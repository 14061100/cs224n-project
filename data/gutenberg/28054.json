{"summary": "Book One: A Nice Little Family The opening of the novel introduces the Karamazov family and relates the story of their distant and recent past. The details of Fyodor's two marriages as well as his indifference to the upbringing of his three children is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to Fyodor's town. The first book concludes by describing the mysterious religious order of Elders to which Alyosha has become devoted.\nBook Two: An Inappropriate Gathering Book Two begins as the Karamazov family arrives at the local monastery so that the Elder Zosima can act as a mediator between Dmitri and his father Fyodor in their dispute over Dmitri's inheritance. It was the father's idea apparently as a joke to have the meeting take place in such a holy place in the presence of the famous Elder. Dmitri arrives late and the gathering soon degenerates and only exacerbates the feud between Dmitri and Fyodor. This book also contains a scene in which the Elder Zosima consoles a woman mourning the death of her three-year-old son. The poor woman's grief parallels Dostoyevsky's own tragedy at the loss of his young son Alyosha.\nBook Three: Sensualists\n\nThe third book provides more details of the love triangle that has erupted between Fyodor, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka. Dmitri's personality is explored in the conversation between him and Alyosha as Dmitri hides near his father's home to see if Grushenka will arrive. Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father's house and assaults him while threatening to come back and kill him in the future. This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Reeking Lizaveta. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka's bitter humiliation of Dmitri's betrothed Katerina, resulting in terrible embarrassment and scandal for this proud woman.\nBook Four: Lacerations/Strains This section introduces a side story which resurfaces in more detail later in the novel. It begins with Alyosha observing a group of schoolboys throwing rocks at one of their sickly peers named Ilyusha. When Alyosha admonishes the boys and tries to help, Ilyusha bites Alyosha's finger. It is later learned that Ilyusha's father, a former staff-captain named Snegiryov, was assaulted by Dmitri, who dragged him by the beard out of a bar. Alyosha soon learns of the further hardships present in the Snegiryov household and offers the former staff captain money as an apology for his brother and to help Snegiryov's ailing wife and children. After initially accepting the money with joy, Snegiryov throws the money back at Alyosha out of pride and runs back into his home.\nBook Five: Pro and Contra\nHere, the rationalist and nihilistic ideology that permeated Russia at this time is defended and espoused passionately by Ivan Karamazov while meeting his brother Alyosha at a restaurant. In the chapter titled \"Rebellion\", Ivan proclaims that he rejects the world that God has created because it is built on a foundation of suffering. In perhaps the most famous chapter in the novel, \"The Grand Inquisitor\", Ivan narrates to Alyosha his imagined poem that describes a leader from the Spanish Inquisition and his encounter with Jesus, Who has made His return to earth. Here, Jesus is rejected by the Inquisitor who puts Him in jail and then says,\n\nWhy hast Thou come now to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that... We are working not with Thee but with him [Satan]... We took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Caesar, and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth... We shall triumph and shall be Caesars, and then we shall plan the universal happiness of man.\n\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that Jesus should not have given humans the \"burden\" of free will. At the end of all these arguments, Jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old man on his lips. The Grand Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells Him he must never come there again, and lets Him out. Alyosha, after hearing this story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly, with an unexplainable emotion, on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight, because Alyosha's gesture is taken directly from his poem. The brothers then part.\nBook Six: The Russian Monk The sixth book relates the life and history of the Elder Zosima as he lies near death in his cell. Zosima explains he found his faith in his rebellious youth, in the middle of a duel, consequently deciding to become a monk. Zosima preaches people must forgive others by acknowledging their own sins and guilt before others. He explains that no sin is isolated, making everyone responsible for their neighbor's sins. Zosima represents a philosophy that responds to Ivan's, which had challenged God's creation in the previous book.\nBook Seven: Alyosha The book begins immediately following the death of Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that true holy men's bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It comes as a great shock to the entire town that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost immediately following his death. Within the first day, the smell of Zosima's body is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going back out into the world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.\nBook Eight: Mitya This section deals primarily with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money so he can run away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina and will believe himself to be a thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. This mad dash for money takes Dmitri from Grushenka's benefactor to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his father Fyodor and marry him because he already has the monetary means to satisfy her. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor's home, but quickly discovers she deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father's home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. Then, there is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his father's property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results.\nDmitri is next seen in a daze on the street, covered in blood, with a pile of money in his hand. He soon learns that Grushenka's former betrothed has returned and taken her to a lodge near where Dmitri just was. Upon learning this, Dmitri loads a cart full of food and wine and pays for a huge orgy to finally confront Grushenka in the presence of her old flame, intending all the while to kill himself at dawn. The \"first and rightful lover\", however, is a boorish Pole who cheats the party at a game of cards. When his deception is revealed, he flees, and Grushenka soon reveals to Dmitri that she really is in love with him. The party rages on, and just as Dmitri and Grushenka are making plans to marry, the police enter the lodge and inform Dmitri that he is under arrest for the murder of his father.\nBook Nine: The Preliminary Investigation Book Nine introduces the details of Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was known to have been completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points against Dmitri; the only other person in the house at the time of the murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.\nBook Ten: Boys Boys continues the story of the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in what appears to be a young boy who doesn't exactly know what he is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.\nBook Eleven: Brother Ivan Fyodorovich Book Eleven chronicles Ivan Karamazov's destructive influence on those around him and his descent into madness. It is in this book that Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov, the final meeting culminating in Smerdyakov's dramatic confession that he had faked the fit, murdered Fyodor Karamazov, and stolen the money, which he presents to Ivan. Smerdyakov expresses disbelief at Ivan's professed ignorance and surprise. Smerdyakov claims that Ivan was complicit in the murder by telling Smerdyakov when he would be leaving Fyodor's house, and more importantly by instilling in Smerdyakov the belief that in a world without God \"everything is permitted.\" The book ends with Ivan having a hallucination in which he is visited by the devil, who torments Ivan by mocking his beliefs. Alyosha finds Ivan raving and informs him that Smerdyakov killed himself shortly after their final meeting.\nBook Twelve: A Judicial Error This book details the trial of Dmitri Karamazov for the murder of his father Fyodor. The courtroom drama is sharply satirized by Dostoyevsky. The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the women are irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri's love triangle between himself, Katerina, and Grushenka. Ivan's madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after recounting his final meeting with Smerdyakov and the aforementioned confession. The turning point in the trial is Katerina's damning testimony against Dmitri. Impassioned by Ivan's illness which she believes is a result of her assumed love for Dmitri, she produces a letter drunkenly written by Dmitri saying that he would kill Fyodor. The section concludes with the impassioned closing remarks of the prosecutor and the defense, and the verdict that Dmitri is guilty.\nEpilogue The final section opens with discussion of a plan developed for Dmitri's escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in Siberia. The plan is never fully described, but it seems to involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha approves, first, because Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, secondly, because he is innocent, and, third, because no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then to return to Russia under assumed American names, because they both cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha's funeral, where Ilyusha's schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha's \"Speech by the Stone.\" Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed. He implores them to love each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will keep each other in their memories forever, join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting, \"Hurrah for Karamazov!\"\n\n", "full_text": "The Brothers Karamazov\n\n                      Translated from the Russian of\n\n                            Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n                           by Constance Garnett\n\n                             The Lowell Press\n\n                                 New York\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nPart I\n   Book I.

The History Of A Family\n\n\n\nChapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov\n\n\nAlexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch\nKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and\nstill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which\nhappened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper\nplace. For the present I will only say that this \"landowner\"--for so we\nused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own\nestate--was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a\ntype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of\nthose senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their\nworldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nfor instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest;\nhe ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet\nat his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard\ncash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless,\nfantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not\nstupidity--the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and\nintelligent enough--but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of\nit.\n\nHe was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first\nwife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch's first\nwife, Adelaida Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble\nfamily, also landowners in our district, the Miuesovs. How it came to pass\nthat an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those\nvigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes\nalso to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny\nweakling, as we all called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young\nlady of the last \"romantic\" generation who after some years of an\nenigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have\nmarried at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and\nended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid\nriver from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to\nsatisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia. Indeed, if\nthis precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less\npicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most\nlikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and\nprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or\nthree generations. Adelaida Ivanovna Miuesov's action was similarly, no\ndoubt, an echo of other people's ideas, and was due to the irritation\ncaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her\nfeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism of\nher family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for\na brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic\nposition, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive\nepoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.\nWhat gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement,\nand this greatly captivated Adelaida Ivanovna's fancy. Fyodor Pavlovitch's\nposition at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, for\nhe was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another. To\nattach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring\nprospect. As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in the\nbride or in him, in spite of Adelaida Ivanovna's beauty. This was,\nperhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who\nwas always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on\nthe slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman who\nmade no particular appeal to his senses.\n\nImmediately after the elopement Adelaida Ivanovna discerned in a flash\nthat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage\naccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.\nAlthough the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the\nrunaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most\ndisorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It was\nsaid that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity\nthan Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up\nto twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that those\nthousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the rather\nfine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a\nlong time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance. He\nwould probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire to\nget rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his\npersistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaida\nIvanovna's family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is known\nfor a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife,\nbut rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was\nbeaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient\nwoman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the\nhouse and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity\nstudent, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband's\nhands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the\nhouse, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he\nused to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all\nof Adelaida Ivanovna's having left him, going into details too disgraceful\nfor a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to\ngratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part\nof the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.\n\n\"One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seem\nso pleased in spite of your sorrow,\" scoffers said to him. Many even added\nthat he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and\nthat it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of\nhis ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At\nlast he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor\nwoman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity\nstudent, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete\nemancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making\npreparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself\nhave said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do\nso he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another\nbout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife's family\nreceived the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly\nin a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had\nit, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife's\ndeath, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting\nwith joy, raising his hands to Heaven: \"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant\ndepart in peace,\" but others say he wept without restraint like a little\nchild, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the\nrepulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true,\nthat he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who\nreleased him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more\nnaive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.\n\n\n\nChapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son\n\n\nYou can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would\nbring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what might be\nexpected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with Adelaida\nIvanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but\nsimply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his\ntears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a\nfaithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya\ninto his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been no one\neven to change the baby's little shirt.\n\nIt happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's side\nforgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow,\nMitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his\ndaughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in\nold Grigory's charge and lived with him in the servant's cottage. But if\nhis father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether\nunaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as\nthe child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a\ncousin of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, happened to return\nfrom Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that\ntime quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miuesovs as a man of\nenlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals\nand abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the type\ncommon in the forties and fifties. In the course of his career he had come\ninto contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in\nRussia and abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in\nhis declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the\nParis Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost\ntaken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most\ngrateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of\nabout a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate\nlay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our\nfamous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless\nlawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rights\nof fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know\nexactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of\nculture to open an attack upon the \"clericals.\" Hearing all about Adelaida\nIvanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time\nbeen interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, in\nspite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.\nHe made the latter's acquaintance for the first time, and told him\ndirectly that he wished to undertake the child's education. He used long\nafterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak\nof Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not\nunderstand what child he was talking about, and even as though he was\nsurprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story may\nhave been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an\nunexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to\nhis own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This\nhabit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some\nof them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch\ncarried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor\nPavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house\nand land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this\ncousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and after\nsecuring the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to\nParis, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living in\nMoscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too,\nforgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out,\nmaking an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his\nlife. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her\nmarried daughters. I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. I\nwon't enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor\nPavlovitch's firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential\nfacts about him, without which I could not begin my story.\n\nIn the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the\nonly one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the belief that\nhe had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. He\nspent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the\ngymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was\npromoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion\nagain, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin\nto receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and\nuntil then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nfor the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on\npurpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have liked\nhis father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away,\nhaving only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an\nagreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value\nof which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get\na statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time\nthen (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated\nidea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this,\nas it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young man\nwas frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and\nthat if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although\nonly, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take\nadvantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles,\ninstallments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience,\ncame a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his\nfather, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was\ndifficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of\nhis property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even\nin debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own\ndesire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect\nanything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed,\nsuspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed,\nthis circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the\nsubject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.\nBut before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's\nother two sons, and of their origin.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family\n\n\nVery shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor\nPavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years.\nHe took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from\nanother province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in\ncompany with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious\ndebauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his\nbusiness affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-\nscrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and\nwas left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up in the\nhouse of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who was\nat once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, but I\nhave only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, was once\ncut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft,\nso terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging\nof this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an\ninsufferable tyrant through idleness.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and he\nwas refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopement\nto the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would not on any\naccount have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.\nBut she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl of\nsixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom of\nthe river than remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child\nexchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a\npenny this time, for the general's widow was furious. She gave them\nnothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry; what\nallured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all her\ninnocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious\nprofligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine\nbeauty.\n\n\"Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,\" he used to say\nafterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this might,\nof course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had received no\ndowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her \"from the halter,\" he\ndid not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel that she had \"wronged\"\nhim, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to\ntrample on the elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women\ninto his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife's\npresence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that\nGrigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had\nalways hated his first mistress, Adelaida Ivanovna, took the side of his\nnew mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a\nmanner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels\nand drove all the disorderly women out of the house. In the end this\nunhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that\nkind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women\nwho are said to be \"possessed by devils.\" At times after terrible fits of\nhysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two\nsons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the\nsecond three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth\nyear, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all\nhis life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same\nthing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.\nThey were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were\nlooked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were\nfound by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was\nstill alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done\nher. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya's\nmanner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she\ndeclared aloud two or three times to her retainers:\n\n\"It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.\"\n\nExactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's widow\nsuddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's\nhouse. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.\nIt was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eight\nyears, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him,\nwithout any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slaps\non the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times up\nand down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to the\ntwo boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in\ndirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and\nannouncing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them\njust as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to her\nown town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word,\nand when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow\nand pronounced impressively that, \"God would repay her for the orphans.\"\n\"You are a blockhead all the same,\" the old lady shouted to him as she\ndrove away.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, and\ndid not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to any proposition\nin regard to his children's education. As for the slaps she had given him,\nhe drove all over the town telling the story.\n\nIt happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the boys\nin her will a thousand roubles each \"for their instruction, and so that\nall be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so\nportioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it is more than\nadequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to throw\naway their money, let them.\" I have not read the will myself, but I heard\nthere was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. The\nprincipal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the\nprovince, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor\nPavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him\nfor his children's education (though the latter never directly refused but\nonly procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was, indeed, at\ntimes effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interest\nin the orphans. He became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, who\nlived for a long while as one of his family. I beg the reader to note this\nfrom the beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and\nhumanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted for\ntheir education and bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand\nroubles left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time\nthey came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of\ninterest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent\nfar more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won't enter into a\ndetailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few\nof the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he\ngrew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. At\nten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home\nbut on other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it\nwas disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancy\n(so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for\nlearning. I don't know precisely why, but he left the family of Yefim\nPetrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and\nboarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of\nYefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to\nthe \"ardor for good works\" of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the\nidea that the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But\nneither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man\nfinished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch\nhad made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady's legacy,\nwhich had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to\nformalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits\nfor the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep\nhimself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not\neven attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from\ncontempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him\nthat from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that may\nhave been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in\ngetting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting\nparagraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of\n\"Eye-Witness.\" These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting and\npiquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young man's\npractical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and\nunfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the\nnewspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than\neverlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.\nHaving once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept\nup his connection with them, and in his latter years at the university he\npublished brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so\nthat he became well known in literary circles. But only in his last year\nhe suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of\nreaders, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It was\nrather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and was\npreparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch\npublished in one of the more important journals a strange article, which\nattracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have been\nsupposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. The\narticle dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the\ntime--the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several\nopinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most\nstriking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion.\nMany of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.\nAnd yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their\napplause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was\nnothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident\nparticularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in\nour neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the\nquestion of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.\nLearning the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of\nthe town and the son of \"that Fyodor Pavlovitch.\" And just then it was\nthat the author himself made his appearance among us.\n\nWhy Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the\ntime with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first\nstep leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.\nIt seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud,\nand apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house\nand a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never\nthought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him\nmoney, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would\nalso come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the\nhouse of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they\nwere on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of\nwonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, of\nwhom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife,\nhappened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had\ncome from Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was more\nsurprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man, who\ninterested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not\nwithout an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.\n\n\"He is proud,\" he used to say, \"he will never be in want of pence; he has\ngot money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every one can\nsee that he hasn't come for money, for his father would never give him\nany. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his father can't\ndo without him. They get on so well together!\"\n\nThat was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over his\nfather, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even\nseemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and even\nspitefully perverse.\n\nIt was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the request\nof, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he saw for\nthe first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving Moscow\nbeen in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concern\nto Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader will learn fully\nin due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still\nfelt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit\nrather mysterious.\n\nI may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator\nbetween his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel\nwith his father and even planning to bring an action against him.\n\nThe family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its\nmembers met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,\nAlexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the\nthree to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to\nspeak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of\nhim, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce\nmy hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been\nfor the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered\nthere for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha\n\n\nHe was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at the\ntime, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven. First of all, I\nmust explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my\nopinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my full\nopinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and\nthat he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it\nstruck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from\nthe darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason\nthis life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as\nhe thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whom\nhe became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart. But I\ndo not dispute that he was very strange even at that time, and had been so\nindeed from his cradle. I have mentioned already, by the way, that though\nhe lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life--her\nface, her caresses, \"as though she stood living before me.\" Such memories\nmay persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two\nyears old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots\nof light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which\nhas all faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was\nwith him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the\nslanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all);\nin a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on\nher knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and\nmoans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,\nand praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both arms to\nthe image as though to put him under the Mother's protection ... and\nsuddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the\npicture! And Alyosha remembered his mother's face at that minute. He used\nto say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely\ncared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth he\nwas by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness\nor a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different,\nfrom a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with\nother people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, to\nforget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed\nthroughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever\nlooked on him as a simpleton or naive person. There was something about\nhim which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards)\nthat he did not care to be a judge of others--that he would never take it\nupon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. He\nseemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though\noften grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could\nsurprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty to\nhis father's house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste\nand pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on was\nunbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.\nHis father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so was\nsensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and\nsullenness. \"He does not say much,\" he used to say, \"and thinks the more.\"\nBut soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissing\nhim terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yet\nhe evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had never\nbeen capable of feeling for any one before.\n\nEvery one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was so\nfrom his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his patron\nand benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts of all the\nfamily, so that they looked on him quite as their own child. Yet he\nentered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted from\ndesign nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift of making\nhimself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very\nnature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he seemed to be\njust one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and\neven disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and\nrather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into\na corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was\nat school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at the\nfirst glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the contrary he was\nbright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off among his\nschoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never afraid of any one,\nyet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his\nfearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous. He\nnever resented an insult. It would happen that an hour after the offense\nhe would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and\ncandid an expression as though nothing had happened between them. And it\nwas not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the\naffront, but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this\ncompletely conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic\nwhich made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to\nmock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. This\ncharacteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could not\nbear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women. There\nare \"certain\" words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in\nschools. Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking\nin school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and\nimages of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than\nthat, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to\nquite young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no\nmoral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the\nappearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something\nrefined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha\nKaramazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of \"that,\" they\nused sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shout\nnastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor, tried\nto hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insults\nin silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him with\nbeing a \"regular girl,\" and what's more they looked upon it with\ncompassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in the class but\nwas never first.\n\nAt the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more years to\ncomplete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went almost\nimmediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her whole\nfamily, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to live in\nthe house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had\nnever seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did not know\nhimself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at\nwhose expense he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to\nhis elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two years\nin the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had from\nchildhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his\nbenefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character must not, I\nthink, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance with\nhim any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths,\nalmost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to\ncome into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give it\naway for the asking, either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue.\nIn general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course,\nin a literal sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked\nfor, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a\nmoment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.\n\nIn later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, a man very sensitive on the\nscore of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment,\nafter getting to know Alyosha:\n\n\"Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone\nwithout a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million\ninhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold and\nhunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were not, he\nwould find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort or\nhumiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on the contrary,\nwould probably be looked on as a pleasure.\"\n\nHe did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end of\nthe course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to see\nhis father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry and\nunwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and the\nladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from his\nbenefactor's family. They provided him liberally with money and even\nfitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the money\nthey gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival\nin the town he made no answer to his father's first inquiry why he had\ncome before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually\nthoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother's\ntomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only\nobject of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.\nIt is more probable that he himself did not understand and could not\nexplain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn him irresistibly\ninto a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show\nhim where his second wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave\nsince he had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had\nentirely forgotten where she was buried.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been\nliving in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death he had gone\nto the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he spent\nseveral years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own words, \"of a\nlot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,\" and ended by being received by\n\"Jews high and low alike.\" It may be presumed that at this period he\ndeveloped a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money. He finally\nreturned to our town only three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former\nacquaintances found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means\nan old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more\neffrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making\nbuffoons of others. His depravity with women was not simply what it used\nto be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a great number\nof new taverns in the district. It was evident that he had perhaps a\nhundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of the inhabitants of the\ntown and district were soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good\nsecurity. Of late, too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more\nirresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to\nbegin one thing and go on with another, as though he were letting himself\ngo altogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not\nbeen for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerably\ntoo, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, Fyodor\nPavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyosha's arrival seemed\nto affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in this\nprematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, \"that you are\nlike her, 'the crazy woman' \"--that was what he used to call his dead wife,\nAlyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the \"crazy woman's\" grave\nto Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remote\ncorner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which were\ninscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death, and\nbelow a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned\nmiddle-class tombs. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be\nGrigory's doing. He had put it up on the poor \"crazy woman's\" grave at his\nown expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about the\ngrave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories.\nAlyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother's grave.\nHe only listened to Grigory's minute and solemn account of the erection of\nthe tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a\nword. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this\nlittle episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch--and a\nvery original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to\npay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,\nAlyosha's mother, the \"crazy woman,\" but for the first, Adelaida Ivanovna,\nwho used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and\nabused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he\nhad probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange\nimpulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.\n\nI have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at this\ntime bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he\nhad led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent,\nsuspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in\nhis little fat face, the Adam's apple hung below his sharp chin like a\ngreat, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual\nappearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between\nwhich could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobbered\nevery time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his own\nface, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it. He used\nparticularly to point to his nose, which was not very large, but very\ndelicate and conspicuously aquiline. \"A regular Roman nose,\" he used to\nsay, \"with my goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman\npatrician of the decadent period.\" He seemed proud of it.\n\nNot long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced that\nhe wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing to\nreceive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong desire, and\nthat he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The old man knew\nthat the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, had\nmade a special impression upon his \"gentle boy.\"\n\n\"That is the most honest monk among them, of course,\" he observed, after\nlistening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprised\nat his request. \"H'm!... So that's where you want to be, my gentle boy?\"\n\nHe was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken grin,\nwhich was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. \"H'm!... I had\na presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would you\nbelieve it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you have\nyour own two thousand. That's a dowry for you. And I'll never desert you,\nmy angel. And I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it.\nBut, of course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them? What do you\nsay? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H'm!...\nDo you know that near one monastery there's a place outside the town where\nevery baby knows there are none but 'the monks' wives' living, as they are\ncalled. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it's\ninteresting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is\nit's awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they\ncould get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear\nof it they'll come along. Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no\n'monks' wives,' and two hundred monks. They're honest. They keep the\nfasts. I admit it.... H'm.... So you want to be a monk? And do you know\nI'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I've really grown\nfond of you? Well, it's a good opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we\nhave sinned too much here. I've always been thinking who would pray for\nme, and whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm\nawfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully. You see,\nhowever stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking--from time\nto time, of course, not all the while. It's impossible, I think, for the\ndevils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. Then\nI wonder--hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do\nthey forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in the\nmonastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.\nNow I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it more\nrefined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after all, what\ndoes it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't? But, do you know,\nthere's a damnable question involved in it? If there's no ceiling there\ncan be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which is\nunlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me down to hell, and\nif they don't drag me down what justice is there in the world? _Il\nfaudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if you\nonly knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.\"\n\n\"But there are no hooks there,\" said Alyosha, looking gently and seriously\nat his father.\n\n\"Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That's how a\nFrenchman described hell: '_J'ai bu l'ombre d'un cocher qui avec l'ombre\nd'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse._' How do you know there are\nno hooks, darling? When you've lived with the monks you'll sing a\ndifferent tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tell\nme. Anyway it's easier going to the other world if one knows what there is\nthere. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here\nwith me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like\nan angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch you\nthere. That's why I let you go, because I hope for that. You've got all\nyour wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will be\nhealed and come back again. And I will wait for you. I feel that you're\nthe only creature in the world who has not condemned me. My dear boy, I\nfeel it, you know. I can't help feeling it.\"\n\nAnd he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked and\nsentimental.\n\n\n\nChapter V. Elders\n\n\nSome of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic,\npoorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On the contrary,\nAlyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of\nnineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome, too, graceful,\nmoderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long,\noval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he was very\nthoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red\ncheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy\nthat Alyosha was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the\nmonastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are\nnever a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose\nrealists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will\nalways find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if\nhe is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather\ndisbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he\nadmits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does\nnot, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.\nIf the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to\nadmit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not\nbelieve till he saw, but when he did see he said, \"My Lord and my God!\"\nWas it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed\nsolely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his\nsecret heart even when he said, \"I do not believe till I see.\"\n\nI shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had not\nfinished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies is\ntrue, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.\nI'll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path only\nbecause, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and presented\nitself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul from\ndarkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of our\nlast epoch--that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for it\nand believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength\nof his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice\neverything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily fail to\nunderstand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest of\nall sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years of\ntheir seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiply\ntenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set\nbefore them as their goal--such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength\nof many of them. The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite\ndirection, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As\nsoon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God\nand immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: \"I want to\nlive for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.\" In the same way,\nif he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at once\nhave become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely the\nlabor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the\nquestion of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower of\nBabel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up\nheaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go\non living as before. It is written: \"Give all that thou hast to the poor\nand follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.\"\n\nAlyosha said to himself: \"I can't give two roubles instead of 'all,' and\nonly go to mass instead of 'following Him.' \" Perhaps his memories of\nchildhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have taken\nhim to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his\npoor \"crazy\" mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination.\nBrooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see\nwhether here he could sacrifice all or only \"two roubles,\" and in the\nmonastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what an \"elder\" is\nin Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent\nto do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a\nfew words. Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of\n\"elders\" is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our\nmonasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos,\nit has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in\nancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook\nRussia--the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the East\nafter the destruction of Constantinople--this institution fell into\noblivion. It was revived among us towards the end of last century by one\nof the great \"ascetics,\" as they called him, Paissy Velitchkovsky, and his\ndisciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and has\nsometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It flourished\nespecially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was\nintroduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three\nsuch elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying of\nweakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The question\nfor our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguished\nby anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints,\nnor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical\nexploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its\nelders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles\nfrom all parts.\n\nWhat was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,\ninto his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your\nown will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete self-\nabnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is\nundertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, in\norder, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from\nself; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without\nfinding their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is not\nfounded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of a\nthousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary\n\"obedience\" which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The\nobligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted\nthemselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them.\n\nThe story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity\none such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his\nelder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after great\nexploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr's\ndeath for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, was\nburying him, suddenly, at the deacon's exhortation, \"Depart all ye\nunbaptized,\" the coffin containing the martyr's body left its place and\nwas cast forth from the church, and this took place three times. And only\nat last they learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and\nleft his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's\nabsolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral\ntake place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent\ninstance.\n\nA monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he loved\nas a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem to\ndo homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:\n\"There is the place for thee and not here.\" The monk, overwhelmed with\nsorrow, went to the OEcumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought\nhim to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not\nonly was he unable to release him, but there was not and could not be on\nearth a power which could release him except the elder who had himself\nlaid that duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain\ncases with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many of\nour monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to\npersecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed\namong the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men of\ndistinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery to\nconfess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask for\ncounsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declared\nthat the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously\ndegraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the\nmonk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In the\nend, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming\nestablished in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this\ninstrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral\nregeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility\nmay be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and\ncomplete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondage\nand not to freedom.\n\nThe elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners, had\nbeen in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.\nHe had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul.\nAlyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and let\nhim wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no\nobligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days.\nThough he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different\nfrom others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination\nwas deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that so\nmany people had for years past come to confess their sins to Father\nZossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he had\nacquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a\nnew-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his conscience. He\nsometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of\ntheir secrets before they had spoken a word.\n\nAlyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first\ntime with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy\nfaces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was\nnot at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks\nused to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the\ngreater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the\nend of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they\nwere few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of\ngreat dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks\ndistinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the\nmajority were on Father Zossima's side and very many of them loved him\nwith all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically\ndevoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint,\nthat there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near,\nthey anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the\nimmediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the\nmiraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the\nstory of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with\nsick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and\nto pray over them, return shortly after--some the next day--and, falling in\ntears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing their sick.\n\nWhether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural\ncourse of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for\nhe fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in\nhis fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His heart\nthrobbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out to\nthe gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the\nhumbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to see\nthe elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissed\nhis feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the women\nheld up their children to him and brought him the sick \"possessed with\ndevils.\" The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed\nthem, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks of\nillness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrims\nwaited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder why\nthey loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotion\nmerely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of\nthe Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the\neverlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was\nthe greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall\ndown before and worship.\n\n\"Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere on\nearth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows the\ntruth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us,\ntoo, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.\"\n\nAlyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. He\nunderstood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian of\nGod's truth--of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the\nsick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction that\nafter his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery\nwas even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind\nof deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart.\nHe was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example\nbefore him.\n\n\"No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal for\nall: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and all\nmen will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich nor\npoor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, and\nthe true Kingdom of Christ will come.\" That was the dream in Alyosha's\nheart.\n\nThe arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then, seemed\nto make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made friends with\nhis half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than with his own\nbrother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but when\nthe latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairly\noften, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he\nseemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his\nbrother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and\ncuriously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyosha\nnoticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother's indifference\nat first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wondered\nwhether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some\nother cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was\nabsorbed in something--something inward and important--that he was striving\ntowards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he\nhad no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some\ncontempt on the part of the learned atheist for him--a foolish novice. He\nknew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take\noffense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment\nwhich he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come\nnearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and\nwith a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of\nthe important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable\nbond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri's enthusiastic references to\nIvan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri was, compared\nwith Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in\npersonality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more\nunlike.\n\nIt was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members\nof this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had\nsuch an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gathering\nwas a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and\nhis father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become\ninsufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to\nsuggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's\ncell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might\nmore decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of\nthe elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally\nsupposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretly\nblamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several\nrecent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he was\nnot, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other end\nof the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, who was staying\nin the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the\nforties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by\nboredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with\nthe desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the\nmonastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the\nSuperior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with\nsuch laudable intentions might be received with more attention and\nconsideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from\nwithin the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had\nscarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his\nordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was\nfixed.\n\n\"Who has made me a judge over them?\" was all he said, smilingly, to\nAlyosha.\n\nAlyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the\nwrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the\ninterview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives,\nperhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and\nMiuesov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his\nfather might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said\nnothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was\nfar from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with\na heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the family\ndiscord could be ended. But his chief anxiety concerned the elder. He\ntrembled for him, for his glory, and dreaded any affront to him,\nespecially the refined, courteous irony of Miuesov and the supercilious\nhalf-utterances of the highly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture on\nwarning the elder, telling him something about them, but, on second\nthoughts, said nothing. He only sent word the day before, through a\nfriend, to his brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep\nhis promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had\npromised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let\nhimself be provoked \"by vileness,\" but that, although he had a deep\nrespect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that the\nmeeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.\n\n\"Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respect\nto the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,\" he wrote in conclusion.\nAlyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.\n\n\n\n\nBook II. An Unfortunate Gathering\n\n\n\nChapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery\n\n\nIt was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with the\nelder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass.\nOur visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it was\nover. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove\nup with Miuesov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty,\ncalled Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter the\nuniversity. Miuesov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to\npersuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young\nman was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was nice-\nlooking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixity in\nhis gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he would sometimes\nstare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and rather awkward,\nbut sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he became talkative and\neffusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But his animation\nvanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and even\nelaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and\nexpectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha's.\n\nIn an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old\npinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Miuesov's carriage, came Fyodor\nPavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been\ninformed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriage\nat the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the\nmonastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever\nseen the monastery, and Miuesov had probably not even been to church for\nthirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumed\nease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these too\nwere ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the\nmonastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church,\nbareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few of\nhigher rank--two or three ladies and a very old general. They were all\nstaying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, but\nnone of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took a ten-\ncopeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed--God knows\nwhy!--hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: \"Divide it equally.\" None\nof his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to be\nembarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.\n\nIt was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they\nwere not received with special honor, though one of them had recently made\na donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy and\nhighly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense\ndependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their\nfishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.\n\nMiuesov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and was\non the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty\npenny for the right of lying in this \"holy place,\" but refrained. His\nliberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.\n\n\"Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out,\nfor time is passing,\" he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.\n\nAll at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating\nlittle eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, he\nintroduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula. He\nat once entered into our visitors' difficulty.\n\n\"Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from the\nmonastery, the other side of the copse.\"\n\n\"I know it's the other side of the copse,\" observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,\n\"but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since we've been here.\"\n\n\"This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Come\nwith me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself.\nThis way, this way.\"\n\nThey came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man of\nsixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, with\nan incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out of\nhis head.\n\n\"You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,\" observed\nMiuesov severely. \"That personage has granted us an audience, so to speak,\nand so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you to\naccompany us.\"\n\n\"I've been there. I've been already; _un chevalier parfait_,\" and Maximov\nsnapped his fingers in the air.\n\n\"Who is a _chevalier_?\" asked Miuesov.\n\n\"The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the\nmonastery, Zossima. Such an elder!\"\n\nBut his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk of\nmedium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitch\nand Miuesov stopped.\n\nThe monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:\n\n\"The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after\nyour visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later. And you also,\" he\nadded, addressing Maximov.\n\n\"That I certainly will, without fail,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely\ndelighted at the invitation. \"And, believe me, we've all given our word to\nbehave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here?\nThe only obstacle to me is your company....\"\n\n\"Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.\"\n\n\"It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you suppose I like\nall this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner.\nThank the Father Superior,\" he said to the monk.\n\n\"No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,\" answered the monk.\n\n\"If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior--to the Father Superior,\"\nbabbled Maximov.\n\n\"The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please--\" the monk\nhesitated.\n\n\"Impertinent old man!\" Miuesov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to\nthe monastery.\n\n\"He's like von Sohn,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.\n\n\"Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Have\nyou ever seen von Sohn?\"\n\n\"I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable.\nHe's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.\"\n\n\"Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor\nPavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave\nproperly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin\nto play the fool I don't intend to be associated with you here.... You see\nwhat a man he is\"--he turned to the monk--\"I'm afraid to go among decent\npeople with him.\" A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to\nthe pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and was\nevidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. Miuesov frowned more than\never.\n\n\"Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, and\nnothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,\" flashed through\nMiuesov's mind.\n\n\"Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \"The gates\nare shut.\"\n\nAnd he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above\nand on the sides of the gates.\n\n\"When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitage\nthere are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, and\neat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That's what is\nremarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives\nladies,\" he remarked suddenly to the monk.\n\n\"Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting.\nBut for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the\nportico, but outside the precincts--you can see the windows--and the elder\ngoes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They are\nalways outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,\nwaiting there now with her sick daughter. Probably he has promised to come\nout to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown\nhimself even to the people.\"\n\n\"So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage to\nthe ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do you\nknow that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but no\ncreature of the female sex--no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.\"\n\n\"Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. They'll\nturn you out when I'm gone.\"\n\n\"But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,\" he cried\nsuddenly, stepping within the precincts, \"what a vale of roses they live\nin!\"\n\nThough there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautiful\nautumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidently\ntended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, and\nbetween the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived\nwas also surrounded with flowers.\n\n\"And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didn't\ncare for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladies\nwith a stick,\" observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.\n\n\"The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great deal\nthat's told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,\" answered the monk.\n\"Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.\"\n\n\"Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behave\nproperly or I will pay you out!\" Miuesov had time to mutter again.\n\n\"I can't think why you are so agitated,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch observed\nsarcastically. \"Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell by\none's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their\nopinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm surprised at you.\"\n\nBut Miuesov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to come\nin. He walked in, somewhat irritated.\n\n\"Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to\nquarrel--and lower myself and my ideas,\" he reflected.\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Old Buffoon\n\n\nThey entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in\nfrom his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, two\nmonks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other Father\nPaissy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though not\nold. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty,\nstanding in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh\nface, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary\ndress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of the\nmonastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,\nreverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an\nequality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.\n\nFather Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks\nrose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their\nfingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as\ndeep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was\nperformed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an\neveryday rite. But Miuesov fancied that it was all done with intentional\nimpressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought--he had\nreflected upon it the evening before--from simple politeness, since it was\nthe custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing, even if\nhe did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on\nthe part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified\ngravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a\nchair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Miuesov like an ape. Ivan\nbowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his\nsides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The\nelder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again,\nasked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was\nashamed. His forebodings were coming true.\n\nFather Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, covered\nwith leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite\nwall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monks\nsat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student,\nthe novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large and\nhad a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture,\nof coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window,\nand a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon\nof the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures in\nshining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic\ncross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign\nengravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to these\ncostly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints\nof saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the\nfairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and\npresent.\n\nMiuesov took a cursory glance at all these \"conventional\" surroundings and\nbent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his own\ninsight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which a\nclever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking\nhimself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima.\nThere was, indeed, something in the elder's face which many people besides\nMiuesov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very\nweak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years\nolder. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,\nparticularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,\nquick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of gray\nhair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and his\nlips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads. His nose was\nnot long, but sharp, like a bird's beak.\n\n\"To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,\" thought\nMiuesov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.\n\nA cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to\nbegin the conversation.\n\n\"Precisely to our time,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \"but no sign of my son,\nDmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!\" (Alyosha shuddered all over at\n\"sacred elder.\") \"I am always punctual myself, minute for minute,\nremembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....\"\n\n\"But you are not a king, anyway,\" Miuesov muttered, losing his self-\nrestraint at once.\n\n\"Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say the\nwrong thing. Your reverence,\" he cried, with sudden pathos, \"you behold\nbefore you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. It's an old\nhabit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it's with an\nobject, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. One\nmust be agreeable, mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town\nwhere I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We\nwent to the captain of police because we had to see him about something,\nand to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, the\nmost dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver. I went straight up to\nhim, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, 'Mr. Ispravnik,'\nsaid I, 'be our Napravnik.' 'What do you mean by Napravnik?' said he. I\nsaw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there so\nglum. 'I wanted to make a joke,' said I, 'for the general diversion, as\nMr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we\nneed for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.' And I\nexplained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? 'Excuse me,' said he,\n'I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.' He\nturned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, 'Yes, yes, you are an\nIspravnik, not a Napravnik.' 'No,' he said, 'since you called me a\nNapravnik I am one.' And would you believe it, it ruined our business! And\nI'm always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with my\npoliteness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: 'Your\nwife is a ticklish lady,' in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities,\nso to speak. But he asked me, 'Why, have you tickled her?' I thought I'd\nbe polite, so I couldn't help saying, 'Yes,' and he gave me a fine\ntickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to\ntell the story. I'm always injuring myself like that.\"\n\n\"You're doing it now,\" muttered Miuesov, with disgust.\n\nFather Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.\n\n\"Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon as\nI began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you'd be the first\nto remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't coming off, your\nreverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower\njaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That's been so since I was young,\nwhen I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen's families. I am an\ninveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as\nthough it were a craze in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only\na little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But\nnot your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth having\neither. But I do believe--I believe in God, though I have had doubts of\nlate. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I'm like the philosopher,\nDiderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot\nwent to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?\nHe went in and said straight out, 'There is no God.' To which the great\nbishop lifted up his finger and answered, 'The fool hath said in his heart\nthere is no God.' And he fell down at his feet on the spot. 'I believe,'\nhe cried, 'and will be christened.' And so he was. Princess Dashkov was\nhis godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.\"\n\n\"Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling lies and\nthat that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing the fool?\" cried\nMiuesov in a shaking voice.\n\n\"I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch cried\nwith conviction. \"But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great\nelder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's christening I made up\njust now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I\nplay the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though I\nreally don't know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot,\nI heard as far as 'the fool hath said in his heart' twenty times from the\ngentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that the\ninfidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan\nPlaton....\"\n\nMiuesov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, and\nconscious of being ridiculous.\n\nWhat was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty or\nfifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had entered\nthat cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every one\nadmitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Many\nremained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had been\nmen of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted by\ncuriosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence\nand delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on the\none side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to\ndecide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed\nand bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with\nunchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the\nelder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Miuesov.\nAlyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed to\nhim strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he had\nrested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that he\ncould have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes,\napparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had\nnothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the\ndivinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the\nmonastery knew Rakitin's thoughts.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" began Miuesov, addressing Father Zossima, \"for perhaps I seem\nto be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in believing\nthat even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on a\nvisit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I should have to\napologize simply for having come with him....\"\n\nPyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room,\noverwhelmed with confusion.\n\n\"Don't distress yourself, I beg.\" The elder got on to his feeble legs, and\ntaking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again. \"I beg\nyou not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest.\" And\nwith a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa.\n\n\"Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?\" Fyodor Pavlovitch\ncried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as though\nready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.\n\n\"I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,\"\nthe elder said impressively. \"Do not trouble. Make yourself quite at home.\nAnd, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root\nof it all.\"\n\n\"Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I\naccept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, you'd better not\ninvite me to be my natural self. Don't risk it.... I will not go so far as\nthat myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged\nin the mists of uncertainty, though there are people who'd be pleased to\ndescribe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for\nyou, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.\"\n\nHe got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, \"Blessed be the womb that\nbare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck--the paps especially. When you\nsaid just now, 'Don't be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root\nof it all,' you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me to\nthe core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than\nall, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, 'Let me really\nplay the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one\nof you worse than I am.' That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame,\ngreat elder, from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me\nrowdy. If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the\nkindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have been\nthen! Teacher!\" he fell suddenly on his knees, \"what must I do to gain\neternal life?\"\n\nIt was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.\n\nFather Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:\n\n\"You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough:\ndon't give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don't give way\nto sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. And close your\ntaverns. If you can't close all, at least two or three. And, above\nall--don't lie.\"\n\n\"You mean about Diderot?\"\n\n\"No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies\nto himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot\ndistinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect\nfor himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and\nin order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to\npassions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all\nfrom continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to\nhimself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimes\nvery pleasant to take offense, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has\ninsulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied\nand exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a\nmountain out of a molehill--he knows that himself, yet he will be the first\nto take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great\npleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit\ndown, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....\"\n\n\"Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.\"\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder's\nthin hand. \"It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well,\nas I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking offense,\nto please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not so\nmuch pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted--that you had\nforgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a note of that.\nBut I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day and\nhour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though I\nbelieve I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say,\nthe son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may\nsometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a\nword will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had\nbeen meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to\nfind out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me.\nHere is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told\nsomewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his\nfaith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his\nhead, and, 'courteously kissing it,' walked a long way, carrying it in his\nhands. Is that true or not, honored Father?\"\n\n\"No, it is untrue,\" said the elder.\n\n\"There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint\ndo you say the story is told of?\" asked the Father Librarian.\n\n\"I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I was deceived.\nI was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch Miuesov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it\nwas who told the story.\"\n\n\"I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.\"\n\n\"It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It\nwas three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you\nshook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I went\nhome with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shaken\never since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall.\nThat was not a Diderot!\"\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clear\nto every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet Miuesov was stung\nby his words.\n\n\"What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,\" he muttered. \"I may really have\ntold it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself. I\nheard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at our mass\nfrom the _Lives of the Saints_ ... he was a very learned man who had made\na special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in\nRussia.... I have not read the _Lives of the Saints_ myself, and I am not\ngoing to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinner--we were\ndining then.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!\" said Fyodor\nPavlovitch, mimicking him.\n\n\"What do I care for your faith?\" Miuesov was on the point of shouting, but\nhe suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, \"You defile\neverything you touch.\"\n\nThe elder suddenly rose from his seat. \"Excuse me, gentlemen, for leaving\nyou a few minutes,\" he said, addressing all his guests. \"I have visitors\nawaiting me who arrived before you. But don't you tell lies all the same,\"\nhe added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He went\nout of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps.\nAlyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too,\nthat the elder was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going\ntowards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor\nPavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.\n\n\"Blessed man!\" he cried, with feeling. \"Allow me to kiss your hand once\nmore. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think\nI always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting\nlike this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all\nthe time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my\nhumility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one\ncan get on with you! But now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the\ntime. I'll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak,\nPyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now--for ten\nminutes.\"\n\n\n\nChapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith\n\n\nNear the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct,\nthere was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told that\nthe elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in\nanticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come\nout into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it\nset aside for women of rank.\n\nMadame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and always\ndressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. She\nwas not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow. Her\ndaughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The poor child had\nnot been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in a\nlong reclining chair. She had a charming little face, rather thin from\nillness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark\neyes with their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her\nabroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by\nbusiness connected with their estate. They had been staying a week in our\ntown, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, but\nhad visited Father Zossima once already, three days before. Though they\nknew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned up\nagain, and urgently entreated \"the happiness of looking once again on the\ngreat healer.\"\n\nThe mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's invalid\ncarriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of our\nmonastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north.\nHe too sought the elder's blessing.\n\nBut Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the\npeasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into\nthe portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and\nbegan blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led\nup to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking\nand writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her\nforehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and\nquieted.\n\nI do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to\nsee and hear these \"possessed\" women in the villages and monasteries. They\nused to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that\nthey were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in\nand they were led up to it, at once the \"possession\" ceased, and the sick\nwomen were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed\nat this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my\ntown teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that\nit could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told\nto confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical\nspecialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible\nillness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in\nRussia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a\ndisease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard,\nabnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery,\nfrom beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like\nothers. The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling\nwoman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been\nexplained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the \"clericals,\"\narose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported\nher and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that\nthe evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman\nwere brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, with\na nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the\nwhole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the\nmoment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the\nmiracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and\nit did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same now\nas soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.\n\nMany of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the\neffect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, others\ncried out in sing-song voices.\n\nHe blessed them all and talked with some of them. The \"possessed\" woman he\nknew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery,\nand had been brought to him before.\n\n\"But here is one from afar.\" He pointed to a woman by no means old but\nvery thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened\nby exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder;\nthere was something almost frenzied in her eyes.\n\n\"From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here.\nFrom afar off, Father, from afar off!\" the woman began in a sing-song\nvoice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head from side to\nside with her cheek resting in her hand.\n\nThere is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the\npeasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief\nthat breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent\nin wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter a\ngrief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart\nstill more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense\nof its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to\nreopen the wound.\n\n\"You are of the tradesman class?\" said Father Zossima, looking curiously\nat her.\n\n\"Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live in\nthe town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father, we\nheard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a\npilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, 'Go,\nNastasya, go to them'--that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at the\nservice, and to-day I have come to you.\"\n\n\"What are you weeping for?\"\n\n\"It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. He was three years old--three\nyears all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I'm in anguish, for\nmy little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and\nnow we've no children, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the first\nthree without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can't\nforget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He has\nwithered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his\nlittle boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his\nlittle things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, 'Let\nme go on a pilgrimage, master.' He is a driver. We're not poor people,\nFather, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the horse and\nthe carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun\ndrinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used to be so before. As soon\nas I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I don't think about him.\nIt's three months since I left home. I've forgotten him. I've forgotten\neverything. I don't want to remember. And what would our life be now\ntogether? I've done with him, I've done. I've done with them all. I don't\ncare to look upon my house and my goods. I don't care to see anything at\nall!\"\n\n\"Listen, mother,\" said the elder. \"Once in olden times a holy saint saw in\nthe Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only one,\nwhom God had taken. 'Knowest thou not,' said the saint to her, 'how bold\nthese little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there are none\nbolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. \"Thou didst give us life, O\nLord,\" they say, \"and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take\nit back again.\" And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them\nat once the rank of angels. Therefore,' said the saint, 'thou, too, O\nmother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the\nfellowship of the angels.' That's what the saint said to the weeping\nmother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely.\nTherefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before the\nthrone of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, and\ntherefore weep not, but rejoice.\"\n\nThe woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. She\nsighed deeply.\n\n\"My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. 'Foolish one,'\nhe said, 'why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before\nGod.' He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he cries like\nme. 'I know, Nikita,' said I. 'Where could he be if not with the Lord God?\nOnly, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before.' And\nif only I could look upon him one little time, if only I could peep at him\none little time, without going up to him, without speaking, if I could be\nhidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him\nplaying in the yard, calling in his little voice, 'Mammy, where are you?'\nIf only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room\njust once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used to run\nto me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet I should\nknow him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone, and I shall never hear him\nagain. Here's his little sash, but him I shall never see or hear now.\"\n\nShe drew out of her bosom her boy's little embroidered sash, and as soon\nas she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes with her\nfingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.\n\n\"It is Rachel of old,\" said the elder, \"weeping for her children, and will\nnot be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on earth for\nyou mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep and\nbe not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep be sure to\nremember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looks\ndown from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and\npoints at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that\ngreat mother's grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your\nbitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart\nand delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child's\nsoul. What was his name?\"\n\n\"Alexey, Father.\"\n\n\"A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\n\"What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in my\nprayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It is a sin for you to\nleave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his\nfather, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his happiness? He is\nliving, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is not in the house he\nis near you, unseen. How can he go into the house when you say that the\nhouse is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together,\nhis father and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But\nthen he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this\nvery day.\"\n\n\"I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone straight to my\nheart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,\" the woman began in a\nsing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very old\nwoman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes\nshowed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something.\nShe said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close\nby in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had\ngone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now a\nyear had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him, but she\ndid not know the proper place to inquire.\n\n\"Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna--she's a rich merchant's wife--said\nto me, 'You go, Prohorovna, and put your son's name down for prayer in the\nchurch, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead. His\nsoul will be troubled,' she said, 'and he will write you a letter.' And\nStepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many\ntimes tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or\nfalse, and would it be right?\"\n\n\"Don't think of it. It's shameful to ask the question. How is it possible\nto pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother too! It's a\ngreat sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you.\nBetter pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for his\ngood health, and that she may forgive you for your error. And another\nthing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you,\nyour son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in\npeace. Your son is alive, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us and\nfor our sins!\"\n\nBut the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon\nhim. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman was\ngazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid to\napproach.\n\n\"What is it, my child?\"\n\n\"Absolve my soul, Father,\" she articulated softly, and slowly sank on her\nknees and bowed down at his feet. \"I have sinned, Father. I am afraid of\nmy sin.\"\n\nThe elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him, still\non her knees.\n\n\"I am a widow these three years,\" she began in a half-whisper, with a sort\nof shudder. \"I had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man. He used\nto beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he were to\nget well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the thought came\nto me--\"\n\n\"Stay!\" said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.\n\nThe woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to\ncatch anything. She had soon done.\n\n\"Three years ago?\" asked the elder.\n\n\"Three years. At first I didn't think about it, but now I've begun to be\nill, and the thought never leaves me.\"\n\n\"Have you come from far?\"\n\n\"Over three hundred miles away.\"\n\n\"Have you told it in confession?\"\n\n\"I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.\"\n\n\"Have you been admitted to Communion?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your penitence\nfail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there can be no sin\non all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant!\nMan cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God.\nCan there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of\nrepentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe\nthat God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your\nsin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner\nthere is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not.\nBe not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the\ndead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in\ntruth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All\nthings are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even\nas you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will\nGod. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world\nby it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.\"\n\nHe signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a little\nikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking.\n\nHe got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny\nbaby in her arms.\n\n\"From Vyshegorye, dear Father.\"\n\n\"Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?\"\n\n\"I've come to look at you. I have been to you before--or have you\nforgotten? You've no great memory if you've forgotten me. They told us you\nwere ill. Thinks I, I'll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, and\nyou're not ill! You'll live another twenty years. God bless you! There are\nplenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?\"\n\n\"I thank you for all, daughter.\"\n\n\"By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty\ncopecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought as\nI came along, better give through him. He'll know whom to give to.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so\ncertainly. Is that your little girl?\"\n\n\"My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.\"\n\n\"May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You have\ngladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.\"\n\nHe blessed them all and bowed low to them.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. A Lady Of Little Faith\n\n\nA visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the peasants and\nhis blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with her\nhandkerchief. She was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good\ndisposition in many respects. When the elder went up to her at last she\nmet him enthusiastically.\n\n\"Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...\" She\ncould not go on for emotion. \"Oh, I understand the people's love for you.\nI love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could help loving\nthem, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!\"\n\n\"How is your daughter's health? You wanted to talk to me again?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it! I was\nready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until\nyou let me in. We have come, great healer, to express our ardent\ngratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely by\npraying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We have\nhastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our\nhomage.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her chair.\"\n\n\"But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,\" said the\nlady with nervous haste. \"And that's not all. Her legs are stronger. This\nmorning she got up well; she had slept all night. Look at her rosy cheeks,\nher bright eyes! She used to be always crying, but now she laughs and is\ngay and happy. This morning she insisted on my letting her stand up, and\nshe stood up for a whole minute without any support. She wagers that in a\nfortnight she'll be dancing a quadrille. I've called in Doctor\nHerzenstube. He shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I am amazed; I can make\nnothing of it.' And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not\nfly here to thank you? Lise, thank him--thank him!\"\n\nLise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She rose in\nher chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder, clasped her hands\nbefore him, but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter.\n\n\"It's at him,\" she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation at\nherself for not being able to repress her mirth.\n\nIf any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, he\nwould have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant. His\neyes shone and he looked down.\n\n\"She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?\" the mother\nwent on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.\n\nThe elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha. The\nlatter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way, held\nout his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important air.\n\n\"Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.\" She handed him a little\nnote. \"She particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible;\nthat you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.\"\n\n\"She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?\" Alyosha muttered in great\nastonishment. His face at once looked anxious. \"Oh, it's all to do with\nDmitri Fyodorovitch and--what has happened lately,\" the mother explained\nhurriedly. \"Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see you\nabout it.... Why, of course, I can't say. But she wants to see you at\nonce. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.\"\n\n\"I have only seen her once,\" Alyosha protested with the same perplexity.\n\n\"Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her\nsuffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring now!\nThink what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!\"\n\n\"Very well, I will come,\" Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the\nbrief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would\ncome, without any sort of explanation.\n\n\"Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!\" cried Lise with sudden\nanimation. \"I told mamma you'd be sure not to go. I said you were saving\nyour soul. How splendid you are! I've always thought you were splendid.\nHow glad I am to tell you so!\"\n\n\"Lise!\" said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had said\nit.\n\n\"You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" she said; \"you never\ncome to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except\nwith you.\"\n\nAlyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled\nwithout knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He had\nbegun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his\nentrance by Lise's chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that is\nof the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in\nhis own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from the far\nnorth, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor\nmonastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing\nand invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.\n\n\"How can you presume to do such deeds?\" the monk asked suddenly, pointing\nsolemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her \"healing.\"\n\n\"It's too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete cure,\nand may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing,\nit is by no power but God's will. It's all from God. Visit me, Father,\" he\nadded to the monk. \"It's not often I can see visitors. I am ill, and I\nknow that my days are numbered.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, long\ntime yet,\" cried the lady. \"And in what way are you ill? You look so well,\nso gay and happy.\"\n\n\"I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only for a\nmoment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to you,\nyou could never say anything that would please me so much. For men are\nmade for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to say\nto himself, 'I am doing God's will on earth.' All the righteous, all the\nsaints, all the holy martyrs were happy.\"\n\n\"Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!\" cried the lady. \"You seem\nto pierce with your words. And yet--happiness, happiness--where is it? Who\ncan say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you have been so good as to\nlet us see you once more to-day, let me tell you what I could not utter\nlast time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and have been for so\nlong! I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering!\"\n\nAnd in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.\n\n\"From what specially?\"\n\n\"I suffer ... from lack of faith.\"\n\n\"Lack of faith in God?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life--it is such\nan enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You are a healer, you\nare deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare not expect you\nto believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of honor that I am not\nspeaking lightly now. The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts\nme to anguish, to terror. And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not\ndared to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God! What\nwill you think of me now?\"\n\nShe clasped her hands.\n\n\"Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you,\" said the elder. \"I\nquite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.\"\n\n\"Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself if\nevery one has faith, where did it come from? And then they do say that it\nall comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and that none\nof it's real. And I say to myself, 'What if I've been believing all my\nlife, and when I come to die there's nothing but the burdocks growing on\nmy grave?' as I read in some author. It's awful! How--how can I get back my\nfaith? But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically,\nwithout thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come now\nto lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this chance\nslip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can I\nconvince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me and see\nthat scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his head about it, and\nI'm the only one who can't stand it. It's deadly--deadly!\"\n\n\"No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor actively\nand indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of\nthe reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to\nperfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will\nbelieve without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has\nbeen tried. This is certain.\"\n\n\"In active love? There's another question--and such a question! You see, I\nso love humanity that--would you believe it?--I often dream of forsaking all\nthat I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy. I close my eyes\nand think and dream, and at that moment I feel full of strength to\novercome all obstacles. No wounds, no festering sores could at that moment\nfrighten me. I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would\nnurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.\"\n\n\"It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not\nothers. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.\"\n\n\"Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?\" the lady went on\nfervently, almost frantically. \"That's the chief question--that's my most\nagonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, 'Would you persevere\nlong on that path? And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not\nmeet you with gratitude, but worried you with his whims, without valuing\nor remarking your charitable services, began abusing you and rudely\ncommanding you, and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which\noften happens when people are in great suffering)--what then? Would you\npersevere in your love, or not?' And do you know, I came with horror to\nthe conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity, it\nwould be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant, I expect my payment\nat once--that is, praise, and the repayment of love with love. Otherwise I\nam incapable of loving any one.\"\n\nShe was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding, she\nlooked with defiant resolution at the elder.\n\n\"It's just the same story as a doctor once told me,\" observed the elder.\n\"He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever. He spoke as\nfrankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. 'I love humanity,' he\nsaid, 'but I wonder at myself. The more I love humanity in general, the\nless I love man in particular. In my dreams,' he said, 'I have often come\nto making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I\nmight actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary;\nand yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two\ndays together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me, his\npersonality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. In\ntwenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he's too\nlong over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing\nhis nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But\nit has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more\nardent becomes my love for humanity.' \"\n\n\"But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one despair?\"\n\n\"No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and it\nwill be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you since you can so\ndeeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have been talking to me so\nsincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did from\nme just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in the\nachievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and your\nwhole life will slip away like a phantom. In that case you will naturally\ncease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer\nafter a fashion in the end.\"\n\n\"You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that I was\nreally only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you I\ncould not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to myself. You have\nseen through me and explained me to myself!\"\n\n\"Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I believe\nthat you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not attain happiness,\nalways remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it.\nAbove all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness\nto yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every\nhour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself.\nWhat seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of\nyour observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the\nconsequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own\nfaint-heartedness in attaining love. Don't be frightened overmuch even at\nyour evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for\nlove in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.\nLove in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in\nthe sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does\nnot last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as\nthough on the stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some\npeople too, perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you\nsee with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther\nfrom your goal instead of nearer to it--at that very moment I predict that\nyou will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who\nhas been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you. Forgive me for\nnot being able to stay longer with you. They are waiting for me. Good-by.\"\n\nThe lady was weeping.\n\n\"Lise, Lise! Bless her--bless her!\" she cried, starting up suddenly.\n\n\"She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness all along,\"\nthe elder said jestingly. \"Why have you been laughing at Alexey?\"\n\nLise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time. She had\nnoticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her, and she\nfound this extremely amusing. She waited intently to catch his eye.\nAlyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was irresistibly and\nsuddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she smiled triumphantly in\nhis face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed. At last he turned\naway from her altogether and hid behind the elder's back. After a few\nminutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he turned again to see\nwhether he was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out\nof her chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look.\nCatching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying,\n\"Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?\"\n\nLise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed and her\nface became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and nervously in a\nwarm and resentful voice:\n\n\"Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me about when I\nwas little. We used to play together. He used to come to teach me to read,\ndo you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he would never\nforget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he's\nafraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn't he want to\ncome near me? Why doesn't he talk? Why won't he come and see us? It's not\nthat you won't let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It's not good\nmanners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought of it first, if he\nhasn't forgotten me. No, now he's saving his soul! Why have you put that\nlong gown on him? If he runs he'll fall.\"\n\nAnd suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible,\nprolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a\nsmile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly\npressed it to her eyes and began crying.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me. I'm silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps\nAlyosha's right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a\nridiculous girl.\"\n\n\"I will certainly send him,\" said the elder.\n\n\n\nChapter V. So Be It! So Be It!\n\n\nThe elder's absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five\nminutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account\nthey had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be\nforgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests\nengaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks took the leading\nshare in it. Miuesov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently very\neagerly, in the conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was\nevidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with neglect,\nwhich increased his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with\nIvan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showed\nhim.\n\n\"Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is\nprogressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,\"\nhe thought.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be quiet, had\nactually been quiet for some time, but he watched his neighbor Miuesov with\nan ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his discomfiture. He had been\nwaiting for some time to pay off old scores, and now he could not let the\nopportunity slip. Bending over his shoulder he began teasing him again in\na whisper.\n\n\"Why didn't you go away just now, after the 'courteously kissing'? Why did\nyou consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you felt\ninsulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by showing\noff your intelligence. Now you won't go till you've displayed your\nintellect to them.\"\n\n\"You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going.\"\n\n\"You'll be the last, the last of all to go!\" Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered\nhim another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossima's return.\n\nThe discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself in\nhis former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting them to\ngo on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his face, saw that he was\nfearfully exhausted and making a great effort. Of late he had been liable\nto fainting fits from exhaustion. His face had the pallor that was common\nbefore such attacks, and his lips were white. But he evidently did not\nwant to break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of his\nown in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently.\n\n\"We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,\" said Father\nIosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. \"He\nbrings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways.\nIt is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical\nauthority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of\nits jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,\" said the\nelder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.\n\n\"He takes up a most interesting position,\" continued the Father Librarian.\n\"As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed\nto the separation of Church from State.\"\n\n\"That's interesting. But in what sense?\" Father Zossima asked Ivan.\n\nThe latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had\nfeared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently\nwithout the slightest _arriere-pensee_.\n\n\"I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of\nthe essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for\never, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and\nthat the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even\nnormal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it.\nCompromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for\ninstance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.\nMy clerical opponent maintains that the Church holds a precise and defined\nposition in the State. I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church ought\nto include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and,\nif this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in\nreality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the future\ndevelopment of Christian society!\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" Father Paissy, the silent and learned monk, assented\nwith fervor and decision.\n\n\"The purest Ultramontanism!\" cried Miuesov impatiently, crossing and\nrecrossing his legs.\n\n\"Oh, well, we have no mountains,\" cried Father Iosif, and turning to the\nelder he continued: \"Observe the answer he makes to the following\n'fundamental and essential' propositions of his opponent, who is, you must\nnote, an ecclesiastic. First, that 'no social organization can or ought to\narrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights of\nits members.' Secondly, that 'criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to\nbelong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as a\ndivine institution and as an organization of men for religious objects,'\nand, finally, in the third place, 'the Church is a kingdom not of this\nworld.' \"\n\n\"A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!\" Father Paissy could\nnot refrain from breaking in again. \"I have read the book which you have\nanswered,\" he added, addressing Ivan, \"and was astounded at the words 'the\nChurch is a kingdom not of this world.' If it is not of this world, then\nit cannot exist on earth at all. In the Gospel, the words 'not of this\nworld' are not used in that sense. To play with such words is\nindefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth.\nThe Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but\nit is only entered through the Church which has been founded and\nestablished upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a\nconnection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, a\nkingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the\nkingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine promise.\"\n\nHe ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After listening\nattentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder with\nperfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:\n\n\"The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first\nthree centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and was\nnothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to become\nChristian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it included\nthe Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments. In\nreality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of\nthe pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects\nand fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering\ninto the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental\nprinciples--the rock on which it stands--and could pursue no other aims than\nthose which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them\nthat of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State\nitself, into the Church. In that way (that is, with a view to the future)\nit is not the Church that should seek a definite position in the State,\nlike 'every social organization,' or as 'an organization of men for\nreligious purposes' (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the\ncontrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completely\ntransformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a Church,\nrejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this\nwill not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great\nState, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false,\nstill pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone\nleads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the book _On the\nFoundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged correctly if, in\nseeking and laying down those foundations, he had looked upon them as a\ntemporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days. But as\nsoon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he\npredicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the\npermanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he is going directly\nagainst the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist\nof my article.\"\n\n\"That is, in brief,\" Father Paissy began again, laying stress on each\nword, \"according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the\nnineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, as\nthough this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as to\ndisappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, and\ncivilization. And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will\nbe set apart for her in the State, and even that under control--and this\nwill be so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopes\nand conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower\ninto a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State\nshould end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else. So\nbe it! So be it!\"\n\n\"Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat,\" Miuesov said smiling, again\ncrossing his legs. \"So far as I understand, then, the realization of such\nan ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ. That's as\nyou please. It's a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war,\ndiplomacy, banks, and so on--something after the fashion of socialism,\nindeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that the\nChurch might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence them to\nbeating, prison, and even death.\"\n\n\"But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would not\neven now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the way of\nregarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, but\nfairly soon,\" Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Miuesov glanced keenly at him.\n\n\"If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the\ncriminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,\" Ivan went\non. \"I ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut off\nthen not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he would\nhave transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ.\nThis is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly\nenunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to-day compromises with\nhis conscience: 'I steal,' he says, 'but I don't go against the Church.\nI'm not an enemy of Christ.' That's what the criminal of to-day is\ncontinually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the\nState it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over\nthe world, to say: 'All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are\nthe false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian\nChurch.' It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires a\nrare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, take\nthe Church's own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present\nalmost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its\ntainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, into\ncompletely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man,\nof his reformation and salvation?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I fail to understand again,\" Miuesov interrupted. \"Some\nsort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible. What\nis excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I suspect you are simply\namusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,\" said the elder suddenly, and\nall turned to him at once. \"If it were not for the Church of Christ there\nwould be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no real\nchastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical\npunishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only\nembitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one,\nthe only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin\nby conscience.\"\n\n\"How is that, may one inquire?\" asked Miuesov, with lively curiosity.\n\n\"Why,\" began the elder, \"all these sentences to exile with hard labor, and\nformerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's more, deter hardly\na single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish but is\ncontinually on the increase. You must admit that. Consequently the\nsecurity of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious member\nis mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another criminal\nalways comes to take his place at once, and often two of them. If anything\ndoes preserve society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform\nthe criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience. It\nis only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian\nsociety--that is, of the Church--that he recognizes his sin against\nsociety--that is, against the Church. So that it is only against the\nChurch, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day can\nrecognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,\nthen it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to\nitself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the power of\nmoral condemnation, withdraws of her own accord from punishing the\ncriminal actively. She does not excommunicate him but simply persists in\nmotherly exhortation of him. What is more, the Church even tries to\npreserve all Christian communion with the criminal. She admits him to\nchurch services, to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him\nmore as a captive than as a convict. And what would become of the\ncriminal, O Lord, if even the Christian society--that is, the Church--were\nto reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off? What\nwould become of him if the Church punished him with her excommunication as\nthe direct consequence of the secular law? There could be no more terrible\ndespair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still have\nfaith. Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen,\nperhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then\nwhat would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother,\nholds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely\npunished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one to\nhave pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgment\nis the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practically\nand morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary\ncompromise. She can enter into no compact about that. The foreign\ncriminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to-day\nconfirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction\nagainst an unjustly oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a\nforce that triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of\nthemselves in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred,\nforgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate\nof the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the\ncompassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are no\nchurches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid church\nbuildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass\nfrom Church into State and to disappear in it completely. So it seems at\nleast in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was proclaimed a State\ninstead of a Church a thousand years ago. And so the criminal is no longer\nconscious of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If he\nreturns to society, often it is with such hatred that society itself\ninstinctively cuts him off. You can judge for yourself how it must end. In\nmany cases it would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is\nthat besides the established law courts we have the Church too, which\nalways keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious\nson. And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought,\nthe judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice is\nstill living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively\nrecognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said here just now is\ntrue too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introduced\nin practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the society were\nchanged into the Church, not only the judgment of the Church would have\ninfluence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, but\npossibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished. And\nthere can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the\ncrime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in\nrestoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in\nregenerating the fallen. It is true,\" said Father Zossima, with a smile,\n\"the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven\nrighteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will continue still\nunshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society\nalmost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful\nChurch. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for it is\nordained to come to pass! And there is no need to be troubled about times\nand seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of\nGod, in His foresight, and His love. And what in human reckoning seems\nstill afar off, may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve\nof its appearance. And so be it, so be it!\"\n\n\"So be it, so be it!\" Father Paissy repeated austerely and reverently.\n\n\"Strange, extremely strange!\" Miuesov pronounced, not so much with heat as\nwith latent indignation.\n\n\"What strikes you as so strange?\" Father Iosif inquired cautiously.\n\n\"Why, it's beyond anything!\" cried Miuesov, suddenly breaking out; \"the\nState is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the State.\nIt's not simply Ultramontanism, it's arch-Ultramontanism! It's beyond the\ndreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!\"\n\n\"You are completely misunderstanding it,\" said Father Paissy sternly.\n\"Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State. That is\nRome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. On the\ncontrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and become\na Church over the whole world--which is the complete opposite of\nUltramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the glorious\ndestiny ordained for the Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the\neast!\"\n\nMiuesov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary\npersonal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile played on his\nlips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart. The whole\nconversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced casually at Rakitin, who\nwas standing immovable in his place by the door listening and watching\nintently though with downcast eyes. But from the color in his cheeks\nAlyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he knew\nwhat caused his excitement.\n\n\"Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,\" Miuesov said\nimpressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. \"Some years ago, soon after\nthe _coup d'etat_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an\nextremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very\ninteresting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a\ndetective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of\npolitical detectives--a rather powerful position in its own way. I was\nprompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him.\nAnd as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing\na special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, he\ndeigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course.\nHe was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,\nespecially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The subject\nwas the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I will\nquote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. 'We are not\nparticularly afraid,' said he, 'of all these socialists, anarchists,\ninfidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all their\ngoings on. But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God\nand are Christians, but at the same time are socialists. These are the\npeople we are most afraid of. They are dreadful people! The socialist who\nis a Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.'\nThe words struck me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to\nme here, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?\" Father Paissy\nasked directly, without beating about the bush.\n\nBut before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the door\nopened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in. They\nhad, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden appearance caused\nsome surprise for a moment.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?\n\n\nDmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height and\nagreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was muscular, and\nshowed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was something\nnot healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and\nthere was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His rather large,\nprominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet\nthere was a vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking\nirritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed\nsomething else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. \"It's\nhard to tell what he's thinking,\" those who talked to him sometimes\ndeclared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes were\nstartled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful and light-\nhearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so gloomy. A certain\nstrained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment. Every one\nknew, or had heard of, the extremely restless and dissipated life which he\nhad been leading of late, as well as of the violent anger to which he had\nbeen roused in his quarrels with his father. There were several stories\ncurrent in the town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature,\n\"of an unstable and unbalanced mind,\" as our justice of the peace,\nKatchalnikov, happily described him.\n\nHe was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned frock-\ncoat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat. Having only lately left\nthe army, he still had mustaches and no beard. His dark brown hair was\ncropped short, and combed forward on his temples. He had the long,\ndetermined stride of a military man. He stood still for a moment on the\nthreshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder,\nguessing him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his\nblessing. Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed\nhis hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:\n\n\"Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long, but\nSmerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my inquiries, told\nme twice over that the appointment was for one. Now I suddenly learn--\"\n\n\"Don't disturb yourself,\" interposed the elder. \"No matter. You are a\nlittle late. It's of no consequence....\"\n\n\"I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your goodness.\"\n\nSaying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards his\nfather, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful bow. He had\nevidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all seriousness,\nthinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions.\n\nAlthough Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to the\noccasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his chair and made\nhis son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly solemn and\nimpressive, which gave him a positively malignant look. Dmitri bowed\ngenerally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with his\nlong, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near Father\nPaissy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he\nhad interrupted.\n\nDmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the conversation\nwas resumed. But this time Miuesov thought it unnecessary to reply to\nFather Paissy's persistent and almost irritable question.\n\n\"Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,\" he observed with a certain\nwell-bred nonchalance. \"It's a subtle question, too. Here Ivan\nFyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting to say\nabout that also. Ask him.\"\n\n\"Nothing special, except one little remark,\" Ivan replied at once.\n\"European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often mix\nup the final results of socialism with those of Christianity. This wild\nnotion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it's not only Liberals\nand dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases,\nit appears, the police--the foreign police, of course--do the same. Your\nParis anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\"\n\n\"I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,\" Miuesov repeated.\n\"I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and rather\ncharacteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself. Only five days ago,\nin a gathering here, principally of ladies, he solemnly declared in\nargument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their\nneighbors. That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind,\nand that, if there had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing\nto a natural law, but simply because men have believed in immortality.\nIvan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in\nthat faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in\nimmortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of\nthe world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then would be\nimmoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism. That's not all. He\nended by asserting that for every individual, like ourselves, who does not\nbelieve in God or immortality, the moral law of nature must immediately be\nchanged into the exact contrary of the former religious law, and that\negoism, even to crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized as\nthe inevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position.\nFrom this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric\nand paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's theories.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Dmitri cried suddenly; \"if I've heard aright, crime must not\nonly be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the most\nrational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is that so or not?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Father Paissy.\n\n\"I'll remember it.\"\n\nHaving uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he had\nbegun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.\n\n\"Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the\ndisappearance of the faith in immortality?\" the elder asked Ivan suddenly.\n\n\"Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no\nimmortality.\"\n\n\"You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.\"\n\n\"Why unhappy?\" Ivan asked smiling.\n\n\"Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the immortality\nof your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your article on\nChurch jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn't altogether joking,\" Ivan suddenly\nand strangely confessed, flushing quickly.\n\n\"You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question is still\nfretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes sometimes to\ndivert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair\nitself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself with\nmagazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don't believe\nyour own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....\nThat question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it\nclamors for an answer.\"\n\n\"But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?\" Ivan went on\nasking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable\nsmile.\n\n\"If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided in\nthe negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and all\nits suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who has given you a\nlofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higher\nthings, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God grant that your heart will\nattain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path.\"\n\nThe elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross over\nIvan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his seat, went up to\nhim, received his blessing, and kissing his hand went back to his place in\nsilence. His face looked firm and earnest. This action and all the\npreceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan, impressed every\none by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that all were silent\nfor a moment, and there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's\nface. But Miuesov suddenly shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment\nFyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.\n\n\"Most pious and holy elder,\" he cried, pointing to Ivan, \"that is my son,\nflesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most dutiful Karl\nMoor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri, against\nwhom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz Moor--they are\nboth out of Schiller's _Robbers_, and so I am the reigning Count von Moor!\nJudge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!\"\n\n\"Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the members of\nyour family,\" answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He was\nobviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing.\n\n\"An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!\" cried Dmitri\nindignantly. He too leapt up. \"Forgive it, reverend Father,\" he added,\naddressing the elder. \"I am not a cultivated man, and I don't even know\nhow to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have been\ntoo good-natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is a\nscandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive. But\nI believe I know why--\"\n\n\"They all blame me, all of them!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn.\n\"Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, you have!\" he turned suddenly to Miuesov, although the\nlatter was not dreaming of interrupting him. \"They all accuse me of having\nhidden the children's money in my boots, and cheated them, but isn't there\na court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\nfrom your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money you\nhad, how much you have spent, and how much you have left. Why does Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him.\nBecause they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to\nme, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentary\nproof. The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was\nstationed before, he several times spent a thousand or two for the\nseduction of some respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, in its most secret details. I'll prove it.... Would you\nbelieve it, holy Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable\nof young ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,\nformerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and had the\nAnna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by his promise of\nmarriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed to him, yet\nbefore her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress.\nAnd although this enchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriage\nwith a respectable man, yet she is of an independent character, an\nunapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wife--for she is\nvirtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to\nopen this fortress with a golden key, and that's why he is insolent to me\nnow, trying to get money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this\nenchantress already. He's continually borrowing money for the purpose.\nFrom whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?\"\n\n\"Be silent!\" cried Dmitri, \"wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my presence\nto asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you should utter a\nword about her is an outrage, and I won't permit it!\"\n\nHe was breathless.\n\n\"Mitya! Mitya!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a\ntear. \"And is your father's blessing nothing to you? If I curse you, what\nthen?\"\n\n\"Shameless hypocrite!\" exclaimed Dmitri furiously.\n\n\"He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with others?\nGentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honorable man living here,\nburdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and was\ndischarged from the army, but not publicly, not by court-martial, with no\nslur on his honor. And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in\na tavern, dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly, and all\nbecause he is an agent in a little business of mine.\"\n\n\"It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie!\" Dmitri was\ntrembling with rage. \"Father, I don't justify my action. Yes, I confess it\npublicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I regret it now, and\nI'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage. But this captain, this agent\nof yours, went to that lady whom you call an enchantress, and suggested to\nher from you, that she should take I.O.U.'s of mine which were in your\npossession, and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by\nmeans of them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my\nproperty. Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you\nyourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face.... She\ntold me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to put me in prison\nbecause you are jealous of me with her, because you'd begun to force your\nattentions upon her; and I know all about that, too; she laughed at you\nfor that as well--you hear--she laughed at you as she described it. So here\nyou have this man, this father who reproaches his profligate son!\nGentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would\nonly bring you together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if\nhe held out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has\njust this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady, for\nwhom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in vain, I have\nmade up my mind to show up his game, though he is my father....\"\n\nHe could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed with\ndifficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except Father\nZossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere but\nwaited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale, not from\nexcitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring smile lighted up\nhis face; from time to time he raised his hand, as though to check the\nstorm, and, of course, a gesture from him would have been enough to end\nthe scene; but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched them\nintently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectly\nclear to him. At last Miuesov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.\n\n\"We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,\" he said hotly. \"But I did\nnot foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal. This\nmust be stopped at once! Believe me, your reverence, I had no precise\nknowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was unwilling to\nbelieve them, and I learn for the first time.... A father is jealous of\nhis son's relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the\ncreature to get his son into prison! This is the company in which I have\nbeen forced to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was\nas much deceived as any one.\"\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an unnatural\nvoice, \"if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a\nduel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a handkerchief,\" he\nended, stamping with both feet.\n\nWith old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when\nthey enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears\nof emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later,\nthey are able to whisper to themselves, \"You know you are lying, you\nshameless old sinner! You're acting now, in spite of your 'holy' wrath.\"\n\nDmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at his\nfather.\n\n\"I thought ... I thought,\" he said, in a soft and, as it were, controlled\nvoice, \"that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart,\nmy betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find nothing but a depraved\nprofligate, a despicable clown!\"\n\n\"A duel!\" yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at each\nsyllable. \"And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miuesov, let me tell you that\nthere has never been in all your family a loftier, and more honest--you\nhear--more honest woman than this 'creature,' as you have dared to call\nher! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for that\n'creature,' so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldn't\nhold a candle to her. That's the woman called a 'creature'!\"\n\n\"Shameful!\" broke from Father Iosif.\n\n\"Shameful and disgraceful!\" Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a boyish\nvoice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till that moment.\n\n\"Why is such a man alive?\" Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in a\nhollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed.\n\"Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?\" He looked round\nat every one and pointed at the old man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.\n\n\"Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nrushing up to Father Iosif. \"That's the answer to your 'shameful!' What is\nshameful? That 'creature,' that 'woman of loose behavior' is perhaps\nholier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation! She\nfell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved much,\nand Christ himself forgave the woman 'who loved much.' \"\n\n\"It was not for such love Christ forgave her,\" broke impatiently from the\ngentle Father Iosif.\n\n\"Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here, eating\ncabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and you\nthink you bribe God with gudgeon.\"\n\n\"This is unendurable!\" was heard on all sides in the cell.\n\nBut this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way. Father\nZossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with anxiety for\nthe elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supporting\nhim by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank\non his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness,\nbut this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at\nDmitri's feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so\nastounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a\nfaint smile on his lips.\n\n\"Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!\" he said, bowing on all sides to his\nguests.\n\nDmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him--what did\nit mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, \"Oh, God!\" hid his face in his hands,\nand rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after him, in their\nconfusion not saying good-by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks went\nup to him again for a blessing.\n\n\"What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic or\nwhat?\" said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen\nconversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They were\nall passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.\n\n\"I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen,\" Miuesov answered at once\nill-humoredly, \"but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nand, trust me, for ever. Where's that monk?\"\n\n\"That monk,\" that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with the\nSuperior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came down\nthe steps from the elder's cell, as though he had been waiting for them\nall the time.\n\n\"Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest respect to the\nFather Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miuesov, to his reverence,\ntelling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances I\nam unable to have the honor of being present at his table, greatly as I\nshould desire to do so,\" Miuesov said irritably to the monk.\n\n\"And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,\" Fyodor\nPavlovitch cut in immediately. \"Do you hear, Father; this gentleman\ndoesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at once. And you\nshall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and good\nappetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home, I'll eat at\nhome, I don't feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable\nrelative.\"\n\n\"I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible man!\"\n\n\"I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim the\nrelationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling.\nI'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan, stay if you like.\nI'll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires you to go to the\nFather Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to apologize for the disturbance\nwe've been making....\"\n\n\"Is it true that you are going home? Aren't you lying?\"\n\n\"Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened! Forgive me,\ngentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And, indeed, I am\nashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon and\nanother the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog\nFido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to\ngobble up the monastery's sauces? I am ashamed, I can't. You must excuse\nme!\"\n\n\"The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?\" thought Miuesov, still\nhesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes. The\nlatter turned round, and noticing that Miuesov was watching him, waved him\na kiss.\n\n\"Well, are you coming to the Superior?\" Miuesov asked Ivan abruptly.\n\n\"Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner,\"\nsaid Miuesov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact that the\nmonk was listening. \"We ought, at least, to apologize for the disturbance,\nand explain that it was not our doing. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father won't be\nthere,\" observed Ivan.\n\n\"Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!\"\n\nThey all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On the road\nthrough the copse he made one observation however--that the Father Superior\nhad been waiting a long time, and that they were more than half an hour\nlate. He received no answer. Miuesov looked with hatred at Ivan.\n\n\"Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,\" he\nthought. \"A brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!\"\n\n\n\nChapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career\n\n\nAlyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed. It\nwas a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrow\niron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the corner, under\nthe ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The\nelder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard.\nHe looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.\n\n\"Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are needed\nthere, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.\"\n\n\"Let me stay here,\" Alyosha entreated.\n\n\"You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be\nof service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, my\nson\"--the elder liked to call him that--\"this is not the place for you in\nthe future. When it is God's will to call me, leave the monastery. Go away\nfor good.\"\n\nAlyosha started.\n\n\"What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great\nservice in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have\nto take a wife, too. You will have to bear _all_ before you come back.\nThere will be much to do. But I don't doubt of you, and so I send you\nforth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you.\nYou will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is\nmy last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.\nRemember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only my\ndays but my hours are numbered.\"\n\nAlyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouth\nquivered.\n\n\"What is it again?\" Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. \"The worldly may\nfollow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who is\ndeparting. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go, and\nmake haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.\"\n\nFather Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make no\nprotest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover, to\nask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tip\nof his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder would have\nexplained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it was not his\nwill. That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed\nblindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.\n\nAs he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in\ntime to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt a sudden pang at\nhis heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima's\nwords, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly\nmust infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how\ncould he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing\nhim? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the\nmonastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He\nhurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage,\nand unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient\npines beside the path. He had not far to go--about five hundred paces. He\nexpected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he\nnoticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.\n\n\"Are you waiting for me?\" asked Alyosha, overtaking him.\n\n\"Yes,\" grinned Rakitin. \"You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know;\nhe has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet since the Superior\nentertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shan't be\nthere, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what\ndoes that vision mean? That's what I want to ask you.\"\n\n\"What vision?\"\n\n\"That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the ground with\nhis forehead, too!\"\n\n\"You speak of Father Zossima?\"\n\n\"Yes, of Father Zossima.\"\n\n\"Tapped the ground?\"\n\n\"Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that\nvision mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know what it means, Misha.\"\n\n\"I knew he wouldn't explain it to you! There's nothing wonderful about it,\nof course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the\nperformance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it and\nspread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To my\nthinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your\nhouse stinks of it.\"\n\n\"What crime?\"\n\nRakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.\n\n\"It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your rich\nold father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn\nup. If something happens later on, it'll be: 'Ah, the holy man foresaw it,\nprophesied it!' though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.\n'Ah, but it was symbolic,' they'll say, 'an allegory,' and the devil knows\nwhat all! It'll be remembered to his glory: 'He predicted the crime and\nmarked the criminal!' That's always the way with these crazy fanatics;\nthey cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like\nyour elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a\nmurderer.\"\n\n\"What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?\"\n\nAlyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.\n\n\"What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've thought of it\nbefore. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you always\nspeak the truth, though you're always between two stools. Have you thought\nof it or not? Answer.\"\n\n\"I have,\" answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.\n\n\"What? Have you really?\" he cried.\n\n\"I ... I've not exactly thought it,\" muttered Alyosha, \"but directly you\nbegan speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.\"\n\n\"You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and your\nbrother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then I'm not mistaken?\"\n\n\"But wait, wait a minute,\" Alyosha broke in uneasily. \"What has led you to\nsee all this? Why does it interest you? That's the first question.\"\n\n\"Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them separately.\nWhat led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I hadn't suddenly\nunderstood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him all\nat once. I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest but\npassionate people have a line which mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd\nrun at your father with a knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned\nold sinner, who can never draw the line--if they both let themselves go,\nthey'll both come to grief.\"\n\n\"No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't come to\nthat.\"\n\n\"But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our Mitya\n(he is stupid, but honest), but he's--a sensualist. That's the very\ndefinition and inner essence of him. It's your father has handed him on\nhis low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you, Alyosha, how you\ncan have kept your purity. You're a Karamazov too, you know! In your\nfamily sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these three\nsensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts.\nThe three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be the\nfourth.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri--despises her,\" said Alyosha,\nwith a sort of shudder.\n\n\"Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has openly\nabandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her. There's something\nhere, my dear boy, that you don't understand yet. A man will fall in love\nwith some beauty, with a woman's body, or even with a part of a woman's\nbody (a sensualist can understand that), and he'll abandon his own\nchildren for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia,\ntoo. If he's honest, he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's\nfaithful, he'll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their\nfeet in his verse. Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at\ntheir feet without a thrill--and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no\nhelp here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he\ncan't tear himself away.\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" Alyosha jerked out suddenly.\n\n\"Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the\nfirst word,\" said Rakitin, malignantly. \"That escaped you unawares, and\nthe confession's the more precious. So it's a familiar subject; you've\nthought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul!\nYou're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're a saint, I know, but the devil only\nknows what you've thought about, and what you know already! You are pure,\nbut you've been down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long\ntime. You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov--no doubt\nbirth and selection have something to answer for. You're a sensualist from\nyour father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do you tremble? Is it\ntrue, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along.\n'I'll pull off his cassock,' she says. You can't think how she keeps\nbegging me to bring you. I wondered why she took such an interest in you.\nDo you know, she's an extraordinary woman, too!\"\n\n\"Thank her and say I'm not coming,\" said Alyosha, with a strained smile.\n\"Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you my idea after.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,\nbrother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,\nIvan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is\nthat you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan writes\ntheological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his own,\nthough he's an atheist, and he admits it's a fraud himself--that's your\nbrother Ivan. He's trying to get Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I\nfancy he'll succeed, too. And what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For\nMitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to\nGrushenka. And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and\ndisinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the\ndevil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it!\nLet me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mitya's way\nnow. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His mouth waters at the\nsight of her. It's simply on her account he made that scene in the cell\njust now, simply because Miuesov called her an 'abandoned creature.' He's\nworse than a tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him in\nconnection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he\nhas suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps\npestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And they'll\ncome into collision, the precious father and son, on that path! But\nGrushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them, and\nteasing them both, considering which she can get most out of. For though\nshe could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't marry her, and\nmaybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. That's where\nMitya's value comes in; he has no money, but he's ready to marry her. Yes,\nready to marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina\nIvanovna, who's rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry\nGrushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant,\nSamsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict\nmay well come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is\nwaiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry off\nKaterina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of\nsixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a man of no\nconsequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't be wronging Mitya, but\ndoing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last\nweek, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud\nthat he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan,\nhe was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end\nrefuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between the two of\nthem already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship\nhim? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.\"\n\n\"How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?\" Alyosha asked\nsharply, frowning.\n\n\"Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know\nI'm speaking the truth.\"\n\n\"You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.\"\n\n\"Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only the money,\nthough a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\"\n\n\"Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for thousands. It is\nnot money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it's suffering he is\nseeking.\"\n\n\"What wild dream now? Oh, you--aristocrats!\"\n\n\"Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted\nby a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don't want millions,\nbut an answer to their questions.\"\n\n\"That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases. Ah, Ivan\nhas set you a problem!\" cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice. His face\nchanged, and his lips twitched. \"And the problem's a stupid one. It is no\ngood guessing it. Rack your brains--you'll understand it. His article is\nabsurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid theory just now: if\nthere's no immortality of the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything\nis lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried\nout: 'I will remember!') An attractive theory for scoundrels!--(I'm being\nabusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic _poseurs_,\n'haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.' He's showing off, and what it all\ncomes to is, 'on the one hand we cannot but admit' and 'on the other it\nmust be confessed!' His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in\nitself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality.\nIt will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity.\"\n\nRakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as\nthough remembering something, he stopped short.\n\n\"Well, that's enough,\" he said, with a still more crooked smile. \"Why are\nyou laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?\"\n\n\"No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but ...\nnever mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot about it,\nMisha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina\nIvanovna yourself; I've suspected that for a long time, brother, that's\nwhy you don't like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?\"\n\n\"And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?\"\n\n\"I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.\"\n\n\"I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivan\nwith you. Don't you understand that one might very well dislike him, apart\nfrom Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? He\ncondescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven't I a right to abuse him?\"\n\n\"I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He doesn't\nspeak of you at all.\"\n\n\"But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's he was\nabusing me for all he was worth--you see what an interest he takes in your\nhumble servant. And which is the jealous one after that, brother, I can't\nsay. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if I don't go in for\nthe career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and don't become a\nmonk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid\nmagazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and in\nthe end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal\nand atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of\nsocialism, but keeping a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in\nwith both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's\naccount, the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the\nproceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the\nend of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my\npublishing offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has\neven chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the Neva,\nwhich they say is to be built in Petersburg.\"\n\n\"Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of it,\" cried\nAlyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.\n\n\"You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different in my\nmind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You can't have been\nat Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking about you?\"\n\n\"I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it with\nmy own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but I overheard him,\nunintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in Grushenka's bedroom and I\ncouldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.\"\n\n\"A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!\" cried Rakitin, turning\ncrimson. \"Are you mad? You're out of your mind!\"\n\n\"Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.\"\n\n\"Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient,\nnoble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon at\nother men's tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor. I may\nbe only a priest's son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but\ndon't insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common\nharlot. I beg you to understand that!\"\n\nRakitin was intensely irritated.\n\n\"Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you\ncall her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?\" Alyosha flushed\nsuddenly. \"I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. You\noften go to see her, and you told me yourself you're not her lover. I\nnever dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she\nreally deserve it?\"\n\n\"I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your business.\nBut as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely\nto make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You'd better go to the\nkitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can't have\nfinished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No\ndoubt they have. Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him.\nThey've broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's\nshouting out something after them from the steps. And your father's\nshouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing. Bah, and there goes\nMiuesov driving away in his carriage. You see, he's going. And there's old\nMaximov running!--there must have been a row. There can't have been any\ndinner. Surely they've not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they,\nperhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!\"\n\nThere was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a scandalous,\nan unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene\n\n\nMiuesov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inward\nqualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed\nof having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdained that\ndespicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him\nin Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \"The monks\nwere not to blame, in any case,\" he reflected, on the steps. \"And if\nthey're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a\nnobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't argue, I'll\nfall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show\nthem that I've nothing to do with that AEsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot,\nand have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.\"\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish\nhis claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the more\nready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he\nhad indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.\n\nThese excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father\nSuperior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a dining-\nroom, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they were,\nhowever, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But there\nwas no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. The\nfurniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned\nstyle of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining\nwith cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the\nmost sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the\nbeautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there\nwere three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of\nexcellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas--both the latter made in the\nmonastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin\nrelated afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of\nsterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a\nspecial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally,\nblanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could\nnot resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He\nhad a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of\nan uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable\nabilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he\nwould play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to\nhim, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and\nquite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that\nbecause he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the\nhighest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced\nhim in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invited\nto the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one other monk\nwere the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were already waiting\nwhen Miuesov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a\nlittle aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of\nthe room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous\nold man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic\nface. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to\nreceive his blessing. Miuesov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father\nSuperior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov\nwent through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner,\nkissing his hand as peasants do.\n\n\"We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,\" began Miuesov, simpering\naffably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. \"Pardon us for\nhaving come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He\nfelt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not without\nreason. In the reverend Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the\nunhappy dissension with his son, and let fall words which were quite out\nof keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ... as\"--he glanced at the\nmonks--\"your reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore,\nrecognizing that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame,\nand begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his\napologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends\nlater. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken\nplace.\"\n\nAs he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miuesov completely recovered his\nself-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation disappeared. He\nfully and sincerely loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight bend\nof the head, replied:\n\n\"I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have\nlearnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\"\n\nHe stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent\ntheir heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with\npeculiar fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It\nmust be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt the\nimpossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing\nhad happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elder's cell. Not that\nhe was so very much ashamed of himself--quite the contrary perhaps. But\nstill he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking\ncarriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had\nhardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own\nwords at the elder's: \"I always feel when I meet people that I am lower\nthan all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play\nthe buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\" He\nlonged to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness. He\nsuddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \"Why do you hate\nso and so, so much?\" And he had answered them, with his shameless\nimpudence, \"I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a\ndirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\"\n\nRemembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for a\nmoment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. \"Well, since I\nhave begun, I may as well go on,\" he decided. His predominant sensation at\nthat moment might be expressed in the following words, \"Well, there is no\nrehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will\nshow them I don't care what they think--that's all!\"\n\nHe told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to the\nmonastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what\nhe would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that a\ntouch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only to\nobscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be legally\npunished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had\nmarveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeared in the\nFather Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and\nall were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the\ncompany, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked\nthem all boldly in the face. \"They thought I had gone, and here I am\nagain,\" he cried to the whole room.\n\nFor one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once every\none felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, was\nabout to happen. Miuesov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame\nof mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died\ndown in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\"No! this I cannot endure!\" he cried. \"I absolutely cannot! and ... I\ncertainly cannot!\"\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyond\nthinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\"What is it he cannot?\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \"that he absolutely\ncannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will\nyou receive me as your guest?\"\n\n\"You are welcome with all my heart,\" answered the Superior. \"Gentlemen!\"\nhe added, \"I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your\ndissensions, and to be united in love and family harmony--with prayer to\nthe Lord at our humble table.\"\n\n\"No, no, it is impossible!\" cried Miuesov, beside himself.\n\n\"Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for\nme, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,\nI will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what\nyou said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my\nrelation. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you,\nvon Sohn?\"\n\n\"Do you mean me?\" muttered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\"Of course I mean you,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \"Who else? The Father\nSuperior could not be von Sohn.\"\n\n\"But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\"\n\n\"No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It\nwas a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry--I believe\nthat is what such places are called among you--he was killed and robbed,\nand in spite of his venerable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from\nPetersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing him\nup, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano.\nSo this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von\nSohn?\"\n\n\"What is happening? What's this?\" voices were heard in the group of monks.\n\n\"Let us go,\" cried Miuesov, addressing Kalganov.\n\n\"No, excuse me,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another step\ninto the room. \"Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me for\nbehaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch. Miuesov, my relation, prefers to have _plus de noblesse que\nde sincerite_ in his words, but I prefer in mine _plus de sincerite que de\nnoblesse_, and--damn the _noblesse_! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn?\nAllow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet\nI am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of\nhonor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing\nelse. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,\nAlexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and\nit is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been\nlistening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the\nlast act of the performance. You know how things are with us? As a thing\nfalls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever.\nNot a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with\nyou. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down\nreverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud.\nCan it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to\nconfess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it\nwas of old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this\nand that ... well, you understand what--sometimes it would not be proper to\ntalk about it--so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried\nalong with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunity\nI shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\"\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak\nspot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached\nthe Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others where the\ninstitution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the\nelders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that the\nelders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on--absurd\ncharges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of\nfolly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the\ncurrent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,\nprompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a\nword of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no\none had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he\ncould not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from\nconfused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish\ntirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to\nprove to his audience, and above all to himself, that he had not been\ntalking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word\nhe would be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,\nand plunged forward blindly.\n\n\"How disgraceful!\" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" said the Father Superior. \"It was said of old, 'Many have\nbegun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And\nhearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He\nhas sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbly thank you, honored\nguest!\" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\"Tut--tut--tut--sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old\ngestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. A\nkiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's _Robbers_. I\ndon't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to\nbe found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do\nyou fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward\nlike that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being\nvirtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in\na monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up\naloft for it--you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father\nSuperior. What have they got here?\" He went up to the table. \"Old port\nwine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is\nsomething beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought\nout, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the\nlaborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it\nfrom his family and the tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy\nfathers.\"\n\n\"This is too disgraceful!\" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obstinately silent. Miuesov rushed from the room, and\nKalganov after him.\n\n\"Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see\nyou again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a\nthousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No,\nI'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the\nhumiliation I endured.\" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm\nof simulated feeling. \"This monastery has played a great part in my life!\nIt has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,\nagainst me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me\nall over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the\nage of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles,\nno, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\"\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part\nin his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was\nso carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one moment\nalmost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But\nat that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke\nimpressively:\n\n\"It is written again, 'Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh\nupon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who\nhath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink\nyourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from\nhere for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most\ndutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you\nto stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only\none short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and\nkasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've\ncloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\" He went out,\nshouting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\"Alexey!\" his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. \"You\ncome home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, and\nleave no trace behind.\"\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.\nMeanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was about\nto follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good-by to\nAlyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque\nbuffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly\nappeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being\ntoo late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was in such a hurry that\nin his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot\nwas still resting, and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in.\n\"I am going with you!\" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh\nwith a look of reckless glee in his face. \"Take me, too.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. \"Did I not say he was von\nSohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear\nyourself away? What did you _vonsohn_ there? And how could you get away\nfrom the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but\nI am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It\nwill be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet,\nvon Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von\nSohn!\"\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a\nviolent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance he\ndid not fall.\n\n\"Drive on!\" Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.\n\n\"Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?\" Fyodor\nPavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\"Well, you are a fellow,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.\n\nAfter a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \"Why, it was you\ngot up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Why\nare you angry now?\"\n\n\"You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\" Ivan snapped\nsullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\"A drop of brandy would be nice now,\" he observed sententiously, but Ivan\nmade no response.\n\n\"You shall have some, too, when we get home.\"\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.\n\n\"But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike\nit so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\"\n\nIvan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the\nroad. And they did not speak again all the way home.\n\n\n\n\nBook III. The Sensualists\n\n\n\nChapter I. In The Servants' Quarters\n\n\nThe Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the town, but it\nwas not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old house of two\nstories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, and\nmight still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little\ncupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but Fyodor\nPavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. \"One doesn't feel so solitary\nwhen one's left alone in the evening,\" he used to say. It was his habit to\nsend the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up\nalone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor\nPavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was a\nkitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter\nand summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The\nhouse was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many,\nwith their servants. But at the time of our story there was no one living\nin the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodge\nthere were only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a\nyoung man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Of\nold Grigory we have said something already. He was firm and determined and\nwent blindly and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought\nby any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that\nit was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa\nIgnatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her life, yet she\nhad pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was set\non leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with\ntheir small savings. But Grigory decided then, once for all, that \"the\nwoman's talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,\" and that they\nought not to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for \"that was\nnow their duty.\"\n\n\"Do you understand what duty is?\" he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.\n\n\"I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it's our\nduty to stay here I never shall understand,\" Marfa answered firmly.\n\n\"Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your\ntongue.\"\n\nAnd so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a\nsmall sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too, that he had\nan indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and he was aware\nof it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though\nhis will was strong enough \"in some of the affairs of life,\" as he\nexpressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in\nfacing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of\nthem. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And\nthat's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most\ntrustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch\nhad only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's intervention,\nand on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But it\nwasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were\ngraver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor\nPavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one\nfaithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a\nmoment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his\nlust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in\nmoments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral\nconvulsion which took an almost physical form. \"My soul's simply quaking\nin my throat at those times,\" he used to say. At such moments he liked to\nfeel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a\nstrong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his\ndebauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to\noverlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or\nthreaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in\ncase of need, to defend him--from whom? From somebody unknown, but terrible\nand dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was _another_ man, an\nold and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely to\nlook at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with\nhim. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he\nwere angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however)\nthat Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and\nfetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would\nbegin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go\nagain, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor\nPavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the\njust. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on\nAlyosha's arrival. Alyosha \"pierced his heart\" by \"living with him, seeing\neverything and blaming nothing.\" Moreover, Alyosha brought with him\nsomething his father had never known before: a complete absence of\ncontempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural\nunaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was\na complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family\nties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till then\nloved nothing but \"evil.\" When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to\nhimself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to\nlearn.\n\nI have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaida Ivanovna, the\nfirst wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he had,\non the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor \"crazy woman,\" against\nhis master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His\nsympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him, so that\neven now, twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to\nher from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,\nGrigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words,\nwithout frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he\nloved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she knew\nit.\n\nMarfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,\ncleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he in worldly\naffairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without question or\ncomplaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for his spiritual\nsuperiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the\ncourse of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs. The\ngrave and dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone,\nso that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did not\nneed her advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took\nit as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once, and then\nonly slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's marriage\nwith Adelaida Ivanovna, the village girls and women--at that time\nserfs--were called together before the house to sing and dance. They were\nbeginning \"In the Green Meadows,\" when Marfa, at that time a young woman,\nskipped forward and danced \"the Russian Dance,\" not in the village\nfashion, but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of\nthe rich Miuesov family, in their private theater, where the actors were\ntaught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wife\ndanced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson,\npulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was never\nrepeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.\n\nGod had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died.\nGrigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. When\nAdelaida Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of three\nyears old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands, and\nlooked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan\nand Alyosha, for which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in\nthe face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his own\nchild had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it\nwas born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had six\nfingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only silent till\nthe day of the christening, but kept away in the garden. It was spring,\nand he spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day was\nfixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a\nconclusion. Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the\nvisitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-\nfather, he suddenly announced that the baby \"ought not to be christened at\nall.\" He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and\ngazing with dull intentness at the priest.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the priest with good-humored surprise.\n\n\"Because it's a dragon,\" muttered Grigory.\n\n\"A dragon? What dragon?\"\n\nGrigory did not speak for some time. \"It's a confusion of nature,\" he\nmuttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.\n\nThey laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayed\nearnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child remained\nunchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sickly\ninfant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, and\nfor the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of a\nfortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its\nlittle coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling\nup the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the\nearth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfa\nspeak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, she\nnever spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day of\nthe burial, he devoted himself to \"religion,\" and took to reading the\n_Lives of the Saints_, for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and\nalways putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read\naloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had\nsomehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of \"the God-fearing\nFather Isaac the Syrian,\" which he read persistently for years together,\nunderstanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the\nmore for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect\nof Flagellants settled in the neighborhood. He was evidently shaken by\nthem, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His habit of\ntheological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity.\n\nHe was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformed\nchild, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompanied\nby another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said later, had left\na \"stamp\" upon his soul. It happened that, on the very night after the\nburial of his child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of a new-born baby.\nShe was frightened and waked her husband. He listened and said he thought\nit was more like some one groaning, \"it might be a woman.\" He got up and\ndressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he\ndistinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard\ninto the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of\nentering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going\nback into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and\ntaking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still\npersuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby\ncrying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he\nheard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near the\ngarden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of\nthe bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who\nwandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname\nof Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-\nhouse and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby\nbeside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But\nher story needs a chapter to itself.\n\n\n\nChapter II. Lizaveta\n\n\nThere was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and\nconfirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a\ndwarfish creature, \"not five foot within a wee bit,\" as many of the pious\nold women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad,\nhealthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her\neyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered\nabout, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen\nsmock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a\nsort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had\nleaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on\nthe ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,\ncalled Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with\nsome well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and\ndiseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to\nhim. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look\nafter her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilya's\nemployers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople,\ntried to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots and\nsheepskin coat for the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress her\nup without resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral\nporch, and taking off all that had been given her--kerchief, sheepskin,\nskirt or boots--she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock\nas before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the\nprovince, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was\nwounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told she was\nan idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about\nin nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur\nagain. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At\nlast her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of\nthe religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemed\nto like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town,\nespecially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk into\nstrange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her and\ngave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and at\nonce drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a\nroll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met.\nSometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it\nto her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted\nanything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,\nwhere there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on\nher, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by\nthem, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to\nchurch. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle\n(there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a\nkitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up \"at home,\" that\nis at the house of her father's former employers, and in the winter went\nthere every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People\nwere amazed that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to\nit, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some\nof the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but\nthat is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from time to\ntime uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?\n\nIt happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago)\nfive or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late\nhour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through the \"back-\nway,\" which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdles on\neither side. This way leads out on to the bridge over the long, stinking\npool which we were accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and\nburdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped\nto look at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.\nIt occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry whether\nany one could possibly look upon such an animal as a woman, and so\nforth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it was\nimpossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward and\ndeclared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, there was a\ncertain piquancy about it, and so on.... It is true that at that time he\nwas overdoing his part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and\nentertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in\nreality he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time\nwhen he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg,\nand, with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly\nthat even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him. The\nrevelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one of them\neven began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelled the idea\neven more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity, and at\nlast they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had\ngone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for certain, and no\none ever knew. But five or six months later, all the town was talking,\nwith intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying\nto find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a\nterrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no other than\nFyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of that drunken band five had\nleft the town and the only one still among us was an elderly and much\nrespected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, who could\nhardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundation for it.\nBut rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing\nat him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not have\ntroubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he was proud,\nand did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the officials\nand nobles, whom he entertained so well.\n\nAt the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provoked\nquarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing some\npeople round to his side. \"It's the wench's own fault,\" he asserted, and\nthe culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and\nwhose name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. This\nconjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been in\nthe neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three\npeople. But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular\nsympathy from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A\nwell-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into her\nhouse at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after the\nconfinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite of their\nvigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made her way into Fyodor\nPavlovitch's garden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over the\nhigh, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have\nbeen lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The\nmost likely explanation is that it happened naturally--that Lizaveta,\naccustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow\nmanaged to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt\ndown, injuring herself.\n\nGrigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an\nold midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at\ndawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit\ndown, put it on her lap. \"A child of God--an orphan is akin to all,\" he\nsaid, \"and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who\nhas come from the devil's son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no\nmore.\"\n\nSo Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people\nwere not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch\ndid not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted\nvigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at\nhis adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname\nfor the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.\n\nSo this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant, and was\nliving in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.\nHe was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but\nI am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention so long occupied with these\ncommon menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of\nSmerdyakov in the course of it.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart--In Verse\n\n\nAlyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his\nfather shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness he\ndid not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchen\nto find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off,\ntrusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting\nhim. I hasten to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return\nhome \"with his mattress and pillow\" did not frighten him in the least. He\nunderstood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely \"a flourish\"\nto produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who was\ncelebrating his name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at being\nrefused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his\nown and his wife's clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for the\nsake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the\nbroken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go\nback to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he\nwas fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not\nhurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would\nwant to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him.\nThis was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he\nwent his way without hesitation, relying on it.\n\nBut at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and\nworried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear of\na woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in the\nnote handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about something.\nThis request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy\nfeeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful all\nthe morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father\nSuperior's. He was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak\nof and what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a\nwoman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life, from early\nchildhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was\nafraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from\nthe first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, and\nhad only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as a\nbeautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which troubled\nhim, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased\nthe apprehension itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew\nthat. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,\nthough he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha\nrecognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a\nshiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.\n\nHe reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend,\nwith her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was even\nmore certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. And\nso his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to run\nand see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing\nhim the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way\noff, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a\nminute, he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and\naccustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the\ndirection of his terrible lady.\n\nHe knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across the\nmarket-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it is\nscattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father was\nexpecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might be\nunreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So he\ndecided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the\nground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing\nother people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted\nhim. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.\n\nHe had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging to a\nlittle tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, as\nAlyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who had\nbeen a genteel maid-servant in generals' families in Petersburg. Now she\nhad been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She always dressed\nup in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had sunk into such\npoverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup\nand bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up\nfor soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even had\na long train--a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always\nknew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it as soon\nas he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he remembered the dress\nwith the train, raised his head, which had been bowed in thought, and came\nupon something quite unexpected.\n\nOver the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaning\nforward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously afraid to\nutter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.\n\n\"It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,\" Mitya\nsaid in a joyful, hurried whisper. \"Climb in here quickly! How splendid\nthat you've come! I was just thinking of you!\"\n\nAlyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over the hurdle.\nMitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump. Tucking up\nhis cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a bare-\nlegged street urchin.\n\n\"Well done! Now come along,\" said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.\n\n\"Where?\" whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in a\ndeserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small, but\nthe house was at least fifty paces away.\n\n\"There's no one here. Why do you whisper?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!\" cried Dmitri at the top of his voice.\n\"You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and on\nthe watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's a secret, I began\nwhispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let us go. Over there. Till\nthen be quiet. I want to kiss you.\n\n\n    Glory to God in the world,\n    Glory to God in me ...\n\n\nI was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.\"\n\nThe garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only\nalong the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees, maples, limes\nand birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, from\nwhich several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer. The garden\nwas let out for a few roubles for the summer. There were also plantations\nof raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a\nkitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.\n\nDmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden. There,\nin a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder,\nsnowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house,\nblackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still a\nroof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built.\nThere was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a\nretired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It\nwas all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the\nwoodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table\nfixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which it\nwas still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his brother's\nexhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of\nbrandy and a wineglass on the table.\n\n\"That's brandy,\" Mitya laughed. \"I see your look: 'He's drinking again!'\nDistrust the apparition.\n\n\n    Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,\n    And lay aside thy doubts.\n\n\nI'm not drinking, I'm only 'indulging,' as that pig, your Rakitin, says.\nHe'll be a civil councilor one day, but he'll always talk about\n'indulging.' Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you\nto my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world--in reality--in re-al-\ni-ty--(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!\"\n\nHe uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.\n\n\"No one but you and one 'jade' I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. But\nbeing in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in love with a woman and yet\nhate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit down here by\nthe table and I'll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. You\nshall keep quiet and I'll go on talking, for the time has come. But on\nreflection, you know, I'd better speak quietly, for here--here--you can\nnever tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they\nsay, 'the story will be continued.' Why have I been longing for you? Why\nhave I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's five\ndays since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I can tell\neverything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shall\nfly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning. Have\nyou ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a\npit? That's just how I'm falling, but not in a dream. And I'm not afraid,\nand don't you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not\nenjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong\nspirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spirit--whatever it is! Let us praise\nnature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all\ngreen, it's still summer; four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness!\nWhere were you going?\"\n\n\"I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's first.\"\n\n\"To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you?\nHungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my\nribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to\nhave done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent\nany one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to\nsee father and her.\"\n\n\"Did you really mean to send me?\" cried Alyosha with a distressed\nexpression.\n\n\"Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet,\nbe quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.\"\n\nDmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.\n\n\"She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why you're\ngoing to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?\"\n\n\"Here is her note.\" Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked\nthrough it quickly.\n\n\"And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by\nthe back-way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old\nfishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to\ntell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I've\ntold already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on\nearth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that\nsome one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from\neverything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,\nand before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says,\n'Do this for me'--some favor never asked before that could only be asked on\none's deathbed--would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?\"\n\n\"I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worry\nyourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a new\nturning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't understand ecstasy. But what\nam I saying to him? As though you didn't understand it. What an ass I am!\nWhat am I saying? 'Be noble, O man!'--who says that?\"\n\nAlyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his work\nlay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his elbow on the\ntable and his head in his hand. Both were silent.\n\n\"Alyosha,\" said Mitya, \"you're the only one who won't laugh. I should like\nto begin--my confession--with Schiller's _Hymn to Joy_, _An die Freude_! I\ndon't know German, I only know it's called that. Don't think I'm talking\nnonsense because I'm drunk. I'm not a bit drunk. Brandy's all very well,\nbut I need two bottles to make me drunk:\n\n\n    Silenus with his rosy phiz\n    Upon his stumbling ass.\n\n\nBut I've not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I'm not Silenus. I'm not\nSilenus, though I am strong,(1) for I've made a decision once for all.\nForgive me the pun; you'll have to forgive me a lot more than puns to-day.\nDon't be uneasy. I'm not spinning it out. I'm talking sense, and I'll come\nto the point in a minute. I won't keep you in suspense. Stay, how does it\ngo?\"\n\nHe raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:\n\n\n    \"Wild and fearful in his cavern\n     Hid the naked troglodyte,\n     And the homeless nomad wandered\n     Laying waste the fertile plain.\n     Menacing with spear and arrow\n     In the woods the hunter strayed....\n     Woe to all poor wretches stranded\n     On those cruel and hostile shores!\n\n    \"From the peak of high Olympus\n     Came the mother Ceres down,\n     Seeking in those savage regions\n     Her lost daughter Proserpine.\n     But the Goddess found no refuge,\n     Found no kindly welcome there,\n     And no temple bearing witness\n     To the worship of the gods.\n\n    \"From the fields and from the vineyards\n     Came no fruits to deck the feasts,\n     Only flesh of bloodstained victims\n     Smoldered on the altar-fires,\n     And where'er the grieving goddess\n     Turns her melancholy gaze,\n     Sunk in vilest degradation\n     Man his loathsomeness displays.\"\n\n\nMitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha's hand.\n\n\"My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. There's a\nterrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble.\nDon't think I'm only a brute in an officer's uniform, wallowing in dirt\nand drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man--if only I'm\nnot lying. I pray God I'm not lying and showing off. I think about that\nman because I am that man myself.\n\n\n    Would he purge his soul from vileness\n    And attain to light and worth,\n    He must turn and cling for ever\n    To his ancient Mother Earth.\n\n\nBut the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I don't\nkiss her. I don't cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or a\nshepherd? I go on and I don't know whether I'm going to shame or to light\nand joy. That's the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle! And\nwhenever I've happened to sink into the vilest degradation (and it's\nalways been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres and man. Has it\nreformed me? Never! For I'm a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit,\nI go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that\ndegrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths of\nthat degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me be\nvile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is\nshrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I\nlove Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.\n\n\n    Joy everlasting fostereth\n    The soul of all creation,\n    It is her secret ferment fires\n    The cup of life with flame.\n    'Tis at her beck the grass hath turned\n    Each blade towards the light\n    And solar systems have evolved\n    From chaos and dark night,\n    Filling the realms of boundless space\n    Beyond the sage's sight.\n    At bounteous Nature's kindly breast,\n    All things that breathe drink Joy,\n    And birds and beasts and creeping things\n    All follow where She leads.\n    Her gifts to man are friends in need,\n    The wreath, the foaming must,\n    To angels--vision of God's throne,\n    To insects--sensual lust.\n\n\nBut enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness that\nevery one would laugh at. But you won't laugh. Your eyes are shining, too.\nEnough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gave\n\"sensual lust.\"\n\n\n    To insects--sensual lust.\n\n\nI am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we\nKaramazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives in\nyou, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests, because\nsensual lust is a tempest--worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and\nawful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can\nbe fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet\nand all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man,\nbrother, but I've thought a lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries\nthere are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as\nwe can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure\nthe thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of\nthe Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's still more awful is\nthat a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal\nof the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on\nfire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too\nbroad, indeed. I'd have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of\nit! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart.\nIs there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind\nbeauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing is\nthat beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are\nfighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a man always\ntalks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart--In Anecdote\n\n\n\"I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent several\nthousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's a swinish invention, and\nthere was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didn't need money\nsimply for _that_. With me money is an accessory, the overflow of my\nheart, the framework. To-day she would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out\nof the streets in her place. I entertained them both. I threw away money\nby the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the\nladies, too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be\npleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of\nthem, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths, little\ndark back-alleys behind the main road--there one finds adventures and\nsurprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking figuratively,\nbrother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in the\nliteral sense, but morally there were. If you were like me, you'd know\nwhat that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I loved\ncruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov!\nOnce we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was\ndark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her\nto kiss me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle,\nsubmissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She\nthought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer (I\nwas looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word to her for\nfive months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we were always\nhaving dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fire--a\nfire of gentle indignation. This game only tickled that insect lust I\ncherished in my soul. Five months later she married an official and left\nthe town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live\nhappily. Observe that I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full\nof low desires, and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're\nblushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this\nwas nothing much--wayside blossoms _a la_ Paul de Kock--though the cruel\ninsect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect album of\nreminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to break it\noff without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of one\nof them. But that's enough. You can't suppose I brought you here simply to\ntalk of such nonsense. No, I'm going to tell you something more curious;\nand don't be surprised that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being\nashamed.\"\n\n\"You say that because I blushed,\" Alyosha said suddenly. \"I wasn't\nblushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I blushed because\nI am the same as you are.\"\n\n\"You? Come, that's going a little too far!\"\n\n\"No, it's not too far,\" said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not a\nnew one). \"The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom step, and you're\nabove, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's how I see it. But it's all\nthe same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound\nto go up to the top one.\"\n\n\"Then one ought not to step on at all.\"\n\n\"Any one who can help it had better not.\"\n\n\"But can you?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so.\nThat rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that she'd\ndevour you one day. There, there, I won't! From this field of corruption\nfouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that is\nby every sort of vileness. Although the old man told lies about my\nseducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy,\nthough it was only once, and then it did not come off. The old man who has\nreproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I\nnever told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course--Ivan\nknows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan's a tomb.\"\n\n\"Ivan's a tomb?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAlyosha listened with great attention.\n\n\"I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,\nlike a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little\ntown. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so\nmyself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although they\nshook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man,\ntook a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had\npowerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he\ncouldn't do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him\nwith proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was\nreally a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives,\nboth dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as\nunpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when I\nwas there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her mother's\nsister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but\nlively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of\nmore charming character than Agafya--fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna!\nAnd she wasn't bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with\na full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had\nnot married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but was\nas cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in 'that' way, it was\npure friendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I\nused to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Many\nwomen like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it very\namusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady. She\nand her aunt lived in her father's house with a sort of voluntary\nhumility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She was\na general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever\ndressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without\nasking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse.\nThe colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one of the\nchief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained the\nwhole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I arrived and joined the\nbattalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of the\ncolonel's second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionable\nschool in the capital. This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she\nwas the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguished\ngeneral's family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she too brought\nthe colonel no money. She had connections, and that was all. There may\nhave been expectations, but they had come to nothing.\n\n\"Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the whole\ntown revived. Our most distinguished ladies--two 'Excellencies' and a\ncolonel's wife--and all the rest following their lead, at once took her up\nand gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of the balls and\npicnics, and they got up _tableaux vivants_ in aid of distressed\ngovernesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of\nmy exploits at the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking my\nmeasure one evening at the battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her,\nas though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an\nevening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed\nher lips scornfully. 'Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,' thought I. I\nbehaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I was\nconscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt that 'Katenka'\nwas not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proud\nand really high-principled; above all, she had education and intellect,\nand I had neither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply\nwanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to\nfeel it.\n\n\"Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel\nput me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father sent me six\nthousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claims\nupon him--settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldn't\nexpect anything more. I didn't understand a word of it at the time. Until\nI came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I\nhaven't been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father.\nBut never mind that, we'll talk of it later.\n\n\"Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me\nsomething that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, were\ndissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected of\nirregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him.\nAnd then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil of\na shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I won't tell you\nhow it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked\ncoolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends all\nturned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya\nIvanovna, with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, 'Do you\nknow there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your\nfather's accounts?'\n\n\" 'What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not long\nago, and everything was all right.'\n\n\" 'Then it was, but now it isn't.'\n\n\"She was terribly scared.\n\n\" 'Don't frighten me!' she said. 'Who told you so?'\n\n\" 'Don't be uneasy,' I said, 'I won't tell any one. You know I'm as silent\nas the tomb. I only wanted, in view of \"possibilities,\" to add, that when\nthey demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he can't produce it,\nhe'll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age,\nunless you like to send me your young lady secretly. I've just had money\npaid me. I'll give her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret\nreligiously.'\n\n\" 'Ah, you scoundrel!'--that's what she said. 'You wicked scoundrel! How\ndare you!'\n\n\"She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once more\nthat the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures, Agafya\nand her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels all\nthrough this business. They genuinely adored their 'Katya,' thought her\nfar above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her of\nour conversation. I found that out afterwards. She didn't keep it back,\nand of course that was all I wanted.\n\n\"Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The old\nlieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't leave his room for two\ndays, and didn't hand over the government money. Dr. Kravchenko declared\nthat he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long\ntime, that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands\nexcept when the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend\nit to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old\nwidower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to go to the\nfair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum to\nthe colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interest\non the loan. But this time (I heard all about it quite by chance from\nTrifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in\nthe world)--this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair.\nThe lieutenant-colonel flew to him. 'I've never received any money from\nyou, and couldn't possibly have received any.' That was all the answer he\ngot. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel\nround his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All at\nonce an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to 'hand\nover the battalion money immediately, within two hours.' He signed the\nbook (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying he\nwould put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barreled\ngun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the gun\nagainst his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his foot. But\nAgafya, remembering what I had told her, had her suspicions. She stole up\nand peeped into the room just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon\nhim from behind, threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the\nceiling, but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held\nhim by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was\ngetting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed\nmy hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the\ndoor opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n\"It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in the\nstreet, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two decrepit\nold ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old things, ready\nto do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as two\ncast-iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at once. She walked in\nand looked straight at me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on\nher lips and round her mouth I saw uncertainty.\n\n\" 'My sister told me,' she began, 'that you would give me 4,500 roubles if\nI came to you for it--myself. I have come ... give me the money!'\n\n\"She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice failed\nher, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered.\nAlyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?\"\n\n\"Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,\" said Alyosha in agitation.\n\n\"I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shan't\nspare myself. My first idea was a--Karamazov one. Once I was bitten by a\ncentipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, I\nfelt a centipede biting at my heart then--a noxious insect, you understand?\nI looked her up and down. You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was\nbeautiful in another way then. At that moment she was beautiful because\nshe was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her\ngenerosity and sacrifice for her father, and I--a bug! And, scoundrel as I\nwas, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. I\ntell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed my\nheart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if there could be\nno resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomous\nspider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I\nshould have gone next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end\nhonorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though\nI'm a man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice\nseemed to whisper in my ear, 'But when you come to-morrow to make your\nproposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her coachman to kick\nyou out of the yard. \"Publish it through all the town,\" she would say,\n\"I'm not afraid of you.\" ' I looked at the young lady, my voice had not\ndeceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from\nher face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite was\nroused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at\nher with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her\nwith a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.\n\n\" 'Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've been counting\nyour chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my\nheart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity.\nYou've put yourself out to no purpose.'\n\n\"I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away. But it would\nhave been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all. I'd have\nhowled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played that\ntrick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any other\nwoman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with hatred. But, on my\noath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful\nhatred--that hate which is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the\nmaddest love!\n\n\"I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I\nremember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long,\ndon't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the drawer\nand took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying in a\nFrench dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it, handed it\nto her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her a\ndeep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! She\nshuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale--white\nas a sheet, in fact--and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently,\nbowed down to my feet--not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow,\nwith her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing\nmy sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I\ndon't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it\nwas from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from\ndelight? But I didn't stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back\nin the scabbard--which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And\nI fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on\nrather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who\npry into the human heart! Well, so much for that 'adventure' with Katerina\nIvanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you--no one else.\"\n\nDmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his\nhandkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the same\nplace as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn\nquite round to face him.\n\n\n\nChapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart--\"Heels Up\"\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Alyosha, \"I understand the first half.\"\n\n\"You understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was played\nout there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.\"\n\n\"And I understand nothing of that second half so far,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"And I? Do you suppose I understand it?\"\n\n\"Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you were\nbetrothed, you are betrothed still?\"\n\n\"We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure.\nThe next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, that\nthere would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer. On\nher side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained in\nthe town; except, indeed, for one action. The day after her visit the\nmaid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it\nopen: it contained the change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five\nhundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred\non changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I don't\nremember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searched\nthe packet for a pencil mark--n-nothing! Well, I spent the rest of the\nmoney on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.\n\n\"Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to the\nastonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the money\nuntouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed, and,\nthree weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five days\nafterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had time to\nreceive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with\nher aunt and sister, went to Moscow. And, behold, on the very day they\nwent away (I hadn't seen them, didn't see them off or take leave) I\nreceived a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line\nin pencil: 'I will write to you. Wait. K.' And that was all.\n\n\"I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changed\nwith the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabian\nfairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lost\nthe two nieces who were her heiresses and next-of-kin--both died in the\nsame week of small-pox. The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed\nKatya as a daughter, as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in\nKatya's favor. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for\npresent use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what\nshe liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in\nMoscow, later.\n\n\"Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles. I\nwas speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later came\nthe promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She offers\nto be my wife, offers herself to me. 'I love you madly,' she says, 'even\nif you don't love me, never mind. Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't\nhamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under\nyour feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.'\nAlyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in\nmy vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myself\nof. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't mind--that I don't\nmind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it was impossible for me to\ngo to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears. One thing I shall be ashamed of\nfor ever. I referred to her being rich and having a dowry while I was only\na stuck-up beggar! I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence,\nbut it slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all\nI could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do you\nlook like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with\nher; he's in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, in\nthe world's opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving\nof us all now. Oo! Don't you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she\nrespects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like\nme, especially after all that has happened here?\"\n\n\"But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man like\nhim.\"\n\n\"She loves her own _virtue_, not me.\" The words broke involuntarily, and\nalmost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his eyes\ngleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist.\n\n\"I swear, Alyosha,\" he cried, with intense and genuine anger at himself;\n\"you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is God, I swear\nthat though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I know that I am a\nmillion times baser in soul than she, and that these lofty sentiments of\nhers are as sincere as a heavenly angel's. That's the tragedy of it--that I\nknow that for certain. What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it\nmyself? And yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand\nhow he must be cursing nature now--with his intellect, too! To see the\npreference given--to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he is\nbetrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his\ndebaucheries--and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man like me\nis preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl wants to\nsacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's ridiculous! I've\nnever said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped a\nhint of the sort to me. But destiny will be accomplished, and the best man\nwill hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his back-\nalley for ever--his filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is\nat home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will\nand with enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use\nthem at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the back-\nalley, and she will marry Ivan.\"\n\n\"Stop, Dmitri,\" Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. \"There's one\nthing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same,\naren't you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your betrothed,\ndoesn't want to?\"\n\n\"Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in\nMoscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The general's\nwife blessed us, and--would you believe it?--congratulated Katya. 'You've\nmade a good choice,' she said, 'I see right through him.' And--would you\nbelieve it?--she didn't like Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of\ntalk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about myself--sincerely, honorably.\nShe listened to everything.\n\n\n    There was sweet confusion,\n    There were tender words.\n\n\nThough there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty promise\nto reform. I gave my promise, and here--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very\nday--remember it--to send you--this very day again--to Katerina Ivanovna,\nand--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, 'He sends you\nhis compliments.' \"\n\n\"But is that possible?\"\n\n\"That's just the reason I'm sending you, in my place, because it's\nimpossible. And, how could I tell her myself?\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\"\n\n\"To the back-alley.\"\n\n\"To Grushenka, then!\" Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.\n\"Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had just\nvisited her, and that was all.\"\n\n\"Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and with\nsuch a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, I\nhave some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be\nbetrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look at\nme? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and I\nknow for a fact now, that that captain, father's agent, had given\nGrushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an\nend to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a\nglimpse of her before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about\nher old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he's leaving her a\ndecent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that she\nhoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that she's a\nmerciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I stayed. The storm\nbroke--it struck me down like the plague. I'm plague-stricken still, and I\nknow that everything is over, that there will never be anything more for\nme. The cycle of the ages is accomplished. That's my position. And though\nI'm a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my\npocket. I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from\nhere. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there\ndrunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. In\nthree days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the hero\nhad gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue,\nGrushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in her\nlittle foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that was\nall, I swear! 'I'll marry you if you like,' she said, 'you're a beggar,\nyou know. Say that you won't beat me, and will let me do anything I\nchoose, and perhaps I will marry you.' She laughed, and she's laughing\nstill!\"\n\nDmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though he\nwere drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.\n\n\"And do you really mean to marry her?\"\n\n\"At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the same. I'll\nbe the porter at her gate. Alyosha!\" he cried. He stopped short before\nhim, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently. \"Do you\nknow, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium, senseless delirium, for\nthere's a tragedy here. Let me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man,\nwith low and degraded passions, but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri\nKaramazov never can be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and\na pickpocket. That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka,\nKaterina Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I\nsuppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of the\nprovince and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow,\nso that nothing should be known of it in the town here. So I had that\nthree thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it\nwas that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been to\nthe town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sent\nthe money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it.\nI've forgotten it. Now what do you think you're going to her to-day to\nsay? 'He sends his compliments,' and she'll ask you, 'What about the\nmoney?' You might still have said to her, 'He's a degraded sensualist, and\na low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money\nthen, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control\nhimself.' But still you might have added, 'He isn't a thief though. Here\nis your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya\nIvanovna. But he told me to say \"he sends his compliments.\" ' But, as it\nis, she will ask, 'But where is the money?' \"\n\n\"Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don't worry\nyourself to death with despair.\"\n\n\"What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three thousand\nto pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I haven't the strength\nnow. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm going to Grushenka. I don't care\nwhat happens.\"\n\n\"And what then?\"\n\n\"I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I'll\ngo into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes, blow up their\nsamovar, run their errands.\"\n\n\"Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,\" Alyosha said solemnly. \"She'll\nunderstand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty\nmind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. She'll see that for\nherself.\"\n\n\"She won't forgive everything,\" said Dmitri, with a grin. \"There's\nsomething in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what\nwould be the best thing to do?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Pay back the three thousand.\"\n\n\"Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give you\nanother thousand--that makes three. Take it and pay it back.\"\n\n\"And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not of age,\nbesides, and you must--you absolutely must--take my farewell to her to-day,\nwith the money or without it, for I can't drag on any longer, things have\ncome to such a pass. To-morrow is too late. I shall send you to father.\"\n\n\"To father?\"\n\n\"Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.\"\n\n\"But, Mitya, he won't give it.\"\n\n\"As though he would! I know he won't. Do you know the meaning of despair,\nAlexey?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I've had it all from him, I know\nthat. But morally he owes me something, doesn't he? You know he started\nwith twenty-eight thousand of my mother's money and made a hundred\nthousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eight\nthousand, and he'll draw my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many\nof his sins. For that three thousand--I give you my solemn word--I'll make\nan end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the last\ntime I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God Himself sends him\nthis chance.\"\n\n\"Mitya, he won't give it for anything.\"\n\n\"I know he won't. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. That's not\nall. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps only\nyesterday he found out for the first time _in earnest_ (underline _in\nearnest_) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means to\nmarry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose he's\ngoing to give me money to help to bring that about when he's crazy about\nher himself? And that's not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I\nknow that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of\nthe bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large\nenvelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see\nhow well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: 'To my angel,\nGrushenka, when she will come to me.' He scrawled it himself in silence\nand in secret, and no one knows that the money's there except the valet,\nSmerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now he has been expecting\nGrushenka for the last three or four days; he hopes she'll come for the\nmoney. He has sent her word of it, and she has sent him word that perhaps\nshe'll come. And if she does go to the old man, can I marry her after\nthat? You understand now why I'm here in secret and what I'm on the watch\nfor.\"\n\n\"For her?\"\n\n\"Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Foma\ncomes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He does jobs for\nthem. He's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time; and\nthat's how he lives. I've established myself in his room. Neither he nor\nthe women of the house know the secret--that is, that I am on the watch\nhere.\"\n\n\"No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?\"\n\n\"No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.\"\n\n\"It was he told you about the money, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the money, or\nanything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three\ndays' journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he'll give eight\nthousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him by\ngoing to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That's what the\nold man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he's away.\"\n\n\"Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?\"\n\n\"No, she won't come to-day; there are signs. She's certain not to come,\"\ncried Mitya suddenly. \"Smerdyakov thinks so, too. Father's drinking now.\nHe's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three\nthousand.\"\n\n\"Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?\" cried Alyosha, jumping up from\nhis place, and looking keenly at his brother's frenzied face. For one\nmoment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.\n\n\"What is it? I'm not insane,\" said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestly\nat him. \"No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what I'm saying.\nI believe in miracles.\"\n\n\"In miracles?\"\n\n\"In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my\ndespair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let something awful\nhappen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!\"\n\n\"I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?\"\n\n\"Yes. I know it will take some time. You can't go at him point blank. He's\ndrunk now. I'll wait three hours--four, five, six, seven. Only remember you\nmust go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if it has to be at midnight, _with\nthe money or without the money_, and say, 'He sends his compliments to\nyou.' I want you to say that verse to her: 'He sends his compliments to\nyou.' \"\n\n\"Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day--if not to-day, to-morrow, or\nthe next day?\"\n\n\"Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.\"\n\n\"And if--\"\n\n\"If there's an if, it will be murder. I couldn't endure it.\"\n\n\"Who will be murdered?\"\n\n\"The old man. I shan't kill her.\"\n\n\"Brother, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.... I don't know. Perhaps I shan't kill, and perhaps I\nshall. I'm afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his\nface at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his eyes, his\nshameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of.\nThat's what may be too much for me.\"\n\n\"I'll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best, that\nnothing awful may happen.\"\n\n\"And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn't come to pass--\"\n\nAlyosha went thoughtfully towards his father's house.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. Smerdyakov\n\n\nHe did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a dining-\nroom in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room, which\nwas the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation. The\nfurniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky material.\nIn the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in elaborate white\nand gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with\nwhite paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two large\nportraits--one of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty\nyears before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In the\ncorner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a lamp was\nlighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as to light\nthe room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three or four\no'clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night or sit in\nan arm-chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He often slept\nquite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually\nSmerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.\n\nWhen Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been\nserved. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.\nIvan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory and\nSmerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemed\nin singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter.\nBefore he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so\nwell, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached\nthe good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.\n\n\"Here he is! Here he is!\" yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at\nseeing Alyosha. \"Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it's hot\nand good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping the fast. But would you\nlike some? No; I'd better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov,\ngo to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look\nsharp!\"\n\nAlyosha began refusing the liqueur.\n\n\"Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,\" said Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nbeaming. \"But stay--have you dined?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and\ndrunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen. \"Though I should\nbe pleased to have some hot coffee.\"\n\n\"Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No, it's\nboiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making. My Smerdyakov's an\nartist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You must come\none day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay;\ndidn't I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow\nand all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" said Alyosha, smiling, too.\n\n\"Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren't\nyou? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex you. Do you know,\nIvan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs?\nIt makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond of him. Alyosha, let me give you\nmy blessing--a father's blessing.\"\n\nAlyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"I'll just make the sign of the cross over you, for\nnow. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line, too. It'll\nmake you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us here--and how he\ntalks! How he talks!\"\n\nBalaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young man\nof about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not that he\nwas shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to\ndespise everybody.\n\nBut we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up by\nGrigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up \"with no sense of gratitude,\" as\nGrigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the\nworld mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats,\nand burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as\nthough it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead\ncat as though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the\ngreatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a\nsound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week. \"He\ndoesn't care for you or me, the monster,\" Grigory used to say to Marfa,\n\"and he doesn't care for any one. Are you a human being?\" he said,\naddressing the boy directly. \"You're not a human being. You grew from the\nmildew in the bath-house.(2) That's what you are.\" Smerdyakov, it appeared\nafterwards, could never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to\nread and write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the\nScriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third\nlesson the boy suddenly grinned.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from under\nhis spectacles.\n\n\"Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, and\nstars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?\"\n\nGrigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.\nThere was something positively condescending in his expression. Grigory\ncould not restrain himself. \"I'll show you where!\" he cried, and gave the\nboy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, but\nwithdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he had his\nfirst attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of his\nlife--epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy\nseemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he\nnever scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him.\nSometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy something\nsweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed an\nactive interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the\ndisease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, once\na month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some\nwere light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade\nGrigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to\ncome upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a\ntime, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch\nnoticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the\nglass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books--over a hundred--but no\none ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the\nbookcase. \"Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting\nreading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,\" and Fyodor\nPavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_.\n\nHe read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and ended by\nfrowning.\n\n\"Why? Isn't it funny?\" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\nSmerdyakov did not speak.\n\n\"Answer, stupid!\"\n\n\"It's all untrue,\" mumbled the boy, with a grin.\n\n\"Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, here's\nSmaragdov's _Universal History_. That's all true. Read that.\"\n\nBut Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought it\ndull. So the bookcase was closed again.\n\nShortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that\nSmerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary\nfastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his spoon and look\ninto the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it to\nthe light.\n\n\"What is it? A beetle?\" Grigory would ask.\n\n\"A fly, perhaps,\" observed Marfa.\n\nThe squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread,\nhis meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to the\nlight, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberation\ndecide to put it in his mouth.\n\n\"Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!\" Grigory muttered, looking at him.\n\nWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he\ndetermined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained. He\nspent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance. He\nlooked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had grown wrinkled,\nyellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he seemed almost exactly\nthe same as before he went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not\nthe slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we\nheard afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little\ninterest for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice\nof anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and\ndispleased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow well\ndressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes most\nscrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning his\nsmart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone like\nmirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a\nsalary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade,\nperfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the\nfemale sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them.\nFyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were\nbecoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did\nnot suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.\n\n\"Why are your fits getting worse?\" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking\naskance at his new cook. \"Would you like to get married? Shall I find you\na wife?\"\n\nBut Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor\nPavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that he\nhad absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when Fyodor\nPavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three\nhundred-rouble notes which he had only just received. He only missed them\nnext day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the\nnotes lying on the table. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked\nthem up and brought them in the day before.\n\n\"Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch said\nshortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed in\nhis honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although the\nyoung man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent.\nHe rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what\nthe young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have\nbeen impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop\nsuddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand\nstill for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his face\nwould have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only a\nsort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by the painter\nKramskoy, called \"Contemplation.\" There is a forest in winter, and on a\nroadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a\ntorn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he\nis not thinking; he is \"contemplating.\" If any one touched him he would\nstart and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. It's true he\nwould come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been\nthinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden\nwithin himself, the impression which had dominated him during the period\nof contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards\nthem imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he\ndoes not know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many\nyears, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his\nsoul's salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native\nvillage, and perhaps do both. There are a good many \"contemplatives\" among\nthe peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he probably\nwas greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing why.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The Controversy\n\n\nBut Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one.\nGrigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from the\nshopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared in\nthe newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken prisoner in some\nremote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death\nif he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny\nhis faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and\nglorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor\nPavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk,\nif only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humored\nand expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening to the story, he\nobserved that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and to\ntake his skin to some monastery. \"That would make the people flock, and\nbring the money in.\"\n\nGrigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched,\nbut, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who was\nstanding by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table towards the\nend of dinner, and since Ivan's arrival in our town he had done so every\nday.\n\n\"What are you grinning at?\" asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile\ninstantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.\n\n\"Well, my opinion is,\" Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a\nloud voice, \"that if that laudable soldier's exploit was so very great\nthere would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such an\nemergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his own\nchristening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which, in\nthe course of years to expiate his cowardice.\"\n\n\"How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that you'll go\nstraight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,\" put in Fyodor\nPavlovitch.\n\nIt was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we\nhave seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.\n\n\"We're on your subject, your subject,\" he chuckled gleefully, making\nAlyosha sit down to listen.\n\n\"As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for this, and\nthere shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,\" Smerdyakov\nmaintained stoutly.\n\n\"How do you mean 'according to justice'?\" Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still\nmore gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.\n\n\"He's a rascal, that's what he is!\" burst from Grigory. He looked\nSmerdyakov wrathfully in the face.\n\n\"As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\" answered\nSmerdyakov with perfect composure. \"You'd better consider yourself that,\nonce I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they\ndemand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy\nchristening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there\nwould be no sin in it.\"\n\n\"But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,\" cried Fyodor\nPavlovitch.\n\n\"Soup-maker!\" muttered Grigory contemptuously.\n\n\"As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself,\nGrigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those\nenemies, 'No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my true God,' then at once,\nby God's high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema\naccursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a\nheathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but\nwhen I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am\ncut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?\"\n\nHe addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really\nanswering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware of it, and\nintentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.\n\n\"Ivan,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, \"stoop down for me to whisper.\nHe's got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise him. Praise\nhim.\"\n\nIvan listened with perfect seriousness to his father's excited whisper.\n\n\"Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more.\n\"Ivan, your ear again.\"\n\nIvan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.\n\n\"I love you as I do Alyosha. Don't think I don't love you. Some brandy?\"\n\n\"Yes.--But you're rather drunk yourself,\" thought Ivan, looking steadily at\nhis father.\n\nHe was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.\n\n\"You're anathema accursed, as it is,\" Grigory suddenly burst out, \"and how\ndare you argue, you rascal, after that, if--\"\n\n\"Don't scold him, Grigory, don't scold him,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him\nshort.\n\n\"You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen,\nfor I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I become\naccursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen,\nand my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isn't that\nso?\"\n\n\"Make haste and finish, my boy,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping from\nhis wine-glass with relish.\n\n\"And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy\nwhen they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I had\nalready been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of the\nthought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy. And if I\nhave already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justice\ncan I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for having\ndenied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him I\nhad been relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a Christian, then\nI can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who will hold\nan unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for\nnot having been born a Christian? And who would punish him for that,\nconsidering that you can't take two skins off one ox? For God Almighty\nHimself, even if He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies would\ngive him the smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must be\npunished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the world\nan unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God can't surely take a\nTatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty would\ntell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even\nin one word?\"\n\nGrigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearly\nstarting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what was\nsaid, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a\nman who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied\nhis glass and went off into his shrill laugh.\n\n\"Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must have\nbeen with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who\ntaught you? But you're talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense,\nnonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a\nmoment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you\nhave renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say\nyourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once\nyou're anathema they won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you\nsay to that, my fine Jesuit?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was\nno special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.\"\n\n\"How's that the most ordinary?\"\n\n\"You lie, accursed one!\" hissed Grigory.\n\n\"Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\" Smerdyakov went on, staid and\nunruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to the\nvanquished foe. \"Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in\nthe Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a\nmountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your\nbidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I'm without faith and you have so\ngreat a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself\ntelling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that's a long way off,\nbut even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the\ngarden. You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just\nwhere it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory\nVassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only abuse\nothers about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day,\nnot only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest\npeasant, can shove mountains into the sea--except perhaps some one man in\nthe world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls\nin secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them--if\nso it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that\nis, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the\ndesert, and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And\nso I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven\nif I shed tears of repentance.\"\n\n\"Stay!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \"So you do\nsuppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it,\nwrite it down. There you have the Russian all over!\"\n\n\"You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's faith,\"\nIvan assented, with an approving smile.\n\n\"You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it,\nAlyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\" said Alyosha firmly and\ngravely.\n\n\"I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only\nthat idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's purely Russian,\" said Alyosha smiling.\n\n\"Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you to-day.\nBut as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you,\nstupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness,\nbecause we haven't time; things are too much for us, and, in the second\nplace, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours in\nthe day, so that one hasn't even time to get sleep enough, much less to\nrepent of one's sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies\nwhen you'd nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I\nconsider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\"\n\n\"Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\nthat it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then\nin very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been\nsinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the\npagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn't have come to torture\nthen, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the\nmountain, 'Move and crush the tormentor,' and it would have moved and at\nthe very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have\nwalked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.\nBut, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that\nmountain, 'Crush these tormentors,' and it hadn't crushed them, how could\nI have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of\nmortal terror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not\nattain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain\nhad not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up\naloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to\ncome). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no\ngood purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back,\neven then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry. And\nat such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose\none's reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all.\nAnd, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my\nadvantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin. And\nso trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that\nI might be altogether forgiven.\"\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. Over The Brandy\n\n\nThe controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had\nbeen so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy, and it\nwas already a glass too much.\n\n\"Get along with you, Jesuits!\" he cried to the servants. \"Go away,\nSmerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but be\noff! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort you and put you to\nbed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after dinner,\" he snapped\npeevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.\n\n\"Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's you he's so\ninterested in. What have you done to fascinate him?\" he added to Ivan.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" answered Ivan. \"He's pleased to have a high opinion of\nme; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution, however,\nwhen the time comes.\"\n\n\"For revolution?\"\n\n\"There will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him as\nwell. His kind will come first, and better ones after.\"\n\n\"And when will the time come?\"\n\n\"The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not very\nfond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.\"\n\n\"Ah, brother, but a Balaam's ass like that thinks and thinks, and the\ndevil knows where he gets to.\"\n\n\"He's storing up ideas,\" said Ivan, smiling.\n\n\"You see, I know he can't bear me, nor any one else, even you, though you\nfancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha, he\ndespises Alyosha. But he doesn't steal, that's one thing, and he's not a\ngossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn't wash our dirty linen in public.\nHe makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth talking\nabout so much?\"\n\n\"Of course he isn't.\"\n\n\"And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant, generally\nspeaking, needs thrashing. That I've always maintained. Our peasants are\nswindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and it's a good thing they're\nstill flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed the\nforests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people.\nWe've left off thrashing the peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go\non thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. 'For with what measure ye\nmete it shall be measured to you again,' or how does it go? Anyhow, it\nwill be measured. But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you only knew\nhow I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice! But maybe I\nmean Russia. _Tout cela c'est de la cochonnerie_.... Do you know what I\nlike? I like wit.\"\n\n\"You've had another glass. That's enough.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit. I'll have one more, and then another, and then I'll stop. No,\nstay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and he\ntold me: 'There's nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to be\nthrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And the\ngirl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in marriage to-morrow.\nSo it quite suits the girls, too,' he said. There's a set of de Sades for\nyou! But it's clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh?\nAlyosha, are you blushing? Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't\nstay to dinner at the Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at\nMokroe. Alyosha, don't be angry that I offended your Superior this\nmorning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, of\ncourse, I'm to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if there\nisn't a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's not enough to\ncut their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it,\nIvan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you don't believe it as I see\nfrom your eyes. You believe what people say, that I'm nothing but a\nbuffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that I'm nothing but a buffoon?\"\n\n\"No, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"And I believe you don't, and that you speak the truth. You look sincere\nand you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan's supercilious.... I'd make an\nend of your monks, though, all the same. I'd take all that mystic stuff\nand suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all the\nfools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into the\nmint!\"\n\n\"But why suppress it?\" asked Ivan.\n\n\"That Truth may prevail. That's why.\"\n\n\"Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you'd be the first to be robbed\nand suppressed.\"\n\n\"Ah! I dare say you're right. Ah, I'm an ass!\" burst out Fyodor\nPavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. \"Well, your\nmonastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that's how it is. And we clever\npeople will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have\nbeen so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God or\nnot? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?\"\n\n\"I'm laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about\nSmerdyakov's belief in the existence of two saints who could move\nmountains.\"\n\n\"Why, am I like him now, then?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Well, that shows I'm a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.\nAnd you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall\nI catch you? What do you bet that I'll catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the\nsame, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious\nnow.\"\n\n\"No, there is no God.\"\n\n\"Alyosha, is there a God?\"\n\n\"There is.\"\n\n\"Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny\nbit?\"\n\n\"There is no immortality either.\"\n\n\"None at all?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"There's absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?\nAnything is better than nothing!\"\n\n\"Absolute nothingness.\"\n\n\"Alyosha, is there immortality?\"\n\n\"There is.\"\n\n\"God and immortality?\"\n\n\"God and immortality. In God is immortality.\"\n\n\"H'm! It's more likely Ivan's right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what\nforce of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for\nhow many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last\ntime, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!\"\n\n\"And for the last time there is not.\"\n\n\"Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?\"\n\n\"It must be the devil,\" said Ivan, smiling.\n\n\"And the devil? Does he exist?\"\n\n\"No, there's no devil either.\"\n\n\"It's a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn't I do to the man who first\ninvented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for him.\"\n\n\"There would have been no civilization if they hadn't invented God.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't there have been? Without God?\"\n\n\"No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take your\nbrandy away from you, anyway.\"\n\n\"Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I've hurt Alyosha's\nfeelings. You're not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!\"\n\n\"No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than your\nhead.\"\n\n\"My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you. Ivan,\ndo you love Alyosha?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You must love him\" (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk).\n\"Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was\nexcited. But there's wit in that elder, don't you think, Ivan?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"There is, there is. _Il y a du Piron la-dedans._ He's a Jesuit, a Russian\none, that is. As he's an honorable person there's a hidden indignation\nboiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.\"\n\n\"But, of course, he believes in God.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Didn't you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.\nThat is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He said\nstraight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: '_Credo_, but I don't know\nin what.' \"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"He really did. But I respect him. There's something of Mephistopheles\nabout him, or rather of 'The hero of our time' ... Arbenin, or what's his\nname?... You see, he's a sensualist. He's such a sensualist that I should\nbe afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. You\nknow, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last he invited\nus to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began\ntelling us about old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially\nhow he once cured a paralyzed woman. 'If my legs were not bad I know a\ndance I could dance you,' he said. What do you say to that? 'I've plenty\nof tricks in my time,' said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant, out of\nsixty thousand.\"\n\n\"What, he stole it?\"\n\n\"He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, 'Take care of\nit for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my place to-morrow.' And\nhe kept it. 'You have given it to the Church,' he declared. I said to him:\n'You're a scoundrel,' I said. 'No,' said he, 'I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm\nbroad-minded.' But that wasn't he, that was some one else. I've muddled\nhim with some one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and\nthat's enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why\ndidn't you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?\"\n\n\"I knew you'd stop of yourself.\"\n\n\"That's a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You\ndespise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy.\"\n\n\"I've begged you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two,\nand you don't go.\"\n\n\"I'll go to-morrow if you're so set upon it.\"\n\n\"You won't go. You want to keep an eye on me. That's what you want,\nspiteful fellow. That's why you won't go.\"\n\nThe old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when the\ndrunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to\nassert himself.\n\n\"Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at\nme and say, 'You ugly drunkard!' Your eyes are mistrustful. They're\ncontemptuous.... You've come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looks\nat me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't\nlove Ivan.\"\n\n\"Don't be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,\" Alyosha\nsaid emphatically.\n\n\"Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It's the\nthird time I've told you.\"\n\nHe mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.\n\n\"Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't love me, but\ndon't be angry all the same. You've nothing to love me for. You go to\nTchermashnya. I'll come to you myself and bring you a present. I'll show\nyou a little wench there. I've had my eye on her a long time. She's still\nrunning about bare-foot. Don't be afraid of bare-footed wenches--don't\ndespise them--they're pearls!\"\n\nAnd he kissed his hand with a smack.\n\n\"To my thinking,\" he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant he\ntouched on his favorite topic. \"To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You\nchildren, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a woman\nugly in my life--that's been my rule! Can you understand that? How could\nyou understand it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of\nyour shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something\ndevilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find in any other.\nOnly, one must know how to find it, that's the point! That's a talent! To\nmy mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she is a woman is half\nthe battle ... but how could you understand that? Even in _vieilles\nfilles_, even in them you may discover something that makes you simply\nwonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without\nnoticing them. Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by\nsurprise. Didn't you know that? You must astound them till they're\nfascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with\nsuch a little slut. It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will\nbe masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little maid-\nof-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's needed for\nhappiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your\nmother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her at all, but all\nat once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion to her, crawl on my\nknees, kiss her feet, and I always, always--I remember it as though it were\nto-day--reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh.\nIt was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that.\nThe next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh\nwas not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That's\nthe great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky--he was a\nhandsome fellow, and rich--used to like to come here and hang about\nher--suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence. And she--such a\nmild sheep--why, I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow.\nHow she set on me! 'You're beaten, beaten now,' she said. 'You've taken a\nblow from him. You have been trying to sell me to him,' she said.... 'And\nhow dared he strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me again,\nnever, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!'... I took her to the\nmonastery then to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her\nback to reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor\ncrazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fond\nof praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used\nto turn me out of her room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her,\nthought I! 'Here,' said I, 'you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I\ntake it down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it\ndirectly and nothing will happen to me for it!'... When she saw it, good\nLord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her\nhands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and\nfell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what's the\nmatter?\"\n\nThe old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about\nhis mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha's face. He flushed\ncrimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone\nspluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very\nstrange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy\nwoman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat\nexactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face\nin them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical\nparoxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance\nto his mother particularly impressed the old man.\n\n\"Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used to be\nthen, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that's what I\nused to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his mother,\" he muttered\nto Ivan.\n\n\"But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?\" said\nIvan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his\nflashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a\nsecond; it seemed really to have escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's\nmother actually was the mother of Ivan too.\n\n\"Your mother?\" he muttered, not understanding. \"What do you mean? What\nmother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was\nyours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me,\nwhy, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!\" He stopped. A broad, drunken,\nhalf-senseless grin overspread his face.\n\nAt that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there\nwere violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the\nroom. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.\n\n\"He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let him get at me!\" he screamed,\nclinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.\n\n\n\nChapter IX. The Sensualists\n\n\nGrigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been\nstruggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on\ninstructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking\nadvantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to\nlook about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on\nthe opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood\nbefore the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the\nentrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,\nDmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.\n\n\"Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\"\n\nHe tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside\nhimself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might.\nThe old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the\ndoor. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room,\nhuddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\n\"She's here!\" shouted Dmitri. \"I saw her turn towards the house just now,\nbut I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\"\n\nThat shout, \"She's here!\" produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor\nPavlovitch. All his terror left him.\n\n\"Hold him! Hold him!\" he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory\nhad got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran\nafter their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the\nfloor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase--not an expensive\none--on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.\n\n\"At him!\" shouted the old man. \"Help!\"\n\nIvan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back.\n\n\"Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright,\" Ivan cried\nwrathfully at his father.\n\n\"Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He said he saw her\nhimself, running.\"\n\nHe was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden\nnews that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling all over.\nHe seemed frantic.\n\n\"But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come,\" cried Ivan.\n\n\"But she may have come by that other entrance.\"\n\n\"You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\"\n\nDmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of course, found\nthe other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch's\npocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could\nnot have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.\n\n\"Hold him!\" shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \"He's\nbeen stealing money in my bedroom.\" And tearing himself from Ivan he\nrushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly\nclutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his\ntemples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He\nkicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man\nmoaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round\nhim, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his\nslender strength, holding Dmitri in front.\n\n\"Madman! You've killed him!\" cried Ivan.\n\n\"Serve him right!\" shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \"If I haven't killed him,\nI'll come again and kill him. You can't protect him!\"\n\n\"Dmitri! Go away at once!\" cried Alyosha commandingly.\n\n\"Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here just now,\nor not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. I\nshouted, she ran away.\"\n\n\"I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her.\"\n\n\"But I saw her.... So she must ... I'll find out at once where she is....\nGood-by, Alexey! Not a word to AEsop about the money now. But go to\nKaterina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, 'He sends his compliments to\nyou!' Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and farewell!\nDescribe the scene to her.\"\n\nMeanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an\narm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious and\nlistened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still fancying that Grushenka\nreally was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he\nwent out.\n\n\"I don't repent shedding your blood!\" he cried. \"Beware, old man, beware\nof your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown you\naltogether.\"\n\nHe ran out of the room.\n\n\"She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!\" the old man\nwheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.\n\n\"No, she's not here, you old lunatic!\" Ivan shouted at him angrily. \"Here,\nhe's fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!\"\n\nSmerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and put\nhim to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by the\nbrandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he shut his\neyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Ivan and\nAlyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of\nthe broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the\nfloor.\n\n\"Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?\" Alyosha\nsaid to him. \"We'll look after him. My brother gave you a terrible blow--on\nthe head.\"\n\n\"He's insulted me!\" Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.\n\n\"He's 'insulted' his father, not only you,\" observed Ivan with a forced\nsmile.\n\n\"I used to wash him in his tub. He's insulted me,\" repeated Grigory.\n\n\"Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have murdered him.\nIt wouldn't take much to do for AEsop, would it?\" whispered Ivan to\nAlyosha.\n\n\"God forbid!\" cried Alyosha.\n\n\"Why should He forbid?\" Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignant\ngrimace. \"One reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right,\ntoo.\"\n\nAlyosha shuddered.\n\n\"Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now. Stay here,\nAlyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun to ache.\"\n\nAlyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the\nscreen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed\nfor a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at\nonce his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.\n\n\"Alyosha,\" he whispered apprehensively, \"where's Ivan?\"\n\n\"In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch.\"\n\n\"Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.\"\n\nAlyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the\nchest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was\nconsiderably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a\nrather large crimson bruise.\n\n\"What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm afraid of Ivan.\nI'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're the only one I'm not afraid\nof....\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend you.\"\n\n\"Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me\nthe truth, was she here just now or not?\"\n\n\"No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.\"\n\n\"You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.\"\n\n\"She won't marry him.\"\n\n\"She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!\"\n\nThe old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting\ncould have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyosha's hand and\npressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes.\n\n\"That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,\" he\nsaid. \"Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll let you go back to\nthe monastery.... I was joking this morning, don't be angry with me. My\nhead aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me\nthe truth!\"\n\n\"You're still asking whether she has been here or not?\" Alyosha said\nsorrowfully.\n\n\"No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to Grushenka\nyourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for yourself,\nwhich she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?\"\n\n\"If I see her I'll ask her,\" Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.\n\n\"No, she won't tell you,\" the old man interrupted, \"she's a rogue. She'll\nbegin kissing you and say that it's you she wants. She's a deceitful,\nshameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you mustn't!\"\n\n\"No, father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right at all.\"\n\n\"Where was he sending you just now? He shouted 'Go' as he ran away.\"\n\n\"To Katerina Ivanovna.\"\n\n\"For money? To ask her for money?\"\n\n\"No. Not for money.\"\n\n\"He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night, and think\nthings over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet her.... Only be sure to\ncome to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word to say to\nyou to-morrow. Will you come?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask after me.\nDon't tell any one I told you to. Don't say a word to Ivan.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forget\nit. I've a word to say to you to-morrow--but I must think about it.\"\n\n\"And how do you feel now?\"\n\n\"I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!\"\n\nCrossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway.\nHe was sitting writing something in pencil in his note-book. Alyosha told\nIvan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him go\nback to sleep at the monastery.\n\n\"Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,\" said Ivan\ncordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.\n\n\"I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,\" answered Alyosha, \"I may be at\nKaterina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now.\"\n\n\"But you're going to her now, anyway? For that 'compliments and\nfarewell,' \" said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.\n\n\"I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what\nwent before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he--well, in\nfact--takes his leave of her?\"\n\n\"Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?\"\nexclaimed Alyosha.\n\n\"One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.\nThat woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and\nnot let Dmitri in the house.\"\n\n\"Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other\nmen and decide which is worthy to live?\"\n\n\"Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in\nmen's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights--who has\nnot the right to wish?\"\n\n\"Not for another man's death?\"\n\n\"What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since all men\nlive so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I\nsaid just now--that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let me\nask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding AEsop's blood,\nmurdering him, eh?\"\n\n\"What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don't\nthink Dmitri is capable of it, either.\"\n\n\"Thanks, if only for that,\" smiled Ivan. \"Be sure, I should always defend\nhim. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good-by\ntill to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't look on me as a villain,\" he\nadded with a smile.\n\nThey shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt that\nhis brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had\ncertainly done this with some definite motive.\n\n\n\nChapter X. Both Together\n\n\nAlyosha left his father's house feeling even more exhausted and dejected\nin spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and\nunhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed\nfragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting\nexperiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he\nhad never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest\nstood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his\nfather and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself\nbeen a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet\nonly his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely\nunhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there were\nother people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed\nbefore. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had\nmade a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring.\nYet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these\nwomen? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's\nin the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the\ncontrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from\nher. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than\nbefore. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and\nDmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to\nany depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the\nscene which had just taken place with his father.\n\nIt was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered\nthe very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by\nKaterina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One of\nthem, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half-sister Agafya\nIvanovna who had looked after her in her father's house when she came from\nboarding-school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and\nconsequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they\nboth gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept\nthem with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one\nbut her benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept by illness in\nMoscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account\nof all her doings.\n\nWhen Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to\nhim to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware of\nhis arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least,\nAlyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling\nskirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.\n\nAlyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement.\nHe was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room,\nelegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style. There were\nmany sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. There were pictures\non the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even\nan aquarium in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made\nout a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just\nbeen sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups\nof chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another with\nsweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. But\nat that instant the portiere was raised, and with rapid, hurrying\nfootsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha\nwith a radiant smile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in\ntwo lighted candles and set them on the table.\n\n\"Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply praying for you\nall day! Sit down.\"\n\nAlyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when, three weeks\nbefore, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna's special\nrequest, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation between\nthem at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very shy,\nKaterina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha\nhad been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck\nby the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl.\nAnd all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He\nthought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her\npale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the lines\nof her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might\nwell be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for\nlong. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the\nvisit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his\nimpressions on seeing his betrothed.\n\n\"You'll be happy with her, but perhaps--not tranquilly happy.\"\n\n\"Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don't yield\nto fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.\"\n\n\"No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won't always be\nhappy with her.\"\n\nAlyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with\nhimself for having yielded to his brother's entreaties and put such\n\"foolish\" ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfully\nfoolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of having\ngiven so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the more\namazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as\nshe ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This time\nher face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct\nwarm-hearted sincerity. The \"pride and haughtiness,\" which had struck\nAlyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy\nand a sort of bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the\nfirst glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in\nrelation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she\nperhaps already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite\nof that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future.\nAlyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. He\nwas conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed at\nher first words that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps\nquite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.\n\n\"I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole\ntruth--from you and no one else.\"\n\n\"I have come,\" muttered Alyosha confusedly, \"I--he sent me.\"\n\n\"Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything--everything!\" cried\nKaterina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. \"Wait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\nI'll tell you why I've been so longing to see you. You see, I know perhaps\nfar more than you do yourself, and there's no need for you to tell me\nanything. I'll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own last\nimpression of him. I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely\neven (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and\nof his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps be\nbetter than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does not want\nto come to me. Do you understand what I want from you? Now, tell me\nsimply, tell me every word of the message he sent you with (I knew he\nwould send you).\"\n\n\"He told me to give you his compliments--and to say that he would never\ncome again--but to give you his compliments.\"\n\n\"His compliments? Was that what he said--his own expression?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did not\nuse the right word?\"\n\n\"No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or three\ntimes not to forget to say so.\"\n\nKaterina Ivanovna flushed hotly.\n\n\"Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I'll tell\nyou what I think, and you must simply say whether it's right or not.\nListen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without insisting on\nyour repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the end\nof everything! But if he particularly insisted on those words, if he\nparticularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he\nwas in excitement, beside himself. He had made his decision and was\nfrightened at it. He wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but\nleaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply\nbravado.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried Alyosha warmly. \"I believe that is it.\"\n\n\"And, if so, he's not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! Did he\nnot tell you anything about money--about three thousand roubles?\"\n\n\"He did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's crushing\nhim. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now,\" Alyosha\nanswered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that\nthere really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother. \"But\ndo you know about the money?\" he added, and suddenly broke off.\n\n\"I've known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and\nheard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadn't sent the money,\nbut I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money.\nMy only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn, and\nwho was his true friend. No, he won't recognize that I am his truest\nfriend; he won't know me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I've been\ntormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being\nashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel\nashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people's knowing, but not\nof my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it he\nstill does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why,\nwhy doesn't he know me? How dare he not know me after all that has\nhappened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed.\nAnd here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn't afraid\nto be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don't deserve\nthe same?\"\n\nThe last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.\n\n\"I must tell you,\" Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, \"what happened\njust now between him and my father.\"\n\nAnd he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the\nmoney, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that had\nagain specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and\nfarewell. \"He went to that woman,\" Alyosha added softly.\n\n\"And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman? Does he think I\ncan't? But he won't marry her,\" she suddenly laughed nervously. \"Could\nsuch a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? It's passion, not love. He\nwon't marry her because she won't marry him.\" Again Katerina Ivanovna\nlaughed strangely.\n\n\"He may marry her,\" said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.\n\n\"He won't marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that?\nDo you know that?\" Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary\nwarmth. \"She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I know\nhow bewitching she is, but I know too that she is kind, firm and noble.\nWhy do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are\nwondering at my words, perhaps you don't believe me? Agrafena\nAlexandrovna, my angel!\" she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the\nnext room, \"come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He knows all\nabout our affairs. Show yourself to him.\"\n\n\"I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,\" said a\nsoft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.\n\nThe portiere was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, came\nup to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed his\neyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful woman,\nthe \"beast,\" as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet one would\nhave thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, a\ngood-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsome\nordinary women! It is true she was very, very good-looking with that\nRussian beauty so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall\nwoman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was\nexceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were,\nnoiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her\nvoice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step,\nbut noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She sank\nsoftly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress,\nand delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a\ncostly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and her face looked\nexactly that age. She was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint on\nher cheeks. The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and\nthe lower jaw was set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the\nslightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked\npouting. But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored\neyebrows and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have\nmade the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the\nstreet, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. What\nstruck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good\nnature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childish\ndelight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to\nexpect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. The\nlight in her eyes gladdened the soul--Alyosha felt that. There was\nsomething else in her which he could not understand, or would not have\nbeen able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. It\nwas that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that\ncatlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl\ncould be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her\nfigure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in\nsomewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs of\nRussian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, still\nyouthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, would\n\"spread\"; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would very\nsoon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes; the complexion would\ngrow coarse and red perhaps--in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment,\nthe fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women. Alyosha,\nof course, did not think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he\nwondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she\ndrawled in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently\nfeeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the\nsyllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad\neducation and a false idea of good manners. And yet this intonation and\nmanner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with\nthe childishly simple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyish\njoy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an arm-\nchair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on her\nsmiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.\n\n\"This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" she said\nrapturously. \"I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her, but\nI'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I knew we should\nsettle everything together--everything. My heart told me so--I was begged\nnot to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the\ndifficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything to\nme, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness\nand brought us peace and joy.\"\n\n\"You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,\" drawled Grushenka\nin her sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.\n\n\"Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain\nyou! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though it\nwere swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how she\nlaughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one's heart good to see the angel.\"\n\nAlyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.\n\n\"You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all\nworthy of your kindness.\"\n\n\"Not worthy! She's not worthy of it!\" Katerina Ivanovna cried again with\nthe same warmth. \"You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we're fanciful, we're\nself-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. We're noble,\nwe're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only been\nunfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy,\nperhaps, or fickle man. There was one man--one, an officer too, we loved\nhim, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago,\nand he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has\nwritten, he is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him, none but\nhim, all this time, and we've loved him all our life! He will come, and\nGrushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she's been\nwretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her favor? Only that\nbedridden old merchant, but he is more like her father, her friend, her\nprotector. He found her then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man she\nloved. She was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant saved\nher--saved her!\"\n\n\"You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurry\nabout everything,\" Grushenka drawled again.\n\n\"Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?\nGrushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little\nhand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and has\nlifted me up, and I'm going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here,\nhere!\"\n\nAnd three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, hand\nof Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a charming\nmusical, nervous little laugh, watched the \"sweet young lady,\" and\nobviously liked having her hand kissed.\n\n\"Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,\" thought Alyosha. He blushed. He\nfelt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.\n\n\"You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this\nbefore Alexey Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"Do you think I meant to make you blush?\" said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhat\nsurprised. \"Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!\"\n\n\"Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady. Maybe\nI'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart; I will have my own\nway. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.\"\n\n\"But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll explain it all\nto him. You'll break to him that you have long loved another man, who is\nnow offering you his hand.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking\nabout that. I didn't give you my word.\"\n\n\"Then I didn't quite understand you,\" said Katerina Ivanovna slowly,\nturning a little pale. \"You promised--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,\" Grushenka interrupted softly\nand evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. \"You see at\nonce, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If I\nwant to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise just now. But\nnow again I'm thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much\nonce--liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him\nto stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.\"\n\n\"Just now you said--something quite different,\" Katerina Ivanovna whispered\nfaintly.\n\n\"Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly creature.\nOnly think what he's gone through on my account! What if when I go home I\nfeel sorry for him? What then?\"\n\n\"I never expected--\"\n\n\"Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now\nperhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now you know my\ncharacter. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,\" she said\ntenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna's hand.\n\n\"Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine.\nYou kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times\nto be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as God\nwills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding\nlike a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises.\nWhat a sweet hand--what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you\nincredible beauty!\"\n\nShe slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed of\n\"being even\" with her in kisses.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid hope\nto the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her bidding like a\nslave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her eyes; she\nstill saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, the\nsame bright gayety.\n\n\"She's perhaps too naive,\" thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of\nhope.\n\nGrushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the \"sweet hand.\" She raised\nit deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes near\nher lips, as though reconsidering something.\n\n\"Do you know, angel lady,\" she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and\nsugary voice, \"do you know, after all, I think I won't kiss your hand?\"\nAnd she laughed a little merry laugh.\n\n\"As you please. What's the matter with you?\" said Katerina Ivanovna,\nstarting suddenly.\n\n\"So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn't\nkiss yours.\"\n\nThere was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness at\nKaterina Ivanovna.\n\n\"Insolent creature!\" cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping\nsomething. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.\n\nGrushenka too got up, but without haste.\n\n\"So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss yours at\nall. And how he will laugh!\"\n\n\"Vile slut! Go away!\"\n\n\"Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming for you, dear\nyoung lady, a word like that.\"\n\n\"Go away! You're a creature for sale!\" screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every\nfeature was working in her utterly distorted face.\n\n\"For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once;\nyou brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.\"\n\nKaterina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha held\nher with all his strength.\n\n\"Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll go\naway--she'll go at once.\"\n\nAt that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry, and with\nthem a maid-servant. All hurried to her.\n\n\"I will go away,\" said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa.\n\"Alyosha, darling, see me home!\"\n\n\"Go away--go away, make haste!\" cried Alyosha, clasping his hands\nimploringly.\n\n\"Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story to tell\nyou on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See me\nhome, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards.\"\n\nAlyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house,\nlaughing musically.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shaken\nwith convulsions. Every one fussed round her.\n\n\"I warned you,\" said the elder of her aunts. \"I tried to prevent your\ndoing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You don't\nknow these creatures, and they say she's worse than any of them. You are\ntoo self-willed.\"\n\n\"She's a tigress!\" yelled Katerina Ivanovna. \"Why did you hold me, Alexey\nFyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her--beaten her!\"\n\nShe could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care to,\nindeed.\n\n\"She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!\"\n\nAlyosha withdrew towards the door.\n\n\"But, my God!\" cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. \"He! He! He\ncould be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature what\nhappened on that fatal, accursed day! 'You brought your beauty for sale,\ndear young lady.' She knows it! Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey\nFyodorovitch.\"\n\nAlyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word. His heart\nached.\n\n\"Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for me! To-\nmorrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't condemn me. Forgive\nme. I don't know what I shall do with myself now!\"\n\nAlyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she did.\nSuddenly he was overtaken by the maid.\n\n\"The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; it's\nbeen left with us since dinner-time.\"\n\nAlyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost\nunconsciously, into his pocket.\n\n\n\nChapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined\n\n\nIt was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the\nmonastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.\nIt was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces\nahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under a\nsolitary willow at the cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-\nroads the figure moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:\n\n\"Your money or your life!\"\n\n\"So it's you, Mitya,\" cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled\nhowever.\n\n\"Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By her\nhouse? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At last\nI thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here, there's no other way\nto the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But\nwhat's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, brother--it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father's blood\njust now.\" (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of tears for a\nlong time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.) \"You almost\nkilled him--cursed him--and now--here--you're making jokes--'Your money or your\nlife!' \"\n\n\"Well, what of that? It's not seemly--is that it? Not suitable in my\nposition?\"\n\n\"No--I only--\"\n\n\"Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what a\nwind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as God's\nabove, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is there\nto wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist\nthem into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdening\nthe earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then I heard you\ncoming--Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So\nthere is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little\nbrother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I love\nin the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment that I\nthought, 'I'll fall on his neck at once.' Then a stupid idea struck me, to\nhave a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a fool, 'Your money!'\nForgive my foolery--it was only nonsense, and there's nothing unseemly in\nmy soul.... Damn it all, tell me what's happened. What did she say? Strike\nme, crush me, don't spare me! Was she furious?\"\n\n\"No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There--I found them\nboth there.\"\n\n\"Both? Whom?\"\n\n\"Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's.\"\n\nDmitri was struck dumb.\n\n\"Impossible!\" he cried. \"You're raving! Grushenka with her?\"\n\nAlyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to\nKaterina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his story. He can't be\nsaid to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make it\nclear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly\ndescribing, often in one word, his own sensations. Dmitri listened in\nsilence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to\nAlyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as the\nstory went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He\nscowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more\nrigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible\nrapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips\nparted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous\nlaughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he could not\nspeak.\n\n\"So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she ran away!\"\nhe kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might have\nbeen called, if it had not been so spontaneous. \"So the other one called\nher tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be flogged on a\nscaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That's just what I think; she ought to\nhave been long ago. It's like this, brother, let her be punished, but I\nmust get better first. I understand the queen of impudence. That's her all\nover! You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's\nmagnificent in her own line! So she ran home? I'll go--ah--I'll run to her!\nAlyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.\"\n\n\"But Katerina Ivanovna!\" exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.\n\n\"I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done before! It's\na regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is, of the\nfive! What a thing to do! That's just like Katya, who was not afraid to\nface a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generous\nimpulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness, the defiance\nof fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? That\naunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. She's the sister of the general's\nwidow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband was\ncaught stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all,\nand the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn't raised them since.\nSo she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to her! She thinks\nshe can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She\nthought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it\nherself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think\nshe kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she\nreally was fascinated by Grushenka, that's to say, not by Grushenka, but\nby her own dream, her own delusion--because it was _her_ dream, _her_\ndelusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did\nyou pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted Katerina\nIvanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face\njust now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty!\nBrother, what could be worse than that insult?\"\n\nWhat worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed,\nhis brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's humiliation.\n\n\"Bah!\" Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. He\nonly now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, and\nKaterina Ivanovna's cry: \"Your brother is a scoundrel!\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that 'fatal day,' as\nKatya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at\nMokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I was\nsobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's image, and Grushenka\nunderstood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she cried\nherself.... Damn it all! But it's bound to be so now.... Then she cried,\nbut now 'the dagger in the heart'! That's how women are.\"\n\nHe looked down and sank into thought.\n\n\"Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!\" he said suddenly, in a\ngloomy voice. \"It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm a scoundrel!\nTell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort. Come, that's enough.\nGood-by. It's no use talking! It's not amusing. You go your way and I\nmine. And I don't want to see you again except as a last resource. Good-\nby, Alexey!\"\n\nHe warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without raising\nhis head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.\n\nAlyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so abruptly.\n\n\"Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!\" cried Dmitri, suddenly\nturning back. \"Look at me. Look at me well. You see here, here--there's\nterrible disgrace in store for me.\" (As he said \"here,\" Dmitri struck his\nchest with his fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor lay\nprecisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging\nround his neck.) \"You know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but\nlet me tell you that I've never done anything before and never shall\nagain, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which I\nbear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to\npass, though I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it\nthrough, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I\nshan't stop it. I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you\nthis, because even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if\nI do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I\nshan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witness\nthat I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need to\nexplain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and the she-\ndevil. Good-by. Don't pray for me, I'm not worth it. And there's no need,\nno need at all.... I don't need it! Away!\"\n\nAnd he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the\nmonastery.\n\n\"What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?\" he wondered\nwildly. \"Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall look him up. I\nshall make a point of it. What does he mean?\"\n\n                  -------------------------------------\n\nHe went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage.\nThe door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at that hour. There\nwas a tremor in his heart as he went into Father Zossima's cell.\n\n\"Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here was\npeace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was darkness in\nwhich one lost one's way and went astray at once....\"\n\nIn the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Paissy, who came every\nhour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm that he\nwas getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the brothers\ncould not take place that day. As a rule every evening after service the\nmonks flocked into Father Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their\nsins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their\ndisputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder\nabsolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed\nthem. It was against this general \"confession\" that the opponents of\n\"elders\" protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament\nof confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different\nthing. They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such\nconfessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led to\nsin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, and\nwent against their own will because every one went, and for fear they\nshould be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some of\nthe monks agreed beforehand, saying, \"I'll confess I lost my temper with\nyou this morning, and you confirm it,\" simply in order to have something\nto say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too,\nthat there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that\nletters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened\nand read by him before those to whom they were addressed.\n\nIt was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good\nfaith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact,\nthere was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and\nstrained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks\nadhered to their opinion, arguing that \"for those who have come within\nthese walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will\ncertainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who\nfind it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in\nentering the monastery--their proper place is in the world. Even in the\ntemple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no good taking\nit too much into account.\"\n\n\"He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,\" Father Paissy whispered to\nAlyosha, as he blessed him. \"It's difficult to rouse him. And he must not\nbe roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to the\nbrothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to take\nthe sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He asked\nwhether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the town. 'I\nblessed him for that work,' he said, 'his place is there, not here, for\nawhile.' Those were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with\nanxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it that he has\ndecided that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseen\nsomething in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return to the\nworld, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not for\nfrivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.\"\n\nFather Paissy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was\ndying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly and\nardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, the\nHohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery next\nday, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed with\nlove, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one\ninstant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed,\nand whom he honored above every one in the world. He went into Father\nZossima's bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder,\nwho slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing\nand a peaceful face.\n\nAlyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received his\nguests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the hard,\nnarrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing nothing\nbut a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted to him that\nmorning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his cassock, which\nhe used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell on his knees and\nprayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to\nlighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which\nalways visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which his\nevening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him light\nuntroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the\nlittle pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina\nIvanovna's. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some\nhesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by\nLise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him before\nthe elder in the morning.\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" she wrote, \"I am writing to you without any one's\nknowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot live\nwithout telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and this\nno one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want so\nmuch to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you it's\nnot true and that it's blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha,\nI love you, I've loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when\nyou were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my\nlife. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together\ntill our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the\nmonastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. By\nthat time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking and\ndancing. There can be no doubt of that.\n\n\"You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing I can't\nimagine: what you'll think of me when you read this. I'm always laughing\nand being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure you before\nI took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and now\nI'm praying, and almost crying.\n\n\"My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't know how I\nshall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can't restrain\nmyself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day. You'll\nthink I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won't believe my letter.\nAnd so I beg you, dear one, if you've any pity for me, when you come to-\nmorrow, don't look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it\nwill be sure to make me laugh, especially as you'll be in that long gown.\nI feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, don't look at\nme at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....\n\n\"Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha,\ndon't despise me, and if I've done something very horrid and wounded you,\nforgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is\nin your hands.\n\n\"I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our _awful_\nmeeting.--LISE.\n\n\"P.S.--Alyosha! You must, must, must come!--LISE.\"\n\nAlyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought a\nlittle, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That laugh\nseemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as softly\nand happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himself\nand lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at once. \"God, have mercy\nupon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy\nkeeping, and set them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them\naccording to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!\"\nAlyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nBook IV. Lacerations\n\n\n\nChapter I. Father Ferapont\n\n\nAlyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up feeling\nvery weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair. His\nmind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright and almost\njoyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality. \"Maybe I\nshall not live through the coming day,\" he said to Alyosha. Then he\ndesired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to\nFather Paissy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction\nfollowed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the\ninmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began coming\nfrom the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kiss\nand take leave of every one. As the cell was so small the earlier visitors\nwithdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was\nseated again in his arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his\nvoice was weak, it was fairly steady.\n\n\"I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been talking\naloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of talking, and so much\nso that it's almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk,\neven now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,\" he jested,\nlooking with emotion at the group round him.\n\nAlyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. But\nthough he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his speech\nwas somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he seemed anxious\nbefore the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life,\nand not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirsting\nto share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more\nin his life to open his whole heart.\n\n\"Love one another, Fathers,\" said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could\nremember afterwards. \"Love God's people. Because we have come here and\nshut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are\noutside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of\nus has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on\nearth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly\nhe must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here.\nWhen he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is\nresponsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins,\nnational and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained.\nFor know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for\nall men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness\nof creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual\nman. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man.\nFor monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to\nbe. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite,\nuniversal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power\nto win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world\nwith your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess\nyour sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when\nperceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with\nGod. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the\ngreat. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and\nslander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the\nmaterialists--and I mean not only the good ones--for there are many good\nones among them, especially in our day--hate not even the wicked ones.\nRemember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none\nto pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not\nin pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....\nLove God's people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if you\nslumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in\ncovetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock.\nExpound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate....\nDo not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to\nthe banner and raise it on high.\"\n\nBut the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his words\nafterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take breath,\nand recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They heard him\nwith emotion, though many wondered at his words and found them obscure....\nAfterwards all remembered those words.\n\nWhen Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by the\ngeneral excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it.\nThis anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout\nsolemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately\nafter the elder's death. Their suspense was, from one point of view,\nalmost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by\nit. Father Paissy's face looked the gravest of all.\n\nAlyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had\narrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. In\nit she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It\nappeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive\nFather Zossima's blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a\nsergeant's widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might\npray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to\nIrkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima\nhad answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for\nthe living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards\nforgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, \"as though reading the\nbook of the future\" (this was Madame Hohlakov's expression), words of\ncomfort: \"that her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come\nhimself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and\nexpect him.\" And \"Would you believe it?\" exclaimed Madame Hohlakov\nenthusiastically, \"the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and\nmore than that.\" Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave\nher a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not\nall; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya\ninformed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and\nthat three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped \"to embrace his\nmother.\"\n\nMadame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new \"miracle of\nprediction\" to the Superior and all the brotherhood. \"All, all, ought to\nknow of it!\" she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the\nexcitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had\nno need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had\ncommissioned the monk who brought his message \"to inform most respectfully\nhis reverence Father Paissy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of\nwith him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and\nhumbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.\" As the monk had given the\nmessage to Father Paissy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after\nreading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to\nFather Paissy in confirmation of the story.\n\nAnd even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read the\nnews of the \"miracle,\" could not completely restrain some inner emotion.\nHis eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips.\n\n\"We shall see greater things!\" broke from him.\n\n\"We shall see greater things, greater things yet!\" the monks around\nrepeated.\n\nBut Father Paissy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a\ntime, not to speak of the matter \"till it be more fully confirmed, seeing\nthere is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this\nmight well have chanced naturally,\" he added, prudently, as it were to\nsatisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, a\nfact his listeners very clearly perceived.\n\nWithin the hour the \"miracle\" was of course known to the whole monastery,\nand many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressed\nby it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from\nthe little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had been\nstanding near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father\nZossima earnestly, referring to the \"healing\" of the lady's daughter, \"How\ncan you presume to do such things?\"\n\nHe was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The evening\nbefore he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind the\napiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit. This\nFather Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing\nsilence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima\nand the whole institution of \"elders,\" which he regarded as a pernicious\nand frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although from\nhis practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made him\nformidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling, and many\nof the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic, although\nthey had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was just his craziness\nattracted them.\n\nFather Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in the\nhermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this too\nbecause he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy-five or more,\nand he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell\nwhich had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, who\nhad lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings many\ncurious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.\n\nFather Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same\nsolitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant's hut,\nthough it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary number\nof ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them--which men brought to\nthe monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed to\nlook after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was\ntrue) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper,\nwho lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three\ndays, and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely\nuttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament\nbread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the Father\nSuperior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug was changed\nevery day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homage\nsaw him sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round.\nIf he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always\nrude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but for\nthe most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete\nriddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in\nexplanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange\nbelief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had\ncommunication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and\nso was silent with men.\n\nThe monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the\nbeekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corner\nwhere Father Ferapont's cell stood. \"Maybe he will speak as you are a\nstranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him,\" the beekeeper had\nwarned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the utmost\napprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was\nsitting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightly\nrustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monk\nfrom Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing.\n\n\"Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?\" said Father Ferapont. \"Get up!\"\n\nThe monk got up.\n\n\"Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?\"\n\nWhat most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict\nfasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man. He\nwas tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face.\nThere was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of athletic\nbuild. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray, and still had\nvery thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His\neyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke\nwith a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of\ncoarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round\nhis waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of\nthe coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changed\nfor months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty pounds under his\ncoat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to\npieces.\n\n\"From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,\" the monk answered\nhumbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyes\nkept watch on the hermit.\n\n\"I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester\nwell?\"\n\nThe monk hesitated.\n\n\"You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?\"\n\n\"Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lent\nthere are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesday\nand Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries,\nor salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white cabbage soup,\nnoodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried\nfish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening,\nsix whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and\nwater, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the\nsame as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing is\neaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o'clock,\nand then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine. On\nHoly Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not\ncooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy\nThursday: 'It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to\ndishonor the whole of Lent!' This is how we keep the fast. But what is\nthat compared with you, holy Father,\" added the monk, growing more\nconfident, \"for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but\nbread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven.\nIt's truly marvelous--your great abstinence.\"\n\n\"And mushrooms?\" asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.\n\n\"Mushrooms?\" repeated the surprised monk.\n\n\"Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away into\nthe forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they can't\ngive up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil.\nNowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting. Haughty and\nunclean is their judgment.\"\n\n\"Och, true,\" sighed the monk.\n\n\"And have you seen devils among them?\" asked Ferapont.\n\n\"Among them? Among whom?\" asked the monk, timidly.\n\n\"I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven't been\nsince. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding under his cassock,\nonly his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his pocket with\nsuch sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean belly\nof one, another was hanging round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him\nabout without seeing him.\"\n\n\"You--can see spirits?\" the monk inquired.\n\n\"I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out from\nthe Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, a\nyard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip of\nhis tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the\ndoor, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to struggle, and I\nmade the sign of the cross over him three times. And he died on the spot\nlike a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be\nstinking, but they don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I\nhave been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.\"\n\n\"Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,\" said the monk,\ngrowing bolder and bolder, \"is it true, as they noise abroad even to\ndistant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with the\nHoly Ghost?\"\n\n\"He does fly down at times.\"\n\n\"How does he fly down? In what form?\"\n\n\"As a bird.\"\n\n\"The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?\"\n\n\"There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can\nappear as other birds--sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch and\nsometimes as a blue-tit.\"\n\n\"How do you know him from an ordinary tit?\"\n\n\"He speaks.\"\n\n\"How does he speak, in what language?\"\n\n\"Human language.\"\n\n\"And what does he tell you?\"\n\n\"Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me\nunseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.\"\n\n\"Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,\" the monk shook\nhis head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.\n\n\"Do you see this tree?\" asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.\n\n\"I do, blessed Father.\"\n\n\"You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape.\"\n\n\"What sort of shape?\" inquired the monk, after a pause of vain\nexpectation.\n\n\"It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it is\nChrist holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see it\nclearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!\"\n\n\"What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?\"\n\n\"Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away.\"\n\n\"Alive?\"\n\n\"In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will take me in\nHis arms and bear me away.\"\n\nThough the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the\nbrothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at heart\na greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima. He was\nstrongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept so\nrigid a fast as Father Ferapont should \"see marvels.\" His words seemed\ncertainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words,\nand were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have\nsacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the\ndevil's tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the\nfigurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong\nprejudice against the institution of \"elders,\" which he only knew of by\nhearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had been\nlong at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of some\nshallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, a\nmeddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This was\nwhy the news of the fresh \"miracle\" performed by Father Zossima reduced\nhim to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their\ninquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro\nfrom one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks\nthat were crowding within and without the elder's cell. But he did not pay\nmuch attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards.\n\nHe had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling\ntired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closing\nhis eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was no one else in\nthe cell but Father Paissy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The\nelder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him\nsuddenly:\n\n\"Are your people expecting you, my son?\"\n\nAlyosha hesitated.\n\n\"Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday to see\nthem to-day?\"\n\n\"I did promise--to my father--my brothers--others too.\"\n\n\"You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die without your\nbeing by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, it\nwill be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love me. But\nnow go to keep your promise.\"\n\nAlyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise that\nhe should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last gift to\nhim, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He made haste\nthat he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly.\nFather Paissy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved and\nsurprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell together.\n\n\"Remember, young man, unceasingly,\" Father Paissy began, without preface,\n\"that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has,\nespecially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down to\nus in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this world\nhave nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have only\nanalyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is\nmarvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the\ngates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen\ncenturies, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul\nand in the masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the\nsouls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who have\nrenounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow\nthe Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of\ntheir hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue\nthan the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the\nresult has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young man, since\nyou are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Maybe,\nremembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the\nheart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the\nworld are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my\norphan.\"\n\nWith these words Father Paissy blessed him. As Alyosha left the monastery\nand thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a new and\nunexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who had\nhitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father Zossima had\nbequeathed him to him at his death, and \"perhaps that's just what had\npassed between them,\" Alyosha thought suddenly. The philosophic\nreflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of\nFather Paissy's heart. He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict\nwith temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the\nstrongest defense he could imagine.\n\n\n\nChapter II. At His Father's\n\n\nFirst of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered that\nhis father had insisted the day before that he should come without his\nbrother Ivan seeing him. \"Why so?\" Alyosha wondered suddenly. \"Even if my\nfather has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most\nlikely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different,\"\nhe decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the\ngarden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),\ntold him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two\nhours ago.\n\n\"And my father?\"\n\n\"He is up, taking his coffee,\" Marfa answered somewhat dryly.\n\nAlyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing\nslippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by looking\nthrough some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone in\nthe house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had got up\nearly and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired and weak.\nHis forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the\nnight, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen\nterribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches,\ngiving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old\nman was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he came\nin.\n\n\"The coffee is cold,\" he cried harshly; \"I won't offer you any. I've\nordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't invite any one\nto share it. Why have you come?\"\n\n\"To find out how you are,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.\nYou need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking in directly.\"\n\nHe said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up and\nlooked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the fortieth time that\nmorning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red handkerchief more\nbecomingly on his forehead.\n\n\"Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,\" he observed\nsententiously. \"Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?\"\n\n\"He is very bad; he may die to-day,\" answered Alyosha. But his father had\nnot listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.\n\n\"Ivan's gone out,\" he said suddenly. \"He is doing his utmost to carry off\nMitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,\" he added\nmaliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.\n\n\"Surely he did not tell you so?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks ago?\nYou don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have had some\nobject in coming.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Why do you say such things?\" said Alyosha, troubled.\n\n\"He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing from\nme. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dear\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer I live,\nthe more I shall need it,\" he continued, pacing from one corner of the\nroom to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy\novercoat made of yellow cotton material. \"I can still pass for a man at\nfive and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As I\nget older, you know, I shan't be a pretty object. The wenches won't come\nto me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am saving up\nmore and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may\nas well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.\nFor sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do it\non the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall upon me for\nbeing so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my\ntaste, let me tell you that; and it's not the proper place for a\ngentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleep\nand don't wake up again, and that's all. You can pray for my soul if you\nlike. And if you don't want to, don't, damn you! That's my philosophy.\nIvan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a\nconceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learning ... nor education\neither. He sits silent and smiles at one without speaking--that's what\npulls him through.\"\n\nAlyosha listened to him in silence.\n\n\"Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your\nIvan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to.\nFor if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing\nand you can have it. That's what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to\nprevent me getting married and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry\nGrushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I\nshould leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries\nGrushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what he's\nreckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!\"\n\n\"How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better lie down,\"\nsaid Alyosha.\n\n\"There! you say that,\" the old man observed suddenly, as though it had\nstruck him for the first time, \"and I am not angry with you. But if Ivan\nsaid it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have good\nmoments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.\"\n\n\"You are not ill-natured, but distorted,\" said Alyosha with a smile.\n\n\"Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and I\ndon't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in these\nfashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice, but\neven now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about by the\nhair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of murdering him\noutright--all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him\nand could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday.\"\n\n\"Then you don't mean to take proceedings?\"\n\n\"Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's another\nthing.\"\n\nAnd bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.\n\n\"If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see him at\nonce. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within an\ninch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For that's her\nway, everything by contraries. I know her through and through! Won't you\nhave a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a\nglass of brandy into it, it's delicious, my boy.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,\" said Alyosha, and\ntaking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock.\n\"And you'd better not have brandy, either,\" he suggested apprehensively,\nlooking into the old man's face.\n\n\"You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them.\nOnly one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.\"\n\nHe unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the\ncupboard and put the key back in his pocket.\n\n\"That's enough. One glass won't kill me.\"\n\n\"You see you are in a better humor now,\" said Alyosha, smiling.\n\n\"Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a\nscoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya--why is that? He wants to spy\nhow much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels! But I\ndon't recognize Ivan, I don't know him at all. Where does he come from? He\nis not one of us in soul. As though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave\na will at all, you may as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I\nsquash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread\non them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_ Mitya, for you love him.\nYes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan\nloved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan loves\nnobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.\nThey are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will be\ngone.... I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; I\nwanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a\nthousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself\noff altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without\nGrushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?\"\n\n\"I--I'll ask him,\" muttered Alyosha. \"If you would give him three thousand,\nperhaps he--\"\n\n\"That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've changed my mind.\nIt was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give him anything, not a penny,\nI want my money myself,\" cried the old man, waving his hand. \"I'll crush\nhim like a beetle without it. Don't say anything to him or else he will\nbegin hoping. There's nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is\nthat betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully\nhidden from me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see\nher yesterday, I believe?\"\n\n\"Nothing will induce her to abandon him.\"\n\n\"There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and a\nscoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies,\nvery different from--Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then (for I\nwas better-looking than he at eight and twenty) I'd have been a conquering\nhero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway,\nhe shan't! I'll crush him!\"\n\nHis anger had returned with the last words.\n\n\"You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,\" he snapped\nharshly.\n\nAlyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.\n\n\"What's that for?\" The old man was a little surprised. \"We shall see each\nother again, or do you think we shan't?\"\n\n\"Not at all, I didn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Nor did I, I did not mean anything,\" said the old man, looking at him.\n\"Listen, listen,\" he shouted after him, \"make haste and come again and\nI'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to-day. Be sure to\ncome! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!\"\n\nAnd as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the cupboard\nagain and poured out another half-glass.\n\n\"I won't have more!\" he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he locked\nthe cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into his bedroom,\nlay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep.\n\n\n\nChapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys\n\n\n\"Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,\" thought Alyosha, as he\nleft his father's house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov's, \"or I might\nhave to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.\"\n\nAlyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed\ntheir energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. \"Father is\nspiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick to it. And what of\nDmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and\nangry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in\nfinding him to-day, whatever happens.\"\n\nBut Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road,\nwhich, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on\nhim. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out\ninto Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High\nStreet (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of\nschoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were\ngoing home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others\nwith leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in\nlittle overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round the\nankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The whole\ngroup was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council.\nAlyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children without\ntaking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of children\nof three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so,\nanxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them.\nHe looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the\nboys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,\nthere was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a satchel at\nhis side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and with\nsparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other\nsix, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school,\nbut with whom he had evidently had a feud.\n\nAlyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a black\njacket, observed:\n\n\"When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on my\nleft side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got yours on your\nright side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.\"\n\nAlyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical\nremark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once into\nconfidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of\nchildren. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on a\nperfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.\n\n\"But he is left-handed,\" another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven,\nanswered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.\n\n\"He even throws stones with his left hand,\" observed a third.\n\nAt that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the\nleft-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy\nstanding the other side of the ditch.\n\n\"Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,\" they all shouted. But Smurov, the\nleft-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threw\na stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other side\nof the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones,\nflung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha\nand hit him painfully on the shoulder.\n\n\"He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!\"\nthe boys shouted, laughing. \"Come, all throw at him at once!\" and six\nstones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down,\nbut at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Both\nsides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full\ntoo.\n\n\"What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you'll kill\nhim,\" cried Alyosha.\n\nHe ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Three\nor four ceased throwing for a minute.\n\n\"He began first!\" cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice.\n\"He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a\npenknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he must be\nthrashed.\"\n\n\"But what for? I suppose you tease him.\"\n\n\"There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,\" cried the\nchildren. \"It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at\nhim again, don't miss, Smurov!\" and again a fire of stones, and a very\nvicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the\nchest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky\nStreet. They all shouted: \"Aha, he is funking, he is running away. Wisp of\ntow!\"\n\n\"You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good for\nhim,\" said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be the\neldest.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\" asked Alyosha, \"is he a tell-tale or what?\"\n\nThe boys looked at one another as though derisively.\n\n\"Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?\" the same boy went on. \"Catch him\nup.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting and looking at you.\"\n\n\"He is looking at you,\" the other boys chimed in.\n\n\"You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask him\nthat!\"\n\nThere was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they at\nhim.\n\n\"Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,\" cried Smurov in a warning voice.\n\n\"I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him with\nthat question somehow. But I'll find out from him why you hate him so.\"\n\n\"Find out then, find out,\" cried the boys, laughing.\n\nAlyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight\ntowards the boy.\n\n\"You'd better look out,\" the boys called after him; \"he won't be afraid of\nyou. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did Krassotkin.\"\n\nThe boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha saw\nfacing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weakly\nboy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him\nvindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had\nmonstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There\nwas a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot\njust at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened\nwith ink. Both the pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with\nstones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at\nhim. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat\nhim, became less defiant, and addressed him first.\n\n\"I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!\" he\nsaid suddenly, with flashing eyes.\n\n\"I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,\" observed Alyosha.\n\n\"But I hit Smurov on the head!\" cried the boy.\n\n\"They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on\npurpose,\" said Alyosha.\n\nThe boy looked darkly at him.\n\n\"I don't know you. Do you know me?\" Alyosha continued.\n\n\"Let me alone!\" the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though he\nwere expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his\neyes.\n\n\"Very well, I am going,\" said Alyosha; \"only I don't know you and I don't\ntease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don't want to tease you.\nGood-by!\"\n\n\"Monk in silk trousers!\" cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same\nvindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude\nof defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha\nturned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone three steps before\nthe biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the\nback.\n\n\"So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say\nthat you attack on the sly,\" said Alyosha, turning round again. This time\nthe boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just\nhad time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?\" he cried.\n\nThe boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack\nhim. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild\nbeast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move,\nthe spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his\nmiddle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he\nlet go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all\nhis might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance.\nAlyosha's finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it\nbegan to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly\nround his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood\nwaiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at\nhim.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"you see how badly you've bitten me. That's enough,\nisn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?\"\n\nThe boy stared in amazement.\n\n\"Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,\" Alyosha\nwent on with the same serenity, \"yet I must have done something to you--you\nwouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How have\nI wronged you, tell me?\"\n\nInstead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away.\nAlyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a long\ntime he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turning\nhis head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his\nmind to find him out as soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery.\nJust now he had not the time.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. At The Hohlakovs'\n\n\nAlyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome stone house of\ntwo stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame Hohlakov spent\nmost of her time in another province where she had an estate, or in\nMoscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she had a house in our town\ntoo, inherited from her forefathers. The estate in our district was the\nlargest of her three estates, yet she had been very little in our province\nbefore this time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.\n\n\"Did you get my letter about the new miracle?\" She spoke rapidly and\nnervously.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his mother!\"\n\n\"He is dying to-day,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some one,\nabout all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I can't see him!\nThe whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense. But now--do you\nknow Katerina Ivanovna is here now?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's lucky,\" cried Alyosha. \"Then I shall see her here. She told me\nyesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.\"\n\n\"I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday--and the\natrocious behavior of that--creature. _C'est tragique_, and if I'd been in\nher place I don't know what I should have done. And your brother Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, what do you think of him?--my goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch,\nI am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there with her, not that\ndreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan\nFyodorovitch, he is sitting with her talking; they are having a serious\nconversation. If you could only imagine what's passing between them\nnow--it's awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale\nof horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.\nThey both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you! I've\nbeen thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst of it. I'll\ntell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of something else,\nthe most important thing--I had quite forgotten what's most important. Tell\nme, why has Lise been in hysterics? As soon as she heard you were here,\nshe began to be hysterical!\"\n\n\"_Maman_, it's you who are hysterical now, not I,\" Lise's voice caroled\nthrough a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice sounded as though\nshe wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to control it. Alyosha at\nonce noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping through it, but that\nhe could not see.\n\n\"And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me hysterical\ntoo. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has been so ill all\nnight, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the morning and for\nHerzenstube to come. He says that he can make nothing of it, that we must\nwait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it. As\nsoon as you approached the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and\ninsisted on being wheeled back into this room here.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I didn't know he had come. It wasn't on his account I wanted to be\nwheeled into this room.\"\n\n\"That's not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch was\ncoming. She was on the look-out for you.\"\n\n\"My darling mamma, it's not at all clever of you. But if you want to make\nup for it and say something very clever, dear mamma, you'd better tell our\nhonored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he has shown his want of wit by\nventuring to us after what happened yesterday and although every one is\nlaughing at him.\"\n\n\"Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who laughs at\nhim? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can't do without him. Oh,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!\"\n\n\"But what's the matter with you, mamma, darling?\"\n\n\"Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful night\nof fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting, everlasting,\nthat's the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything.... Even that\nmiracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how it has shattered me, that\nmiracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And that tragedy in the drawing-room,\nit's more than I can bear, I warn you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps,\nnot a tragedy. Tell me, will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he?\nOh, my God! What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and see\nthat it's all nonsense, all nonsense.\"\n\n\"I should be very grateful,\" Alyosha interrupted suddenly, \"if you could\ngive me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have hurt it, and it's\nvery painful.\"\n\nAlyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked with blood.\nMadame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.\n\n\"Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!\"\n\nBut as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she flung the\ndoor wide open.\n\n\"Come, come here,\" she cried, imperiously. \"No nonsense now! Good heavens,\nwhy did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time? He might\nhave bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water! You must wash\nit first of all, simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain, and keep\nit there, keep it there.... Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin.\nBut do make haste,\" she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at\nthe sight of Alyosha's wound.\n\n\"Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?\" cried Madame Hohlakov.\n\n\"Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say that\nhe can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodness' sake go\nyourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can come\nquickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.\"\n\n\"Why, it's nothing much,\" cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.\n\nYulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.\n\n\"Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that muddy\ncaustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got some. You know\nwhere the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom in the right-hand\ncupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the lint.\"\n\n\"I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and don't\nfuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you get\nsuch a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?\"\n\nMadame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.\n\n\"First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?\" she\nasked Alyosha, quickly. \"And then I'll talk to you about something quite\ndifferent. Well?\"\n\nInstinctively feeling that the time of her mother's absence was precious\nfor her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the\nschoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at his\nstory.\n\n\"How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?\" she cried\nangrily, as though she had a right to control him. \"You are nothing but a\nboy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you must find out for\nme about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there's some\nmystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a question: does the\npain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things, but talking\nsensibly?\"\n\n\"Of course not, and I don't feel much pain now.\"\n\n\"That's because your finger is in the water. It must be changed directly,\nfor it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice from the cellar\nand another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can speak; will you give me\nthe letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch--be quick, for\nmamma will be back in a minute and I don't want--\"\n\n\"I haven't got the letter.\"\n\n\"That's not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You've got it in\nthat pocket. I've been regretting that joke all night. Give me back the\nletter at once, give it me.\"\n\n\"I've left it at home.\"\n\n\"But you can't consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly\njoke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me the\nletter, if you really haven't got it--bring it to-day, you must, you must.\"\n\n\"To-day I can't possibly, for I am going back to the monastery and I\nshan't come and see you for the next two days--three or four perhaps--for\nFather Zossima--\"\n\n\"Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very much?\"\n\n\"I didn't laugh at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I believed all you said.\"\n\n\"You are insulting me!\"\n\n\"Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would come to\npass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the monastery.\nThen I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you reach the legal\nage we will be married. I shall love you. Though I haven't had time to\nthink about it, I believe I couldn't find a better wife than you, and\nFather Zossima tells me I must marry.\"\n\n\"But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,\" laughed Lise, flushing\ncrimson.\n\n\"I'll wheel you about myself, but I'm sure you'll get well by then.\"\n\n\"But you are mad,\" said Lise, nervously, \"to make all this nonsense out of\na joke! Here's mamma, very _a propos_, perhaps. Mamma, how slow you always\nare, how can you be so long! And here's Yulia with the ice!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lise, don't scream, above all things don't scream. That scream drives\nme ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place? I've been\nhunting and hunting--I do believe you did it on purpose.\"\n\n\"But I couldn't tell that he would come with a bad finger, or else perhaps\nI might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you begin to say really\nwitty things.\"\n\n\"Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling for\nAlexey Fyodorovitch's sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, what's\nkilling me is no one thing in particular, not Herzenstube, but everything\ntogether, that's what is too much for me.\"\n\n\"That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,\" Lise laughed gayly.\n\"Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That's simply Goulard's\nwater, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but it's a splendid\nlotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had a fight with\nthe boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child,\na child himself? Is he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he\nwants to be married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be\nfunny, wouldn't it be awful?\"\n\nAnd Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly at\nAlyosha.\n\n\"But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? It's quite\nout of place--and perhaps the boy was rabid.\"\n\n\"Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!\"\n\n\"Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might have\nbeen bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near\nhim. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldn't have\ndone it. Do you still feel the pain?\"\n\n\"It's nothing much now.\"\n\n\"You don't feel afraid of water?\" asked Lise.\n\n\"Come, that's enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick talking\nof the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovna\nhas only just heard that you are here, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply\nrushed at me, she's dying to see you, dying!\"\n\n\"Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can't go just now, he is in too much\npain.\"\n\n\"Not at all, I can go quite well,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"What! You are going away? Is that what you say?\"\n\n\"Well, when I've seen them, I'll come back here and we can talk as much as\nyou like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once, for I am\nvery anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don't trouble to come\nand see me afterwards, but go straight back to your monastery and a good\nriddance. I want to sleep, I didn't sleep all night.\"\n\n\"Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would sleep!\" cried\nMadame Hohlakov.\n\n\"I don't know what I've done.... I'll stay another three minutes, five if\nyou like,\" muttered Alyosha.\n\n\"Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a monster.\"\n\n\"Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too\ncapricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one has with\nnervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you.\nHow quickly you have made her sleepy, and how fortunate it is!\"\n\n\"Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it, mamma.\"\n\n\"And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" Madame Hohlakov\nbegan mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid whisper. \"I don't\nwant to suggest anything, I don't want to lift the veil, you will see for\nyourself what's going on. It's appalling. It's the most fantastic farce.\nShe loves your brother, Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuade\nherself she loves your brother, Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with\nyou, and if they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end.\"\n\n\n\nChapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room\n\n\nBut in the drawing-room the conversation was already over. Katerina\nIvanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment\nAlyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take\nleave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For\nthis moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some\ntime haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times\nsuggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna,\nand, what was more, that he meant \"to carry her off\" from Dmitri. Until\nquite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him\nextremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between\nthem. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was\nglad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him,\nDmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that\nAlyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had\ntill the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a\nsteadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till\nthe evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving\na man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he\nwas, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.\n\nBut during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him.\nThe word \"lacerating,\" which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered, almost made\nhim start, because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had cried\nout \"Laceration, laceration,\" probably applying it to his dream. He had\nbeen dreaming all night of the previous day's scene at Katerina\nIvanovna's. Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and\npersistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and\nonly deceived herself through some sort of pose, from \"self-laceration,\"\nand tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied\nduty of gratitude. \"Yes,\" he thought, \"perhaps the whole truth lies in\nthose words.\" But in that case what was Ivan's position? Alyosha felt\ninstinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's must dominate, and\nshe could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan.\nFor Dmitri might at last submit to her domination \"to his own happiness\"\n(which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan--no, Ivan could not\nsubmit to her, and such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha\ncould not help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and\nreflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room.\nAnother idea, too, forced itself upon him: \"What if she loved neither of\nthem--neither Ivan nor Dmitri?\"\n\nIt must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts\nand blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month.\n\"What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?\"\nhe thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was\nimpossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry\nwas of immense importance in his brothers' lives and that a great deal\ndepended upon it.\n\n\"One reptile will devour the other,\" Ivan had pronounced the day before,\nspeaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as\na reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he had known\nKaterina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares\nyesterday, but that only made it more important. If he felt like that,\nwhat chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new\ngrounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of them\nwas Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them? He\nloved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of these\nconflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, and\nAlyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was always\nof an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If he loved any\none, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so he must know what he\nwas aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and having\nascertained this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of\na definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all\nsides. \"It was lacerating,\" as was said just now. But what could he\nunderstand even in this \"laceration\"? He did not understand the first word\nin this perplexing maze.\n\nSeeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan, who\nhad already got up to go, \"A minute! Stay another minute! I want to hear\nthe opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Don't go away,\"\nshe added, addressing Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside\nher, and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.\n\n\"You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear friends,\"\nshe began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of\nsuffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her at once. \"You, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene, and saw\nwhat I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did. What he thought\nof me yesterday I don't know. I only know one thing, that if it were\nrepeated to-day, this minute, I should express the same feelings again as\nyesterday--the same feelings, the same words, the same actions. You\nremember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them\"\n... (as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). \"I must tell you\nthat I can't get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even know\nwhether I still love _him_. I feel _pity_ for him, and that is a poor sign\nof love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I shouldn't be\nsorry for him now, but should hate him.\"\n\nHer voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha\nshuddered inwardly. \"That girl is truthful and sincere,\" he thought, \"and\nshe does not love Dmitri any more.\"\n\n\"That's true, that's true,\" cried Madame Hohlakov.\n\n\"Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I came to\nduring the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one--for\nme, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it--nothing. It\nwill be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful and generous adviser,\nthe one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep\ninsight into the heart, approves and commends my decision. He knows it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I approve of it,\" Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.\n\n\"But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive my\ncalling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, to\ntell me before my two friends whether I am right. I feel instinctively\nthat you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are a dear brother to me),\"\nshe said again ecstatically, taking his cold hand in her hot one, \"I\nforesee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in spite\nof all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and submit--I\nfeel that.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are asking me,\" said Alyosha, flushing. \"I only\nknow that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than\nmy own!... But I know nothing about such affairs,\" something impelled him\nto add hurriedly.\n\n\"In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing is\nhonor and duty and something higher--I don't know what--but higher perhaps\neven than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart,\nand it compels me irresistibly. But it may all be put in two words. I've\nalready decided, even if he marries that--creature,\" she began solemnly,\n\"whom I never, never can forgive, _even then I will not abandon him_.\nHenceforward I will never, never abandon him!\" she cried, breaking into a\nsort of pale, hysterical ecstasy. \"Not that I would run after him\ncontinually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to\nanother town--where you like--but I will watch over him all my life--I will\nwatch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy with that\nwoman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let him come to me and he\nwill find a friend, a sister.... Only a sister, of course, and so for\never; but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister,\nwho loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him. I will gain my\npoint. I will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me,\nwithout reserve,\" she cried, in a sort of frenzy. \"I will be a god to whom\nhe can pray--and that, at least, he owes me for his treachery and for what\nI suffered yesterday through him. And let him see that all my life I will\nbe true to him and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue\nand betraying me. I will--I will become nothing but a means for his\nhappiness, or--how shall I say?--an instrument, a machine for his happiness,\nand that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may see that all\nhis life! That's my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.\"\n\nShe was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea with more\ndignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried and crude. It\nwas full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she was still\nsmarting from yesterday's insult, and that her pride craved satisfaction.\nShe felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look came\ninto her eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy. His\nbrother Ivan made it worse by adding:\n\n\"I've only expressed my own view,\" he said. \"From any one else, this would\nhave been affected and overstrained, but from you--no. Any other woman\nwould have been wrong, but you are right. I don't know how to explain it,\nbut I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore, you are right.\"\n\n\"But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for?\nNothing but yesterday's insult.\" Madame Hohlakov obviously had not\nintended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very just\ncomment.\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously\nannoyed at being interrupted, \"in any one else this moment would be only\ndue to yesterday's impression and would be only a moment. But with\nKaterina Ivanovna's character, that moment will last all her life. What\nfor any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting\nburdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty. And she will be sustained\nby the feeling of this duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna,\nwill henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your\nown heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will be\nsoftened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a\nbold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any\ncase, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of it will at last be a\nsource of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything\nelse.\"\n\nThis was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention;\neven perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with\nintention.\n\n\"Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!\" Madame Hohlakov cried again.\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you will\nsay!\" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears. Alyosha got up from\nthe sofa.\n\n\"It's nothing, nothing!\" she went on through her tears. \"I'm upset, I\ndidn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends as you and\nyour brother I still feel strong--for I know--you two will never desert me.\"\n\n\"Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow--perhaps to-morrow--and to leave\nyou for a long time--And, unluckily, it's unavoidable,\" Ivan said suddenly.\n\n\"To-morrow--to Moscow!\" her face was suddenly contorted; \"but--but, dear me,\nhow fortunate!\" she cried in a voice suddenly changed. In one instant\nthere was no trace left of her tears. She underwent an instantaneous\ntransformation, which amazed Alyosha. Instead of a poor, insulted girl,\nweeping in a sort of \"laceration,\" he saw a woman completely self-\npossessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable had\njust happened.\n\n\"Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,\" she corrected\nherself suddenly, with a charming society smile. \"Such a friend as you are\ncould not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you.\" She rushed\nimpulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his hands, pressed them warmly. \"But\nwhat is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and\nAgafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position. You can\nspeak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will\nknow how to do that. You can't think how wretched I was yesterday and this\nmorning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter--for one can\nnever tell such things in a letter.... Now it will be easy for me to\nwrite, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I am!\nBut I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can take your\nplace.... I will run at once to write the letter,\" she finished suddenly,\nand took a step as though to go out of the room.\n\n\"And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so desperately\nanxious to hear?\" cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry note\nin her voice.\n\n\"I had not forgotten that,\" cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a sudden\nstandstill, \"and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?\" she added,\nwith warm and bitter reproachfulness. \"What I said, I repeat. I must have\nhis opinion. More than that, I must have his decision! As he says, so it\nshall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch....\nBut what's the matter?\"\n\n\"I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!\" Alyosha cried\nsuddenly in distress.\n\n\"What? What?\"\n\n\"He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You said that\non purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but\nsorry to be--losing a friend. But that was acting, too--you were playing a\npart--as in a theater!\"\n\n\"In a theater? What? What do you mean?\" exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna,\nprofoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.\n\n\"Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him, you persist\nin telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is going,\" said Alyosha\nbreathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not sit down.\n\n\"What are you talking about? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I don't understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I am\nnot saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same,\" Alyosha went on in\nthe same shaking and broken voice. \"What I see is that perhaps you don't\nlove Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri,\ntoo, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I really don't know\nhow I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for\nnobody here will tell the truth.\"\n\n\"What truth?\" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring in\nher voice.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he were\njumping from the top of a house. \"Call Dmitri; I will fetch him--and let\nhim come here and take your hand and take Ivan's and join your hands. For\nyou're torturing Ivan, simply because you love him--and torturing him,\nbecause you love Dmitri through 'self-laceration'--with an unreal\nlove--because you've persuaded yourself.\"\n\nAlyosha broke off and was silent.\n\n\"You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot--that's what you are!\"\nKaterina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving\nwith anger.\n\nIvan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.\n\n\"You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,\" he said, with an expression Alyosha\nhad never seen in his face before--an expression of youthful sincerity and\nstrong, irresistibly frank feeling. \"Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for\nme! She has known all the time that I cared for her--though I never said a\nword of my love to her--she knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never\nbeen her friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my\nfriendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged\nwith me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receiving\nfrom Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that first meeting\nhas rankled in her heart as an insult--that's what her heart is like! She\nhas talked to me of nothing but her love for him. I am going now; but,\nbelieve me, Katerina Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more he\ninsults you, the more you love him--that's your 'laceration.' You love him\njust as he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give\nhim up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as to\ncontemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for\ninfidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a great deal of\nhumiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride.... I\nam too young and I've loved you too much. I know that I ought not to say\nthis, that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you, and\nit would be less offensive for you. But I am going far away, and shall\nnever come back.... It is for ever. I don't want to sit beside a\n'laceration.'... But I don't know how to speak now. I've said\neverything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna; you can't be angry with me, for\nI am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the fact\nthat I shall never see you again. Good-by! I don't want your hand. You\nhave tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this\nmoment. I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand. 'Den\nDank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,' \" he added, with a forced smile, showing,\nhowever, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he knew him by\nheart--which Alyosha would never have believed. He went out of the room\nwithout saying good-by even to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha\nclasped his hands.\n\n\"Ivan!\" he cried desperately after him. \"Come back, Ivan! No, nothing will\ninduce him to come back now!\" he cried again, regretfully realizing it;\n\"but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly.\nUnjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come back,\" Alyosha kept\nexclaiming frantically.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.\n\n\"You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,\" Madame\nHohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. \"I will do my\nutmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.\"\n\nHer face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, but\nKaterina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble notes in\nher hand.\n\n\"I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" she began,\naddressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though\nnothing had happened. \"A week--yes, I think it was a week ago--Dmitri\nFyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action--a very ugly action.\nThere is a low tavern here, and in it he met that discharged officer, that\ncaptain, whom your father used to employ in some business. Dmitri\nFyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this captain, seized him by the\nbeard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it,\nin that insulting fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a\nchild, who is at the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and\nbegging for his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every\none laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think\nwithout indignation of that disgraceful action of _his_ ... one of those\nactions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger\n... and in his passions! I can't describe it even.... I can't find my\nwords. I've made inquiries about his victim, and find he is quite a poor\nman. His name is Snegiryov. He did something wrong in the army and was\ndischarged. I can't tell you what. And now he has sunk into terrible\ndestitution, with his family--an unhappy family of sick children, and, I\nbelieve, an insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to\nwork as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought if you\n... that is I thought ... I don't know. I am so confused. You see, I\nwanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find some\nexcuse to go to them--I mean to that captain--oh, goodness, how badly I\nexplain it!--and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to\" (Alyosha\nblushed), \"manage to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles.\nHe will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,\nrather, what do I mean? You see it's not by way of compensation to prevent\nhim from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to), but simply a\ntoken of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself.... But you know.... I would go\nmyself, but you'll know how to do it ever so much better. He lives in Lake\nStreet, in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.... For God's sake, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, do it for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired. Good-\nby!\"\n\nShe turned and disappeared behind the portiere so quickly that Alyosha had\nnot time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to beg her\npardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was full and he\ncould not bear to go out of the room without it. But Madame Hohlakov took\nhim by the hand and drew him along with her. In the hall she stopped him\nagain as before.\n\n\"She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,\ngenerous,\" she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. \"Oh, how I love her,\nespecially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear Alexey\nFyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you, that we all, all--both\nher aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even--have been hoping and praying for\nnothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite Dmitri,\nwho takes no notice of her and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan\nFyodorovitch--such an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her\nmore than anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it\nabout, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.\"\n\n\"But she has been crying--she has been wounded again,\" cried Alyosha.\n\n\"Never trust a woman's tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the\nwomen in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.\"\n\n\"Mamma, you are spoiling him,\" Lise's little voice cried from behind the\ndoor.\n\n\"No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,\" Alyosha repeated\nunconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his\nindiscretion.\n\n\"Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready\nto say so a thousand times over.\"\n\n\"Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?\" Lise's voice was heard again.\n\n\"I somehow fancied all at once,\" Alyosha went on as though he had not\nheard Lise, \"that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing.... What\nwill happen now?\"\n\n\"To whom, to whom?\" cried Lise. \"Mamma, you really want to be the death of\nme. I ask you and you don't answer.\"\n\nAt the moment the maid ran in.\n\n\"Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. \"Mamma, I\nshall be having hysterics, and not she!\"\n\n\"Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At your age one\ncan't know everything that grown-up people know. I'll come and tell you\neverything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am\ncoming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it's an\nexcellent thing that she is hysterical. That's just as it ought to be. In\nsuch cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tears\nand hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her. As for Ivan\nFyodorovitch's going away like that, it's her own fault. But he won't go\naway. Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not\nscreaming. It's I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted,\ndelighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how\nyoung Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said all\nthat and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a _savant_, and all\nof a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such\nyouthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you.... And the way he\nrepeated that German verse, it was just like you! But I must fly, I must\nfly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her commission, and then\nmake haste back. Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't\nkeep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.\"\n\nMadame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened\nthe door to see Lise.\n\n\"On no account,\" cried Lise. \"On no account now. Speak through the door.\nHow have you come to be an angel? That's the only thing I want to know.\"\n\n\"For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!\"\n\n\"Don't dare to go away like that!\" Lise was beginning.\n\n\"Lise, I have a real sorrow! I'll be back directly, but I have a great,\ngreat sorrow!\"\n\nAnd he ran out of the room.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage\n\n\nHe certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He had\nrushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love-affair. \"But what do\nI know about it? What can I tell about such things?\" he repeated to\nhimself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. \"Oh, being ashamed would\nbe nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall\ncertainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me to\nreconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them\ntogether?\" Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their\nhands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. \"Though I acted quite\nsincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,\" he concluded suddenly,\nand did not even smile at his conclusion.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother\nDmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided to\ngo to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a\npresentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he\nwould intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow.\nTime was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for\none minute from the time he set off from the monastery.\n\nThere was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina\nIvanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the captain's son, the\nlittle schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at\nonce struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his\nfinger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. Now\nAlyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have said\nwhy. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think no\nmore about the \"mischief\" he had done, and not to torture himself with\nremorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thought\nhe was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he\nfelt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from his\nfather's, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.\n\nDmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, his\nson, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha. \"He\nhasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone away,\" the\nold man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that\nhe was answering in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he\nwere not at Grushenka's or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on\npurpose), all three looked at him in alarm. \"They are fond of him, they\nare doing their best for him,\" thought Alyosha. \"That's good.\"\n\nAt last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house,\nsunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a\nmuddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed the\nyard and found the door opening into the passage. On the left of the\npassage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Both\nseemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one\nof them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and\npointed to a door across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to\nbe a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open\nthe door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from\nKaterina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family. \"Either they are all\nasleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open\nthe door. I'd better knock first,\" and he knocked. An answer came, but not\nat once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.\n\n\"Who's there?\" shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.\n\nThen Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himself\nin a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up with\ndomestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. On\nthe left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on the\nleft was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags\nhanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and\nleft, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of\nfour print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the\nother there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was\nscreened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain\ncould be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square table\nof plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three windows,\nwhich consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little\nlight, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather\nstuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs,\na half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.\n\nA woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a\nchair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunken\ncheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what struck\nAlyosha most was the expression in the poor woman's eyes--a look of\nsurprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking to\nher husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with\nthe same haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the window\nstood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but\nvery neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.\nBeside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad\nsight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled \"with\nwithered legs,\" as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches stood in the\ncorner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor\ngirl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting\nat the table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weakly\nbuilt. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very much\nlike a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase \"a wisp of tow\" flashed\nat once into Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).\nIt was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there was no\nother man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from the\nbench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged\nnapkin, darted up to Alyosha.\n\n\"It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!\" the\ngirl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round instantly\ntowards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice:\n\n\"No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,\" he turned again to Alyosha,\n\"what has brought you to--our retreat?\"\n\nAlyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen him.\nThere was something angular, flurried and irritable about him. Though he\nhad obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There was\nextraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at the\nsame time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been kept in\nsubjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was\ntrying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wants\ndreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In his\nwords and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy\nhumor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting\nfrom one tone to another. The question about \"our retreat\" he had asked as\nit were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close to\nAlyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed in a very\nshabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore checked trousers of\nan extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material.\nThey were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grown\nout of them like a boy.\n\n\"I am Alexey Karamazov,\" Alyosha began in reply.\n\n\"I quite understand that, sir,\" the gentleman snapped out at once to\nassure him that he knew who he was already. \"I am Captain Snegiryov, sir,\nbut I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you--\"\n\n\"Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you--if\nonly you allow me.\"\n\n\"In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's what they\nused to say in the old comedies, 'kindly be seated,' \" and with a rapid\ngesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, not\nupholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then,\ntaking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha, so\nclose to him that their knees almost touched.\n\n\"Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian\ninfantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I might\nnot be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life I've\nlearnt to say 'sir.' It's a word you use when you've come down in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"That's very true,\" smiled Alyosha. \"But is it used involuntarily or on\npurpose?\"\n\n\"As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I didn't use\nthe word 'sir' all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I began\nto say 'sir.' It's the work of a higher power. I see you are interested in\ncontemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, living\nas I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?\"\n\n\"I've come--about that business.\"\n\n\"About what business?\" the captain interrupted impatiently.\n\n\"About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" Alyosha blurted\nout awkwardly.\n\n\"What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About my 'wisp of tow,'\nthen?\" He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against\nAlyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.\n\n\"What wisp of tow?\" muttered Alyosha.\n\n\"He is come to complain of me, father!\" cried a voice familiar to\nAlyosha--the voice of the schoolboy--from behind the curtain. \"I bit his\nfinger just now.\" The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailant\nlying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner\nunder the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt.\nHe was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a\nfever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home\nand could not be touched.\n\n\"What! Did he bite your finger?\" The captain jumped up from his chair.\n\"Was it your finger he bit?\"\n\n\"Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of them\nagainst him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me and then\nanother at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And then he rushed\nat me and bit my finger badly, I don't know why.\"\n\n\"I'll thrash him, sir, at once--this minute!\" The captain jumped up from\nhis seat.\n\n\"But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I don't want\nhim to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha and thrash him\nbefore you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?\"\nsaid the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were going to\nattack him. \"I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashing\nIlusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here\nbefore your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers\nwould be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for\nthe fifth one too?\" He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every\nfeature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely\ndefiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.\n\n\"I think I understand it all now,\" said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,\nstill keeping his seat. \"So your boy is a good boy, he loves his father,\nand he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I understand\nit,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets\nhis action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him to come to\nyou, or better still, to meet you in that same place, he will ask your\nforgiveness before every one--if you wish it.\"\n\n\"After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And he\nthinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way you\nlike.\"\n\n\"So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in\nthat very tavern--'The Metropolis' it's called--or in the market-place, he\nwould do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, he would even go down on his knees.\"\n\n\"You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced me\nto the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother's generosity. Allow\nme to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son--my litter. If I\ndie, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for a\nwretch like me? That's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man\nof my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man like\nme.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's perfectly true!\" exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n\"Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us to\nshame!\" cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father with\na disdainful and contemptuous air.\n\n\"Wait a little, Varvara!\" cried her father, speaking peremptorily but\nlooking at her quite approvingly. \"That's her character,\" he said,\naddressing Alyosha again.\n\n\n    \"And in all nature there was naught\n    That could find favor in his eyes--\n\n\nor rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now let\nme present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is forty-\nthree; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. Arina\nPetrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.\nGet up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.\" He took him by the hand and with unexpected\nforce pulled him up. \"You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It's\nnot the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h'm ... etcetera, but his brother,\nradiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first your\nhand to be kissed.\"\n\nAnd he kissed his wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly. The girl at\nthe window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression of\nextraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the\nwoman.\n\n\"Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,\" she said.\n\n\"Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,\" he whispered\nagain.\n\n\"Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of\nTchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me crippled,\nbut I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled up\nmyself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it's as though I had swallowed a\nneedle.\"\n\n\"We are of humble origin,\" the captain muttered again.\n\n\"Oh, father, father!\" the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent on\nher chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.\n\n\"Buffoon!\" blurted out the girl at the window.\n\n\"Have you heard our news?\" said the mother, pointing at her daughters.\n\"It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again.\nWhen we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don't mean\nto make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon's wife used\nto come then and say, 'Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest\nheart, but Nastasya Petrovna,' she would say, 'is of the brood of hell.'\n'Well,' I said, 'that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.'\n'And you want keeping in your place,' says she. 'You black sword,' said I,\n'who asked you to teach me?' 'But my breath,' says she, 'is clean, and\nyours is unclean.' 'You ask all the officers whether my breath is\nunclean.' And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long ago I was\nsitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who came\nhere for Easter, and I asked him: 'Your Excellency,' said I, 'can a lady's\nbreath be unpleasant?' 'Yes,' he answered; 'you ought to open a window-\npane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.' And they all go on\nlike that! And what is my breath to them? The dead smell worse still! 'I\nwon't spoil the air,' said I, 'I'll order some slippers and go away.' My\ndarlings, don't blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can't\nplease you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school and loves me.\nYesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own mother--forgive a poor\nlonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasant to you?\"\n\nAnd the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her\ncheeks. The captain rushed up to her.\n\n\"Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves\nyou, every one adores you.\" He began kissing both her hands again and\ntenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he began wiping away\nher tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes. \"There, you\nsee, you hear?\" he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the\npoor imbecile.\n\n\"I see and hear,\" muttered Alyosha.\n\n\"Father, father, how can you--with him! Let him alone!\" cried the boy,\nsitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.\n\n\"Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead to\nanything!\" shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.\n\n\"Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make haste to\nsatisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I'll put on\nmine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but not\nwithin these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgot\nto introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who has\nflown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.\"\n\n\"There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!\" Varvara\nwent on indignantly.\n\n\"And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now, she\nis a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call me so.\nCome along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.\"\n\nAnd, snatching Alyosha's hand, he drew him out of the room into the\nstreet.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. And In The Open Air\n\n\n\"The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the\nword. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.\"\n\n\"I too have something important to say to you,\" observed Alyosha, \"only I\ndon't know how to begin.\"\n\n\"To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked in\nupon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of the\nboy, and that's hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I could not\nexplain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you. My\ntow was thicker a week ago--I mean my beard. That's the nickname they give\nto my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri\nFyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I'd done nothing, he was in a\ntowering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of the\ntavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out of\nschool, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state he\nrushed up to me. 'Father,' he cried, 'father!' He caught hold of me,\nhugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, 'Let go, let go,\nit's my father, forgive him!'--yes, he actually cried 'forgive him.' He\nclutched at that hand, that very hand, in his little hands and kissed\nit.... I remember his little face at that moment, I haven't forgotten it\nand I never shall!\"\n\n\"I swear,\" cried Alyosha, \"that my brother will express his most deep and\nsincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that same\nmarket-place.... I'll make him or he is no brother of mine!\"\n\n\"Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from him but\nsimply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have said\nso. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother's highly\nchivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at the\ntime. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: 'You are an\nofficer,' he said, 'and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man to\nbe your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though\nyou are a scoundrel.' That's what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I\nretired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever\non Ilusha's soul. No, it's not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen.\nJudge for yourself. You've just been in our mansion, what did you see\nthere? Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and\nhunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a student,\ndying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the\nRussian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won't speak of Ilusha, he is\nonly nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all\nof them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me on\nthe spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if he\ndoesn't kill me but only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I should still\nbe a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I\ntake Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That's what it\nmeans for me to challenge him to a duel. It's silly talk and nothing\nelse.\"\n\n\"He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the middle\nof the market-place,\" cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.\n\n\"I did think of prosecuting him,\" the captain went on, \"but look in our\ncode, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And then\nAgrafena Alexandrovna(3) sent for me and shouted at me: 'Don't dare to\ndream of it! If you proceed against him, I'll publish it to all the world\nthat he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.' I\ncall God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I\nacted, wasn't it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch's? 'And what's more,'\nshe went on, 'I'll dismiss you for good and you'll never earn another\npenny from me. I'll speak to my merchant too' (that's what she calls her\nold man) 'and he will dismiss you!' And if he dismisses me, what can I\nearn then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your\nFyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another\nreason, but he means to make use of papers I've signed to go to law\nagainst me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But now\nlet me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much? I didn't like to go into\nit in our mansion before him.\"\n\n\"Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me as\na Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was throwing\nstones at his school-fellows! It's very dangerous. They might kill him.\nThey are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebody's\nhead.\"\n\n\"That's just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to-day. Not\non the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home crying\nand groaning and now he is ill.\"\n\n\"And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on your\naccount. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife not\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"I've heard about that too, it's dangerous. Krassotkin is an official\nhere, we may hear more about it.\"\n\n\"I would advise you,\" Alyosha went on warmly, \"not to send him to school\nat all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is passed.\"\n\n\"Anger!\" the captain repeated, \"that's just what it is. He is a little\ncreature, but it's a mighty anger. You don't know all, sir. Let me tell\nyou more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about the\n'wisp of tow.' Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are\nangels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless.\nTheir teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy,\na weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his father, sir,\nbut he stood up for his father against them all. For his father and for\ntruth and justice. For what he suffered when he kissed your brother's hand\nand cried to him 'Forgive father, forgive him,'--that only God knows--and I,\nhis father. For our children--not your children, but ours--the children of\nthe poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one--know what justice means,\nsir, even at nine years old. How should the rich know? They don't explore\nsuch depths once in their lives. But at that moment in the square when he\nkissed his hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice\nmeans. That truth entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,\" the\ncaptain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right\nfist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how \"the truth\"\ncrushed Ilusha. \"That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was\ndelirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I\nnoticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the\nwindow and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mind\nwas not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful\nman as I am, and I don't remember much. Mamma began crying, too--I am very\nfond of mamma--well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don't\ndespise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best\nmen amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don't remember\nabout Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at\nschool. 'Wisp of tow,' they shouted, 'your father was pulled out of the\ntavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.' \"\n\n\"On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale and\nwretched. 'What is it?' I asked. He wouldn't answer. Well, there's no\ntalking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it.\nWhat's more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara had\nbegun snarling. 'You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything\nrational?' 'Quite so,' I said, 'can we ever do anything rational?' For the\ntime I turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a\nwalk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same\nway, along which we are going now--from our gate to that great stone which\nlies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of the\ntown pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along\nhand in hand as usual. He has a little hand, his fingers are thin and\ncold--he suffers with his chest, you know. 'Father,' said he, 'father!'\n'Well?' said I. I saw his eyes flashing. 'Father, how he treated you\nthen!' 'It can't be helped, Ilusha,' I said. 'Don't forgive him, father,\ndon't forgive him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for\nit.' 'No, Ilusha,' said I, 'I would not take money from him for anything.'\nThen he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it\nagain. 'Father,' he said, 'father, challenge him to a duel, at school they\nsay you are a coward and won't challenge him, and that you'll accept ten\nroubles from him.' 'I can't challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,' I answered.\nAnd I told briefly what I've just told you. He listened. 'Father,' he\nsaid, 'anyway don't forgive it. When I grow up I'll call him out myself\nand kill him.' His eyes shone and glowed. And of course I am his father,\nand I had to put in a word: 'It's a sin to kill,' I said, 'even in a\nduel.' 'Father,' he said, 'when I grow up, I'll knock him down, knock the\nsword out of his hand, I'll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say:\n\"I could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!\" ' You see what the\nworkings of his little mind have been during these two days; he must have\nbeen planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.\n\n\"But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about it\nthe day before yesterday, and you are right, I won't send him to that\nschool any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the class\nalone and defying them all, that his heart was full of resentment, of\nbitterness--I was alarmed about him. We went for another walk. 'Father,' he\nasked, 'are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?' 'Yes,\nIlusha,' I said, 'there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.'\n'Father,' he said, 'I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer\neverybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one\nwill dare--' Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling.\n'Father,' he said, 'what a horrid town this is.' 'Yes, Ilusha,' I said,\n'it isn't a very nice town.' 'Father, let us move into another town, a\nnice one,' he said, 'where people don't know about us.' 'We will move, we\nwill, Ilusha,' said I, 'only I must save up for it.' I was glad to be able\nto turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we\nwould move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. 'We will\nput mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we'll walk,\nyou shall have a lift now and then, and I'll walk beside, for we must take\ncare of our horse, we can't all ride. That's how we'll go.' He was\nenchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and\ndriving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We\nchattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind and\ncomforted him.\n\n\"That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night\neverything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came back\ndepressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the hand and\nwe went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no\nsun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along,\nboth of us depressed. 'Well, my boy,' said I, 'how about our setting off\non our travels?' I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day\nbefore. He didn't answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand. Ah,\nI thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh. We had reached the\nstone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And in the air there were\nlots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty in\nsight. Of course, it's just the season for the kites. 'Look, Ilusha,' said\nI, 'it's time we got out our last year's kite again. I'll mend it, where\nhave you put it away?' My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned\nsideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell\non me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You\nknow, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears\nwhen they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall\nin streams. With those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face.\nHe sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up\nagainst me as I sat on the stone. 'Father,' he kept crying, 'dear father,\nhow he insulted you!' And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other's\narms. 'Ilusha,' I said to him, 'Ilusha darling.' No one saw us then. God\nalone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your\nbrother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won't thrash my boy for your\nsatisfaction.\"\n\nHe had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha\nfelt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else\nin his, Alyosha's place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would\nnot have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart\nwas trembling on the verge of tears.\n\n\"Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!\" he cried. \"If you\ncould arrange it--\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" muttered the captain.\n\n\"But now listen to something quite different!\" Alyosha went on. \"I have a\nmessage for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his\nbetrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I\nhave a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for\nhearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate\nposition, she commissioned me at once--just now--to bring you this help from\nher--but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor\nfrom me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her!\nShe entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the\nsame man. She thought of you only when she had just received a similar\ninsult from him--similar in its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister to\nhelp a brother in misfortune.... She told me to persuade you to take these\ntwo hundred roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in\nsuch need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander.\nThere are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them\nunless--unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothers\neven on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, you\nmust,\" and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.\n\nThey were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence,\nand there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendous\nimpression on the captain. He started, but at first only from\nastonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he\nexpected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from\nany one--and such a sum!\n\nHe took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer, quite\na new expression came into his face.\n\n\"That for me? So much money--two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I\nhaven't seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And she\nsays she is a sister.... And is that the truth?\"\n\n\"I swear that all I told you is the truth,\" cried Alyosha.\n\nThe captain flushed red.\n\n\"Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan't be behaving like a\nscoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan't be a scoundrel? No,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,\" he hurried, touching Alyosha with\nboth his hands. \"You are persuading me to take it, saying that it's a\nsister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won't you feel contempt for\nme if I take it, eh?\"\n\n\"No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan't! And no one will ever know but\nme--I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.\"\n\n\"Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this\nyou must listen, for you can't understand what these two hundred roubles\nmean to me now.\" The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of\nincoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown off his balance and\ntalked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be allowed to say all\nhe had to say.\n\n\"Besides its being honestly acquired from a 'sister,' so highly respected\nand revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my\nhunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of\nhis heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. 'I can make\nnothing of it,' said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept\nat a chemist's here. He said it would be sure to do her good, and he\nordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral water costs\nthirty copecks, and she'd need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I took\nthe prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it\nlies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them,\nmorning and evening. But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion,\nwithout servants, without help, without a bath, and without water? Nina is\nrheumatic all over, I don't think I told you that. All her right side\naches at night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel\nbears it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get,\nand she'll only take the leavings, what you'd scarcely give to a dog. 'I\nam not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,' that's\nwhat her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesn't like\nit. 'I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.' As though she were not\nworth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness.\nWithout her, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! She\nsoftens even Varvara. And don't judge Varvara harshly either, she is an\nangel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer,\nand she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to\ngo back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took her\nmoney and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Though\nindeed she couldn't go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. She\nis like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits on us\nall, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma is\ncapricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant with this\nmoney, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the\ndear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I can\nfeed them properly. Good Lord, but it's a dream!\"\n\nAlyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that the\npoor fellow had consented to be made happy.\n\n\"Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,\" the captain began to talk with frenzied\nrapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. \"Do you know that Ilusha and I\nwill perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, a\nblack horse, he insists on its being black, and we will set off as we\npretended the other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province,\nand I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he'd give me a\nplace as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I'd just\nput mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I'd walk, I'd\nwalk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that's owing me,\nI should have perhaps enough for that too!\"\n\n\"There would be enough!\" cried Alyosha. \"Katerina Ivanovna will send you\nas much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what you\nwant, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it back\nlater.... (You'll get rich, you'll get rich!) And you know you couldn't\nhave a better idea than to move to another province! It would be the\nsaving of you, especially of your boy--and you ought to go quickly, before\nthe winter, before the cold. You must write to us when you are there, and\nwe will always be brothers.... No, it's not a dream!\"\n\nAlyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him he\nstopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and his\nlips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving as\nthough trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his lips\nmoved. It was uncanny.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Alyosha, startled.\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,\" muttered the captain, faltering,\nlooking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate\nresolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips. \"I ...\nyou, sir ... wouldn't you like me to show you a little trick I know?\" he\nmurmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no longer\nfaltering.\n\n\"What trick?\"\n\n\"A pretty trick,\" whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted on the left\nside, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.\n\n\"What is the matter? What trick?\" Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.\n\n\"Why, look,\" squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes\nwhich he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger\nduring the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them\ntight in his right hand. \"Do you see, do you see?\" he shrieked, pale and\ninfuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notes\non the sand. \"Do you see?\" he shrieked again, pointing to them. \"Look\nthere!\"\n\nAnd with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping and\nexclaiming as he did so:\n\n\"So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money!\nSo much for your money!\"\n\nSuddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his whole\nfigure expressed unutterable pride.\n\n\"Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,\" he\ncried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began to\nrun; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and\nkissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turned\nround for the last time. This time his face was not contorted with\nlaughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering,\nsobbing voice he cried:\n\n\"What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?\"\n\nAnd then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,\ninexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the man\nhad not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did not\nturn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and call him\nback, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two\nnotes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into\nthe sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha\nunfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he folded\nthem up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on\nthe success of her commission.\n\n\n\n\nBook V. Pro And Contra\n\n\n\nChapter I. The Engagement\n\n\nMadame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered;\nsomething important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna's hysterics had ended\nin a fainting fit, and then \"a terrible, awful weakness had followed, she\nlay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever.\nThey had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts were\nalready here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in\nher room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain\nfever!\"\n\nMadame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. \"This is serious, serious,\" she\nadded at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before had\nbeen serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to\ndescribe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words. She\nhad not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her\nthere.\n\n\"Lise,\" she whispered almost in his ear, \"Lise has greatly surprised me\njust now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heart\nforgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began to\nbe truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though\nshe was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry\nfor it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never\nbeen really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And\nyou know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in\nearnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and\ndon't take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am never\nhard upon her, for she's such a clever little thing. Would you believe it?\nShe said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, 'the greatest\nfriend of her childhood'--just think of that--'greatest friend'--and what\nabout me? She has very strong feelings and memories, and, what's more, she\nuses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden\nwhen you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for\ninstance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early\nchildhood. Very likely it's standing there still; so there's no need to\nspeak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, they don't change quickly. 'Mamma,' she said, 'I remember\nthis pine-tree as in a dream,' only she said something so original about\nit that I can't repeat it. Besides, I've forgotten it. Well, good-by! I am\nso worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I've\nbeen out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as you\nalways can so charmingly. Lise,\" she cried, going to her door, \"here I've\nbrought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at all\nangry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you could\nsuppose so.\"\n\n\"_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.\"\n\nAlyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed\ncrimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do\nin such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as though\nthey were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.\n\n\"Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told\nme all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know,\nalthough mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to\nanother ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the money and how\nis that poor man getting on?\"\n\n\"The fact is I didn't give it to him, and it's a long story,\" answered\nAlyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret at\nhaving failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away, and\nthat he, too, was trying to talk of other things.\n\nAlyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the\nfirst words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise's\nattention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of the\nstrong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling his\nstory well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been fond of\ncoming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him, what\nhe had read, or what he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had\nmade day-dreams and woven whole romances together--generally cheerful and\namusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in\nMoscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyosha\ndescribed Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how the\nluckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her hands\nand crying out:\n\n\"So you didn't give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, you\nought to have run after him!\"\n\n\"No, Lise; it's better I didn't run after him,\" said Alyosha, getting up\nfrom his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.\n\n\"How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is\nhopeless?\"\n\n\"Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them. He'll\ntake the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to take it,\" said\nAlyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. \"You see, Lise,\" he went on,\nstopping suddenly before her, \"I made one blunder, but that, even that, is\nall for the best.\"\n\n\"What blunder, and why is it for the best?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he has\nsuffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why he took\noffense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did not\nknow that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now that there\nwas a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise in\nhis position.... To begin with, he was sore at having been so glad of the\nmoney in my presence and not having concealed it from me. If he had been\npleased, but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun\naffecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take\nmoney, he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinely\ndelighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful\nman--that's the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, his\nvoice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept laughing\nsuch a laugh, or perhaps he was crying--yes, I am sure he was crying, he\nwas so delighted--and he talked about his daughters--and about the situation\nhe could get in another town.... And when he had poured out his heart, he\nfelt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to\nhate me at once. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What\nhad made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and\naccepted me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried\nto intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing\nme; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came to\nfeel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very important\none. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to\nanother town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give\nhim as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once.\nWhy, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise,\nit's awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look\nat him as though they were his benefactors.... I've heard that; Father\nZossima told me so. I don't know how to put it, but I have often seen it\nmyself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of it was that\nthough he did not know, up to the very last minute, that he would trample\non the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that.\nThat's just what made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment....\nAnd though it's so dreadful, it's all for the best. In fact, I believe\nnothing better could have happened.\"\n\n\"Why, why could nothing better have happened?\" cried Lise, looking with\ngreat surprise at Alyosha.\n\n\"Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he\nwould be crying with mortification, that's just what would have happened.\nAnd most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps have\nflung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now. But now\nhe has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he knows he has\n'ruined himself.' So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept\nthe two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his\nhonor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot.... He couldn't\nknow when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yet\nhe is in terrible need of that money. Though he is proud of himself now,\nyet even to-day he'll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will think\nof it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning\nhe may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. It's just then that I'll\nappear. 'Here, you are a proud man,' I shall say: 'you have shown it; but\nnow take the money and forgive us!' And then he will take it!\"\n\nAlyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, \"And then\nhe will take it!\" Lise clapped her hands.\n\n\"Ah, that's true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you\nknow all this? So young and yet he knows what's in the heart.... I should\nnever have worked it out.\"\n\n\"The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing\nwith us, in spite of his taking money from us,\" Alyosha went on in his\nexcitement, \"and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.\"\n\n\" 'On a higher footing' is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, go\non!\"\n\n\"You mean there isn't such an expression as 'on a higher footing'; but\nthat doesn't matter because--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, of course it doesn't matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You\nknow, I scarcely respected you till now--that is I respected you but on an\nequal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing.\nDon't be angry, dear, at my joking,\" she put in at once, with strong\nfeeling. \"I am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, Alexey\nFyodorovitch. Isn't there in all our analysis--I mean your analysis ... no,\nbetter call it ours--aren't we showing contempt for him, for that poor\nman--in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? In\ndeciding so certainly that he will take the money?\"\n\n\"No, Lise, it's not contempt,\" Alyosha answered, as though he had prepared\nhimself for the question. \"I was thinking of that on the way here. How can\nit be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all just the same as\nhe is? For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, we\nshould have been just the same in his place.... I don't know about you,\nLise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul\nis not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have\nno contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care for\nmost people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one\nwould for the sick in hospitals.\"\n\n\"Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the\nsick!\"\n\n\"Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. I\nam sometimes very impatient and at other times I don't see things. It's\ndifferent with you.\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!\"\n\n\"I am so glad you say so, Lise.\"\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sort\nof formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door,\nopen it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,\" said Lise, in a\nnervous, hurried whisper.\n\nAlyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.\n\n\"Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" Lise went on, flushing redder and\nredder. \"Give me your hand--that's right. I have to make a great\nconfession, I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,\" and\nshe hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly\nashamed of the confession.\n\nSuddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.\n\n\"Ah, Lise, what a good thing!\" cried Alyosha joyfully. \"You know, I was\nperfectly sure you were in earnest.\"\n\n\"Sure? Upon my word!\" She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it,\nblushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. \"I kiss his hand and he\nsays, 'What a good thing!' \"\n\nBut her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.\n\n\"I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don't know how to do it,\"\nhe muttered, blushing too.\n\n\"Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as his\nwife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What a\nthing to say! Why, that's impertinence--that's what it is.\"\n\n\"Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?\" Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly.\n\n\"Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,\" cried Lise,\nlooking tenderly and happily at him.\n\nAlyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down and\nkissed her on her lips.\n\n\"Oh, what are you doing?\" cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.\n\n\"Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't.... Perhaps I'm awfully stupid.... You said\nI was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.\"\n\nLise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. \"And in that dress!\" she\nejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing and\nbecame serious, almost stern.\n\n\"Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and we\nshall have a long time to wait,\" she ended suddenly. \"Tell me rather why\nyou who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a little\nidiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I don't\ndeserve you a bit.\"\n\n\"You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days.\nIf I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. _He_ told me to marry,\ntoo. Whom could I marry better than you--and who would have me except you?\nI have been thinking it over. In the first place, you've known me from a\nchild and you've a great many qualities I haven't. You are more light-\nhearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. I have been\nbrought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah, you don't\nknow, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do laugh and\nmake jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do. You laugh\nlike a little child, but you think like a martyr.\"\n\n\"Like a martyr? How?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren't showing contempt\nfor that poor man by dissecting his soul--that was the question of a\nsufferer.... You see, I don't know how to express it, but any one who\nthinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your invalid\nchair you must have thought over many things already.\"\n\n\"Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?\" murmured Lise in\na failing voice, weak with happiness. \"Listen, Alyosha. What will you wear\nwhen you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Don't laugh, don't\nbe angry, it's very, very important to me.\"\n\n\"I haven't thought about the suit, Lise; but I'll wear whatever you like.\"\n\n\"I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white pique\nwaistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I\ndidn't care for you when I said I didn't mean what I wrote?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't believe it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.\"\n\n\"You see, I knew that you--seemed to care for me, but I pretended to\nbelieve that you didn't care for me to make it--easier for you.\"\n\n\"That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully\nfond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I\ndecided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly\nand gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean\nthat you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply a\nstupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the\nletter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as\nnot to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this\nmorning, in this pocket. Here it is.\"\n\nAlyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance.\n\n\"But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.\"\n\n\"Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!\"\n\n\"I told a lie if you like,\" Alyosha laughed, too. \"I told a lie so as not\nto give you back the letter. It's very precious to me,\" he added suddenly,\nwith strong feeling, and again he flushed. \"It always will be, and I won't\ngive it up to any one!\"\n\nLise looked at him joyfully. \"Alyosha,\" she murmured again, \"look at the\ndoor. Isn't mamma listening?\"\n\n\"Very well, Lise, I'll look; but wouldn't it be better not to look? Why\nsuspect your mother of such meanness?\"\n\n\"What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it's her right, it's\nnot meanness!\" cried Lise, firing up. \"You may be sure, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself I\nshall certainly spy on her!\"\n\n\"Really, Lise? That's not right.\"\n\n\"Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were listening\nto some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness, but when her\nown daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you know\nI shall spy upon you as soon as we are married, and let me tell you I\nshall open all your letters and read them, so you may as well be\nprepared.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, if so--\" muttered Alyosha, \"only it's not right.\"\n\n\"Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won't quarrel the very first day.\nI'd better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it's very wrong to spy on\npeople, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall spy on\nyou all the same.\"\n\n\"Do, then; you won't find out anything,\" laughed Alyosha.\n\n\"And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most\nimportant things. Even if you don't agree with me, I shall do my duty in\nthe most important things.\"\n\n\"That's right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only\nin the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready to vow to\ndo so now--in everything, and for all my life!\" cried Lise fervently, \"and\nI'll do it gladly, gladly! What's more, I'll swear never to spy on you,\nnever once, never to read one of your letters. For you are right and I am\nnot. And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won't do\nit since you consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now....\nListen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately--both\nyesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but I\nsee you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,\" answered Alyosha mournfully. \"I see\nyou love me, since you guessed that.\"\n\n\"What grief? What about? Can you tell me?\" asked Lise with timid entreaty.\n\n\"I'll tell you later, Lise--afterwards,\" said Alyosha, confused. \"Now you\nwouldn't understand it perhaps--and perhaps I couldn't explain it.\"\n\n\"I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, my brothers too,\" murmured Alyosha, pondering.\n\n\"I don't like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,\" said Lise suddenly.\n\nHe noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.\n\n\"My brothers are destroying themselves,\" he went on, \"my father, too. And\nthey are destroying others with them. It's 'the primitive force of the\nKaramazovs,' as Father Paissy said the other day, a crude, unbridled,\nearthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I\ndon't know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk!\nAm I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"And perhaps I don't even believe in God.\"\n\n\"You don't believe? What is the matter?\" said Lise quietly and gently. But\nAlyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective\nin these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing\nhim.\n\n\"And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is\ngoing, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am\nwith him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise....\nFor the future we will be together.\"\n\n\"Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all\nour lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.\"\n\nAlyosha kissed her.\n\n\"Come, now go. Christ be with you!\" and she made the sign of the cross\nover him. \"Make haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see I've kept you\ncruelly. I'll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy!\nShall we be happy, shall we?\"\n\n\"I believe we shall, Lise.\"\n\nAlyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going\nout of the house without saying good-by to her. But no sooner had he\nopened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From\nthe first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to\nmeet him.\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and\nridiculous. I trust you won't dream--It's foolishness, nothing but\nfoolishness!\" she said, attacking him at once.\n\n\"Only don't tell her that,\" said Alyosha, \"or she will be upset, and\nthat's bad for her now.\"\n\n\"Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you\nonly agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you\ndidn't want to irritate her by contradiction?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,\" Alyosha declared\nstoutly.\n\n\"To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first place\nI shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you may\nbe sure of that.\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Alyosha. \"It's all so far off. We may have to wait\nanother year and a half.\"\n\n\"Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that's true, of course, and you'll have time to\nquarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am so\nunhappy! Though it's such nonsense, it's a great blow to me. I feel like\nFamusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky and she\nis Sofya, and, only fancy, I've run down to meet you on the stairs, and in\nthe play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I\nalmost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her\nhysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother.\nI might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still,\nwhat is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!\"\n\n\"No, there's no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.\"\n\n\"She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her aunts\nare here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs.\nHerzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn't know what to do for\nhim. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home in\nmy carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! It's true\nnothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all that's holy,\nin the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch.\nI'm her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.\"\n\n\"No, I won't show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn't. I am\ncoming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but now\ngood-by!\"\n\nAnd Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.\n\n\n\nChapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar\n\n\nHe had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-by to Lise,\nthe thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his\nbrother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting\nlate, nearly three o'clock. Alyosha's whole soul turned to the monastery,\nto his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed\neverything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about\nto happen grew stronger in Alyosha's mind with every hour. What that\ncatastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he\ncould perhaps not have said definitely. \"Even if my benefactor must die\nwithout me, anyway I won't have to reproach myself all my life with the\nthought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and\nhastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great\nprecept.\"\n\nHis plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the\nfence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the\nsummer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not\nannounce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain\nhidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If,\nas before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be\nvery likely to come to the summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, give\nmuch thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even\nif it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.\n\nEverything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost\nin the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-house\nunseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the house and Foma\ntoo, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and obey his\ninstructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden, or might\nwarn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.\n\nThere was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait.\nHe looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him as a great deal\nmore ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, it\nseemed a wretched little place this time. There was a circle on the table,\nleft no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before.\nFoolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in\na time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat down\nprecisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat. At last\nhe felt very depressed--depressed by suspense and uncertainty. But he had\nnot sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly heard the\nthrum of a guitar somewhere quite close. People were sitting, or had only\njust sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away.\nAlyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the\nday before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among\nthe bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it\nnow. Who were they?\n\nA man's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying\nhimself on the guitar:\n\n\n    With invincible force\n    I am bound to my dear.\n    O Lord, have mercy\n    On her and on me!\n    On her and on me!\n    On her and on me!\n\n\nThe voice ceased. It was a lackey's tenor and a lackey's song. Another\nvoice, a woman's, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though with\nmincing affectation:\n\n\"Why haven't you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why do\nyou always look down upon us?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" answered a man's voice politely, but with emphatic dignity.\nIt was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the woman\nwas making advances. \"I believe the man must be Smerdyakov,\" thought\nAlyosha, \"from his voice. And the lady must be the daughter of the house\nhere, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail\nand goes to Marfa for soup.\"\n\n\"I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,\" the woman's\nvoice continued. \"Why don't you go on?\"\n\nThe man sang again:\n\n\n    What do I care for royal wealth\n    If but my dear one be in health?\n    Lord have mercy\n    On her and on me!\n    On her and on me!\n    On her and on me!\n\n\n\"It was even better last time,\" observed the woman's voice. \"You sang 'If\nmy darling be in health'; it sounded more tender. I suppose you've\nforgotten to-day.\"\n\n\"Poetry is rubbish!\" said Smerdyakov curtly.\n\n\"Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.\"\n\n\"So far as it's poetry, it's essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who\never talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though it\nwere decreed by government, we shouldn't say much, should we? Poetry is no\ngood, Marya Kondratyevna.\"\n\n\"How clever you are! How is it you've gone so deep into everything?\" The\nwoman's voice was more and more insinuating.\n\n\"I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, if\nit had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have shot a\nman in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy\nbeggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my teeth in\nMoscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.\nGrigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but I\nwould have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not\nhave come into the world at all. They used to say in the market, and your\nmamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair\nwas like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a wee\nbit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said 'a little bit,' like\nevery one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant's\nfeeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with an\neducated man? He can't be said to have feeling at all, in his ignorance.\nFrom my childhood up when I hear 'a wee bit,' I am ready to burst with\nrage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.\"\n\n\"If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn't have\ntalked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's more, I\nshould like to abolish all soldiers.\"\n\n\"And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?\"\n\n\"There's no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia\nby Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, and\nit would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A clever nation\nwould have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We should have had\nquite different institutions.\"\n\n\"Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldn't\nchange a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,\" observed Marya\nKondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a most\nlanguishing glance.\n\n\"That's as one prefers.\"\n\n\"But you are just like a foreigner--just like a most gentlemanly foreigner.\nI tell you that, though it makes me bashful.\"\n\n\"If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in\ntheir vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished\nboots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russian\npeople want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday,\nthough he is mad, and all his children.\"\n\n\"You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly. He\nis mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have left\nhere long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his\nbehavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesn't know how to do\nanything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only a soup-\nmaker, but with luck I could open a cafe restaurant in Petrovka, in\nMoscow, for my cookery is something special, and there's no one in Moscow,\nexcept the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special. Dmitri\nFyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of the first\ncount in the country, he'd fight him. Though in what way is he better than\nI am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has\nwasted without any need!\"\n\n\"It must be lovely, a duel,\" Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers with\npistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady. A\nperfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I'd give\nanything to see one!\"\n\n\"It's all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is firing\nstraight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You'd be glad to run\naway, Marya Kondratyevna.\"\n\n\"You don't mean you would run away?\" But Smerdyakov did not deign to\nreply. After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sang\nagain in the same falsetto:\n\n\n    Whatever you may say,\n    I shall go far away.\n    Life will be bright and gay\n    In the city far away.\n    I shall not grieve,\n    I shall not grieve at all,\n    I don't intend to grieve at all.\n\n\nThen something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were\nsilent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakov\ndressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhaps\ncurled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His companion was the daughter\nof the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long. She\nwas young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was so\nround and terribly freckled.\n\n\"Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?\" asked Alyosha with as much\ncomposure as he could.\n\nSmerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.\n\n\"How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It's not as if I were his\nkeeper,\" answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.\n\n\"But I simply asked whether you do know?\" Alyosha explained.\n\n\"I know nothing of his whereabouts and don't want to.\"\n\n\"But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the\nhouse, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.\"\n\nSmerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.\n\n\"And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?\"\nhe asked, looking at Alyosha.\n\n\"I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to the\nsummer-house. I hope you'll forgive me,\" he added, addressing Marya\nKondratyevna. \"I was in a hurry to find my brother.\"\n\n\"Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!\" drawled Marya\nKondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. \"For Dmitri Fyodorovitch\noften goes to the summer-house in that way. We don't know he is here and\nhe is sitting in the summer-house.\"\n\n\"I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now.\nBelieve me, it's on business of great importance to him.\"\n\n\"He never tells us,\" lisped Marya Kondratyevna.\n\n\"Though I used to come here as a friend,\" Smerdyakov began again, \"Dmitri\nFyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant\nquestions about the master. 'What news?' he'll ask. 'What's going on in\nthere now? Who's coming and going?' and can't I tell him something more.\nTwice already he's threatened me with death.\"\n\n\"With death?\" Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper, which you had a\nchance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let Agrafena\nAlexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll be the first to\nsuffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more\nafraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what he\nmight not do!\"\n\n\"His honor said to him the other day, 'I'll pound you in a mortar!' \"\nadded Marya Kondratyevna.\n\n\"Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,\" observed Alyosha.\n\"If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.\"\n\n\"Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,\" said Smerdyakov, as though\nthinking better of it; \"I am here as an old friend and neighbor, and it\nwould be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent\nme first thing this morning to your brother's lodging in Lake Street,\nwithout a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine\nwith him at the restaurant here, in the market-place. I went, but didn't\nfind Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o'clock. 'He's been\nhere, but he is quite gone,' those were the very words of his landlady.\nIt's as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this\nmoment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan\nFyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone\nan hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not\nto speak of me and of what I have told you, for he'd kill me for nothing\nat all.\"\n\n\"Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?\" repeated Alyosha\nquickly.\n\n\"That's so.\"\n\n\"The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?\"\n\n\"The very same.\"\n\n\"That's quite likely,\" cried Alyosha, much excited. \"Thank you,\nSmerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once.\"\n\n\"Don't betray me,\" Smerdyakov called after him.\n\n\"Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don't be anxious.\"\n\n\"But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you,\" cried Marya Kondratyevna.\n\n\"No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again.\"\n\nWhat he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the\ntavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic\ndress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them\ndown. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his\nbrother Ivan called down to him from it.\n\n\"Alyosha, can't you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.\"\n\n\"To be sure I can, only I don't quite know whether in this dress--\"\n\n\"But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I'll run down to meet you.\"\n\nA minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone\ndining.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Brothers Make Friends\n\n\nIvan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by\na screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was the\nfirst room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters were\ncontinually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an\nold retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual\nbustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for\nthe waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the\ndrone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this\ntavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he\nreflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.\n\n\"Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don't live on tea alone, I\nsuppose,\" cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha.\nHe had finished dinner and was drinking tea.\n\n\"Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,\" said Alyosha gayly.\n\n\"And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love\ncherry jam when you were little?\"\n\n\"You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.\"\n\nIvan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.\n\n\"I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I\nwas nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between fifteen and eleven\nthat brothers are never companions at those ages. I don't know whether I\nwas fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years I\nnever thought of you at all. Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we\nonly met once somewhere, I believe. And now I've been here more than three\nmonths, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I\nam going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see you\nto say good-by and just then you passed.\"\n\n\"Were you very anxious to see me, then?\"\n\n\"Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me.\nAnd then to say good-by. I believe it's always best to get to know people\njust before leaving them. I've noticed how you've been looking at me these\nthree months. There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes,\nand I can't endure that. That's how it is I've kept away from you. But in\nthe end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I\nthought. Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don't you?\nI like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if\nthey are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy\nme, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love\nme for some reason, Alyosha?\"\n\n\"I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you--Ivan is a tomb! I say of you,\nIvan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand\nsomething in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" laughed Ivan.\n\n\"You won't be angry?\" Alyosha laughed too.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that\nyou are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have I\ninsulted you dreadfully?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,\" cried Ivan, warmly and\ngood-humoredly. \"Would you believe it that ever since that scene with her,\nI have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as\nthough you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I've been sitting\nhere thinking to myself: that if I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith\nin the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in\nfact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden\nchaos, if I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment--still I\nshould want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn\naway from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure to\nleave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away--where I don't\nknow. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over\neverything--every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I've asked\nmyself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would\novercome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I've\ncome to the conclusion that there isn't, that is till I am thirty, and\nthen I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive\nmoralists--and poets especially--often call that thirst for life base. It's\na feature of the Karamazovs, it's true, that thirst for life regardless of\neverything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal\nforce on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing\nfor life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe\nin the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they\nopen in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves\nyou know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by\nmen, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old\nhabit one's heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you,\neat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate soup, they know how to make\nit here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here.\nAnd yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it's a most\nprecious graveyard, that's what it is! Precious are the dead that lie\nthere, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of\nsuch passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their\nscience, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and\nweep over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been\nnothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply\nbecause I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion.\nI love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky--that's all it is. It's\nnot a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving with one's inside, with\none's stomach. One loves the first strength of one's youth. Do you\nunderstand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?\" Ivan laughed suddenly.\n\n\"I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one's inside, with\none's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have\nsuch a longing for life,\" cried Alyosha. \"I think every one should love\nlife above everything in the world.\"\n\n\"Love life more than the meaning of it?\"\n\n\"Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless\nof logic, and it's only then one will understand the meaning of it. I have\nthought so a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan, you love life, now\nyou've only to try to do the second half and you are saved.\"\n\n\"You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does your\nsecond half mean?\"\n\n\"Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all.\nCome, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.\"\n\n\"I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such _professions de\nfoi_ from such--novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it true\nthat you mean to leave the monastery?\"\n\n\"Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.\"\n\n\"We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I am\nthirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesn't want\nto turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of hanging on to\neighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too seriously, though he is a\nbuffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he stands on his sensuality--though\nafter we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on.... But\nto hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain 'a\nshadow of nobility' by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?\"\n\n\"No, but I saw Smerdyakov,\" and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,\ndescribed his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously and\nquestioned him.\n\n\"But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,\" added\nAlyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.\n\n\"Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but\nnow there's no need,\" said Ivan reluctantly.\n\n\"But are you really going so soon, brother?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\" asked Alyosha anxiously.\n\n\"You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my\nbrother Dmitri's keeper?\" Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly\nsmiled bitterly. \"Cain's answer about his murdered brother, wasn't it?\nPerhaps that's what you're thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I\ncan't stay here to be their keeper, can I? I've finished what I had to do,\nand I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I've been\ntrying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?\nNonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished\nit just now, you were witness.\"\n\n\"At Katerina Ivanovna's?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I've released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to\ndo with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn't come in. I had my own business to settle\nwith Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as\nthough there was an understanding between us. I didn't ask him to do it,\nbut he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It's all\ntoo funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would\nyou believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering\nchampagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It's been going on\nnearly six months, and all at once I've thrown it off. I could never have\nguessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I\nwanted.\"\n\n\"You are speaking of your love, Ivan?\"\n\n\"Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried\nmyself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all at\nonce it's collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went\naway and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it's the literal\ntruth.\"\n\n\"You seem very merry about it now,\" observed Alyosha, looking into his\nface, which had suddenly grown brighter.\n\n\"But how could I tell that I didn't care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears\nafter all I didn't. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she was\njust now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully\neven now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?\"\n\n\"No, only perhaps it wasn't love.\"\n\n\"Alyosha,\" laughed Ivan, \"don't make reflections about love, it's unseemly\nfor you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I've forgotten\nto kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly was sitting\nby a 'laceration.' Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not\nDmitri,\" Ivan insisted gayly. \"Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self-\nlaceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worst of\nit is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she\ndoesn't care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she\nmay never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it's\nbetter so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What\nhappened after I departed?\"\n\nAlyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard,\nunconscious and delirious.\n\n\"Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it on?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don't matter. God\ngave woman hysterics as a relief. I won't go to her at all. Why push\nmyself forward again?\"\n\n\"But you told her that she had never cared for you.\"\n\n\"I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us\ndrink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!\"\n\n\"No, brother, we had better not drink,\" said Alyosha suddenly. \"Besides I\nfeel somehow depressed.\"\n\n\"Yes, you've been depressed a long time, I've noticed it.\"\n\n\"Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?\"\n\n\"Morning? I didn't say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it may\nbe the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid\ndining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long ago, so\nfar as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my going away?\nWe've plenty of time before I go, an eternity!\"\n\n\"If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?\"\n\n\"But what does it matter to us?\" laughed Ivan. \"We've time enough for our\ntalk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why\nhave we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man\nand Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the\nEmperor Napoleon? Is that it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but we in our\ngreen youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. That's what\nwe care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternal\nquestions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practical\nquestions. Why have you been looking at me in expectation for the last\nthree months? To ask me, 'What do you believe, or don't you believe at\nall?' That's what your eyes have been meaning for these three months,\nhaven't they?\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" smiled Alyosha. \"You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?\"\n\n\"Me laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has been\nwatching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look straight\nat me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not a\nnovice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, I\nmean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit down\nin a corner. They've never met in their lives before and, when they go out\nof the tavern, they won't meet again for forty years. And what do they\ntalk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions,\nof the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe in\nGod talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanity\non a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same, they're the same\nquestions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most original\nRussian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions! Isn't it so?\"\n\n\"Yes, for real Russians the questions of God's existence and of\nimmortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come\nfirst and foremost, of course, and so they should,\" said Alyosha, still\nwatching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.\n\n\"Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but\nanything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can\nhardly imagine. But there's one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully\nfond of.\"\n\n\"How nicely you put that in!\" Alyosha laughed suddenly.\n\n\"Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God,\neh?\"\n\n\"Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father's that there was\nno God.\" Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.\n\n\"I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your\neyes glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with you, and I say so\nvery seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have no\nfriends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept God,\"\nlaughed Ivan; \"that's a surprise for you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.\"\n\n\"Joking? I was told at the elder's yesterday that I was joking. You know,\ndear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared\nthat, if there were no God, he would have to be invented. _S'il n'existait\npas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer._ And man has actually invented God. And\nwhat's strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really\nexist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God,\ncould enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it\nis, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me,\nI've long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And I\nwon't go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject,\nall derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis there, is an\naxiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their\nteachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys\nthemselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming at\nnow? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature,\nthat is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope,\nthat's it, isn't it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply.\nBut you must note this: if God exists and if He really did create the\nworld, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of\nEuclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in\nspace. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,\nand even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole\nuniverse, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created in\nEuclid's geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which\naccording to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in\ninfinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can't understand\neven that, I can't expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly\nthat I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian\nearthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world?\nAnd I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha,\nespecially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are\nutterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three\ndimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's more, I accept\nHis wisdom, His purpose--which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the\nunderlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony\nin which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to\nWhich the universe is striving, and Which Itself was 'with God,' and Which\nItself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of\nphrases for it. I seem to be on the right path, don't I? Yet would you\nbelieve it, in the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and,\nalthough I know it exists, I don't accept it at all. It's not that I don't\naccept God, you must understand, it's the world created by Him I don't and\ncannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that suffering\nwill be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of\nhuman contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the\ndespicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind\nof man, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony,\nsomething so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all\nhearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all\nthe crimes of humanity, of all the blood they've shed; that it will make\nit not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with\nmen--but though all that may come to pass, I don't accept it. I won't\naccept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see\nit and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it. That's what's at\nthe root of me, Alyosha; that's my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I\nbegan our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I've led up to my\nconfession, for that's all you want. You didn't want to hear about God,\nbut only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I've told\nyou.\"\n\nIvan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.\n\n\"And why did you begin 'as stupidly as you could'?\" asked Alyosha, looking\ndreamily at him.\n\n\"To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on\nsuch subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And secondly,\nthe stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is,\nthe clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence\nwriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is\nhonest and straightforward. I've led the conversation to my despair, and\nthe more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.\"\n\n\"You will explain why you don't accept the world?\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"To be sure I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading up\nto. Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn you from\nyour stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.\" Ivan smiled suddenly\nquite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile on\nhis face before.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Rebellion\n\n\n\"I must make you one confession,\" Ivan began. \"I could never understand\nhow one can love one's neighbors. It's just one's neighbors, to my mind,\nthat one can't love, though one might love those at a distance. I once\nread somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen\nbeggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and\nbegan breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some\nawful disease. I am convinced that he did that from 'self-laceration,'\nfrom the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed\nby duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must be\nhidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.\"\n\n\"Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,\" observed Alyosha; \"he,\ntoo, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced\nin love, from loving him. But yet there's a great deal of love in mankind,\nand almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.\"\n\n\"Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and the\ninnumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether\nthat's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's inherent in their\nnature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible\non earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer\nintensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is another\nand not I. And what's more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's\nsuffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you\nthink? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I\nonce trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering;\ndegrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me--hunger, for\ninstance--my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher\nsuffering--for an idea, for instance--he will very rarely admit that,\nperhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man\nshould have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of\nhis favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially\ngenteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity\nthrough the newspapers. One can love one's neighbors in the abstract, or\neven at a distance, but at close quarters it's almost impossible. If it\nwere as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear\nsilken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then\none might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But\nenough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to\nspeak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine\nourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my\nargument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we'd better keep to the\nchildren, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children\ncan be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when\nthey are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second\nreason why I won't speak of grown-up people is that, besides being\ndisgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation--they've eaten\nthe apple and know good and evil, and they have become 'like gods.' They\ngo on eating it still. But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so\nfar innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you\nwill understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer\nhorribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins, they must be\npunished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning\nis of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on\nearth. The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially\nsuch innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond\nof children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious,\nthe Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they\nare quite little--up to seven, for instance--are so remote from grown-up\npeople; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.\nI knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a\nburglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when he\nwas in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time\nat his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He\ntrained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends\nwith him.... You don't know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My\nhead aches and I am sad.\"\n\n\"You speak with a strange air,\" observed Alyosha uneasily, \"as though you\nwere not quite yourself.\"\n\n\"By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,\" Ivan went on, seeming\nnot to hear his brother's words, \"told me about the crimes committed by\nTurks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general\nrising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and\nchildren, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them\nso till morning, and in the morning they hang them--all sorts of things you\ncan't imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a\ngreat injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as\na man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all\nhe can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he\nwere able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children,\ntoo; cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and tossing babies\nup in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before\ntheir mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes was what gave zest\nto the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.\nImagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading\nTurks around her. They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to\nmake it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points\na pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee,\nholds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the\nbaby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it? By the way,\nTurks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.\"\n\n\"Brother, what are you driving at?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he has\ncreated him in his own image and likeness.\"\n\n\"Just as he did God, then?\" observed Alyosha.\n\n\" 'It's wonderful how you can turn words,' as Polonius says in _Hamlet_,\"\nlaughed Ivan. \"You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours must\nbe a fine God, if man created Him in his image and likeness. You asked\njust now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond of collecting certain\nfacts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort\nfrom newspapers and books, and I've already got a fine collection. The\nTurks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have\nspecimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we\nprefer beating--rods and scourges--that's our national institution. Nailing\nears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod\nand the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us.\nAbroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws\nhave been passed, so that they don't dare to flog men now. But they make\nup for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that it\nwould be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being\ninoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.\nI have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,\nquite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed--a young\nman, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the\nChristian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimate\nchild who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on\nthe Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up like\na little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and\nscarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock\nin cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite\nthe contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been\ngiven to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of\nfeeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like the\nProdigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to the\npigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't even give him that,\nand beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent all\nhis childhood and his youth, till he grew up and was strong enough to go\naway and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day laborer\nin Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by\nkilling and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to\ndeath. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was\nimmediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods,\nphilanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in\nprison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon\nhim, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his\ncrime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a\nmonster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace.\nAll Geneva was in excitement about him--all philanthropic and religious\nGeneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to\nthe prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; 'You are our brother, you\nhave found grace.' And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, 'Yes,\nI've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs' food, but\nnow even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.' 'Yes, Richard, die\nin the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though it's not your fault\nthat you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs' food and were\nbeaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing is\nforbidden); but you've shed blood and you must die.' And on the last day,\nRichard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute:\n'This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.' 'Yes,' cry the pastors\nand the judges and philanthropic ladies. 'This is the happiest day of your\nlife, for you are going to the Lord!' They all walk or drive to the\nscaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call to\nRichard: 'Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!'\nAnd so, covered with his brothers' kisses, Richard is dragged on to the\nscaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head in\nbrotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, that's characteristic.\nThat pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists\nof aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed\ngratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is\ninteresting because it's national. Though to us it's absurd to cut off a\nman's head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet we\nhave our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical pastime is\nthe direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov\ndescribing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, 'on its meek eyes,'\nevery one must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian. He describes how a\nfeeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move.\nThe peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what\nhe is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over\nand over again. 'However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.'\nThe nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature\non its weeping, on its 'meek eyes.' The frantic beast tugs and draws the\nload, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort\nof unnatural spasmodic action--it's awful in Nekrassov. But that's only a\nhorse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught\nus, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can\nbe beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own\nchild with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it.\nThe papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. 'It stings more,'\nsaid he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there\nare people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal\nsensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. They\nbeat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more\nsavagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps,\n'Daddy! daddy!' By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought\ninto court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a\nbarrister 'a conscience for hire.' The counsel protests in his client's\ndefense. 'It's such a simple thing,' he says, 'an everyday domestic event.\nA father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought into\ncourt.' The jury, convinced by him, give a favorable verdict. The public\nroars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't\nthere! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor!\nCharming pictures.\n\n\"But I've still better things about children. I've collected a great,\ngreat deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of\nfive who was hated by her father and mother, 'most worthy and respectable\npeople, of good education and breeding.' You see, I must repeat again, it\nis a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing\nchildren, and children only. To all other types of humanity these\ntorturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane\nEuropeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of\nchildren themselves in that sense. It's just their defenselessness that\ntempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no\nrefuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of\ncourse, a demon lies hidden--the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat\nat the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off\nthe chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney\ndisease, and so on.\n\n\"This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those\ncultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason\ntill her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of\ncruelty--shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and\nbecause she didn't ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five\nsleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they\nsmeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her\nmother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor\nchild's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even\nunderstand what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with\nher tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful\ntears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and\nbrother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy\nmust be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have\nexisted on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he\nknow that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole\nworld of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to 'dear, kind God'! I\nsay nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the\napple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am\nmaking you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if you\nlike.\"\n\n\"Never mind. I want to suffer too,\" muttered Alyosha.\n\n\"One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic,\nand I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities.\nI've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was in the darkest days of\nserfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of\nthe People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections,\nthe owner of great estates, one of those men--somewhat exceptional, I\nbelieve, even then--who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure,\nare convinced that they've earned absolute power over the lives of their\nsubjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his\nproperty of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor\nneighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of\nhundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys--all mounted, and in\nuniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in\nplay and hurt the paw of the general's favorite hound. 'Why is my favorite\ndog lame?' He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog's paw.\n'So you did it.' The general looked the child up and down. 'Take him.' He\nwas taken--taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that\nmorning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his\ndependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting\nparade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of\nthem all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from the\nlock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting.\nThe general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked.\nHe shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... 'Make him run,'\ncommands the general. 'Run! run!' shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... 'At\nhim!' yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the\nchild. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's\neyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of\nadministering his estates. Well--what did he deserve? To be shot? To be\nshot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!\"\n\n\"To be shot,\" murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale,\ntwisted smile.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Ivan, delighted. \"If even you say so.... You're a pretty\nmonk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha\nKaramazov!\"\n\n\"What I said was absurd, but--\"\n\n\"That's just the point, that 'but'!\" cried Ivan. \"Let me tell you, novice,\nthat the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on\nabsurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without\nthem. We know what we know!\"\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\n\"I understand nothing,\" Ivan went on, as though in delirium. \"I don't want\nto understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind\nlong ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be\nfalse to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.\"\n\n\"Why are you trying me?\" Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. \"Will you\nsay what you mean at last?\"\n\n\"Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You are dear to\nme, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up to your Zossima.\"\n\nIvan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.\n\n\"Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of the\nother tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to\nits center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. I\nam a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why the\nworld is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they\nwere given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven,\nthough they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity\nthem. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is\nthat there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows\neffect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level--but\nthat's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent to live\nby it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause\nfollows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?--I must have\njustice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite\ntime and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have\nbelieved in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise\nagain, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I\nhaven't suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure\nthe soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my\nown eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and\nembrace his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly\nunderstands what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are\nbuilt on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the\nchildren, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I can't\nanswer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions,\nbut I've only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so\nunanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal\nharmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It's beyond\nall comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the\nharmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the\nharmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. I\nunderstand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such\nsolidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must share\nresponsibility for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this\nworld and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that\nthe child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn't grow\nup, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I\nam not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the\nuniverse it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in one\nhymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: 'Thou\nart just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.' When the mother embraces the\nfiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears,\n'Thou art just, O Lord!' then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be\nreached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I\ncan't accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take\nmy own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I\nlive to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry\naloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child's torturer,\n'Thou art just, O Lord!' but I don't want to cry aloud then. While there\nis still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher\nharmony altogether. It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child\nwho beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its\nstinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to 'dear, kind God'! It's not\nworth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for,\nor there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them?\nIs it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging\nthem? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do,\nsince those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of\nharmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don't\nwant more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum\nof sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that\nthe truth is not worth such a price. I don't want the mother to embrace\nthe oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let\nher forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for\nthe immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings of\nher tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the\ntorturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if\nthey dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole\nworld a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I\ndon't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather\nbe left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my\nunavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_.\nBesides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to\npay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance\nticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as\npossible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha,\nonly I most respectfully return Him the ticket.\"\n\n\"That's rebellion,\" murmured Alyosha, looking down.\n\n\"Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,\" said Ivan earnestly. \"One can\nhardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I\nchallenge you--answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human\ndestiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace\nand rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to\ndeath only one tiny creature--that baby beating its breast with its fist,\nfor instance--and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you\nconsent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't consent,\" said Alyosha softly.\n\n\"And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would\nagree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood\nof a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?\"\n\n\"No, I can't admit it. Brother,\" said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing\neyes, \"you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would\nhave the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and He\ncan forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent\nblood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built\nthe edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, 'Thou art just, O Lord, for\nThy ways are revealed!' \"\n\n\"Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; on\nthe contrary I've been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring\nHim in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in the\nforeground. Do you know, Alyosha--don't laugh! I made a poem about a year\nago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\"You wrote a poem?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I didn't write it,\" laughed Ivan, \"and I've never written two\nlines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I\nremembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first\nreader--that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?\"\nsmiled Ivan. \"Shall I tell it to you?\"\n\n\"I am all attention,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"My poem is called 'The Grand Inquisitor'; it's a ridiculous thing, but I\nwant to tell it to you.\"\n\n\n\nChapter V. The Grand Inquisitor\n\n\n\"Even this must have a preface--that is, a literary preface,\" laughed Ivan,\n\"and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the\nsixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it\nwas customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to\nspeak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the\nmonasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the\nsaints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In\nthose days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo's _Notre Dame de\nParis_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in\nthe Hotel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the\nbirth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la tres sainte et\ngracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and\npronounces her _bon jugement_. Similar plays, chiefly from the Old\nTestament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of\nPeter the Great. But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and\nballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all\nthe powers of Heaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monks\nbusied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such\npoems--and even under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of\ncourse, from the Greek), _The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell_, with\ndescriptions as bold as Dante's. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel\nMichael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners and their\npunishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a\nburning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they\ncan't swim out, and 'these God forgets'--an expression of extraordinary\ndepth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the\nthrone of God and begs for mercy for all in hell--for all she has seen\nthere, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immensely\ninteresting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God points\nto the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, 'How can\nI forgive His tormentors?' she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all\nthe angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all\nwithout distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite of\nsuffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at\nonce raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, 'Thou art just, O\nLord, in this judgment.' Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it\nhad appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He says\nnothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed since\nHe promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophet\nwrote, 'Behold, I come quickly'; 'Of that day and that hour knoweth no\nman, neither the Son, but the Father,' as He Himself predicted on earth.\nBut humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh,\nwith greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to\nsee signs from heaven.\n\n\n    No signs from heaven come to-day\n    To add to what the heart doth say.\n\n\nThere was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true\nthere were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed\nmiraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were\nvisited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, and\ndoubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And\njust then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. \"A\nhuge star like to a torch\" (that is, to a church) \"fell on the sources of\nthe waters and they became bitter.\" These heretics began blasphemously\ndenying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent\nin their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before, awaited\nHis coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him as\nbefore. And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor, \"O Lord\nour God, hasten Thy coming,\" so many ages called upon Him, that in His\ninfinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He\nhad come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as is\nwritten in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the\ntruth of his words, bore witness that\n\n\n    Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,\n    Weary and worn, the Heavenly King\n    Our mother, Russia, came to bless,\n    And through our land went wandering.\n\n\nAnd that certainly was so, I assure you.\n\n\"And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the\ntortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him like\nchildren. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible time\nof the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God,\nand 'in the splendid _auto da fe_ the wicked heretics were burnt.' Oh, of\ncourse, this was not the coming in which He will appear according to His\npromise at the end of time in all His heavenly glory, and which will be\nsudden 'as lightning flashing from east to west.' No, He visited His\nchildren only for a moment, and there where the flames were crackling\nround the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men in\nthat human shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteen\ncenturies ago. He came down to the 'hot pavements' of the southern town in\nwhich on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, _ad majorem gloriam\nDei_, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent\n_auto da fe_, in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, the\ncardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole population\nof Seville.\n\n\"He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognized\nHim. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they\nrecognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround\nHim, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst\nwith a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His\nheart, light and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on\nthe people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His\nhands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with\nHim, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from\nchildhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!' and, as it\nwere, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd\nweeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before\nHim, sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is He--it is He!' all repeat. 'It must be\nHe, it can be no one but Him!' He stops at the steps of the Seville\ncathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little\nopen white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a\nprominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. 'He will raise\nyour child,' the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to\nmeet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead\nchild throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is Thou, raise my\nchild!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the\ncoffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His\nlips once more softly pronounce, 'Maiden, arise!' and the maiden arises.\nThe little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide-\nopen wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her\nhand.\n\n\"There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the\ncardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an\nold man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken\neyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his\ngorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning\nthe enemies of the Roman Church--at this moment he is wearing his coarse,\nold, monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants\nand slaves and the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and\nwatches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the\ncoffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He\nknits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He\nholds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power,\nso completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience\nto him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the\nmidst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The\ncrowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old\nInquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards\nlead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient\npalace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is\nfollowed by the dark, burning, 'breathless' night of Seville. The air is\n'fragrant with laurel and lemon.' In the pitch darkness the iron door of\nthe prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in\nwith a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind\nhim. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face.\nAt last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.\n\n\" 'Is it Thou? Thou?' but receiving no answer, he adds at once, 'Don't\nanswer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou\nwouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst\nsaid of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to\nhinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to-\nmorrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or\nonly a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee\nat the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have to-day\nkissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap\nup the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,'\nhe added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes\noff the Prisoner.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?\" Alyosha, who had been\nlistening in silence, said with a smile. \"Is it simply a wild fantasy, or\na mistake on the part of the old man--some impossible _quiproquo_?\"\n\n\"Take it as the last,\" said Ivan, laughing, \"if you are so corrupted by\nmodern realism and can't stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be a\ncase of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,\" he went on,\nlaughing, \"the old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his set\nidea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. It\nmight, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man of\nninety, over-excited by the _auto da fe_ of a hundred heretics the day\nbefore. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of\nidentity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should\nspeak out, should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for\nninety years.\"\n\n\"And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a word?\"\n\n\"That's inevitable in any case,\" Ivan laughed again. \"The old man has told\nHim He hasn't the right to add anything to what He has said of old. One\nmay say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my\nopinion at least. 'All has been given by Thee to the Pope,' they say, 'and\nall, therefore, is still in the Pope's hands, and there is no need for\nThee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.'\nThat's how they speak and write too--the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read\nit myself in the works of their theologians. 'Hast Thou the right to\nreveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast\ncome?' my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. 'No, Thou\nhast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, and\nmayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast\non earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men's freedom of\nfaith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of their\nfaith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years\nago. Didst Thou not often say then, \"I will make you free\"? But now Thou\nhast seen these \"free\" men,' the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive\nsmile. 'Yes, we've paid dearly for it,' he goes on, looking sternly at\nHim, 'but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen\ncenturies we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and\nover for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for good? Thou lookest\nmeekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tell\nThee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have\nperfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it\nhumbly at our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst?\nWas this Thy freedom?' \"\n\n\"I don't understand again,\" Alyosha broke in. \"Is he ironical, is he\njesting?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that\nat last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy.\n'For now' (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) 'for the first\ntime it has become possible to think of the happiness of men. Man was\ncreated a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,' he says\nto Him. 'Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst\nnot listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men\nmight be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the\nwork to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thou\nhast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thou\ncanst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder\nus?' \"\n\n\"And what's the meaning of 'no lack of admonitions and warnings'?\" asked\nAlyosha.\n\n\"Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say.\n\n\" 'The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and non-\nexistence,' the old man goes on, 'the great spirit talked with Thee in the\nwilderness, and we are told in the books that he \"tempted\" Thee. Is that\nso? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in\nthree questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is\ncalled \"the temptation\"? And yet if there has ever been on earth a real\nstupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three\ntemptations. The statement of those three questions was itself the\nmiracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument\nthat those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from\nthe books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to\ndo so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth--rulers, chief\npriests, learned men, philosophers, poets--and had set them the task to\ninvent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but\nexpress in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history of\nthe world and of humanity--dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of the\nearth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the\nthree questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and\nmighty spirit in the wilderness? From those questions alone, from the\nmiracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not with\nthe fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For in\nthose three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it\nwere, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them are\nunited all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature. At the\ntime it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that\nfifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three\nquestions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly\nfulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.\n\n\" 'Judge Thyself who was right--Thou or he who questioned Thee then?\nRemember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this: \"Thou\nwouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with some\npromise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural\nunruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread--for nothing\nhas ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than\nfreedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren\nwilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a\nflock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest\nThou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.\" But Thou wouldst not\ndeprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that\nfreedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply that\nman lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of that\nearthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will\nstrive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him, crying, \"Who\ncan compare with this beast? He has given us fire from heaven!\" Dost Thou\nknow that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of\ntheir sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only\nhunger? \"Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!\" that's what they'll write\non the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which they\nwill destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building;\nthe terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the one\nof old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new\ntower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for\nthey will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their\ntower. They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for\nwe shall be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to\nus, \"Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't\ngiven it!\" And then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishes\nthe building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name,\ndeclaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they feed\nthemselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as they\nremain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say\nto us, \"Make us your slaves, but feed us.\" They will understand\nthemselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are\ninconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share\nbetween them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free,\nfor they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. Thou didst promise\nthem the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly\nbread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And if\nfor the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is\nto become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures\nwho will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of\nthe heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the\ngreat and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea,\nwho are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and\nstrong? No, we care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but\nin the end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and look\non us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have\nfound so dreadful and to rule over them--so awful it will seem to them to\nbe free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in\nThy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us\nagain. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to\nlie.\n\n\" 'This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, and\nthis is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou\nhast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the great\nsecret of this world. Choosing \"bread,\" Thou wouldst have satisfied the\nuniversal and everlasting craving of humanity--to find some one to worship.\nSo long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so\npainfully as to find some one to worship. But man seeks to worship what is\nestablished beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship\nit. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or\nthe other can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and\nworship; what is essential is that all may be _together_ in it. This\ncraving for _community_ of worship is the chief misery of every man\nindividually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake\nof common worship they've slain each other with the sword. They have set\nup gods and challenged one another, \"Put away your gods and come and\nworship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!\" And so it will be to the\nend of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall\ndown before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but\nhave known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject\nthe one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down\nto Thee alone--the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for\nthe sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didst\nfurther. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man is\ntormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom he\ncan hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is\nborn. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their\nfreedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread,\nand man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But if\nsome one else gains possession of his conscience--oh! then he will cast\naway Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience. In\nthat Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is not only to live\nbut to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the\nobject of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather\ndestroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.\nThat is true. But what happened? Instead of taking men's freedom from\nthem, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man\nprefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of\ngood and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of\nconscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,\ninstead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at\nrest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and\nenigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men,\nacting as though Thou didst not love them at all--Thou who didst come to\ngive Thy life for them! Instead of taking possession of men's freedom,\nThou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with\nits sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man's free love, that he should\nfollow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the\nrigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself\nwhat is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as his\nguide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even Thy image\nand Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free\nchoice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, for\nthey could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou\nhast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.\n\n\" 'So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the\ndestruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet what\nwas offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone, able to\nconquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent\nrebels for their happiness--those forces are miracle, mystery and\nauthority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing\nso. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple\nand said to Thee, \"If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God\nthen cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up\nlest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art\nthe Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father.\"\nBut Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down. Oh, of course,\nThou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men,\nare they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in making\none movement to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have\nlost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against\nthat earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise spirit that tempted\nThee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And\ncouldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such a\ntemptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and\nat the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most\nagonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the\nheart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, would\nbe handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thou\ndidst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a\nmiracle. But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects\nGod too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And as man\ncannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new miracles of\nhis own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft,\nthough he might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thou\ndidst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and\nreviling Thee, \"Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art\nHe.\" Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a\nmiracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. Thou\ndidst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before\nthe might that has overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highly\nof men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by\nnature. Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon\nthem. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and\nbaser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he, can he do what Thou\ndidst? By showing him so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to\nfeel for him, for Thou didst ask far too much from him--Thou who hast loved\nhim more than Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less\nof him. That would have been more like love, for his burden would have\nbeen lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere now\nrebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the pride\nof a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and barring\nout the teacher at school. But their childish delight will end; it will\ncost them dear. They will cast down temples and drench the earth with\nblood. But they will see at last, the foolish children, that, though they\nare rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their own\nrebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears, they will recognize at last that\nHe who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them. They will say\nthis in despair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make\nthem more unhappy still, for man's nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in\nthe end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and\nunhappiness--that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so much\nfor their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in image, that he\nsaw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there were\nof each tribe twelve thousand. But if there were so many of them, they\nmust have been not men but gods. They had borne Thy cross, they had\nendured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living upon\nlocusts and roots--and Thou mayest indeed point with pride at those\nchildren of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy\nname. But remember that they were only some thousands; and what of the\nrest? And how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not\nendure what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that it\nis unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply come to\nthe elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and we cannot\nunderstand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right to preach a\nmystery, and to teach them that it's not the free judgment of their\nhearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which they must follow\nblindly, even against their conscience. So we have done. We have corrected\nThy work and have founded it upon _miracle_, _mystery_ and _authority_.\nAnd men rejoiced that they were again led like sheep, and that the\nterrible gift that had brought them such suffering was, at last, lifted\nfrom their hearts. Were we right teaching them this? Speak! Did we not\nlove mankind, so meekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly\nlightening their burden, and permitting their weak nature even sin with\nour sanction? Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look\nsilently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I don't want\nThy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anything\nfrom Thee? Don't I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is known\nto Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our mystery?\nPerhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not\nworking with Thee, but with _him_--that is our mystery. It's long--eight\ncenturies--since we have been on _his_ side and not on Thine. Just eight\ncenturies ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that\nlast gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We\ntook from him Rome and the sword of Caesar, and proclaimed ourselves sole\nrulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been able to complete our\nwork. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has\nbegun. It has long to await completion and the earth has yet much to\nsuffer, but we shall triumph and shall be Caesars, and then we shall plan\nthe universal happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then the\nsword of Caesar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst Thou accepted\nthat last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished all\nthat man seeks on earth--that is, some one to worship, some one to keep his\nconscience, and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious\nant-heap, for the craving for universal unity is the third and last\nanguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a\nuniversal state. There have been many great nations with great histories,\nbut the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for\nthey felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union.\nThe great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes\nover the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they too\nwere but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal\nunity. Hadst Thou taken the world and Caesar's purple, Thou wouldst have\nfounded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who can\nrule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his\nhands? We have taken the sword of Caesar, and in taking it, of course, have\nrejected Thee and followed _him_. Oh, ages are yet to come of the\nconfusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having\nbegun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,\nwith cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet\nand spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon the beast and\nraise the cup, and on it will be written, \"Mystery.\" But then, and only\nthen, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men. Thou art proud\nof Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we give rest to all.\nAnd besides, how many of those elect, those mighty ones who could become\nelect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will\ntransfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the\nother camp, and end by raising their _free_ banner against Thee. Thou\ndidst Thyself lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and will\nno more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shall\npersuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their\nfreedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right or shall we be\nlying? They will be convinced that we are right, for they will remember\nthe horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.\nFreedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and\nwill bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries,\nthat some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves,\nothers, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest,\nweak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: \"Yes,\nyou were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you,\nsave us from ourselves!\"\n\n\" 'Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread\nmade by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any miracle.\nThey will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but in truth they\nwill be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread\nitself! For they will remember only too well that in old days, without our\nhelp, even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands, while\nsince they have come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in\ntheir hands. Too, too well will they know the value of complete\nsubmission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to\nblame for their not knowing it?--speak! Who scattered the flock and sent it\nastray on unknown paths? But the flock will come together again and will\nsubmit once more, and then it will be once for all. Then we shall give\nthem the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by\nnature. Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst\nlift them up and thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them that\nthey are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike\nhappiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look to\nus and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvel\nat us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our being\nso powerful and clever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent\nflock of thousands of millions. They will tremble impotently before our\nwrath, their minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tears\nlike women and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from us\nto pass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes,\nwe shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their\nlife like a child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance. Oh, we\nshall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love\nus like children because we allow them to sin. We shall tell them that\nevery sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that we\nallow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these sins\nwe take upon ourselves. And we shall take it upon ourselves, and they will\nadore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins before\nGod. And they will have no secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid them\nto live with their wives and mistresses, to have or not to have\nchildren--according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient--and\nthey will submit to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets of\ntheir conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an\nanswer for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will\nsave them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present\nin making a free decision for themselves. And all will be happy, all the\nmillions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For\nonly we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will be\nthousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who\nhave taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.\nPeacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and\nbeyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the\nsecret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of\nheaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world, it\ncertainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that Thou wilt\ncome again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud and\nstrong, but we will say that they have only saved themselves, but we have\nsaved all. We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds\nin her hands the _mystery_, shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise\nup again, and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her\nloathsome body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the\nthousand millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we who have\ntaken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and\nsay: \"Judge us if Thou canst and darest.\" Know that I fear Thee not. Know\nthat I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on roots and\nlocusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and I\ntoo was striving to stand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful,\nthirsting \"to make up the number.\" But I awakened and would not serve\nmadness. I turned back and joined the ranks of those _who have corrected\nThy work_. I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness\nof the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will\nbe built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at\na sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on\nwhich I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if any one has ever\ndeserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn Thee. _Dixi._' \"\n\nIvan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with excitement;\nwhen he had finished, he suddenly smiled.\n\nAlyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved and\nseemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained himself.\nNow his words came with a rush.\n\n\"But ... that's absurd!\" he cried, flushing. \"Your poem is in praise of\nJesus, not in blame of Him--as you meant it to be. And who will believe you\nabout freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That's not the idea of it\nin the Orthodox Church.... That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome,\nit's false--those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the\nJesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your\nInquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who\nare these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves\nfor the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know the\nJesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you\ndescribe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply the\nRomish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with\nthe Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that's their ideal, but there's no\nsort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It's simple lust of\npower, of filthy earthly gain, of domination--something like a universal\nserfdom with them as masters--that's all they stand for. They don't even\nbelieve in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.\"\n\n\"Stay, stay,\" laughed Ivan, \"how hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it be\nso! Of course it's a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really think\nthat the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing\nbut the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is that Father Paissy's\nteaching?\"\n\n\"No, no, on the contrary, Father Paissy did once say something rather the\nsame as you ... but of course it's not the same, not a bit the same,\"\nAlyosha hastily corrected himself.\n\n\"A precious admission, in spite of your 'not a bit the same.' I ask you\nwhy your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material\ngain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow\nand loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was one such man\namong all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain--if there's\nonly one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert\nand made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and\nperfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyes\nwere opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain\nperfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction that\nmillions of God's creatures have been created as a mockery, that they will\nnever be capable of using their freedom, that these poor rebels can never\nturn into giants to complete the tower, that it was not for such geese\nthat the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that he\nturned back and joined--the clever people. Surely that could have\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Joined whom, what clever people?\" cried Alyosha, completely carried away.\n\"They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets....\nPerhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their secret. Your Inquisitor does\nnot believe in God, that's his secret!\"\n\n\"What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It's perfectly true, it's\ntrue that that's the whole secret, but isn't that suffering, at least for\na man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could\nnot shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old age he reached\nthe clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit\ncould build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly,\n'incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.' And so, convinced of\nthis, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the\ndread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and\ndeception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet\ndeceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being\nled, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think\nthemselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose\nideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that\ntragic? And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army 'filled\nwith the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain'--would not one\nsuch be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the\nhead is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with\nall its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I\nfirmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood\nat the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such even\namong the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old\nman who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found even\nnow in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by\nagreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the\nmystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them\nhappy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even\namong the Masons there's something of the same mystery at the bottom, and\nthat that's why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals\nbreaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there\nshould be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea\nI might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.\"\n\n\"You are perhaps a Mason yourself!\" broke suddenly from Alyosha. \"You\ndon't believe in God,\" he added, speaking this time very sorrowfully. He\nfancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically. \"How does\nyour poem end?\" he asked, suddenly looking down. \"Or was it the end?\"\n\n\"I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he\nwaited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed down\nupon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time,\nlooking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply. The old man\nlonged for Him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But He\nsuddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his\nbloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His\nlips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: 'Go, and come\nno more ... come not at all, never, never!' And he let Him out into the\ndark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.\"\n\n\"And the old man?\"\n\n\"The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.\"\n\n\"And you with him, you too?\" cried Alyosha, mournfully.\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\"Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a\nsenseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do you\ntake it so seriously? Surely you don't suppose I am going straight off to\nthe Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord, it's\nno business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, and\nthen ... dash the cup to the ground!\"\n\n\"But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky,\nand the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?\"\nAlyosha cried sorrowfully. \"With such a hell in your heart and your head,\nhow can you? No, that's just what you are going away for, to join them ...\nif not, you will kill yourself, you can't endure it!\"\n\n\"There is a strength to endure everything,\" Ivan said with a cold smile.\n\n\"What strength?\"\n\n\"The strength of the Karamazovs--the strength of the Karamazov baseness.\"\n\n\"To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?\"\n\n\"Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it,\nand then--\"\n\n\"How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That's impossible\nwith your ideas.\"\n\n\"In the Karamazov way, again.\"\n\n\" 'Everything is lawful,' you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?\"\n\nIvan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.\n\n\"Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase, which so offended Miuesov--and\nwhich Dmitri pounced upon so naively, and paraphrased!\" he smiled queerly.\n\"Yes, if you like, 'everything is lawful' since the word has been said. I\nwon't deny it. And Mitya's version isn't bad.\"\n\nAlyosha looked at him in silence.\n\n\"I thought that going away from here I have you at least,\" Ivan said\nsuddenly, with unexpected feeling; \"but now I see that there is no place\nfor me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, 'all is lawful,' I\nwon't renounce--will you renounce me for that, yes?\"\n\nAlyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.\n\n\"That's plagiarism,\" cried Ivan, highly delighted. \"You stole that from my\npoem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time we were going, both of\nus.\"\n\nThey went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the\nrestaurant.\n\n\"Listen, Alyosha,\" Ivan began in a resolute voice, \"if I am really able to\ncare for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you.\nIt's enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan't lose my\ndesire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of\nlove if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left. And it's\nenough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don't go away to-morrow (I\nthink I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don't say a word more on\nthese subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you\nspecially, never speak to me again,\" he added, with sudden irritation;\n\"it's all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn't it?\nAnd I'll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want to\n'dash the cup to the ground,' wherever I may be I'll come to have one more\ntalk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that.\nI'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you,\nto see what you'll be by that time. It's rather a solemn promise, you see.\nAnd we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your\nPater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry\nwith me for having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; that's right, now\ngo.\"\n\nIvan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just as\nDmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very\ndifferent. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha's\nmind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little,\nlooking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he\nwalked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had\nnever noticed it before. But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to\nthe monastery. It was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened;\nsomething new was growing up in him for which he could not account. The\nwind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines\nmurmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse. He almost\nran. \"Pater Seraphicus--he got that name from somewhere--where from?\"\nAlyosha wondered. \"Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?...\nHere is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he will\nsave me--from him and for ever!\"\n\nSeveral times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving Ivan so\ncompletely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only a\nfew hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing\nso, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure One\n\n\nAnd Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch's house.\nBut, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, which\ngrew greater at every step he took towards the house. There was nothing\nstrange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not\nhave said what was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before,\nand there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when\nhe had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was\npreparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown\nfuture. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had great\nhopes, and great--too great--expectations from life, he could not have given\nany definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires.\n\nYet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown\ncertainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something\nquite different. \"Is it loathing for my father's house?\" he wondered.\n\"Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it's the last time I shall\ncross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it's not that\neither. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with\nhim? For so many years I've been silent with the whole world and not\ndeigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.\"\nIt certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful\ninexperience and vanity--vexation at having failed to express himself,\nespecially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly\nbeen reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done\nindeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. \"I feel sick with\ndepression and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.\"\n\nIvan tried \"not to think,\" but that, too, was no use. What made his\ndepression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual,\nexternal character--he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to be\nstanding out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself\nupon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that\nfor a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost\ntorments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object,\noften quite a trifling and ridiculous one--some article left about in the\nwrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the\nshelf, and so on.\n\nAt last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, and\nsuddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was\nfretting and worrying him.\n\nOn a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the\ncoolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the\nvalet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soul\nloathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just before,\nwhen Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had\nfelt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred\nresponsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had\nbeen forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as\nsoon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten\nsensation began to obtrude itself again. \"Is it possible that a miserable,\ncontemptible creature like that can worry me so much?\" he wondered, with\ninsufferable irritation.\n\nIt was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the\nman, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to notice in\nhimself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature.\nPerhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came\nto the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then he had taken a\nmarked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He\nhad encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a\ncertain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not\nunderstand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the\nbrain of \"the contemplative.\" They discussed philosophical questions and\neven how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon,\nand stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be\nunderstood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might\nbe an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov,\nand that he was looking for something altogether different. In one way and\nanother, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too,\nand that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on,\nthere had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and\nthere had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri--they discussed that,\ntoo. But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it\nwas impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in\nfact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of\nhis desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.\nSmerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously\npremeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, and\nusually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse into\nsilence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most\nand confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity\nwhich Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not that he forgot\nhimself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully,\nyet he had obviously begun to consider--goodness knows why!--that there was\nsome sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always\nspoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact,\nsome secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on both\nsides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around\nthem. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of his\ngrowing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root of\nit.\n\nWith a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gate\nwithout speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose from the\nbench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he wanted\nparticularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and the fact\nthat he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the minute before,\ndrove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's\nemasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his\nforehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, \"Where are you\ngoing? You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something\nto say to each other.\"\n\nIvan shook. \"Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?\" was\non the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heard\nhimself say, \"Is my father still asleep, or has he waked?\"\n\nHe asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at once,\nagain to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant he felt\nalmost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov stood facing\nhim, his hands behind his back, looking at him with assurance and almost\nseverity.\n\n\"His honor is still asleep,\" he articulated deliberately (\"You were the\nfirst to speak, not I,\" he seemed to say). \"I am surprised at you, sir,\"\nhe added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his right\nfoot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.\n\n\"Why are you surprised at me?\" Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing his\nutmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that he\nwas feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have gone\naway without satisfying it.\n\n\"Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?\" Smerdyakov suddenly raised his\neyes and smiled familiarly. \"Why I smile you must understand of yourself,\nif you are a clever man,\" his screwed-up left eye seemed to say.\n\n\"Why should I go to Tchermashnya?\" Ivan asked in surprise.\n\nSmerdyakov was silent again.\n\n\"Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,\" he said at last, slowly\nand apparently attaching no significance to his answer. \"I put you off\nwith a secondary reason,\" he seemed to suggest, \"simply to say something.\"\n\n\"Damn you! Speak out what you want!\" Ivan cried angrily at last, passing\nfrom meekness to violence.\n\nSmerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but\nstill looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.\n\n\"Substantially nothing--but just by way of conversation.\"\n\nAnother silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan\nknew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before\nhim and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or\nnot. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov\nseemed to seize the moment.\n\n\"I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how to help\nmyself,\" he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he\nsighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.\n\n\"They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,\"\nSmerdyakov went on. \"I am speaking of your parent and your brother Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin\nworrying me every minute, 'Has she come? Why hasn't she come?' and so on\nup till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna\ndoesn't come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he\nwill be at me again to-morrow morning, 'Why hasn't she come? When will she\ncome?'--as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's no better.\nAs soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his\ngun in his hands: 'Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker. If you miss her\nand don't let me know she's been--I'll kill you before any one.' When the\nnight's over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins\nworrying me to death. 'Why hasn't she come? Will she come soon?' And he,\ntoo, thinks me to blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and\nevery hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall\nkill myself in a fright. I can't depend upon them, sir.\"\n\n\"And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri\nFyodorovitch?\" said Ivan irritably.\n\n\"How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled at all, if\nyou want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very\nbeginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his servant.\nHe has had only one thing to say since: 'I'll kill you, you scoundrel, if\nyou miss her,' I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fit to-\nmorrow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'a long fit'?\"\n\n\"A long fit, lasting a long time--several hours, or perhaps a day or two.\nOnce it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. The\nstruggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn't come\nback to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor\nhere, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might\nhave died.\"\n\n\"But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What\nmakes you say you will have one to-morrow?\" Ivan inquired, with a\npeculiar, irritable curiosity.\n\n\"That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.\"\n\n\"Besides, you fell from the garret then.\"\n\n\"I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again\nto-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to go\ninto the cellar every day, too.\"\n\nIvan took a long look at him.\n\n\"You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand you,\" he\nsaid softly, but with a sort of menace. \"Do you mean to pretend to be ill\nto-morrow for three days, eh?\"\n\nSmerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toe\nof his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and,\ngrinning, articulated:\n\n\"If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit--and\nit would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them--I should have a\nperfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For even if\nAgrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill, his honor\ncan't blame a sick man for not telling him. He'd be ashamed to.\"\n\n\"Hang it all!\" Ivan cried, his face working with anger, \"why are you\nalways in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri's threats are\nonly hasty words and mean nothing. He won't kill you; it's not you he'll\nkill!\"\n\n\"He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am\nafraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something\ncrazy to his father.\"\n\n\"Why should you be taken for an accomplice?\"\n\n\"They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals as a\ngreat secret.\"\n\n\"What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.\"\n\n\"I'm bound to admit the fact,\" Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure,\n\"that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business. As you know\nyourself (if only you do know it) he has for several days past locked\nhimself in as soon as night or even evening comes on. Of late you've been\ngoing upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did not\ncome down at all, and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun\nto lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to\nthe door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory\nVassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his room\nnow. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this to-do with\nAgrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his orders, I go away to the\nlodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch,\ngetting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna\nto come. For the last few days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her.\nWhat he argues is, she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he\ncalls him), 'and so,' says he, 'she'll come the back-way, late at night,\nto me. You look out for her,' says he, 'till midnight and later; and if\nshe does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the\ngarden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more\nquickly, then,' says he, 'I shall understand at once that she has come,\nand will open the door to you quietly.' Another signal he gave me in case\nanything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an\ninterval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something has\nhappened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so that\nI can go and speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't\ncome herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might\ncome, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully afraid\nof Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and\nwere locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere\nnear at the time, I should be bound to let him know at once, knocking\nthree times. So that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena\nAlexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks means\n'something important to tell you.' His honor has shown me them several\ntimes and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of\nthese signals but myself and his honor, so he'd open the door without the\nslightest hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of\ncalling out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch\ntoo, now.\"\n\n\"How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?\"\n\n\"It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back from\nhim? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, 'You are deceiving me,\nyou are hiding something from me! I'll break both your legs for you.' So I\ntold him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion, and\nmight be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was telling him all I\ncould.\"\n\n\"If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to get in,\ndon't let him in.\"\n\n\"But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming in\nthen, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?\"\n\n\"Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confound\nyou? Are you laughing at me?\"\n\n\"How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this fear\non me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment. Fright\nalone will bring it on.\"\n\n\"Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. Let\nGrigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.\"\n\n\"I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signals\nwithout orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearing\nhim and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and Marfa\nIgnatyevna intends to give him medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged\nit. It's a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a\npreparation and always keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb.\nShe has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch\nthree times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralyzed by it.\nThen she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his whole back\nfor half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and what's left in the\nbottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but not quite all,\nfor on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and drinks it herself.\nAnd as they never take strong drink, I assure you they both drop asleep at\nonce and sleep sound a very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch\nwakes up he is perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a\nheadache from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to-\nmorrow, they won't hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They'll\nbe asleep.\"\n\n\"What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it were\nplanned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be unconscious,\" cried Ivan.\n\"But aren't you trying to arrange it so?\" broke from him suddenly, and he\nfrowned threateningly.\n\n\"How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri\nFyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, he'll do it;\nbut if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his father.\"\n\n\"And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you say\nyourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?\" Ivan went on, turning\nwhite with anger. \"You say that yourself, and all the while I've been\nhere, I've felt sure it was all the old man's fancy, and the creature\nwon't come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she doesn't come?\nSpeak, I want to know what you are thinking!\"\n\n\"You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I think? His\nhonor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account of\nmy illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as he did yesterday through\nimpatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasn't escaped him on\nthe sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big\nenvelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed\nwith three seals. On it is written in his own hand, 'To my angel\nGrushenka, if she will come,' to which he added three days later, 'for my\nlittle chicken.' There's no knowing what that might do.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Ivan, almost beside himself. \"Dmitri won't come to steal\nmoney and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him yesterday on\naccount of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is, but he won't\nsteal.\"\n\n\"He is in very great need of money now--the greatest need, Ivan\nFyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is,\" Smerdyakov explained,\nwith perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. \"He looks on that\nthree thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. 'My father still\nowes me just three thousand,' he said. And besides that, consider, Ivan\nFyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. It's as good as\ncertain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only she\ncares to, to marry her--the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch--if\nonly she cares to, and of course she may care to. All I've said is that\nshe won't come, but maybe she's looking for more than that--I mean to be\nmistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing\nwith her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a\nstupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense. She wouldn't marry a\nbeggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan\nFyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself\nand your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the\nmaster's death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him\nsimply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your\nfather were to die now, there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for\nDmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he's made no will.... Dmitri\nFyodorovitch knows all that very well.\"\n\nA sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly flushed.\n\n\"Then why on earth,\" he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, \"do you advise me\nto go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see\nwhat will happen here.\" Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.\n\n\"Precisely so,\" said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan\nintently, however.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'precisely so'?\" Ivan questioned him, with a menacing\nlight in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.\n\n\"I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should\nsimply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\"\nanswered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan's flashing\neyes. They were both silent.\n\n\"You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful scoundrel,\ntoo.\" Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight\nthrough the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something\nstrange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his\nfists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The\nlatter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back.\nBut the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in\nsilence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.\n\n\"I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know--early to-morrow\nmorning. That's all!\" he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself\nafterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.\n\n\"That's the best thing you can do,\" he responded, as though he had\nexpected to hear it; \"except that you can always be telegraphed for from\nMoscow, if anything should happen here.\"\n\nIvan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change\nhad passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness had\ncompletely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation,\nintent but timid and cringing.\n\n\"Haven't you something more to say--something to add?\" could be read in the\nintent gaze he fixed on Ivan.\n\n\"And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too--in case anything\nhappened?\" Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his\nvoice.\n\n\"From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,\" Smerdyakov muttered,\nalmost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivan's\neyes.\n\n\"Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save my\nspending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, that\nyou insist on Tchermashnya?\"\n\n\"Precisely so ...\" muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He looked\nat Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back. But to\nhis astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate still\nlaughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment would have known\nthat he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he could not have\nexplained himself what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked\nas though in a nervous frenzy.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. \"It's Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man\"\n\n\nAnd in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitch\nin the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to him, waving his\nhands, \"I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you. Good-by!\" and\npassed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the old\nman was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremonious\ndisplay of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old\nman evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet\nhim in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he\nstood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going\nupstairs, till he passed out of sight.\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\" he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had\nfollowed Ivan.\n\n\"Angry about something. Who can tell?\" the valet muttered evasively.\n\n\"Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get along\nwith you. Look sharp! No news?\"\n\nThen followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complained\nof to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these questions we\nwill omit. Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old man\nwas wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing\nevery minute the five knocks agreed upon. Now and then he peered out into\nthe darkness, seeing nothing.\n\nIt was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up late\nthat night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an account of his\nthoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul--its turn will\ncome. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account of\nthem, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something very vague,\nand, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his\nbearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost\nsurprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an\nintense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the\nlodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not have\ngiven any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one\nwho had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world. On the other\nhand, he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable\nhumiliating terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical\npowers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling\nin his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He even\nhated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had with him. At\nmoments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot\nto think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he\nremembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to Katerina\nIvanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered\nin his heart, \"That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy\nto tear yourself away as you are boasting now.\"\n\nRemembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar\nrepulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, as\nthough he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on the\nstaircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below, had\nlistened a long while--some five minutes--with a sort of strange curiosity,\nholding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this,\nwhy he was listening, he could not have said. That \"action\" all his life\nafterwards he called \"infamous,\" and at the bottom of his heart, he\nthought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch\nhimself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious\nto know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now.\nHe wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows\nand stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening--for some one\nto knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this.\n\nAbout two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch\nhad gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep at\nonce, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at once, and\nslept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven o'clock, when it\nwas broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himself\nextraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then\ndragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His linen had come\nback from the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at\nthe thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his\ndeparture certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before (to\nKaterina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day,\nyet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed,\nor, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would be\nto pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine\no'clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, \"Where will\nyour honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?\" He looked\nalmost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,\nsomething hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even\ninquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear his\nanswer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour to\nreturn to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses. His\nfather heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an\nunmannerly way to show regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew\ninto a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his\nown.\n\n\"What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we'll manage\nit all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to Tchermashnya on\nthe way. It's only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, only\nanother twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train\nstarts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just catch it.\"\n\n\"You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off to\nTchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your father! If I hadn't\nhad something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, for\nI've some business there in a hurry. But here I ... it's not the time for\nme to go now.... You see, I've two pieces of copse land there. The\nMaslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight thousand for the\ntimber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given\ntwelve. There's no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have\nit all their own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here\ndare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday\nthat a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makes\nhim valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not afraid of\nthe Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse. Do you\nhear? But he'll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, so\nyou must go at once and make a bargain with him.\"\n\n\"Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain.\"\n\n\"He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure, I'd\ngive him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but he\nhas no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him.\nAnd yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looks\nlike a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's\nthe common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you\nwonder why he is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife\nwas dead and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there\nwas not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is\nalive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you have\nto find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when he says he\nwants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.\"\n\n\"I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.\"\n\n\"Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by\nwhich you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business with him a long\ntime. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red beard.\nIf his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, it's all right, he is\nsaying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he strokes his beard\nwith his left hand and grins--he is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his\neyes, you won't find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a\nrogue--but watch his beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him.\nHe's called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy(4); but don't call\nhim so, he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and\nsee it's all right, write here at once. You need only write: 'He's not\nlying.' Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, but\nnot more. Just think! there's a difference between eight thousand and\neleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three thousand; it's not so\neasy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate need of money. Only let me\nknow it's serious, and I'll run over and fix it up. I'll snatch the time\nsomehow. But what's the good of my galloping over, if it's all a notion of\nthe priest's? Come, will you go?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.\"\n\n\"Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget it. You've no heart,\nany of you--that's what it is? What's a day or two to you? Where are you\ngoing now--to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I would have\nsent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you\njust because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You\nknow nothing about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to\nsee whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard--if his\nbeard shakes you know he is in earnest.\"\n\n\"You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?\" cried\nIvan, with a malignant smile.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy, but\nhe caught the smile.\n\n\"Then you'll go, you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at once.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on the way.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle the\nmatter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send it on to me\nat once. And I won't delay you more than that. You can go to Venice. The\npriest will give you horses back to Volovya station.\"\n\nThe old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for the\nhorses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch\nwas pleased, he usually became expansive, but to-day he seemed to restrain\nhimself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite\nunmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to\nsay. Ivan noticed this particularly. \"He must be bored with me,\" he\nthought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man\nbegan to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold\nout his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and\ninstantly pulled himself up.\n\n\"Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!\" he repeated from the steps.\n\"You'll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be\nglad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!\"\n\nIvan got into the carriage.\n\n\"Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!\" the father called for the last\ntime.\n\nThe whole household came out to take leave--Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory.\nIvan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the\ncarriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.\n\n\"You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,\" broke suddenly from Ivan. Again,\nas the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed,\ntoo, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after.\n\n\"It's a true saying then, that 'it's always worth while speaking to a\nclever man,' \" answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.\n\nThe carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but he looked\neagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flock\nof geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a sudden he\nfelt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt intensely\ninterested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute later he\nrealized that he was not catching anything, and that he had not really\neven taken in the peasant's answer. He was silent, and it was pleasant\neven so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images of\nAlyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled,\nblew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. \"There's plenty\nof time for them,\" he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed\nhorses, and galloped to Volovya. \"Why is it worth while speaking to a\nclever man? What did he mean by that?\" The thought seemed suddenly to\nclutch at his breathing. \"And why did I tell him I was going to\nTchermashnya?\" They reached Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage,\nand the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve\nversts to Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went into\nthe station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and\nsuddenly went back to the entrance.\n\n\"I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven,\nbrothers?\"\n\n\"We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?\"\n\n\"At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?\"\n\n\"To be sure. Mitri here will.\"\n\n\"Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor Pavlovitch\nKaramazov, and tell him I haven't gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?\"\n\n\"Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.\"\n\n\"And here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give you anything,\"\nsaid Ivan, laughing gayly.\n\n\"You may depend on it he won't.\" Mitya laughed too. \"Thank you, sir. I'll\nbe sure to do it.\"\n\nAt seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow \"Away with\nthe past. I've done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news,\nno echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!\" But\ninstead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart\nached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was\nthinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he\nwas approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.\n\n\"I am a scoundrel,\" he whispered to himself.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For\ntwo hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. But\nsuddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for\nevery one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's\nequanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell\ndown from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the\nyard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his\nscream--the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her--the scream of\nthe epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had\ncome on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must\nhave fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had\ncaused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them. They\nfound him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and\nfoaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have broken\nsomething--an arm or a leg--and hurt himself, but \"God had preserved him,\"\nas Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it--nothing of the kind had happened. But it\nwas difficult to get him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to\nhelp and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the\nwhole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man did\nnot regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then\nbegan again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as\nhad happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret.\nThey remembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was still\nice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the\nevening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at\nonce. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and\nconscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, he\nconcluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious\nconsequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it,\nbut that by to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he\nwould venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the lodge,\nto a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's.\n\nThen Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with\nthat day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared with\nSmerdyakov's, was \"no better than dish-water,\" and the fowl was so dried\nup that it was impossible to masticate it. To her master's bitter, though\ndeserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very\nold one to begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. In\nthe evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he\nwas informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days,\nwas completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea\nas early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He was in\nterrible excitement and suspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka's\ncoming almost as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning\nan assurance \"that she had promised to come without fail.\" The\nincorrigible old man's heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and\ndown his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be\non the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window\n(Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where\nand how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a\nsecond in the passage, for fear--which God forbid!--that she should be\nfrightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never\nhad his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could\nsay almost certainly that she would come!\n\n\n\n\nBook VI. The Russian Monk\n\n\n\nChapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors\n\n\nWhen with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder's cell,\nhe stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp,\nperhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up\nin his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and\ncheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful\nconversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour\nbefore Alyosha's arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell\nearlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident\nassurance from Father Paissy that \"the teacher would get up, and as he had\nhimself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his\nheart.\" This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father\nPaissy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious, if he had\nseen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise that he would rise up\nand say good-by to him, he would not have believed perhaps even in death,\nbut would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill his\npromise. In the morning as he lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told\nhim positively: \"I shall not die without the delight of another\nconversation with you, beloved of my heart. I shall look once more on your\ndear face and pour out my heart to you once again.\" The monks, who had\ngathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had all\nbeen his devoted friends for many years. There were four of them: Father\nIosif and Father Paissy, Father Mihail, the warden of the hermitage, a man\nnot very old and far from being learned. He was of humble origin, of\nstrong will and steadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deep\ntenderness, though he obviously concealed it as though he were almost\nashamed of it. The fourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little\nmonk of the poorest peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very\nquiet, scarcely speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble,\nand looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful\nbeyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great affection\nfor this timorous man, and always treated him with marked respect, though\nperhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less, in spite\nof the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him.\nThat was very long ago, forty years before, when Father Zossima first\nbegan his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and\nwhen, shortly after, he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to\ncollect alms for their poor monastery.\n\nThe whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, was\nvery small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them (in\naddition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit round Father Zossima on\nchairs brought from the sitting-room. It was already beginning to get\ndark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the\nikons.\n\nSeeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima smiled\nat him joyfully and held out his hand.\n\n\"Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew you\nwould come.\"\n\nAlyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and wept.\nSomething surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering, he wanted to\nsob.\n\n\"Come, don't weep over me yet,\" Father Zossima smiled, laying his right\nhand on his head. \"You see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall live\nanother twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, with\nher little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday. God bless the mother\nand the little girl Lizaveta,\" he crossed himself. \"Porfiry, did you take\nher offering where I told you?\"\n\nHe meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good-humored\nwoman to be given \"to some one poorer than me.\" Such offerings, always of\nmoney gained by personal toil, are made by way of penance voluntarily\nundertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow,\nwhose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone\nwith her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had\ngiven the money, as he had been instructed, \"from an unknown\nbenefactress.\"\n\n\"Get up, my dear boy,\" the elder went on to Alyosha. \"Let me look at you.\nHave you been home and seen your brother?\" It seemed strange to Alyosha\nthat he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothers\nonly--but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and\nto-day for the sake of that brother.\n\n\"I have seen one of my brothers,\" answered Alyosha.\n\n\"I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.\"\n\n\"I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste, leave\neverything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent\nsomething terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store\nfor him.\"\n\nHe was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange.\nFather Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances\nwith Father Paissy. Alyosha could not resist asking:\n\n\"Father and teacher,\" he began with extreme emotion, \"your words are too\nobscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?\"\n\n\"Don't inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though\nhis whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came into his eyes--so\nthat I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing for\nhimself. Once or twice in my life I've seen such a look in a man's face\n... reflecting as it were his future fate, and that fate, alas, came to\npass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I thought your brotherly face would\nhelp him. But everything and all our fates are from the Lord. 'Except a\ncorn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it\ndie, it bringeth forth much fruit.' Remember that. You, Alexey, I've many\ntimes silently blessed for your face, know that,\" added the elder with a\ngentle smile. \"This is what I think of you, you will go forth from these\nwalls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have many enemies,\nbut even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes,\nbut you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will\nmake others bless it--which is what matters most. Well, that is your\ncharacter. Fathers and teachers,\" he addressed his friends with a tender\nsmile, \"I have never till to-day told even him why the face of this youth\nis so dear to me. Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were a\nremembrance and a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a\nchild I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And\nlater on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that\nbrother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For had he\nnot come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, have\nbecome a monk and entered on this precious path. He appeared first to me\nin my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he seems to have\ncome to me over again. It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey,\nwho has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like\nhim spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that young man, my\nbrother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a\nreminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so strange a\ndream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?\" he turned to the novice who\nwaited on him. \"Many times I've seen in your face as it were a look of\nmortification that I love Alexey more than you. Now you know why that was\nso, but I love you too, know that, and many times I grieved at your\nmortification. I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my\nbrother, for there has been no presence in my life more precious, more\nsignificant and touching. My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my\nwhole life at this moment as though living through it again.\"\n\n                  -------------------------------------\n\nHere I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with the\nfriends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partly\npreserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down from\nmemory, some time after his elder's death. But whether this was only the\nconversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of\nparts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his\naccount, Father Zossima's talk goes on without interruption, as though he\ntold his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no\ndoubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was\ngeneral. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they\ntoo talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father\nZossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was\nsometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down\nto rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not\nleave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by\nFather Paissy's reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one\nof them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his\nlife after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new\nstrength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a\nlast effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little\ntime, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that\nlater. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the\naccount given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not\nso fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great\ndeal from previous conversations and added them to it.\n\n                  -------------------------------------\n\nNotes of the Life of the deceased Priest and Monk, the Elder Zossima,\ntaken from his own words by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES\n\n_(a)_ _Father Zossima's Brother_\n\nBeloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the\nnorth, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no\ngreat consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old, and\nI don't remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built of\nwood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and her\nchildren in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I.\nHe was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but\nkind-hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at\nhome with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did\nnot get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so\nmy mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen,\nhe made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow\nto our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was a\ngood scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university.\nSomething made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see\nhim. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter,\ntill the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his\nown request, as he had powerful friends.\n\nIt was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude and\nlaughed at it. \"That's all silly twaddle, and there is no God,\" he said,\nhorrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was only\nnine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four servants, all\nserfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, who\nwas lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant\nto take her place.\n\nIn the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a\ntendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin and delicate-\nlooking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he caught cold,\nanyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it was\ngalloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring. My\nmother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she entreated\nhim to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he was still\nable to move about. This made him angry, and he said something profane\nabout the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he\nwas seriously ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to\nconfess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long time\npast, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed at\ndinner to our mother and me, \"My life won't be long among you, I may not\nlive another year,\" which seemed now like a prophecy.\n\nThree days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning my\nbrother began going to church. \"I am doing this simply for your sake,\nmother, to please and comfort you,\" he said. My mother wept with joy and\ngrief. \"His end must be near,\" she thought, \"if there's such a change in\nhim.\" But he was not able to go to church long, he took to his bed, so he\nhad to confess and take the sacrament at home.\n\nIt was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of\nfragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly, but in\nthe morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair. That's how I\nremember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his face bright and\njoyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change passed over him, his\nspirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and say, \"Let me\nlight the lamp before the holy image, my dear.\" And once he would not have\nallowed it and would have blown it out.\n\n\"Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it.\nYou are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoice\nseeing you. So we are praying to the same God.\"\n\nThose words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her room and\nweep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful.\n\"Mother, don't weep, darling,\" he would say, \"I've long to live yet, long\nto rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night,\ncoughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.\"\n\n\"Don't cry, mother,\" he would answer, \"life is paradise, and we are all in\nparadise, but we won't see it, if we would, we should have heaven on earth\nthe next day.\"\n\nEvery one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively; we\nwere all touched and wept. Friends came to see us. \"Dear ones,\" he would\nsay to them, \"what have I done that you should love me so, how can you\nlove any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate\nit before?\"\n\nWhen the servants came in to him he would say continually, \"Dear, kind\npeople, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? If\nit were God's will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should\nwait on one another.\"\n\nMother shook her head as she listened. \"My darling, it's your illness\nmakes you talk like that.\"\n\n\"Mother, darling,\" he would say, \"there must be servants and masters, but\nif so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.\nAnd another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, and\nI more than any.\"\n\nMother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. \"Why, how\ncould you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers and\nmurderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you\nhold yourself more guilty than all?\"\n\n\"Mother, little heart of mine,\" he said (he had begun using such strange\ncaressing words at that time), \"little heart of mine, my joy, believe me,\nevery one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.\nI don't know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfully\neven. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and not\nknowing?\"\n\nSo he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full of\nlove. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came:\n\n\"Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?\" he would ask, joking.\n\n\"You'll live many days yet,\" the doctor would answer, \"and months and\nyears too.\"\n\n\"Months and years!\" he would exclaim. \"Why reckon the days? One day is\nenough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we quarrel,\ntry to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other? Let's go\nstraight into the garden, walk and play there, love, appreciate, and kiss\neach other, and glorify life.\"\n\n\"Your son cannot last long,\" the doctor told my mother, as she accompanied\nhim to the door. \"The disease is affecting his brain.\"\n\nThe windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our garden was a\nshady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The first\nbirds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing at\nthe windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began suddenly\nbegging their forgiveness too: \"Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me,\nfor I have sinned against you too.\" None of us could understand that at\nthe time, but he shed tears of joy. \"Yes,\" he said, \"there was such a\nglory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in\nshame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.\"\n\n\"You take too many sins on yourself,\" mother used to say, weeping.\n\n\"Mother, darling, it's for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though I can't\nexplain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I don't know\nhow to love them enough. If I have sinned against every one, yet all\nforgive me, too, and that's heaven. Am I not in heaven now?\"\n\nAnd there was a great deal more I don't remember. I remember I went once\ninto his room when there was no one else there. It was a bright evening,\nthe sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He beckoned me,\nand I went up to him. He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my\nface tenderly, lovingly; he said nothing for a minute, only looked at me\nlike that.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"run and play now, enjoy life for me too.\"\n\nI went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life afterwards I\nremembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too. There\nwere many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his, though we did not\nunderstand them at the time. He died the third week after Easter. He was\nfully conscious though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did not\nchange. He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,\nbeckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his\ndeath. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so,\nthough I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then, a child, but\na lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my heart,\nready to rise up and respond when the time came. So indeed it happened.\n\n_(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima_\n\nI was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her to send me\nto Petersburg as other parents did. \"You have only one son now,\" they\nsaid, \"and have a fair income, and you will be depriving him perhaps of a\nbrilliant career if you keep him here.\" They suggested I should be sent to\nPetersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might afterwards enter the Imperial\nGuard. My mother hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her\nonly child, but she made up her mind to it at last, though not without\nmany tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me to\nPetersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again. For\nshe too died three years afterwards. She spent those three years mourning\nand grieving for both of us.\n\nFrom the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious\nmemories, for there are no memories more precious than those of early\nchildhood in one's first home. And that is almost always so if there is\nany love and harmony in the family at all. Indeed, precious memories may\nremain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what is\nprecious. With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible,\nwhich, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book of\nScripture history then with excellent pictures, called _A Hundred and Four\nStories from the Old and New Testament_, and I learned to read from it. I\nhave it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious relic of the past.\nBut even before I learned to read, I remember first being moved to\ndevotional feeling at eight years old. My mother took me alone to mass (I\ndon't remember where my brother was at the time) on the Monday before\nEaster. It was a fine day, and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now,\nhow the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and,\noverhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that\nstreamed in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for the\nfirst time in my life I consciously received the seed of God's word in my\nheart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book,\nso large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry it. He laid it\non the reading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for the\nfirst time I understood something read in the church of God. In the land\nof Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he had great\nwealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted,\nand he loved them very much and prayed for them. \"It may be that my sons\nhave sinned in their feasting.\" Now the devil came before the Lord\ntogether with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up\nand down the earth and under the earth. \"And hast thou considered my\nservant Job?\" God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil, pointing to\nhis great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at God's words. \"Give\nhim over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Thee\nand curse Thy name.\" And God gave up the just man He loved so, to the\ndevil. And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered his\nwealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his\nmantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, \"Naked came I out of\nmy mother's womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gave\nand the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and\never.\"\n\nFathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises up\nagain before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of\na little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder and\ngladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, who\ntalked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up to destruction,\nand His servant crying out: \"Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish\nme,\" and then the soft and sweet singing in the church: \"Let my prayer\nrise up before Thee,\" and again incense from the priest's censer and the\nkneeling and the prayer. Ever since then--only yesterday I took it up--I've\nnever been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much that\nis great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard\nthe words of mockery and blame, proud words, \"How could God give up the\nmost loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his\nchildren, smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption\nfrom his sores with a pot-sherd--and for no object except to boast to the\ndevil! 'See what My saint can suffer for My sake.' \" But the greatness of\nit lies just in the fact that it is a mystery--that the passing earthly\nshow and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of the\nearthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as on\nthe first days of creation He ended each day with praise: \"That is good\nthat I have created,\" looks upon Job and again praises His creation. And\nJob, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His creation for\ngenerations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he was\nordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are in\nit! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with\nit to man! It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature,\neverything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what\nmysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him wealth\nagain. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. But\nhow could he love those new ones when those first children are no more,\nwhen he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy with\nthose new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, he\ncould. It's the great mystery of human life that old grief passes\ngradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place\nof the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as\nbefore, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting,\nits long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come\nwith them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life--and over\nall the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life is\nending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my\nearthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching\nlife, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind\nglowing and my heart weeping with joy.\n\nFriends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one may\nhear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village priests,\nare complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their\nhumiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print--I've read it\nmyself--that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people because\nof the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics come and\nlead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because they have so\nlittle to live upon. May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so\nprecious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say,\nif any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he may\nbe short of time, he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while\nwith work and services, but still it's not all the time, even he has an\nhour a week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year round.\nLet him gather round him once a week, some hour in the evening, if only\nthe children at first--the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin\nto come. There's no need to build halls for this, let him take them into\nhis own cottage. They won't spoil his cottage, they would only be there\none hour. Let him open that book and begin reading it without grand words\nor superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly,\nbeing glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with\nattention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to\nexplain words that are not understood by the peasants. Don't be anxious,\nthey will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand all!\nLet him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of how\nJacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said,\n\"This place is holy\"--and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant.\nLet him read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph,\nthe tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their\nfather that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him his blood-\nstained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed\ninto Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by\nthem, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all\nthrough love: \"I love you, and loving you I torment you.\" For he\nremembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the\nburning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he had wept and\nbesought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land. And\nhow, seeing them again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but\nhe harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able to\nbear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and wept. Then,\nwiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and told them,\n\"Brothers, I am your brother Joseph!\" Let him read them further how happy\nold Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive, and how he\nwent to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign land,\nbequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his\nmeek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, from Judah,\nwill come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour.\n\nFathers and teachers, forgive me and don't be angry, that like a little\nchild I've been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a\nhundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive my\ntears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the priest of God, and be\nsure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response. Only a\nlittle tiny seed is needed--drop it into the heart of the peasant and it\nwon't die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be hidden in the\nmidst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder.\nAnd there's no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it\nall simply. Do you suppose that the peasants don't understand? Try reading\nthem the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or the\nmiraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don't forget either the parables\nof Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke (that is what I\ndid), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paul\n(that you mustn't leave out on any account), and from the _Lives of the\nSaints_, for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of\nall, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egypt--and you will\npenetrate their hearts with these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it\nin spite of your poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for\nyourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a\nhundred-fold. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words\nthey have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in his\nfields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect than\nbefore--so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too. The thing\nis so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for\nfear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believe\nin God will not believe in God's people. He who believes in God's people\nwill see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it till\nthen. Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our\natheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil.\n\nAnd what is the use of Christ's words, unless we set an example? The\npeople is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the\nWord and for all that is good.\n\nIn my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia\nwith Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one\nnight on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. A good-\nlooking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry back next\nmorning to pull a merchant's barge along the bank. I noticed him looking\nstraight before him with clear and tender eyes. It was a bright, warm,\nstill, July night, a cool mist rose from the broad river, we could hear\nthe plash of a fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and beautiful,\neverything praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, the lad and I,\nand we talked of the beauty of this world of God's and of the great\nmystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden bee,\nall so marvelously know their path, though they have not intelligence,\nthey bear witness to the mystery of God and continually accomplish it\nthemselves. I saw the dear lad's heart was moved. He told me that he loved\nthe forest and the forest birds. He was a bird-catcher, knew the note of\neach of them, could call each bird. \"I know nothing better than to be in\nthe forest,\" said he, \"though all things are good.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" I answered him, \"all things are good and fair, because all is\ntruth. Look,\" said I, \"at the horse, that great beast that is so near to\nman; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works for him; look at\ntheir faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats them\nmercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what beauty! It's\ntouching to know that there's no sin in them, for all, all except man, is\nsinless, and Christ has been with them before us.\"\n\n\"Why,\" asked the boy, \"is Christ with them too?\"\n\n\"It cannot but be so,\" said I, \"since the Word is for all. All creation\nand all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory to\nGod, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of\ntheir sinless life. Yonder,\" said I, \"in the forest wanders the dreadful\nbear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it.\" And I told him how\nonce a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in\nthe wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear and\ngave him a piece of bread. \"Go along,\" said he, \"Christ be with you,\" and\nthe savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm. And the\nlad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint,\nand that Christ was with him too. \"Ah,\" said he, \"how good that is, how\ngood and beautiful is all God's work!\" He sat musing softly and sweetly. I\nsaw he understood. And he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May\nGod bless youth! And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace\nand light to Thy people!\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Duel\n\n\n_(c) Recollections of Father Zossima's Youth before he became a Monk. The\nDuel_\n\nI spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school at\nPetersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of my\nchildish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing. I picked up so\nmany new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd,\nalmost savage creature. A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I\ndid acquire together with the French language.\n\nBut we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service as\ncattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was so\nmuch more impressionable than my companions. By the time we left the\nschool as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor of\nthe regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of\nhonor, and if any one had known it, he would have been the first to\nridicule it. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almost\nprided ourselves on. I don't say that we were bad by nature, all these\nyoung men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.\nWhat made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I\nflung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the\nrecklessness of youth.\n\nI was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I\nnever opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and I\nwas never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book \"for\nthe day and the hour, for the month and the year,\" though I knew it not.\n\nAfter four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our\nregiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town\nhospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial\nreception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be\nwell off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a\ncircumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.\n\nI formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble\nand lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They were\nwell-to-do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial\nand friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with\nfavor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully\nrealized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all,\nbut only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I could\nnot indeed have helped doing. I was prevented, however, from making her an\noffer at the time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the\nallurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my\nyouth, and with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to my\nfeelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a time.\nThen, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to another\ndistrict.\n\nOn my return two months later, I found the young lady already married to a\nrich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though older\nthan I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I was not,\nand of excellent education, which I also was not. I was so overwhelmed at\nthis unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded. The\nworst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had been\na long while betrothed to her, and I had met him indeed many times in her\nhouse, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And this\nparticularly mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while\nI knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With flushed\nface I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring my\nlove to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me, she\nmust, I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time. Later on, of\ncourse, I reflected and remembered that she had been very far from\nlaughing at me; on the contrary, she used to turn off any love-making on\nmy part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects; but at that\nmoment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I\nam surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were\nextremely repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found\nit difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work\nmyself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.\n\nI waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my \"rival\" in the\npresence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly extraneous\npretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public event--it was in\nthe year 1826(5)--and my jeer was, so people said, clever and effective.\nThen I forced him to ask for an explanation, and behaved so rudely that he\naccepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us, as I was\nyounger, a person of no consequence, and of inferior rank. I learned\nafterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also\nthat my challenge was accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on his\nwife's account before their marriage; he fancied now that if he submitted\nto be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heard\nof it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him. I\nsoon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those days\nthough duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashion\namong the officers--so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice\nsometimes be.\n\nIt was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven o'clock\nthe next day on the outskirts of the town--and then something happened that\nin very truth was the turning-point of my life. In the evening, returning\nhome in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly\nAfanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with all my might, so that it\nwas covered with blood. He had not long been in my service and I had\nstruck him before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me,\nthough it's forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went\nto bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was\nbreaking. I got up--I did not want to sleep any more--I went to the\nwindow--opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it\nwas warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.\n\n\"What's the meaning of it?\" I thought. \"I feel in my heart as it were\nsomething vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,\"\nI thought, \"I feel it's not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death,\nafraid of being killed? No, that's not it, that's not it at all.\"... And\nall at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the\nevening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated\nover again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face\nand he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed\nupon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even\ndare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been\nbrought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime! It\nwas as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if I\nwere struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and\nthe birds were trilling the praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands,\nfell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my\nbrother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: \"My dear\nones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your waiting\non me?\"\n\n\"Yes, am I worth it?\" flashed through my mind. \"After all what am I worth,\nthat another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and image of\nGod, should serve me?\" For the first time in my life this question forced\nitself upon me. He had said, \"Mother, my little heart, in truth we are\neach responsible to all for all, it's only that men don't know this. If\nthey knew it, the world would be a paradise at once.\"\n\n\"God, can that too be false?\" I thought as I wept. \"In truth, perhaps, I\nam more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than all men\nin the world.\" And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared\nto me; what was I going to do? I was going to kill a good, clever, noble\nman, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his wife of happiness for\nthe rest of her life, I should be torturing and killing her too. I lay\nthus in my bed with my face in the pillow, heedless how the time was\npassing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch\nme.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"it's a good thing you are up already, it's time we were\noff, come along!\"\n\nI did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out to\nthe carriage, however.\n\n\"Wait here a minute,\" I said to him. \"I'll be back directly, I have\nforgotten my purse.\"\n\nAnd I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.\n\n\"Afanasy,\" I said, \"I gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgive\nme,\" I said.\n\nHe started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw that\nit was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's uniform, I\ndropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" I said.\n\nThen he was completely aghast.\n\n\"Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?\"\n\nAnd he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his hands,\nturned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I flew out to my\ncomrade and jumped into the carriage.\n\n\"Ready,\" I cried. \"Have you ever seen a conqueror?\" I asked him. \"Here is\none before you.\"\n\nI was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't remember what\nabout.\n\nHe looked at me. \"Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll keep up\nthe honor of the uniform, I can see.\"\n\nSo we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We were placed\ntwelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly, looking him full\nin the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked lovingly at him, for I\nknew what I would do. His shot just grazed my cheek and ear.\n\n\"Thank God,\" I cried, \"no man has been killed,\" and I seized my pistol,\nturned back and flung it far away into the wood. \"That's the place for\nyou,\" I cried.\n\nI turned to my adversary.\n\n\"Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,\" I said, \"for my unprovoked insult\nto you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten times worse than you\nand more, maybe. Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the\nworld.\"\n\nI had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" cried my adversary, annoyed, \"if you did not want to\nfight, why did not you let me alone?\"\n\n\"Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,\" I answered him gayly.\n\n\"As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to\nagree with your opinion,\" said he.\n\n\"Bravo,\" I cried, clapping my hands. \"I agree with you there too. I have\ndeserved it!\"\n\n\"Will you shoot, sir, or not?\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" I said; \"if you like, fire at me again, but it would be\nbetter for you not to fire.\"\n\nThe seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: \"Can you disgrace the\nregiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness! If\nI'd only known this!\"\n\nI stood facing them all, not laughing now.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"is it really so wonderful in these days to find a\nman who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing?\"\n\n\"But not in a duel,\" cried my second again.\n\n\"That's what's so strange,\" I said. \"For I ought to have owned my fault as\nsoon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before leading him into a\ngreat and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque, that to act\nin that way would have been almost impossible, for only after I have faced\nhis shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any\nsignificance for him, and if I had spoken before, he would have said, 'He\nis a coward, the sight of the pistols has frightened him, no use to listen\nto him.' Gentlemen,\" I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart,\n\"look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the\ntender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we,\nare sinful and foolish, and we don't understand that life is heaven, for\nwe have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all\nits beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.\"\n\nI would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the sweetness\nand youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my heart as I had\nnever known before in my life.\n\n\"All this as rational and edifying,\" said my antagonist, \"and in any case\nyou are an original person.\"\n\n\"You may laugh,\" I said to him, laughing too, \"but afterwards you will\napprove of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,\" said he; \"will you shake hands?\nfor I believe you are genuinely sincere.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"not now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserve\nyour esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.\"\n\nWe went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him. All\nmy comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass\njudgment on me the same day.\n\n\"He has disgraced the uniform,\" they said; \"let him resign his\ncommission.\"\n\nSome stood up for me: \"He faced the shot,\" they said.\n\n\"Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.\"\n\n\"If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own pistol\nfirst before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into the forest.\nNo, there's something else in this, something original.\"\n\nI enjoyed listening and looking at them. \"My dear friends and comrades,\"\nsaid I, \"don't worry about my resigning my commission, for I have done so\nalready. I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my\ndischarge I shall go into a monastery--it's with that object I am leaving\nthe regiment.\"\n\nWhen I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.\n\n\"You should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we can't\njudge a monk.\"\n\nThey laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but kindly\nand merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even those who had been\nsternest in their censure, and all the following month, before my\ndischarge came, they could not make enough of me. \"Ah, you monk,\" they\nwould say. And every one said something kind to me, they began trying to\ndissuade me, even to pity me: \"What are you doing to yourself?\"\n\n\"No,\" they would say, \"he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and could have\nfired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before that he\nshould become a monk, that's why he did it.\"\n\nIt was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I had been\nkindly received, but had not been the object of special attention, and now\nall came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me, but they\nloved me. I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel,\nthe authorities took no notice of it, because my antagonist was a near\nrelation of our general, and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious\nconsequences, and as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. And\nI began then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,\nfor it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversations\nmostly took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women\nparticularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.\n\n\"But how can I possibly be responsible for all?\" every one would laugh in\nmy face. \"Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?\"\n\n\"You may well not know it,\" I would answer, \"since the whole world has\nlong been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies as\ntruth and demand the same lies from others. Here I have for once in my\nlife acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman. Though\nyou are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.\"\n\n\"But how can we help being friendly to you?\" said my hostess, laughing.\nThe room was full of people. All of a sudden the young lady rose, on whose\naccount the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to be\nmy future wife. I had not noticed her coming into the room. She got up,\ncame to me and held out her hand.\n\n\"Let me tell you,\" she said, \"that I am the first not to laugh at you, but\non the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you for\nyour action then.\"\n\nHer husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almost\nkissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was especially\ncaught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others. I knew him\nby name already, but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word\nwith him till that evening.\n\n_(d) The Mysterious Visitor_\n\nHe had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent position,\nrespected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence. He subscribed\nconsiderable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum; he was very\ncharitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known after his\ndeath. He was a man of about fifty, almost stern in appearance and not\nmuch given to conversation. He had been married about ten years and his\nwife, who was still young, had borne him three children. Well, I was\nsitting alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenly\nopened and this gentleman walked in.\n\nI must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my former\nquarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an old\nlady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady's servant waited upon\nme, for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the\nduel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt ashamed to look\nhim in the face after my last interview with him. So prone is the man of\nthe world to be ashamed of any righteous action.\n\n\"I have,\" said my visitor, \"with great interest listened to you speaking\nin different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make your\npersonal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately. Can you, dear\nsir, grant me this favor?\"\n\n\"I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an honor.\"\nI said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I impressed\nfrom the first moment by the appearance of this man. For though other\npeople had listened to me with interest and attention, no one had come to\nme before with such a serious, stern and concentrated expression. And now\nhe had come to see me in my own rooms. He sat down.\n\n\"You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,\" he said; \"as you\nhave dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked incurring\nthe contempt of all.\"\n\n\"Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,\" I replied.\n\n\"No, it's not excessive,\" he answered; \"believe me, such a course of\naction is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has\nimpressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,\" he\ncontinued. \"Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps\nunseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can recall\nthem, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the\nduel. Do not think my question frivolous; on the contrary, I have in\nasking the question a secret motive of my own, which I will perhaps\nexplain to you later on, if it is God's will that we should become more\nintimately acquainted.\"\n\nAll the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into the face\nand I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on my\nside also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his soul.\n\n\"You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my\nopponent's forgiveness,\" I answered; \"but I had better tell you from the\nbeginning what I have not yet told any one else.\" And I described all that\nhad passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to the ground\nat his feet. \"From that you can see for yourself,\" I concluded, \"that at\nthe time of the duel it was easier for me, for I had made a beginning\nalready at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go farther\nalong it was far from being difficult, but became a source of joy and\nhappiness.\"\n\nI liked the way he looked at me as he listened. \"All that,\" he said, \"is\nexceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.\"\n\nAnd from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And we\nshould have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of himself.\nBut about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked me\nabout myself. In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke with\nperfect frankness to him about all my feelings; \"for,\" thought I, \"what\nneed have I to know his secrets, since I can see without that that he is a\ngood man? Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, he\ncomes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.\" And I\nlearned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man of\nlofty mind.\n\n\"That life is heaven,\" he said to me suddenly, \"that I have long been\nthinking about\"; and all at once he added, \"I think of nothing else\nindeed.\" He looked at me and smiled. \"I am more convinced of it than you\nare, I will tell you later why.\"\n\nI listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me\nsomething.\n\n\"Heaven,\" he went on, \"lies hidden within all of us--here it lies hidden in\nme now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all\ntime.\"\n\nI looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing\nmysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.\n\n\"And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins,\nyou were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you could\ncomprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very truth, so soon\nas men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a\ndream, but a living reality.\"\n\n\"And when,\" I cried out to him bitterly, \"when will that come to pass? and\nwill it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?\"\n\n\"What then, you don't believe it,\" he said. \"You preach it and don't\nbelieve it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to\npass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has its\nlaw. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to\nrecreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Until\nyou have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one,\nbrotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kind\nof common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges\nwith equal consideration for all. Every one will think his share too small\nand they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.\nYou ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have\nto go through the period of isolation.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by isolation?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age--it has\nnot fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one\nstrives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure\nthe greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his\nefforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for\ninstead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All\nmankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in\nhis own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has,\nfrom the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.\nHe heaps up riches by himself and thinks, 'How strong I am now and how\nsecure,' and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps\nup, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is\naccustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the\nwhole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men\nand in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and\nthe privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men\nhave, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to\nbe found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.\nBut this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will\nsuddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another.\nIt will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have\nsat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the\nSon of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keep\nthe banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his\nconduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men's\nsouls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love,\nthat the great idea may not die.\"\n\nOur evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and fervent\ntalk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently.\nBesides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as blame, for they\nstill loved me and treated me good-humoredly, but there's no denying that\nfashion is a great power in society. I began to regard my mysterious\nvisitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his intelligence, I began to\nperceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart, and was\npreparing himself perhaps for a great deed. Perhaps he liked my not\nshowing curiosity about his secret, not seeking to discover it by direct\nquestion nor by insinuation. But I noticed at last, that he seemed to show\nsigns of wanting to tell me something. This had become quite evident,\nindeed, about a month after he first began to visit me.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said to me once, \"that people are very inquisitive about\nus in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often. But let them\nwonder, for _soon all will be explained_.\"\n\nSometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and almost\nalways on such occasions he would get up and go away. Sometimes he would\nfix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, \"He will say something\ndirectly now.\" But he would suddenly begin talking of something ordinary\nand familiar. He often complained of headache too.\n\nOne day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking with great\nfervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his face worked\nconvulsively, while he stared persistently at me.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I said; \"do you feel ill?\"--he had just been\ncomplaining of headache.\n\n\"I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.\"\n\nHe said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. \"Why is it he is\nsmiling?\" The thought flashed through my mind before I realized anything\nelse. I too turned pale.\n\n\"What are you saying?\" I cried.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, with a pale smile, \"how much it has cost me to say the\nfirst word. Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the first step and shall\ngo on.\"\n\nFor a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him at\nthat time, but only after he had been to see me three days running and\ntold me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended by being convinced,\nto my great grief and amazement. His crime was a great and terrible one.\n\nFourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner, a wealthy\nand handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He fell passionately\nin love with her, declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry\nhim. But she had already given her heart to another man, an officer of\nnoble birth and high rank in the service, who was at that time away at the\nfront, though she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offer\nand begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to visit her,\nhe took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through\nthe garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often happens,\na crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than\nothers.\n\nEntering the garret through the skylight, he went down the ladder, knowing\nthat the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the negligence of\nthe servants, left unlocked. He hoped to find it so, and so it was. He\nmade his way in the dark to her bedroom, where a light was burning. As\nthough on purpose, both her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the\nsame street, without asking leave. The other servants slept in the\nservants' quarters or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passion\nflamed up at the sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger\ntook possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he\nthrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then with\ndevilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall on\nthe servants. He was so base as to take her purse, to open her chest with\nkeys from under her pillow, and to take some things from it, doing it all\nas it might have been done by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers\nand taking only money. He took some of the larger gold things, but left\nsmaller articles that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too,\nsome things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done\nthis awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.\n\nNeither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after in\nhis life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal. No one\nindeed knew of his love for her, for he was always reserved and silent and\nhad no friend to whom he would have opened his heart. He was looked upon\nsimply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of the murdered\nwoman, as for the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serf\nof hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance\nconfirmed the suspicion. The man knew--indeed his mistress did not conceal\nthe fact--that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had decided\nto send him, as he had no relations and his conduct was unsatisfactory.\nPeople had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunk\nin a tavern. Two days before her death, he had run away, staying no one\nknew where in the town. The day after the murder, he was found on the road\nleading out of the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his\nright hand happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose\nhad been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that they\nhad gone to a party and that the street-door had been left open till they\nreturned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwing\nsuspicion on the innocent servant.\n\nThey arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week after the\narrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the\nhospital. There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and\nevery one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed\nby no one but the servant who had died in the hospital. And after that the\npunishment began.\n\nMy mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he was not in\nthe least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable a long time,\nbut not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the woman he\nloved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed his love,\nwhile the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the innocent\nblood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcely\nthought. The thought that his victim might have become the wife of another\nman was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in\nhis conscience that he could not have acted otherwise.\n\nAt first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness and\ndeath soon set his mind at rest, for the man's death was apparently (so he\nreflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chill\nhe had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunk\non the damp ground. The theft of the money and other things troubled him\nlittle, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but\nto avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards\nsubscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for\nmaintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his\nconscience at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact that for a\nlong time he really was at peace--he told me this himself. He entered then\nupon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a\ndifficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being a\nman of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he\ntried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too,\nfounded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good\ndeal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a\nmember of philanthropic societies.\n\nAt last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of it\nwas too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl\nand soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely\ndepression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his\nduty to his wife and children, he would escape from old memories\naltogether. But the very opposite of what he expected happened. He began,\neven in the first month of his marriage, to be continually fretted by the\nthought, \"My wife loves me--but what if she knew?\" When she first told him\nthat she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. \"I am giving life,\nbut I have taken life.\" Children came. \"How dare I love them, teach and\neducate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have shed blood.\" They\nwere splendid children, he longed to caress them; \"and I can't look at\ntheir innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.\"\n\nAt last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his\nmurdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood that\ncried out for vengeance. He had begun to have awful dreams. But, being a\nman of fortitude, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking: \"I shall\nexpiate everything by this secret agony.\" But that hope, too, was vain;\nthe longer it went on, the more intense was his suffering.\n\nHe was respected in society for his active benevolence, though every one\nwas overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the more he was\nrespected, the more intolerable it was for him. He confessed to me that he\nhad thoughts of killing himself. But he began to be haunted by another\nidea--an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable,\nthough at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it\noff. He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all\nmen that he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued\nhim, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his whole\nheart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would be\nat peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with terror, for how\ncould he carry it out? And then came what happened at my duel.\n\n\"Looking at you, I have made up my mind.\"\n\nI looked at him.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" I cried, clasping my hands, \"that such a trivial\nincident could give rise to such a resolution in you?\"\n\n\"My resolution has been growing for the last three years,\" he answered,\n\"and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking at you, I\nreproached myself and envied you.\" He said this to me almost sullenly.\n\n\"But you won't be believed,\" I observed; \"it's fourteen years ago.\"\n\n\"I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.\"\n\nThen I cried and kissed him.\n\n\"Tell me one thing, one thing,\" he said (as though it all depended upon\nme), \"my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, and though my\nchildren won't lose their rank and property, they'll be a convict's\nchildren and for ever! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall\nleave in their hearts!\"\n\nI said nothing.\n\n\"And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It's for ever, you know,\nfor ever!\"\n\nI sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt afraid.\n\n\"Well?\" He looked at me.\n\n\"Go!\" said I, \"confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Your\nchildren will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of your\nresolution.\"\n\nHe left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for more than\na fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still preparing\nhimself, still unable to bring himself to the point. He made my heart\nache. One day he would come determined and say fervently:\n\n\"I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess. Fourteen\nyears I've been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my punishment and\nbegin to live. You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there's no\nturning back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children.\nGood God, my children will understand, perhaps, what my punishment has\ncost me and will not condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth.\"\n\n\"All will understand your sacrifice,\" I said to him, \"if not at once, they\nwill understand later; for you have served truth, the higher truth, not of\nthe earth.\"\n\nAnd he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would come again,\nbitter, pale, sarcastic.\n\n\"Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though to\nsay, 'He has still not confessed!' Wait a bit, don't despise me too much.\nIt's not such an easy thing to do, as you would think. Perhaps I shall not\ndo it at all. You won't go and inform against me then, will you?\"\n\nAnd far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid to\nlook at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full of\ntears. I could not sleep at night.\n\n\"I have just come from my wife,\" he went on. \"Do you understand what the\nword 'wife' means? When I went out, the children called to me, 'Good-by,\nfather, make haste back to read _The Children's Magazine_ with us.' No,\nyou don't understand that! No one is wise from another man's woe.\"\n\nHis eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he struck the\ntable with his fist so that everything on it danced--it was the first time\nhe had done such a thing, he was such a mild man.\n\n\"But need I?\" he exclaimed, \"must I? No one has been condemned, no one has\nbeen sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever. And I've been\npunished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shan't be believed,\nthey won't believe my proofs. Need I confess, need I? I am ready to go on\nsuffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only my wife and\nchildren may be spared. Will it be just to ruin them with me? Aren't we\nmaking a mistake? What is right in this case? And will people recognize\nit, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I thought to myself, \"he is thinking of other people's\nrespect at such a moment!\" And I felt so sorry for him then, that I\nbelieve I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him. I saw\nhe was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as well as my\nmind what such a resolution meant.\n\n\"Decide my fate!\" he exclaimed again.\n\n\"Go and confess,\" I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I whispered\nit firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table, the Russian\ntranslation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John, chapter xii. verse 24:\n\n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the\nground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much\nfruit.\"\n\nI had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.\n\n\"That's true,\" he said, but he smiled bitterly. \"It's terrible the things\nyou find in those books,\" he said, after a pause. \"It's easy enough to\nthrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have been written by\nmen?\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit wrote them,\" said I.\n\n\"It's easy for you to prate,\" he smiled again, this time almost with\nhatred.\n\nI took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:\n\n\"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n\nHe read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all over.\n\n\"An awful text,\" he said. \"There's no denying you've picked out fitting\nones.\" He rose from the chair. \"Well!\" he said, \"good-by, perhaps I shan't\ncome again ... we shall meet in heaven. So I have been for fourteen years\n'in the hands of the living God,' that's how one must think of those\nfourteen years. To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go.\"\n\nI wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dare--his face\nwas contorted and somber. He went away.\n\n\"Good God,\" I thought, \"what has he gone to face!\" I fell on my knees\nbefore the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God, our swift\ndefender and helper. I was half an hour praying in tears, and it was late,\nabout midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again. I was\nsurprised.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"I've forgotten something ... my handkerchief, I\nthink.... Well, even if I've not forgotten anything, let me stay a\nlittle.\"\n\nHe sat down. I stood over him.\n\n\"You sit down, too,\" said he.\n\nI sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at me and\nsuddenly smiled--I remembered that--then he got up, embraced me warmly and\nkissed me.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, \"how I came to you a second time. Do you hear,\nremember it!\"\n\nAnd he went out.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" I thought.\n\nAnd so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was his\nbirthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance of\nhearing it from any one. On that day he always had a great gathering,\nevery one in the town went to it. It was the same this time. After dinner\nhe walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his hand--a formal\ndeclaration to the chief of his department who was present. This\ndeclaration he read aloud to the whole assembly. It contained a full\naccount of the crime, in every detail.\n\n\"I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,\" he said in\nconclusion. \"I want to suffer for my sin!\"\n\nThen he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been\nkeeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his crime, the\njewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert\nsuspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her\nbetrothed in the locket, her notebook and two letters; one from her\nbetrothed, telling her that he would soon be with her, and her unfinished\nanswer left on the table to be sent off next day. He carried off these two\nletters--what for? Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards\ninstead of destroying them as evidence against him?\n\nAnd this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every one\nrefused to believe it and thought that he was deranged, though all\nlistened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was fully decided and\nagreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal authorities\ncould not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped it. Though the\ntrinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that even if they did\nturn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on those alone.\nBesides, she might have given him those things as a friend, or asked him\nto take care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that the\ngenuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the\nmurdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet nothing was\ndestined to come of it, after all.\n\nFive days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was in\ndanger. The nature of his illness I can't explain, they said it was an\naffection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors had been\ninduced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also, and had come\nto the conclusion that it was a case of insanity. I betrayed nothing,\nthough people ran to question me. But when I wanted to visit him, I was\nfor a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his wife.\n\n\"It's you who have caused his illness,\" she said to me; \"he was always\ngloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarly\nexcited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him.\nYour preaching has brought him to this; for the last month he was always\nwith you.\"\n\nIndeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamed\nme. \"It's all your doing,\" they said. I was silent and indeed rejoiced at\nheart, for I saw plainly God's mercy to the man who had turned against\nhimself and punished himself. I could not believe in his insanity.\n\nThey let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good-by to me. I went\nin to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but his hours were\nnumbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for breath,\nbut his face was full of tender and happy feeling.\n\n\"It is done!\" he said. \"I've long been yearning to see you, why didn't you\ncome?\"\n\nI did not tell him that they would not let me see him.\n\n\"God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying,\nbut I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years. There was\nheaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dare\nto love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife nor the judges, nor\nany one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I see\nin that God's mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without a\nstain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heaven\n... I have done my duty.\"\n\nHe could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly,\nlooking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept peeping\nin at us. But he had time to whisper to me:\n\n\"Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? I\ntold you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to kill\nyou!\"\n\nI started.\n\n\"I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets,\nstruggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly\nbear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he is my judge. I\ncan't refuse to face my punishment to-morrow, for he knows all. It was not\nthat I was afraid you would betray me (I never even thought of that), but\nI thought, 'How can I look him in the face if I don't confess?' And if you\nhad been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all\nthe same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing\neverything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the cause, as\nthough you were to blame for everything. I came back to you then,\nremembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I sat down and\nasked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I pondered. If I had killed\nyou, I should have been ruined by that murder even if I had not confessed\nthe other. But I didn't think about that at all, and I didn't want to\nthink of it at that moment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myself\non you for everything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let\nme tell you, you were never nearer death.\"\n\nA week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave. The chief\npriest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible illness\nthat had cut short his days. But all the town was up in arms against me\nafter the funeral, and people even refused to see me. Some, at first a few\nand afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the truth of his story,\nand they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness,\nfor man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But I\nheld my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months\nlater by God's grace I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praising\nthe unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember in\nmy prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered so\ngreatly.\n\n\n\nChapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossima\n\n\n_(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance_\n\nFathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world the word\nis nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others it is\nused as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is growing. It is\ntrue, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards, gluttons,\nprofligates and insolent beggars among monks. Educated people point to\nthese: \"You are idlers, useless members of society, you live on the labor\nof others, you are shameless beggars.\" And yet how many meek and humble\nmonks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! These\nare less noticed, or passed over in silence. And how surprised men would\nbe if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary\nprayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more! For they are\nin truth made ready in peace and quiet \"for the day and the hour, the\nmonth and the year.\" Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image of\nChrist fair and undefiled, in the purity of God's truth, from the times of\nthe Fathers of old, the Apostles and the martyrs. And when the time comes\nthey will show it to the tottering creeds of the world. That is a great\nthought. That star will rise out of the East.\n\nThat is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at the\nworldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has not\nGod's image and His truth been distorted in them? They have science; but\nin science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. The spiritual\nworld, the higher part of man's being is rejected altogether, dismissed\nwith a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The world has proclaimed the\nreign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom\nof theirs? Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:\n\n\"You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the\nmost rich and powerful. Don't be afraid of satisfying them and even\nmultiply your desires.\" That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that\nthey see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication of\ndesires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy\nand murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the\nmeans of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting\nmore and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community,\nas it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.\n\nAlas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom as the\nmultiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their own\nnature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous\nfancies are fostered in them. They live only for mutual envy, for luxury\nand ostentation. To have dinners, visits, carriages, rank and slaves to\nwait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which life, honor and human\nfeeling are sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable to\nsatisfy it. We see the same thing among those who are not rich, while the\npoor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness. But soon\nthey will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to it. I ask\nyou is such a man free? I knew one \"champion of freedom\" who told me\nhimself that, when he was deprived of tobacco in prison, he was so\nwretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for\nthe sake of getting tobacco again! And such a man says, \"I am fighting for\nthe cause of humanity.\"\n\nHow can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps of\nsome action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And it's no wonder\nthat instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and instead\nof serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have\nfallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation, as my mysterious\nvisitor and teacher said to me in my youth. And therefore the idea of the\nservice of humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is\nmore and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes\ntreated with derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What can\nbecome of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the\ninnumerable desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and what\nconcern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in\naccumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown\nless.\n\nThe monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer are\nlaughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom. I\ncut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and\nwanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God's help I attain\nfreedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most capable of\nconceiving a great idea and serving it--the rich man in his isolation or\nthe man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and\nhabits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, \"You have secluded\nyourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, and\nhave forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!\" But we shall see which\nwill be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but\nthey, who are in isolation, though they don't see that. Of old, leaders of\nthe people came from among us, and why should they not again? The same\nmeek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great\ncause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people. And the Russian monk\nhas always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if the\npeople are isolated. The people believe as we do, and an unbelieving\nreformer will never do anything in Russia, even if he is sincere in heart\nand a genius. Remember that! The people will meet the atheist and overcome\nhim, and Russia will be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and\nguard his heart. Go on educating him quietly. That's your duty as monks,\nfor the peasant has God in his heart.\n\n(_f_) _Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them to\nbe Brothers in the Spirit_\n\nOf course, I don't deny that there is sin in the peasants too. And the\nfire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from above\ndownwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too. Money-\nlenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. Already the merchant\ngrows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show himself cultured\nthough he has not a trace of culture, and to this end meanly despises his\nold traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of his fathers. He visits\nprinces, though he is only a peasant corrupted. The peasants are rotting\nin drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit. And what cruelty to their\nwives, to their children even! All from drunkenness! I've seen in the\nfactories children of nine years old, frail, rickety, bent and already\ndepraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, work all day long,\nthe vile language and the drink, the drink--is that what a little child's\nheart needs? He needs sunshine, childish play, good examples all about\nhim, and at least a little love. There must be no more of this, monks, no\nmore torturing of children, rise up and preach that, make haste, make\nhaste!\n\nBut God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and cannot\nrenounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and that they\ndo wrong in sinning. So that our people still believe in righteousness,\nhave faith in God and weep tears of devotion.\n\nIt is different with the upper classes. They, following science, want to\nbase justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and they\nhave already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no sin. And\nthat's consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning of crime? In\nEurope the people are already rising up against the rich with violence,\nand the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed,\nand teaching them that their wrath is righteous. But their \"wrath is\naccursed, for it is cruel.\" But God will save Russia as He has saved her\nmany times. Salvation will come from the people, from their faith and\ntheir meekness.\n\nFathers and teachers, watch over the people's faith and this will not be a\ndream. I've been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity,\ntheir true and seemly dignity. I've seen it myself, I can testify to it,\nI've seen it and marveled at it, I've seen it in spite of the degraded\nsins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry. They are not\nservile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner\nand bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.\n\"You are rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, God\nbless you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact\nthat I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.\"\n\nIn truth if they don't say this (for they don't know how to say this yet),\nthat is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known it myself, and,\nwould you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is, the more\nnoticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them are for the\nmost part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness\nand indifference. But God will save His people, for Russia is great in her\nhumility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future.\nIt will come to pass, that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by\nbeing ashamed of his riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his\nhumility, will understand and give way before him, will respond joyfully\nand kindly to his honorable shame. Believe me that it will end in that;\nthings are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritual\ndignity of man, and that will only be understood among us. If we were\nbrothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will never\nagree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and\nit will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world. So may it\nbe, so may it be!\n\nFathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my wanderings\nI met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was eight years since\nI had parted from him. He chanced to see me in the market-place,\nrecognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he was! He simply pounced\non me: \"Master dear, is it you? Is it really you I see?\" He took me home\nwith him.\n\nHe was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two little\nchildren. He and his wife earned their living as costermongers in the\nmarket-place. His room was poor, but bright and clean. He made me sit\ndown, set the samovar, sent for his wife, as though my appearance were a\nfestival for them. He brought me his children: \"Bless them, Father.\"\n\n\"Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will pray for\nthem. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since that\nday, for it all came from you,\" said I. And I explained that to him as\nwell as I could. And what do you think? The man kept gazing at me and\ncould not believe that I, his former master, an officer, was now before\nhim in such a guise and position; it made him shed tears.\n\n\"Why are you weeping?\" said I, \"better rejoice over me, dear friend, whom\nI can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.\"\n\nHe did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over me\ntenderly.\n\n\"What has became of your fortune?\" he asked.\n\n\"I gave it to the monastery,\" I answered; \"we live in common.\"\n\nAfter tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he brought out half a\nrouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble I saw him\nthrusting hurriedly into my hand: \"That's for you in your wanderings, it\nmay be of use to you, Father.\"\n\nI took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out rejoicing.\nAnd on my way I thought: \"Here we are both now, he at home and I on the\nroad, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet smiling joyfully in\nthe gladness of our hearts, remembering how God brought about our\nmeeting.\"\n\nI have never seen him again since then. I had been his master and he my\nservant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts,\nthere was a great human bond between us. I have thought a great deal about\nthat, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that that grand\nand simple-hearted unity might in due time become universal among the\nRussian people? I believe that it will come to pass and that the time is\nat hand.\n\nAnd of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I was often\nangry with servants; \"the cook had served something too hot, the orderly\nhad not brushed my clothes.\" But what taught me better then was a thought\nof my dear brother's, which I had heard from him in childhood: \"Am I worth\nit, that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty\nand ignorance?\" And I wondered at the time that such simple and self-\nevident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds.\n\nIt is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act so\nthat your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant.\nAnd why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him see it, and\nthat without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his? Why should not\nmy servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take him into my family\nand rejoice in doing so? Even now this can be done, but it will lead to\nthe grand unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servants\nfor himself, or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he\ndoes now, but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be the\nservant of all, as the Gospel teaches.\n\nAnd can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only in deeds\nof light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in gluttony,\nfornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one with the\nother? I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand.\nPeople laugh and ask: \"When will that time come and does it look like\ncoming?\" I believe that with Christ's help we shall accomplish this great\nthing. And how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man\nwhich were unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when their\ndestined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth.\nSo it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, and\nall men will say: \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the\ncorner-stone of the building.\"\n\nAnd we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when will\nyou build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone,\nwithout Christ? If they declare that it is they who are advancing towards\nunity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one may\npositively marvel at such simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic\ndreams than we. They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by\nflooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that\ntaketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not for\nChrist's covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last two\nmen on earth. And those two last men would not be able to restrain each\nother in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself.\nAnd that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that\nfor the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.\n\nWhile I was still wearing an officer's uniform after my duel, I talked\nabout servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed at\nme. \"What!\" they asked, \"are we to make our servants sit down on the sofa\nand offer them tea?\" And I answered them: \"Why not, sometimes at least?\"\nEvery one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer was not\nclear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.\n\n(_g_) _Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds_\n\nYoung man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer\nis sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will\ngive you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an\neducation. Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to\nyourself, \"Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to-day.\" For\nevery hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and\ntheir souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude,\nunknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether\nthey have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth\nperhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew\nthem not nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread\nbefore the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one to\npray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! And\nGod will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much\npity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving and\nmerciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake.\n\nBrothers, have no fear of men's sin. Love a man even in his sin, for that\nis the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all\nGod's creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf,\nevery ray of God's light. Love the animals, love the plants, love\neverything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery\nin things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better\nevery day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all-\nembracing love. Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of\nthought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble it, don't harass them, don't\ndeprive them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent. Man, do\nnot pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin,\nand you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it,\nand leave the traces of your foulness after you--alas, it is true of almost\nevery one of us! Love children especially, for they too are sinless like\nthe angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to\nguide us. Woe to him who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love\nchildren. The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the\nfarthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could not pass\nby a child without emotion. That's the nature of the man.\n\nAt some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men's\nsin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Always\ndecide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may\nsubdue the whole world. Loving humility is marvelously strong, the\nstrongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it.\n\nEvery day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watch\nyourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass by a little\nchild, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you\nmay not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image,\nunseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You don't know\nit, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and all\nbecause you were not careful before the child, because you did not foster\nin yourself a careful, actively benevolent love. Brothers, love is a\nteacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire,\nit is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor. For we must love not\nonly occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one can love\noccasionally, even the wicked can.\n\nMy brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless, but it\nis right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch\nin one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It may be\nsenseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier at\nyour side--a little happier, anyway--and children and all animals, if you\nwere nobler than you are now. It's all like an ocean, I tell you. Then you\nwould pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in a sort\nof transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your sin. Treasure\nthis ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.\n\nMy friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds of\nheaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear not\nthat it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. Do not\nsay, \"Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, and\nwe are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away and\nhindering our good work from being done.\" Fly from that dejection,\nchildren! There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and\nmake yourself responsible for all men's sins, that is the truth, you know,\nfriends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for\neverything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and\nthat you are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing your\nown indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of\nSatan and murmuring against God.\n\nOf the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth to\ncomprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to share\nit, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine. Indeed,\nmany of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we cannot\ncomprehend on earth. Let not that be a stumbling-block, and think not that\nit may serve as a justification to you for anything. For the Eternal Judge\nasks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will know\nthat yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then and\nwill not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and if\nit were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should be\nundone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the flood. Much\non earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that we have been given a\nprecious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world, with the\nhigher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are not\nhere but in other worlds. That is why the philosophers say that we cannot\napprehend the reality of things on earth.\n\nGod took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and His\ngarden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what grows\nlives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other\nmysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you, the\nheavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be indifferent to life\nand even grow to hate it. That's what I think.\n\n_(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End_\n\nRemember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one. For no one\ncan judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just such a criminal\nas the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more than all men\nto blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will be able to be a\njudge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous\nmyself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me. If\nyou can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is\njudging, take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go without\nreproach. And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same\nspirit so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more\nbitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched,\nmocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows his\ntime has not yet come, but it will come in due course. And if it come not,\nno matter; if not he, then another in his place will understand and\nsuffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled.\nBelieve that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and\nfaith of the saints.\n\nWork without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to sleep, \"I\nhave not done what I ought to have done,\" rise up at once and do it. If\nthe people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you, fall\ndown before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you are to blame\nfor their not wanting to hear you. And if you cannot speak to them in\ntheir bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility, never losing\nhope. If all men abandon you and even drive you away by force, then when\nyou are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears\nand it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in\nyour solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you\nwere left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise\nGod in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered together--then there\nis a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace each other tenderly and\npraise God, for if only in you two His truth has been fulfilled.\n\nIf you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for your\nsudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous man,\nrejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not sinned.\n\nIf the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming\ndistress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above all\nthings that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as though\nyou were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering and bear it\nand your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too are\nguilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one\nman sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light,\nyou would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might\nperhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though your\nlight was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm and\ndoubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they were not\nsaved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter,\nthen their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when you\nare dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains. Men are always\nsaved after the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay\nthem, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.\nYou are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek no\nreward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which is\nonly vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great nor the mighty,\nbut be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know the times, study that.\nWhen you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth and\nkiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love.\nLove all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water the\nearth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don't be ashamed of\nthat ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not\ngiven to many but only to the elect.\n\n_(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_\n\nFathers and teachers, I ponder, \"What is hell?\" I maintain that it is the\nsuffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,\nimmeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his\ncoming to earth, the power of saying, \"I am and I love.\" Once, only once,\nthere was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for that was\nearthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And that happy\ncreature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned\nit and remained callous. Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham's\nbosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man\nand Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is\njust his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be\nbrought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. For\nhe sees clearly and says to himself, \"Now I have understanding, and though\nI now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my\nlove, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with a\ndrop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the\nfiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it\non earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Even\nthough I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for that\nlife is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is a gulf\nfixed between that life and this existence.\"\n\nThey talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don't go into that mystery\nand I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, they\nwould be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still\ngreater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that\nspiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not\nexternal but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it\nwould be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the\nrighteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called\nthem up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their\ntorments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst\nfor responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible. In the\ntimidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of this\nimpossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting the love\nof the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it, by this\nsubmissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will attain at last,\nas it were, to a certain semblance of that active love which they scorned\nin life, to something like its outward expression.... I am sorry, friends\nand brothers, that I cannot express this clearly. But woe to those who\nhave slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that there\ncan be none more miserable then they. They tell us that it is a sin to\npray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were, renounces them, but in\nmy secret heart I believe that we may pray even for them. Love can never\nbe an offense to Christ. For such as those I have prayed inwardly all my\nlife, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray for them\nevery day.\n\nOh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite of\ntheir certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there are\nsome fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his proud\nspirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they are\ntortured by their own choice. For they have cursed themselves, cursing God\nand life. They live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in the\ndesert sucking blood out of his own body. But they are never satisfied,\nand they refuse forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannot\nbehold the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of\nlife should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His own\ncreation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and\nyearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain to death....\n\n                  -------------------------------------\n\nHere Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov's manuscript ends. I repeat, it is\nincomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover only\nFather Zossima's earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we find\nbrought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions.\nHis utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from\nthe rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in\nAlexey Fyodorovitch's manuscript.\n\nThe elder's death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although those\nwho were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was\napproaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so\nsuddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing him\nthat night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there\nwas at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five\nminutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was\nimpossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his\nchest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from\ntheir seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at\nthem with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed\nhis face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful\necstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his\nsoul to God.\n\nThe news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the\nmonastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was\nfrom their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient\nritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn\nthe news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was\ntalking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the\nmonastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only\nadd here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so\nstrange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the\ntownspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is\nstill vividly remembered in the town.\n\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\n\nBook VII. Alyosha\n\n\n\nChapter I. The Breath Of Corruption\n\n\nThe body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the\nestablished ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits\nare not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \"If any one of the\nmonks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it\nis) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the\ncross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the\nhands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\" All this was done by\nFather Paissy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and\nwrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to\nallow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head he\nput a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and the\ndead man's face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was put an ikon\nof the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been\nmade ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the\ncell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors\nand fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest\nrule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks\nin holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after\nthe requiem service. Father Paissy desired later on to read the Gospel all\nday and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the\nFather Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for\nsomething extraordinary, an unheard-of, even \"unseemly\" excitement and\nimpatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitors\nfrom the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the\ntown. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked. Both the\nSuperintendent and Father Paissy did their utmost to calm the general\nbustle and agitation.\n\nWhen it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in most\ncases children, with them from the town--as though they had been waiting\nexpressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the dead\nelder's remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately made\nmanifest in accordance with their faith. It was only then apparent how\nunquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima during\nhis lifetime as a great saint. And those who came were far from being all\nof the humbler classes.\n\nThis intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such\nhaste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,\nimpressed Father Paissy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen something\nof the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything\nhe had looked for. When he came across any of the monks who displayed this\nexcitement, Father Paissy began to reprove them. \"Such immediate\nexpectation of something extraordinary,\" he said, \"shows a levity,\npossible to worldly people but unseemly in us.\"\n\nBut little attention was paid him and Father Paissy noticed it uneasily.\nYet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at the bottom\nof his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware\nof it, though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation around\nhim, and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it was\nparticularly unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presence\naroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead man's cell he\nnoticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached himself)\nthe presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still\nstaying in the monastery. Of both of them Father Paissy felt for some\nreason suddenly suspicious--though, indeed, he might well have felt the\nsame about others.\n\nThe monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited\ncrowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking questions,\neverywhere he was listening, on all sides he was whispering with a\npeculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest impatience\nand even a sort of irritation.\n\nAs for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitage\nat the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that good-hearted\nbut weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to the\nhermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she was\novertaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitin\nto the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter\nevery half-hour or so \"_everything that takes place_.\" She regarded\nRakitin as a most religious and devout young man. He was particularly\nclever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most\nto their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from\ndoing so.\n\nIt was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging about\nthe tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scattered\nhere and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the hermitage,\nFather Paissy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen him for some\ntime, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of him than he at\nonce noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting\non the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his\nsaintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to the\nwall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him,\nFather Paissy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face\nhidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs.\nFather Paissy stood over him for a little.\n\n\"Enough, dear son, enough, dear,\" he pronounced with feeling at last. \"Why\ndo you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don't you know that this is the\ngreatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!\"\n\nAlyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with crying\nlike a child's, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid\nhis face in his hands again.\n\n\"Maybe it is well,\" said Father Paissy thoughtfully; \"weep if you must,\nChrist has sent you those tears.\"\n\n\"Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to\ngladden your dear heart,\" he added to himself, walking away from Alyosha,\nand thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however, for he felt\nthat he too might weep looking at him.\n\nMeanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems\nfor the dead followed in their due course. Father Paissy again took Father\nIosif's place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But before three\no'clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at\nthe end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so\ncontrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has\nbeen minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding\nneighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost\nrepulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and\nwas such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the most\nnatural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mention\nof it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the\nheart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha,\nforming a crisis and turning-point in his spiritual development, giving a\nshock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his\nlife and gave it a definite aim.\n\nAnd so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father\nZossima's body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the\nquestion of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the\ncoffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and\nalmost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed\nit, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the\nbody of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if\nnot a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For they\nexpected something quite different.\n\nAnd, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first\nonly observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently\neach afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o'clock\nthose signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly\nreached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated\nto the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in\nthe shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it,\nbelievers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the\nbelievers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for \"men\nlove the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,\" as the deceased elder\nhad said in one of his exhortations.\n\nThe fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin,\ngrowing gradually more marked, and by three o'clock it was quite\nunmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal\ncould be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have\nbeen possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after\nthis discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many\nyears afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they\nrecalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions.\nFor in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men,\nwhose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins,\ntoo, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead\nbodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.\nOf course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose\nmemory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition,\nshowed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as\ntouching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as\nsomething blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God's grace, of\nstill greater glory from their tombs in the future.\n\nOne such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job,\nwho had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had\nbeen a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was\npointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and\nmysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb\non which Father Paissy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another\nmemory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy,\nwho was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the\neldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all\nthe pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these\nhad lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of\ndecomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light\nin their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came\nfrom their bodies.\n\nYet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain\nthe frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin\nof Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes\nwere simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostility\nto the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy\nhidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was\njealousy of the dead man's saintliness, so firmly established during his\nlifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though\nthe late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles,\nand had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in\nfact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so had\ncome to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery\nbut in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but \"Why do they\nthink him so saintly?\" And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave\nrise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was\nwhy many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition\nwhich came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the\nsame time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently\ndevoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted\nby this incident. This was how the thing happened.\n\nAs soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of\nthe monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They went\nin, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the\ncrowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook their heads\nmournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight which\ngleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no one reproached\nthem for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for\nthe majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it\nseemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand\nfor a time.\n\nVisitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went into\nthe cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went into\nthe cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage.\nAfter three o'clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and\nthis was no doubt owing to the shocking news. People were attracted who\nwould not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come,\nand among them were some personages of high standing. But external decorum\nwas still preserved and Father Paissy, with a stern face, continued firmly\nand distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what was\ntaking place around him, though he had, in fact, observed something\nunusual long before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually\nlouder and more confident, reached even him. \"It shows God's judgment is\nnot as man's,\" Father Paissy heard suddenly. The first to give utterance\nto this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known\nto be a man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had\nlong been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning\nconclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction\nat that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon they\nbegan to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they\nhad a sort of right to discard it.\n\n\"And for what reason can _this_ have happened,\" some of the monks said, at\nfirst with a show of regret; \"he had a small frame and his flesh was dried\nup on his bones, what was there to decay?\"\n\n\"It must be a sign from heaven,\" others hastened to add, and their opinion\nwas adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out, too, that if\nthe decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner,\nit would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-four\nhours, but this premature corruption \"was in excess of nature,\" and so the\nfinger of God was evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed\nirresistible.\n\nGentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man's,\ntried to reply to some of the evil speakers that \"this is not held\neverywhere alike,\" and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just\nwas not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that even\nin the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatly\nconfounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of the\nglorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the color\nof the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have\ndecayed in it. \"And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign\nthat the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but\nblack, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such glory--that is\nthe belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has been\npreserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,\" said Father\nIosif in conclusion.\n\nBut the meek Father's words had little effect and even provoked a mocking\nretort. \"That's all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,\" the\nmonks decided. \"We stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts of\ninnovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?\" added others.\n\n\"We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the\nTurks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been impure\nand they have no bells even,\" the most sneering added.\n\nFather Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward his\nown opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it\nhimself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was\nbeginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little by\nlittle, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif.\nAnd so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with\ndevout obedience the institution of the eldership were all at once\nterribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another's faces, when they\nmet. Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty,\nheld up their heads proudly. \"There was no smell of corruption from the\nlate elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,\" they recalled malignantly.\n\"But he gained that glory not because he was an elder, but because he was\na holy man.\"\n\nAnd this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father\nZossima. \"His teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy and\nnot a vale of tears,\" said some of the more unreasonable. \"He followed the\nfashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in hell,\" others,\nstill more unreasonable, added. \"He was not strict in fasting, allowed\nhimself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send it\nto him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?\" could be heard\namong some of the envious. \"He sat in pride,\" the most malignant declared\nvindictively; \"he considered himself a saint and he took it as his due\nwhen people knelt before him.\" \"He abused the sacrament of confession,\"\nthe fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious\nwhisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in their\ndevotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the\ndeceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was\nterrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were not\nyet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this\nattentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. \"Yes, clearly Father\nFerapont was right in his judgment yesterday,\" and at that moment Father\nFerapont himself made his appearance, as though on purpose to increase the\nconfusion.\n\nI have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the\napiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglect\non the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the rules binding\non all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a\nchoice about it. For it would have been discreditable to insist on\nburdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day\nand night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, the\nmonks would have said, \"He is holier than all of us and he follows a rule\nharder than ours. And if he does not go to church, it's because he knows\nwhen he ought to; he has his own rule.\" It was to avoid the chance of\nthese sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.\n\nAs every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father\nZossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that \"God's judgment\nis not the same as man's,\" and that something had happened which was \"in\nexcess of nature.\" It may well be supposed that among the first to run to\nhim with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the\nevening before and left his cell terror-stricken.\n\nI have mentioned above, that though Father Paissy, standing firm and\nimmovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see what\nwas passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in his heart,\nfor he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken by it, but\nawaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and\ninsight for the outcome of the general excitement.\n\nSuddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of\ndecorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont\nappeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him a\ncrowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not,\nhowever, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to\nsee what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certain\nawe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing.\nStanding in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his\nright arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped\nin. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up the\nsteps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther\nback in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding his\nhands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:\n\n\"Casting out I cast out!\" and, turning in all directions, he began at once\nmaking the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of\nthe cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately\nunderstood his action. For they knew he always did this wherever he went,\nand that he would not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out the\nevil spirits.\n\n\"Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!\" he repeated at each sign of the cross.\n\"Casting out I cast out,\" he roared again.\n\nHe was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest, covered\nwith gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet were bare.\nAs soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore under his\ngown could be heard clanking.\n\nFather Paissy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before him\nwaiting.\n\n\"What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against good\norder? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?\" he said at last,\nlooking sternly at him.\n\n\"What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?\" shouted Father\nFerapont crazily. \"I've come here to drive out your visitors, the unclean\ndevils. I've come to see how many have gathered here while I have been\naway. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.\"\n\n\"You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him yourself,\"\nFather Paissy went on fearlessly. \"And who can say of himself 'I am holy'?\nCan you, Father?\"\n\n\"I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not\nhave them bow down to me as an idol,\" thundered Father Ferapont. \"Nowadays\nfolk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,\" he turned to the\ncrowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, \"did not believe in devils.\nHe gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they have become as common\nas spiders in the corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that\nwe see a great sign from God.\"\n\nThe incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in his\ndreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits. When\nin the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima, the elder had\nadvised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that was of no use,\nhe advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special\nmedicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as\nthey talked over it--and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the\ncensorious had hastened to report this \"extraordinary\" counsel on the part\nof the elder.\n\n\"Go away, Father!\" said Father Paissy, in a commanding voice, \"it's not\nfor man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a 'sign' which neither\nyou, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and do\nnot trouble the flock!\" he repeated impressively.\n\n\"He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign\nhas come. That is clear and it's a sin to hide it,\" the fanatic, carried\naway by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be quieted. \"He was\nseduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in their pockets, he\nsipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with sweet things and his\nmind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is put to shame....\"\n\n\"You speak lightly, Father.\" Father Paissy, too, raised his voice. \"I\nadmire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some\nfrivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!\"\nFather Paissy thundered in conclusion.\n\n\"I will go,\" said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as\nbitter. \"You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my\nhumbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have forgotten\nwhat I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your\nsubtlety.\"\n\nFather Paissy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont paused\nand, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently, pronounced in a\nsing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:\n\n\"To-morrow they will sing over him 'Our Helper and Defender'--a splendid\nanthem--and over me when I die all they'll sing will be 'What earthly\njoy'--a little canticle,\"(6) he added with tearful regret. \"You are proud\nand puffed up, this is a vain place!\" he shouted suddenly like a madman,\nand with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the\nsteps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once and\nsome lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Paissy, following\nFather Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. But the excited old\nfanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, he\nsuddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, as\nthough some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.\n\n\"My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!\" he shouted\nfrantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling face\ndownwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by his\ntears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up to him;\nthere were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed\nto take possession of them all.\n\n\"This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!\" some\ncried aloud, losing their fear. \"This is he who should be an elder,\"\nothers added malignantly.\n\n\"He wouldn't be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn't serve a\ncursed innovation ... he wouldn't imitate their foolery,\" other voices\nchimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but\nat that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossing\nthemselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went\nback to his cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations which\nwere utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater number\ndispersed, hastening to service. Father Paissy let Father Iosif read in\nhis place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could not shake\nhim, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special\nreason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly wondered, \"Why am I\nsad even to dejection?\" and immediately grasped with surprise that his\nsudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowd\nthronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and he\nremembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. \"Can\nthat boy mean so much to my heart now?\" he asked himself, wondering.\n\nAt that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the direction\nof the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away his eyes and\ndropped them to the ground, and from the boy's look alone, Father Paissy\nguessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment.\n\n\"Have you, too, fallen into temptation?\" cried Father Paissy. \"Can you be\nwith those of little faith?\" he added mournfully.\n\nAlyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Paissy, but quickly turned\nhis eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood sideways and\ndid not turn his face to Father Paissy, who watched him attentively.\n\n\"Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,\" he asked again, but\nagain Alyosha gave no answer.\n\n\"Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without asking\na blessing?\"\n\nAlyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at\nthe Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart and\nmind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And suddenly,\nstill without speaking, waved his hand, as though not caring even to be\nrespectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the\nhermitage.\n\n\"You will come back again!\" murmured Father Paissy, looking after him with\nsorrowful surprise.\n\n\n\nChapter II. A Critical Moment\n\n\nFather Paissy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his \"dear\nboy\" would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated\nwith insight into the true meaning of Alyosha's spiritual condition. Yet I\nmust frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear\naccount of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love\nso much. To Father Paissy's sorrowful question, \"Are you too with those of\nlittle faith?\" I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, \"No, he\nis not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.\" Indeed, all his\ntrouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the\ntrouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha\nthought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days\nof his life. If the question is asked: \"Could all his grief and\ndisturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder's body had shown\nsigns of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?\"\nI must answer without beating about the bush, \"Yes, it certainly was.\" I\nwould only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my\nyoung hero's pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or\nto justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little\nprogress he had made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare,\non the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his\nheart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love\nwas lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little\nvalue, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my\nhero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by\nan emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to\nbe unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always\nsensible is to be suspected and is of little worth--that's my opinion!\n\n\"But,\" reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, \"every young man cannot\nbelieve in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.\"\n\nTo this I reply again, \"Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and\nsteadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.\"\n\nThough I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not\nexplain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for\nthe understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not a\nquestion of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of\nmiracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the\ntriumph of some preconceived idea--oh, no, not at all--what he saw before\nall was one figure--the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that\nholy man whom he revered with such adoration. The fact is that all the\nlove that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and\neverything had, for the past year, been concentrated--and perhaps wrongly\nso--on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long\nbeen accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy\ncould not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the\nmoment \"of every one and everything.\" He remembered afterwards how, on\nthat terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about\nwhom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten,\ntoo, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha's father, though he had so\nwarmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not\nmiracles he needed but only \"the higher justice\" which had been in his\nbelief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his\nheart. And what does it signify that this \"justice\" looked for by Alyosha\ninevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the\nashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery cherished the\nsame thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha\nrevered, Father Paissy himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubled\nby doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And a\nwhole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this\nexpectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted for,\nnot simply miracles.\n\nAnd now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every one\nin the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was his\ndue, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had judged him?\nWho could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung his\ninexperienced and virginal heart. He could not endure without\nmortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men\nshould have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the\nfrivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles, had\nthere been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why\nthis humiliation, why this premature decay, \"in excess of nature,\" as the\nspiteful monks said? Why this \"sign from heaven,\" which they so\ntriumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did they\nbelieve they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the finger of\nProvidence? Why did Providence hide its face \"at the most critical moment\"\n(so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily submitting to the blind,\ndumb, pitiless laws of nature?\n\nThat was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have said\nalready, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on\nearth should be put to shame and humiliated! This murmuring may have been\nshallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the third\ntime--and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my\nfeeling--I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that\nmoment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but,\nif love does not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an\nexceptional moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention\nsomething strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha's mind\nat this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing\nimpression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently\nhaunted Alyosha's mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that\nsomething of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul\nhad been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though\nhe was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil\nimpression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly\nrevived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of\nhis consciousness.\n\nIt had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the\nhermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards\non the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up\nand called him by his name.\n\n\"You here, Alexey? Can you have--\" he began wondering but broke off. He had\nmeant to say, \"Can you have come to this?\"\n\nAlyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once\nsaw that he heard and understood him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually\npassed into a smile that became more and more ironical.\n\n\"I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly\ndisappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just look\nat me...\"\n\nAlyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree. He\nwas not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his\nface. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side of\nhim.\n\n\"Do you know your face is quite changed? There's none of your famous\nmildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been\nill-treating you?\"\n\n\"Let me alone,\" said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his hand,\nstill looking away from him.\n\n\"Oho! So that's how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like other\nmortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you have\nsurprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It's long since I've been surprised\nat anything here. I always took you for an educated man....\"\n\nAlyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely\nunderstanding what he said.\n\n\"Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to\nstink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to\nwork miracles?\" exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.\n\n\"I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what more\ndo you want?\" cried Alyosha irritably.\n\n\"Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen\nbelieves in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with your\nGod, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't given promotion, He hasn't\nbestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!\"\n\nAlyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, and there\nwas a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.\n\n\"I am not rebelling against my God; I simply 'don't accept His world.' \"\nAlyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.\n\n\"How do you mean, you don't accept the world?\" Rakitin thought a moment\nover his answer. \"What idiocy is this?\"\n\nAlyosha did not answer.\n\n\"Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat to-\nday?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.... I think I have.\"\n\n\"You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look at\nyou. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in\nthere. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you've had\nnothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've got some sausage in my\npocket; I've brought it from the town in case of need, only you won't eat\nsausage....\"\n\n\"Give me some.\"\n\n\"I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with barricades!\nWell, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I\nshouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going\ntoo far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?\"\n\n\"Give me some vodka too.\"\n\n\"Hullo! You surprise me, brother!\" Rakitin looked at him in amazement.\n\"Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chance\nand mustn't be missed. Come along.\"\n\nAlyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.\n\n\"If your little brother Ivan could see this--wouldn't he be surprised! By\nthe way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his brother\nDmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though it reminded\nhim of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, some\nterrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him, did not\nreach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten.\nBut, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.\n\n\"Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a 'liberal booby with no\ntalents whatsoever.' Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I was\n'dishonorable.' Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense of\nhonor will do for you now.\" This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said aloud, \"let's go by the path beyond the monastery\nstraight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov's by the way.\nOnly fancy, I've written to tell her everything that happened, and would\nyou believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has a\npassion for writing notes) that 'she would never have expected _such\nconduct_ from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.' That\nwas her very word: 'conduct.' She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!\"\nhe cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the\nshoulder made him stop too.\n\n\"Do you know, Alyosha,\" he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed in\na sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was laughing\noutwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, so\ndifficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood\nin which he now saw Alyosha. \"Alyosha, do you know where we had better\ngo?\" he brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly.\n\n\"I don't care ... where you like.\"\n\n\"Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?\" pronounced Rakitin at last,\ntrembling with timid suspense.\n\n\"Let's go to Grushenka,\" Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this prompt\nand calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost started\nback.\n\n\"Well! I say!\" he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the\narm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change his\nmind.\n\nThey walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.\n\n\"And how glad she will be, how delighted!\" he muttered, but lapsed into\nsilence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was taking\nAlyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anything\nwithout a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case was\ntwofold, first a revengeful desire to see \"the downfall of the righteous,\"\nand Alyosha's fall \"from the saints to the sinners,\" over which he was\nalready gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had in\nview a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said\nlater.\n\n\"So the critical moment has come,\" he thought to himself with spiteful\nglee, \"and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just what we want.\"\n\n\n\nChapter III. An Onion\n\n\nGrushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedral\nsquare, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house of\nthe widow Morozov. The house was a large stone building of two stories,\nold and very ugly. The widow led a secluded life with her two unmarried\nnieces, who were also elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, but\nevery one knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years\nbefore, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was known\nto be the girl's protector. It was said that the jealous old man's object\nin placing his \"favorite\" with the widow Morozov was that the old woman\nshould keep a sharp eye on her new lodger's conduct. But this sharp eye\nsoon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow Morozov seldom met\nGrushenka and did not worry her by looking after her in any way. It is\ntrue that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim,\ndelicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town\nof the province, and much had happened since then. Little was known of the\ngirl's history in the town and that little was vague. Nothing more had\nbeen learnt during the last four years, even after many persons had become\ninterested in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna\nhad meanwhile developed. There were rumors that she had been at seventeen\nbetrayed by some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards\nabandoned by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married, while\nGrushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was said, however,\nthat though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man,\nSamsonov, she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical\nclass, that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.\n\nAnd now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little orphan\nhad become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of bold and\ndetermined character, proud and insolent. She had a good head for\nbusiness, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foul\nhad succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune. There was only\none point on which all were agreed. Grushenka was not easily to be\napproached and except her aged protector there had not been one man who\ncould boast of her favors during those four years. It was a positive fact,\nfor there had been a good many, especially during the last two years, who\nhad attempted to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been in\nvain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and\neven comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met\nfrom the strong-willed young person. It was known, too, that the young\nperson had, especially of late, been given to what is called\n\"speculation,\" and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction,\nso that many people began to say that she was no better than a Jew. It was\nnot that she lent money on interest, but it was known, for instance, that\nshe had for some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actually\ninvested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their\nnominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value.\n\nThe old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and\nmerciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the last year\nduring which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs, he had\nfallen greatly under the influence of his protegee, whom he had at first\nkept strictly and in humble surroundings, \"on Lenten fare,\" as the wits\nsaid at the time. But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself,\nwhile she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity. The old\nman, now long since dead, had had a large business in his day and was also\na noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka's hold\nupon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it had been so\nespecially for the last two years), he did not settle any considerable\nfortune on her and would not have been moved to do so, if she had\nthreatened to leave him. But he had presented her with a small sum, and\neven that was a surprise to every one when it became known.\n\n\"You are a wench with brains,\" he said to her, when he gave her eight\nthousand roubles, \"and you must look after yourself, but let me tell you\nthat except your yearly allowance as before, you'll get nothing more from\nme to the day of my death, and I'll leave you nothing in my will either.\"\n\nAnd he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons, whom, with\ntheir wives and children, he had treated all his life as servants.\nGrushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known\nafterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital\nand put business in her way.\n\nWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a\npiece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love\nwith her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is\nremarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was\nabsolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have\nbeen the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when\nDmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off\nlaughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest\npiece of advice.\n\n\"If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd better choose\nthe old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and\nsettle some fortune on you beforehand. But don't keep on with the captain,\nyou'll get no good out of that.\"\n\nThese were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his\ndeath was not far off and who actually died five months later.\n\nI will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the\ngrotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the\nobject of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really\nunderlay her attitude to both of them. Even Grushenka's two servants\n(after the catastrophe of which we will speak later) testified in court\nthat she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because \"he\nthreatened to murder her.\" These servants were an old cook, invalidish and\nalmost deaf, who came from Grushenka's old home, and her granddaughter, a\nsmart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenka\nlived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious.\nHer lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in\nthe fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.\n\nIt was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms, yet they\nwere not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her drawing-room on the\nbig, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered with\nshabby and ragged leather. Under her head she had two white down pillows\ntaken from her bed. She was lying stretched out motionless on her back\nwith her hands behind her head. She was dressed as though expecting some\none, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, which\nwas very becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with\na massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She lay as\nthough impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips and eyes\nhot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her right\nfoot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement.\nFrom the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry out\nin a frightened voice, \"Who's there?\" But the maid met the visitors and at\nonce called back to her mistress.\n\n\"It's not he, it's nothing, only other visitors.\"\n\n\"What can be the matter?\" muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into the\ndrawing-room.\n\nGrushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A thick coil\nof her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on her\nright shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put it back till she\nhad gazed at her visitors and recognized them.\n\n\"Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?\nWho is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!\" she exclaimed,\nrecognizing Alyosha.\n\n\"Do send for candles!\" said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air of a most\nintimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.\n\n\"Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle.... Well,\nyou have chosen a moment to bring him!\" she exclaimed again, nodding\ntowards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began quickly\nfastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed displeased.\n\n\"Haven't I managed to please you?\" asked Rakitin, instantly almost\noffended.\n\n\"You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is.\" Grushenka turned with a\nsmile to Alyosha. \"Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot\nthink how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor. But you frightened\nme, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I deceived him\njust now, I made him promise to believe me and I told him a lie. I told\nhim that I was going to spend the evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch,\nand should be there till late counting up his money. I always spend one\nwhole evening a week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves in\nand he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in\nthe book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there,\nbut I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some news.\nHow was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open it\nand look about whether the captain is to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and\nspying, I am dreadfully frightened.\"\n\n\"There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked out, I keep\nrunning to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling myself.\"\n\n\"Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains--that's\nbetter!\" She drew the heavy curtains herself. \"He'd rush in at once if he\nsaw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha.\"\n\nGrushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed very happy\nabout something.\n\n\"Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?\" inquired Rakitin. \"I should have\nthought you were not timid with him, you'd twist him round your little\nfinger.\"\n\n\"I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't want Mitya at\nall. And he didn't believe, I feel he didn't, that I should stay at Kuzma\nKuzmitch's. He must be in his ambush now, behind Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in\nthe garden, watching for me. And if he's there, he won't come here, so\nmuch the better! But I really have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya\nescorted me there. I told him I should stay there till midnight, and I\nasked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home. He went away\nand I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, I\nwas afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.\"\n\n\"And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've got on!\"\n\n\"How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting a\nmessage. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and you\nwill see no more of me. That's why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.\"\n\n\"And where are you flying to?\"\n\n\"If you know too much, you'll get old too soon.\"\n\n\"Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I've never seen you like this\nbefore. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.\" Rakitin looked\nher up and down.\n\n\"Much you know about balls.\"\n\n\"And do you know much about them?\"\n\n\"I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch's son was\nmarried and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want to be\ntalking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here. Such a\nvisitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and can't believe my eyes.\nGood heavens, can you have come here to see me! To tell you the truth, I\nnever had a thought of seeing you and I didn't think that you would ever\ncome and see me. Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to\nsee you. Sit down on the sofa, here, that's right, my bright young moon. I\nreally can't take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had brought\nhim yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is! Perhaps it's\nbetter he has come now, at such a moment, and not the day before\nyesterday.\"\n\nShe gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him with\npositive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying when she said\nso. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a good-hearted merry\nlaugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in her\nface.... He had hardly met her till the day before, he had formed an\nalarming idea of her, and had been horribly distressed the day before by\nthe spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. He\nwas greatly surprised to find her now altogether different from what he\nhad expected. And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes\ninvoluntarily rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemed\nchanged for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace of\nthat mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness in her\nmovements. Everything was simple and good-natured, her gestures were\nrapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.\n\n\"Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!\" she chattered on again.\n\"And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn't say myself! If you\nask me, I couldn't tell you.\"\n\n\"Come, don't you know why you're glad?\" said Rakitin, grinning. \"You used\nto be always pestering me to bring him, you'd some object, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I had a different object once, but now that's over, this is not the\nmoment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-natured\nnow. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing? You've sat down\nalready? There's no fear of Rakitin's forgetting to look after himself.\nLook, Alyosha, he's sitting there opposite us, so offended that I didn't\nask him to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to take\noffense!\" laughed Grushenka. \"Don't be angry, Rakitin, I'm kind to-day.\nWhy are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?\" She peeped into\nhis eyes with merry mockery\"\n\n\"He's sad. The promotion has not been given,\" boomed Rakitin.\n\n\"What promotion?\"\n\n\"His elder stinks.\"\n\n\"What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something nasty. Be\nquiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this.\" She\nsuddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his knee, like a\nnestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck. \"I'll cheer you up, my\npious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee? You won't be\nangry? If you tell me, I'll get off?\"\n\nAlyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words, \"If you\ntell me, I'll get off,\" but he did not answer. But there was nothing in\nhis heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly from his\ncorner, might have expected or fancied. The great grief in his heart\nswallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused, and, if only he\ncould have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he\nhad now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation.\nYet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and\nthe sorrow that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new and\nstrange sensation in his heart. This woman, this \"dreadful\" woman, had no\nterror for him now, none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at\nany passing thought of woman. On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above\nall women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in\nhim now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the\nintensest and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his former\nterror. That was what instinctively surprised him.\n\n\"You've talked nonsense enough,\" cried Rakitin, \"you'd much better give us\nsome champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!\"\n\n\"Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on the\ntop of everything, if he'd bring you? I'll have some too! Fenya, Fenya,\nbring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so stingy, I'll\nstand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you're a toadstool, but he is a\nfalcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it,\nI'll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.\"\n\n\"But what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, or\nis it a secret?\" Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretend\nnot to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him.\n\n\"Ech, it's not a secret, and you know it, too,\" Grushenka said, in a voice\nsuddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a little\naway from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his\nneck. \"My officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.\"\n\n\"I heard he was coming, but is he so near?\"\n\n\"He is at Mokroe now; he'll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I\ngot a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger every minute.\"\n\n\"You don't say so! Why at Mokroe?\"\n\n\"That's a long story, I've told you enough.\"\n\n\"Mitya'll be up to something now--I say! Does he know or doesn't he?\"\n\n\"He know! Of course he doesn't. If he knew, there would be murder. But I\nam not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet,\nRakitin, don't remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my heart.\nAnd I don't want to think of that at this moment. I can think of Alyosha\nhere, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my\nfoolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, he's smiling, he's smiling! How kindly\nhe looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, I've been thinking all this time\nyou were angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of\nthat young lady. I was a cur, that's the truth.... But it's a good thing\nit happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.\" Grushenka\nsmiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile. \"Mitya told\nme that she screamed out that I 'ought to be flogged.' I did insult her\ndreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a conquest of me, to win\nme over with her chocolate.... No, it's a good thing it did end like\nthat.\" She smiled again. \"But I am still afraid of your being angry.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's really true,\" Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise.\n\"Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.\"\n\n\"He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you've no conscience, that's\nwhat it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that's how it is!\nAlyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?\"\n\n\"Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!\"\n\n\"Well, what of it, I love him!\"\n\n\"And what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?\"\n\n\"That is quite different.\"\n\n\"That's a woman's way of looking at it!\"\n\n\"Don't you make me angry, Rakitin.\" Grushenka caught him up hotly. \"This\nis quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. It's true, Alyosha,\nI had sly designs on you before. For I am a horrid, violent creature. But\nat other times I've looked upon you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I've kept\nthinking 'how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me.' I\nthought that the day before yesterday, as I ran home from the young\nlady's. I have thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya\nknows, I've talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believe\nit, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of\nmyself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that,\nI can't say, I don't remember....\"\n\nFenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of\nchampagne on the table.\n\n\"Here's the champagne!\" cried Rakitin. \"You're excited, Agrafena\nAlexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of champagne,\nyou'll be ready to dance. Eh, they can't even do that properly,\" he added,\nlooking at the bottle. \"The old woman's poured it out in the kitchen and\nthe bottle's been brought in warm and without a cork. Well, let me have\nsome, anyway.\"\n\nHe went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and poured\nhimself out another.\n\n\"One doesn't often stumble upon champagne,\" he said, licking his lips.\n\"Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do! What shall we drink to?\nThe gates of paradise? Take a glass, Grushenka, you drink to the gates of\nparadise, too.\"\n\n\"What gates of paradise?\"\n\nShe took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.\n\n\"No, I'd better not,\" he smiled gently.\n\n\"And you bragged!\" cried Rakitin.\n\n\"Well, if so, I won't either,\" chimed in Grushenka, \"I really don't want\nany. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin. If Alyosha has some, I\nwill.\"\n\n\"What touching sentimentality!\" said Rakitin tauntingly; \"and she's\nsitting on his knee, too! He's got something to grieve over, but what's\nthe matter with you? He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat\nsausage....\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"His elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.\"\n\n\"So Father Zossima is dead,\" cried Grushenka. \"Good God, I did not know!\"\nShe crossed herself devoutly. \"Goodness, what have I been doing, sitting\non his knee like this at such a moment!\" She started up as though in\ndismay, instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa.\n\nAlyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in\nhis face.\n\n\"Rakitin,\" he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; \"don't taunt me\nwith having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel angry with you, so\nyou must be kinder, too, I've lost a treasure such as you have never had,\nand you cannot judge me now. You had much better look at her--do you see\nhow she has pity on me? I came here to find a wicked soul--I felt drawn to\nevil because I was base and evil myself, and I've found a true sister, I\nhave found a treasure--a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....\nAgrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You've raised my soul from\nthe depths.\"\n\nAlyosha's lips were quivering and he caught his breath.\n\n\"She has saved you, it seems,\" laughed Rakitin spitefully. \"And she meant\nto get you in her clutches, do you realize that?\"\n\n\"Stay, Rakitin.\" Grushenka jumped up. \"Hush, both of you. Now I'll tell\nyou all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad\nand not good--that's what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you are\ntelling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, but\nnow you are lying, now it's all different. And don't let me hear anything\nmore from you, Rakitin.\"\n\nAll this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.\n\n\"They are both crazy,\" said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. \"I\nfeel as though I were in a madhouse. They're both getting so feeble\nthey'll begin crying in a minute.\"\n\n\"I shall begin to cry, I shall,\" repeated Grushenka. \"He called me his\nsister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin,\nthough I am bad, I did give away an onion.\"\n\n\"An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.\"\n\nRakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed, though\nhe might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a\nspiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime. But though\nRakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he was\nvery obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others--partly from\nhis youth and inexperience, partly from his intense egoism.\n\n\"You see, Alyosha,\" Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh. \"I was\nboasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but it's not to\nboast I tell you about it. It's only a story, but it's a nice story. I\nused to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who is still\nwith me. It's like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a\nvery wicked woman she was. And she died and did not leave a single good\ndeed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire.\nSo her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could\nremember to tell to God; 'She once pulled up an onion in her garden,' said\nhe, 'and gave it to a beggar woman.' And God answered: 'You take that\nonion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold and be\npulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to\nParadise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.'\nThe angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. 'Come,' said he,\n'catch hold and I'll pull you out.' And he began cautiously pulling her\nout. He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the lake,\nseeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be\npulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking\nthem. 'I'm to be pulled out, not you. It's my onion, not yours.' As soon\nas she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and\nshe is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away. So\nthat's the story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman\nmyself. I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you\nI'll say: 'I've done nothing but give away one onion all my life, that's\nthe only good deed I've done.' So don't praise me, Alyosha, don't think me\ngood, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise\nme. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was so anxious to\nget hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he would\nbring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!\"\n\nShe went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out a\npurse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.\n\n\"What nonsense! What nonsense!\" cried Rakitin, disconcerted.\n\n\"Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there's no fear of your refusing it, you\nasked for it yourself.\" And she threw the note to him.\n\n\"Likely I should refuse it,\" boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, but\ncarrying off his confusion with a swagger. \"That will come in very handy;\nfools are made for wise men's profit.\"\n\n\"And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not for\nyour ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You don't like us, so\nhold your tongue.\"\n\n\"What should I like you for?\" Rakitin snarled, not concealing his ill-\nhumor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket and he felt\nashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving his payment\nlater, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and now, feeling ashamed, he lost\nhis temper. Till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradict\nGrushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing, since he had something to\nget out of her. But now he, too, was angry:\n\n\"One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done for\nme?\"\n\n\"You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.\"\n\n\"How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a fuss\nabout it?\"\n\nGrushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with heat and\nthere were hysterical notes in her voice.\n\n\"Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don't dare to speak to me\nlike that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and be\nquiet, as though you were my footman! And now, Alyosha, I'll tell you the\nwhole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talking to\nRakitin, but to you. I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth;\nI quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.\nAnd why did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,\nyou turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes. And I've\nlooked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking every one\nabout you. Your face haunted my heart. 'He despises me,' I thought; 'he\nwon't even look at me.' And I felt it so much at last that I wondered at\nmyself for being so frightened of a boy. I'll get him in my clutches and\nlaugh at him. I was full of spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody\nhere dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil\npurpose. Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was\nbound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has been no\none else. But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him in my clutches and\nlaugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me your\nsister! And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for a\nmessage from him. And do you know what that man has been to me? Five years\nago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one\nmight have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used to\nsit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: 'Where is he\nnow, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with another woman, most\nlikely. If only I could see him, if I could meet him again, I'd pay him\nout, I'd pay him out!' At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in\nthe dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose\nand gloat over my anger. 'I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!' That's what\nI used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should\nreally do nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhaps\nhad utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into\nhelpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I would\nget up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces.\nAnd then what do you think? I began saving money, I became hard-hearted,\ngrew stout--grew wiser, would you say? No, no one in the whole world sees\nit, no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did\nfive years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all\nnight, thinking, 'I'll pay him out, I'll pay him out!' Do you hear? Well\nthen, now you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me--he was\ncoming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath away;\nthen I suddenly thought: 'If he comes and whistles to call me, I shall\ncreep back to him like a beaten dog.' I couldn't believe myself. Am I so\nabject? Shall I run to him or not? And I've been in such a rage with\nmyself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago. Do you\nsee now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shown\nyou the whole truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that\nother. Hush, Rakitin, it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to\nyou. Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my\nwhole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,\nAlyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened\nthe day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I am\ngoing through now, and no one ever can know.... For perhaps I shall take a\nknife with me to-day, I can't make up my mind ...\"\n\nAnd at this \"tragic\" phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face in her\nhands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little child.\n\nAlyosha got up and went to Rakitin.\n\n\"Misha,\" he said, \"don't be angry. She wounded you, but don't be angry.\nYou heard what she said just now? You mustn't ask too much of human\nendurance, one must be merciful.\"\n\nAlyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He felt\nobliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there,\nhe would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him ironically and\nAlyosha stopped short.\n\n\"You were so primed up with your elder's teaching last night that now you\nhave to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!\" said Rakitin, with a smile\nof hatred.\n\n\"Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead--he was better\nthan any one in the world!\" cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. \"I\ndidn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am I\nbeside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, 'What does it\nmatter?' in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soon\nas any one says a word from the heart to her--it makes her forget\neverything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged her\nhas come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, and\nhastens joyfully to meet him and she won't take a knife with her. She\nwon't! No, I am not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I\nam not like that. It's a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....\nHave you heard her speak before of what she has just told us? No, you\nhaven't; if you had, you'd have understood her long ago ... and the person\ninsulted the day before yesterday must forgive her, too! She will, when\nshe knows ... and she shall know.... This soul is not yet at peace with\nitself, one must be tender with it ... there may be a treasure in that\nsoul....\"\n\nAlyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his ill-humor\nRakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never expected such a\ntirade from the gentle Alyosha.\n\n\"She's found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love with her?\nAgrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with you, you've made a\nconquest!\" he cried, with a coarse laugh.\n\nGrushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with a\ntender smile shining on her tear-stained face.\n\n\"Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not a person\nfor you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,\" she turned to Rakitin, \"I meant\nto beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now I don't want to.\nAlyosha, come to me, sit down here.\" She beckoned to him with a happy\nsmile. \"That's right, sit here. Tell me,\" she shook him by the hand and\npeeped into his face, smiling, \"tell me, do I love that man or not? the\nman who wronged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here in\nthe dark, asking my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, the\ntime has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?\"\n\n\"But you have forgiven him already,\" said Alyosha, smiling.\n\n\"Yes, I really have forgiven him,\" Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. \"What\nan abject heart! To my abject heart!\" She snatched up a glass from the\ntable, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it on the\nfloor. The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came into her\nsmile.\n\n\"Perhaps I haven't forgiven him, though,\" she said, with a sort of menace\nin her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though she were\ntalking to herself. \"Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive. I\nshall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, I've grown to love my\ntears in these five years.... Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him\n...\"\n\n\"Well, I shouldn't care to be in his shoes,\" hissed Rakitin.\n\n\"Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his shoes. You shall\nblack my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for. You'll never\nget a woman like me ... and he won't either, perhaps ...\"\n\n\"Won't he? Then why are you dressed up like that?\" said Rakitin, with a\nvenomous sneer.\n\n\"Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all that is in\nmy heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear it off at once,\nthis minute,\" she cried in a resonant voice. \"You don't know what that\nfinery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and say: 'Have you ever\nseen me look like this before?' He left me a thin, consumptive cry-baby of\nseventeen. I'll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up. 'Do you see\nwhat I am like now?' I'll say to him; 'well, and that's enough for you, my\ndear sir, there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip!' That may be what\nthe finery is for, Rakitin.\" Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.\n\"I'm violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll destroy\nmy beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn beggar. If\nI choose, I won't go anywhere now to see any one. If I choose, I'll send\nKuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow, and all his money and I'll\ngo out charing for the rest of my life. You think I wouldn't do it,\nRakitin, that I would not dare to do it? I would, I would, I could do it\ndirectly, only don't exasperate me ... and I'll send him about his\nbusiness, I'll snap my fingers in his face, he shall never see me again!\"\n\nShe uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down again,\nhid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs.\n\nRakitin got up.\n\n\"It's time we were off,\" he said, \"it's late, we shall be shut out of the\nmonastery.\"\n\nGrushenka leapt up from her place.\n\n\"Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha!\" she cried, in mournful surprise.\n\"What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling, tortured me, and\nnow you'll leave me to face this night alone!\"\n\n\"He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to, let him!\nI'll go alone,\" Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.\n\n\"Hush, evil tongue!\" Grushenka cried angrily at him; \"you never said such\nwords to me as he has come to say.\"\n\n\"What has he said to you so special?\" asked Rakitin irritably.\n\n\"I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he said to me, it went\nstraight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the first, the only\none who has pitied me, that's what it is. Why did you not come before, you\nangel?\" She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy.\n\"I've been waiting all my life for some one like you, I knew that some one\nlike you would come and forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, some\none would really love me, not only with a shameful love!\"\n\n\"What have I done to you?\" answered Alyosha, bending over her with a\ntender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; \"I only gave you an\nonion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!\"\n\nHe was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment there was a\nsudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall. Grushenka jumped\nup, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily into the room, crying out:\n\n\"Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,\" she cried,\nbreathless and joyful. \"A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey the\ndriver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses.... A\nletter, here's the letter, mistress.\"\n\nA letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while she\ntalked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the\ncandle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.\n\n\"He has sent for me,\" she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan\nsmile; \"he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!\"\n\nBut only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the\nblood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.\n\n\"I will go,\" she cried; \"five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha,\nmy fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don't let me see you\nagain! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don't you remember evil\nagainst me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as\nthough I were drunk!\"\n\nShe suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.\n\n\"Well, she has no thoughts for us now!\" grumbled Rakitin. \"Let's go, or we\nmay hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and\ncries.\"\n\nAlyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a covered\ncart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and\nfro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate.\nBut when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka's\nbedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after\nAlyosha:\n\n\"Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to\nremember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him,\ntoo, in my words: 'Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you,\nnoble heart.' And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only\none short hour she loved him--so let him remember that hour all his\nlife--say, 'Grushenka tells you to!' \"\n\nShe ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam.\n\n\"H'm, h'm!\" growled Rakitin, laughing, \"she murders your brother Mitya and\nthen tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!\"\n\nAlyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast beside\nRakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought and moved\nmechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touched\non an open wound. He had expected something quite different by bringing\nGrushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he had\nhoped for had happened.\n\n\"He is a Pole, that officer of hers,\" he began again, restraining himself;\n\"and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the customs in\nSiberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of a\nPole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He's heard now that Grushenka's\nsaved a little money, so he's turned up again--that's the explanation of\nthe mystery.\"\n\nAgain Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself.\n\n\"Well, so you've saved the sinner?\" he laughed spitefully. \"Have you\nturned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh?\nSo you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to\npass!\"\n\n\"Hush, Rakitin,\" Alyosha answered with an aching heart.\n\n\"So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold my friend,\nyou think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it,\" cried Alyosha, \"you\nremind me of it yourself....\"\n\nBut this was the last straw for Rakitin.\n\n\"Damnation take you all and each of you!\" he cried suddenly, \"why the\ndevil did I take you up? I don't want to know you from this time forward.\nGo alone, there's your road!\"\n\nAnd he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the\ndark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to the\nmonastery.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Cana Of Galilee\n\n\nIt was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returned\nto the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a special entrance. It had\nstruck nine o'clock--the hour of rest and repose after a day of such\nagitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into the\nelder's cell where his coffin was now standing. There was no one in the\ncell but Father Paissy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin,\nand the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's\nconversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the\ndeep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father\nPaissy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.\nAlyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his knees\nand began to pray.\n\nHis soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation\nstood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow,\ncontinual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange to\nsay, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw that coffin before him,\nthe hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping and poignant\ngrief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came\nin, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy\nwas glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell was\nopen, the air was fresh and cool. \"So the smell must have become stronger,\nif they opened the window,\" thought Alyosha. But even this thought of the\nsmell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a\nfew hours before, no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He began\nquietly praying, but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically.\nFragments of thought floated through his soul, flashed like stars and went\nout again at once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning\nin his soul a sense of the wholeness of things--something steadfast and\ncomforting--and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying\nardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....\n\nBut when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, and\nsank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it.\nHe began listening to what Father Paissy was reading, but worn out with\nexhaustion he gradually began to doze.\n\n\"_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_\" read Father\nPaissy. \"_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called,\nand his disciples, to the marriage._\"\n\n\"Marriage? What's that?... A marriage!\" floated whirling through Alyosha's\nmind. \"There is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to the feast....\nNo, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Well\n... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases\ncomfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to\nbear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broods\nover his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the high\nroad ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal, and the sun\nis at the end of it.... Ah!... What's being read?\"...\n\n\"_And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have\nno wine_\" ... Alyosha heard.\n\n\"Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it, I love that\npassage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that miracle! Ah,\nthat sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but their joy Christ visited,\nHe worked His first miracle to help men's gladness.... 'He who loves men\nloves their gladness, too' ... He was always repeating that, it was one of\nhis leading ideas.... 'There's no living without joy,' Mitya says.... Yes,\nMitya.... 'Everything that is true and good is always full of\nforgiveness,' he used to say that, too\" ...\n\n\"_Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mine\nhour is not yet come._\n\n\"_His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do\nit_\" ...\n\n\"Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people.... Of\ncourse they were poor, since they hadn't wine enough even at a wedding....\nThe historians write that, in those days, the people living about the Lake\nof Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined ... and\nanother great heart, that other great being, His Mother, knew that He had\ncome not only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that His\nheart was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure and\nunlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor wedding. 'Mine\nhour is not yet come,' He said, with a soft smile (He must have smiled\ngently to her). And, indeed, was it to make wine abundant at poor weddings\nHe had come down to earth? And yet He went and did as she asked Him....\nAh, he is reading again\"....\n\n\"_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled\nthem up to the brim._\n\n\"_And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the\nfeast. And they bare it._\n\n\"_When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and\nknew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the\ngovernor of the feast called the bridegroom,_\n\n\"_And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;\nand when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast kept the\ngood wine until now._\"\n\n\"But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah, yes\n... It's the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of course. Here are the\nguests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ...\nWhere is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who? Again the\nwalls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great table?\nWhat!... He here, too? But he's in the coffin ... but he's here, too. He\nhas stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!\"...\n\nYes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man, with tiny\nwrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There was no coffin now,\nand he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with them,\nwhen the visitors had gathered about him. His face was uncovered, his eyes\nwere shining. How was this, then? He, too, had been called to the feast.\nHe, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,\" he heard a soft voice\nsaying over him. \"Why have you hidden yourself here, out of sight? You\ncome and join us too.\"\n\nIt was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he, since he\ncalled him!\n\nThe elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.\n\n\"We are rejoicing,\" the little, thin old man went on. \"We are drinking the\nnew wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many guests?\nHere are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of the feast,\nhe is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me? I gave an onion to a\nbeggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only an onion\neach--only one little onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentle\none, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman an\nonion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!... Do you\nsee our Sun, do you see Him?\"\n\n\"I am afraid ... I dare not look,\" whispered Alyosha.\n\n\"Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His sublimity,\nbut infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto us from love and\nrejoices with us. He is changing the water into wine that the gladness of\nthe guests may not be cut short. He is expecting new guests, He is calling\nnew ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There they are bringing new\nwine. Do you see they are bringing the vessels....\"\n\nSomething glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it ached,\ntears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out his hands,\nuttered a cry and waked up.\n\nAgain the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct reading\nof the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. It was strange,\nhe had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was on his feet, and\nsuddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid steps he went\nright up to the coffin. His shoulder brushed against Father Paissy without\nhis noticing it. Father Paissy raised his eyes for an instant from his\nbook, but looked away again at once, seeing that something strange was\nhappening to the boy. Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at\nthe covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on\nhis breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. He\nhad only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing in\nhis ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly he\nturned sharply and went out of the cell.\n\nHe did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his soul,\noverflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. The vault\nof heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless\nabove him. The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to the\nhorizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth. The white\ntowers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire\nsky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were\nslumbering till morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into the\nsilence of the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of\nthe stars....\n\nAlyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He did\nnot know why he embraced it. He could not have told why he longed so\nirresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he kissed it weeping, sobbing\nand watering it with his tears, and vowed passionately to love it, to love\nit for ever and ever. \"Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love\nthose tears,\" echoed in his soul.\n\nWhat was he weeping over?\n\nOh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which were\nshining to him from the abyss of space, and \"he was not ashamed of that\necstasy.\" There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of\nGod, linking his soul to them, and it was trembling all over \"in contact\nwith other worlds.\" He longed to forgive every one and for everything, and\nto beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all men, for all and for\neverything. \"And others are praying for me too,\" echoed again in his soul.\nBut with every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that\nsomething firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his\nsoul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his\nmind--and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had fallen on\nthe earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion, and he knew and\nfelt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy. And never, never, all\nhis life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.\n\n\"Some one visited my soul in that hour,\" he used to say afterwards, with\nimplicit faith in his words.\n\nWithin three days he left the monastery in accordance with the words of\nhis elder, who had bidden him \"sojourn in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\nBook VIII. Mitya\n\n\n\nChapter I. Kuzma Samsonov\n\n\nBut Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her\nlast greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knew\nnothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a condition\nof feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been in\nsuch an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill\nwith brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able\nto find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him\nat the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders,\nconcealed his movements.\n\nHe had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,\n\"struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,\" as he expressed\nit himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash out of the\ntown on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose sight of\nGrushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in detail, and\nconfirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only note\nthe most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediately\npreceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him.\n\nThough Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely and\nsincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. The\nworst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To prevail\nupon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would yield to\nnothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from him\naltogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that\nshe, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of\nextraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something,\nand unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he\ndivined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him\nand his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing\nGrushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay\nbetween him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\nHere, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded\nthat Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka\nlawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary\nhoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached\nthis conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That\nwas how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka's\nuneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most\nto her advantage.\n\nStrange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the\napproaching return of the \"officer,\" that is, of the man who had been such\na fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and whose arrival she was expecting\nwith such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been\nvery silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had\nreceived a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own\nlips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite\nGrushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached\nhardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.\nPerhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his\nown father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more\nterrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did not believe in a suitor\nwho suddenly turned up again after five years' disappearance, still less\nin his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the \"officer's\" first letter which had\nbeen shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival's visit was very\nvaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of\nsentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the\nlast lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more\ndefinitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered\nafterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from\nSiberia on Grushenka's face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed\nlater between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely\nforgotten the officer's existence.\n\nHe felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take,\nhis final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be\ndecided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every\nmoment Grushenka's decision, always believing that it would come suddenly,\non the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: \"Take\nme, I'm yours for ever,\" and it would all be over. He would seize her and\nbear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her\naway at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,\nif not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with her\nincognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or\nanywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!\n\nOf this different, reformed and \"virtuous\" life (\"it must, it must be\nvirtuous\") he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that\nreformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his\nown free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in such\ncases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not for\nthese people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he\ncould fly away from this accursed place--he would be altogether\nregenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and\nwhat he was yearning for.\n\nBut all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solution\nof the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful\nending. Suddenly she might say to him: \"Go away. I have just come to terms\nwith Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don't want you\"--and\nthen ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to\nthe last hour he didn't know. That must be said to his credit. He had no\ndefinite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and\nspying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution\nof his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending\na quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and\ninsoluble difficulty presented itself.\n\nIf she were to say to him: \"I'm yours; take me away,\" how could he take\nher away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at this\ntime that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had\ngone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had\nmoney, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced\nextraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life\nwith her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive\nof taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense\nrepulsion. I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine\nmyself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may\nhave arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his\nconscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly\nappropriated. \"I've been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a\nscoundrel again to the other directly,\" was his feeling then, as he\nexplained after: \"and when Grushenka knows, she won't care for such a\nscoundrel.\"\n\nWhere then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money?\nWithout it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, \"and only because\nI hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of it!\"\n\nTo anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew,\nperhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as\nit will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however\nobscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have the\nright_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna's three\nthousand--if not, \"I'm a common pickpocket, I'm a scoundrel, and I don't\nwant to begin a new life as a scoundrel,\" Mitya decided. And so he made up\nhis mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three\nthousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so to\nsay, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last\ninterview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the evening\nwhen Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing\nAlyosha's account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told\nhim to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After\nparting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it\nwould be better \"to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to\nKatya. I'd rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I'd rather\ngo to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived\nher and stole her money, and used her money to run away with Grushenka and\nbegin a new life! That I can't do!\" So Mitya decided, grinding his teeth,\nand he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. But\nmeanwhile he went on struggling....\n\nStrange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left for\nhim but despair--for what chance had he, with nothing in the world, to\nraise such a sum?--yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would\nget that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of\nitself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with\npeople who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except\nto squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of\ntheir own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most\nfantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had\nparted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a tangle\nof confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wild\nenterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the most\nimpossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.\n\nHe suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenka's\nprotector, and to propose a \"scheme\" to him, and by means of it to obtain\nfrom him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the commercial value of\nhis scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain how\nSamsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from\nany but the commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by\nsight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him.\nBut for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that\nthe old reprobate, who was lying at death's door, would perhaps not at all\nobject now to Grushenka's securing a respectable position, and marrying a\nman \"to be depended upon.\" And he believed not only that he would not\nobject, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that\nhe would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray\nword of Grushenka's, he had gathered further that the old man would\nperhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.\n\nPossibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on\nsuch assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the\nhands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of\ndelicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka's past as\nsomething completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and\nresolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told\nhim she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a\nnew Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive\none another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov,\nDmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in\nthat remote past of Grushenka's, though she had never loved him, and who\nwas now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say,\nnon-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for\nit was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck,\nwhose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now\nsimply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.\n\nIn any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all this, for in\nspite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It was an\ninstance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, being\non the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerely\nrepent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had no more\ndevoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.\n\nAfter his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly slept\nall night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he was at the house of\nSamsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very large and\ngloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses. In the lower\nstory lived Samsonov's two married sons with their families, his old\nsister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his clerks,\none of whom also had a large family. Both the lodge and the lower story\nwere overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and\nwould not even let the daughter live there with him, though she waited\nupon him, and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours,\nand at any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.\n\nThis upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show,\nfurnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rows\nof clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers under\nshades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these rooms were entirely\nempty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remote\nbedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her\nhead, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to\nhis swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only\nrarely lifted from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting\nhim led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and taciturn\neven with this old woman.\n\nWhen he was informed of the arrival of the \"captain,\" he at once refused\nto see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again. Samsonov\nquestioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he was drunk?\nWas he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that he was sober,\nbut wouldn't go away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya,\nwho had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him,\nwrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: \"On most important business\nclosely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,\" and sent it up to the old man.\n\nAfter thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the\ndrawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his\nyounger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a man over\nsix foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven and\ndressed in the European style, though his father still wore a kaftan and a\nbeard, came at once without a comment. All the family trembled before the\nfather. The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of\nthe \"captain\" (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order to\nhave a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son and the\nservant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It may be assumed\nthat he felt considerable curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya was\nawaiting him was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on\nthe heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and\nthree immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.\n\nMitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fate\nwith nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the opposite door,\nseventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long, military\nstride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat,\nbuttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his hands, just as he\nhad been three days before at the elder's, at the family meeting with his\nfather and brothers. The old man waited for him, standing dignified and\nunbending, and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and\nthrough as he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's\nimmensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick, hung\ndown now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in dignified silence,\nmotioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his son's arm he\nbegan lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so\nthat Mitya, seeing his painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and\nsensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the\ndignified person he had ventured to disturb.\n\n\"What is it you want of me, sir?\" said the old man, deliberately,\ndistinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.\n\nMitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at once\nspeaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive\nfrenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of\nruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old Samsonov\nprobably grasped all this in an instant, though his face remained cold and\nimmovable as a statue's.\n\n\"Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than once\nof my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed me\nof my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossiping\nabout it ... for here every one's gossiping of what they shouldn't ... and\nbesides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your\npardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady\nfor whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...\"\n\nSo Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will not\nreproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of\nit. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mitya\npurposely used these words instead of \"intentionally\") consulted a lawyer\nin the chief town of the province, \"a distinguished lawyer, Kuzma\nKuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. You have perhaps heard of him? A\nman of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ...\nspoke of you in the highest terms ...\" Mitya broke down again. But these\nbreaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled\non and on.\n\nThis Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting the\ndocuments he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to\nthese documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste),\nreported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village\nof Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, from\nhis mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... \"because\nevery door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.\" In\nfact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand\nroubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least,\ntwenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact,\n\"thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get\nseventeen from that heartless man!\" So he, Mitya, had thrown the business\nup, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here was\nstruck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift again\nand again took a flying leap forward), \"so will not you, excellent and\nhonored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against that\nunnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?... You\nsee, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear\nthat. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of\nthree.\" Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.\n\n\"I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is ... in\nfact, I'm ready to do anything.... I'll hand over all the deeds ...\nwhatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at\nonce ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that very\nmorning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn't a\ncapitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ...\nwould save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action....\nFor I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you\nknow well, and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it\nhad not been as a father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this\nbusiness, for it's fate--that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy,\nKuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped out long ago, it's a tug-\nof-war between two. I'm expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I'm not a\nliterary man. You see, I'm on the one side, and that monster on the other.\nSo you must choose. It's either I or the monster. It all lies in your\nhands--the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse me, I'm\nmaking a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes\nthat you understand ... and if you don't understand, I'm done for ... so\nyou see!\"\n\nMitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, \"so you see!\" and jumping up\nfrom his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the last\nphrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen\nflat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.\n\n\"How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it's\nnothing but nonsense.\" The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.\nAll the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching\nhim with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment in\nsuspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and\nchilling tone:\n\n\"Excuse me, we don't undertake such business.\"\n\nMitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.\n\n\"What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?\" he muttered, with a pale smile. \"I\nsuppose it's all up with me--what do you think?\"\n\n\"Excuse me....\"\n\nMitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed a\nmovement in the old man's face. He started.\n\n\"You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line,\" said the old man\nslowly. \"There's the court, and the lawyers--it's a perfect misery. But if\nyou like, there is a man here you might apply to.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,\" faltered\nMitya.\n\n\"He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a peasant, he\ndoes business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been haggling with\nFyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya. They\ncan't agree on the price, maybe you've heard? Now he's come back again and\nis staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the\nVolovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse,\nasking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if\nyou were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the\noffer you've made me, he might possibly--\"\n\n\"A brilliant idea!\" Mitya interrupted ecstatically. \"He's the very man, it\nwould just suit him. He's haggling with him for it, being asked too much,\nand here he would have all the documents entitling him to the property\nitself. Ha ha ha!\"\n\nAnd Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling\nSamsonov.\n\n\"How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?\" cried Mitya effusively.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Samsonov, inclining his head.\n\n\"But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment\nbrought me to you.... So now to this priest!\"\n\n\"No need of thanks.\"\n\n\"I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your strength. I\nshall never forget it. It's a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a R-r-\nrussian!\"\n\n\"To be sure!\"\n\nMitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in the\nold man's eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself for\nhis mistrustfulness.\n\n\"It's because he's tired,\" he thought.\n\n\"For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it's for\nher,\" he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed, turned\nsharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door without\nlooking back. He was trembling with delight.\n\n\"Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,\" was\nthe thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a most\nworthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then ...\nthen success was assured. He would fly off immediately. \"I will be back\nbefore night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done. Could the\nold man have been laughing at me?\" exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards\nhis lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was\npractical \"from such a business man\" with an understanding of the\nbusiness, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or--the\nold man was laughing at him.\n\nAlas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, when\nthe catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing,\nthat he had made a fool of the \"captain.\" He was a cold, spiteful and\nsarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was the\n\"captain's\" excited face, or the foolish conviction of the \"rake and\nspendthrift,\" that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull\nstory as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this\n\"scapegrace\" had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which\nworked on the old man, I can't tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood\nbefore him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and frantically\nexclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him\nwith intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When\nMitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his son and\nbade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and never\nadmitted even into the yard, or else he'd--\n\nHe did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him enraged,\ntrembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shaking\nwith anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the doctor.\n\n\n\nChapter II. Lyagavy\n\n\nSo he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. He\nhad forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many years\nof prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had long\nceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who\nhad a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him six roubles for it.\n\n\"And I didn't expect that,\" cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in a\nstate of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home he\nborrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him so much\nthat they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had. Mitya\nin his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided\nthat day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he had\nput before Samsonov, the latter's decision, his own hopes for the future,\nand so on. These people had been told many of their lodger's secrets\nbefore, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud,\nand almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya\nsent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This was how\nthe fact came to be remembered and established that \"at midday, on the day\nbefore the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he had sold his watch\nto get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord, all in the\npresence of witnesses.\"\n\nI note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.\n\nThough he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at last\nsolve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station, he\ntrembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his absence.\nWhat if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? This was\nwhy he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with his\nlandlady not to let out where he had gone, if any one came to inquire for\nhim.\n\n\"I must, I must get back to-night,\" he repeated, as he was jolted along in\nthe cart, \"and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ...\nto draw up the deed.\" So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas!\nhis dreams were not fated to be carried out.\n\nTo begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station which\nturned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he did not\nfind the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a neighboring\nvillage. While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses,\nwas looking for him, it was almost dark.\n\nThe priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at once\nthat though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now at\nSuhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the forester's cottage,\nas he was buying timber there too. At Mitya's urgent request that he would\ntake him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing \"save him, so to speak,\" the\npriest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his\ncuriosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on\nfoot, as it would not be \"much over\" a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed,\nand marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost\nran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.\n\nMitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously and\nexcitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way. The\npriest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off Mitya's\nquestions with: \"I don't know. Ah, I can't say. How can I tell?\" and so\non. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over his\ninheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he was in some way\ndependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why\nhe called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained\nto Mitya that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never\ncalled so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he\nmust be sure to call him Gorstkin, \"or you'll do nothing with him; he\nwon't even listen to you,\" said the priest in conclusion.\n\nMitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was\nwhat Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped the\nsubject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubt\nwhether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy,\nthere was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into\nridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried,\nstriding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize\nthat they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three.\nThis annoyed him, but he controlled himself.\n\nThey went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and\nGorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of the\npassage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut was\nextremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had gone out,\na tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and\nsome half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched\nat full length on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a\npillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.\n\n\"Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I've come in\nsuch haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day,\" he said in great\nagitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving\ntheir opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; he\ntried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.\n\n\"He's drunk,\" Mitya decided. \"Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I to\ndo?\" And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by the\nlegs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench.\nYet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting the\ndrunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.\n\n\"No, you'd better wait a little,\" the priest pronounced at last, \"for he's\nobviously not in a fit state.\"\n\n\"He's been drinking the whole day,\" the forester chimed in.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Mitya. \"If only you knew how important it is to me\nand how desperate I am!\"\n\n\"No, you'd better wait till morning,\" the priest repeated.\n\n\"Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!\"\n\nAnd in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man\nagain, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his\nefforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.\n\n\"What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,\" said Mitya, in\ncomplete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The priest\nseized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even if he\nsucceeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and incapable of\nconversation. \"And your business is important,\" he said, \"so you'd\ncertainly better put it off till morning.\" With a gesture of despair Mitya\nagreed.\n\n\"Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. As\nsoon as he wakes I'll begin. I'll pay you for the light,\" he said to the\nforester, \"for the night's lodging, too; you'll remember Dmitri Karamazov.\nOnly, Father, I don't know what we're to do with you. Where will you\nsleep?\"\n\n\"No, I'm going home. I'll take his horse and get home,\" he said,\nindicating the forester. \"And now I'll say good-by. I wish you all\nsuccess.\"\n\nSo it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester's horse, delighted\nto escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering whether he ought\nnot next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curious\nincident, \"or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw\nhis favor.\"\n\nThe forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word,\nand Mitya sat on the bench to \"catch the favorable moment,\" as he\nexpressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist. A\nprofound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach no\nconclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became\ninsufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured the\ngarden, the path behind the garden, the door of his father's house\nmysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench.\n\n\"It's a tragedy!\" he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up to\nthe sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle-aged\npeasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish\nbeard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocket\nof which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his face with\nintense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly\nirritated him.\n\nWhat was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of such\nimportance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn out, should\nwith business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole\nfate depended, while he snored as though there were nothing the matter, as\nthough he'd dropped from another planet.\n\n\"Oh, the irony of fate!\" cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he fell\nagain to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of ferocity,\npulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five minutes of vain\nexertions, he returned to his bench in helpless despair, and sat down.\n\n\"Stupid! Stupid!\" cried Mitya. \"And how dishonorable it all is!\" something\nmade him add. His head began to ache horribly. \"Should he fling it up and\ngo away altogether?\" he wondered. \"No, wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay\non purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, I've no means of going. How\nam I to get away from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!\"\n\nBut his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously\ndozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours\nor more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could\nhave screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his\nhead ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and\nunderstand what had happened to him.\n\nAt last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the\nstove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still\nlay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out,\nand ran staggering across the passage into the forester's room. The\nforester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of\nfumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange\nunconcern, though he did go to see to it.\n\n\"But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?\" cried Mitya\nfrantically.\n\nThey threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought\na pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then,\nfinding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on\nLyagavy's head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and\nwhen he opened the window said grumpily:\n\n\"It'll be all right, now.\"\n\nHe went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed about\nthe drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravely\nresolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he sat\ndown for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciously\nstretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.\n\nIt was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine o'clock.\nThe sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. The\ncurly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on. He had\nanother samovar and another bottle in front of him. Yesterday's bottle had\nalready been finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya\njumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again,\nhopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened\neyes. The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting\ncomposure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya\nfancied. He rushed up to him.\n\n\"Excuse me, you see ... I ... you've most likely heard from the forester\nhere in the hut. I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old\nKaramazov whose copse you are buying.\"\n\n\"That's a lie!\" said the peasant, calmly and confidently.\n\n\"A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?\"\n\n\"I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,\" said the peasant, speaking\nthickly.\n\n\"You're bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and\ncollect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote to\nSamsonov, and he has sent me to you,\" Mitya gasped breathlessly.\n\n\"You're l-lying!\" Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya's legs went cold.\n\n\"For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet you can\nspeak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!\"\n\n\"You're a painter!\"\n\n\"For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to\nmake you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning\nthe copse!\"\n\nThe peasant stroked his beard importantly.\n\n\"No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You're a\nscoundrel!\"\n\n\"I assure you you're mistaken,\" cried Mitya, wringing his hands in\ndespair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up his\neyes cunningly.\n\n\"No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D'you\nhear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?\"\n\nMitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly \"something seemed to hit him on\nthe head,\" as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in\nhis mind, \"a light was kindled and I grasped it all.\" He stood, stupefied,\nwondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to\nsuch folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for\nalmost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.\n\n\"Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he'll go on drinking now for a\nweek; what's the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here on\npurpose? What if she--? Oh, God, what have I done?\"\n\nThe peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might have\nkilled the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He went\nquietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, and\nwent out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next room; there\nwas no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocket\nand put them on the table for his night's lodging, the candle, and the\ntrouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all\nround. He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut,\nto the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with the\npriest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful feeling for\nanybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode along a narrow forest\npath, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he was going. A child could\nhave knocked him down, so weak was he in body and soul. He got out of the\nforest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest,\nstretched as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"What despair! What death all round!\" he repeated, striding on and on.\n\nHe was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across\ncountry in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and it\nturned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After some\ndiscussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. At\nVolovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, and\nsuddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While the horses were\nbeing harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an\ninstant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three\nglasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He\nflew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and\n\"unalterable\" plan to procure that \"accursed money\" before evening. \"And\nto think, only to think that a man's life should be ruined for the sake of\nthat paltry three thousand!\" he cried, contemptuously. \"I'll settle it to-\nday.\" And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what\nmight have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps have\nbecome quite cheerful again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to\nthe heart every moment, like a sharp knife.\n\nAt last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.\n\n\n\nChapter III. Gold-Mines\n\n\nThis was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with\nsuch horror. She was just then expecting the \"message,\" and was much\nrelieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before.\nShe hoped that \"please God he won't come till I'm gone away,\" and he\nsuddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him off her\nhands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov's,\nwhere she said she absolutely must go \"to settle his accounts,\" and when\nMitya accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making\nhim promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home again. Mitya, too,\nwas delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting at Samsonov's she\ncould not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, \"if only she's not lying,\" he\nadded at once. But he thought she was not lying from what he saw.\n\nHe was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman,\nat once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to\nher, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken, heartbroken,\nconvinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at the first glance\nat her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he revives at once,\nlays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his\njealousy.\n\nAfter leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much\nstill to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart, anyway.\n\n\"Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anything\nhappened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to Fyodor\nPavlovitch; ough!\" floated through his mind.\n\nBefore he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again in\nhis restless heart.\n\nJealousy! \"Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,\" observed Pushkin.\nAnd that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great\npoet. Othello's soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply\nbecause _his ideal was destroyed_. But Othello did not begin hiding,\nspying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up,\npushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the\nidea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible\nto picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous\nman can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet it's not as though\nthe jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of\nlofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet\nhide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the\nlowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.\n\nOthello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness--not incapable\nof forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it--though his soul was as\ninnocent and free from malice as a babe's. It is not so with the really\njealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their\nmind to and overlook, and what they can forgive! The jealous are the\nreadiest of all to forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man can\nforgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violent\nscene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved,\nthe very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be\nconvinced that it has all been \"for the last time,\" and that his rival\nwill vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth,\nor that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that dreaded rival\nwill not get near her. Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour.\nFor, even if the rival did disappear next day, he would invent another one\nand would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a love\nthat had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed\nsuch strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never understand. And\nyet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those\nvery men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and\nspying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though\nthey understand clearly enough with their \"noble hearts\" the shameful\ndepths to which they have voluntarily sunk.\n\nAt the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for an instant\nhe became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his\nevil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, there\nwas an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that it\nwas not only a sensual passion, not only the \"curve of her body,\" of which\nhe had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began\nto suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no\nsting of conscience at it.\n\nAnd so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make\nhaste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small,\ntemporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his\nexpedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a step without money. But\nhe had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace\nof fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then\nbecause he prized them above all his possessions.\n\nIn the \"Metropolis\" tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a\nyoung official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was\npassionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers,\nhang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself on\nthem, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya,\nwithout stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his\npistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to\npersuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent, so the\nyoung man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce him\nto take interest. They parted friends.\n\nMitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by the back way,\nto his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In this way\nthe fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event,\nof which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for\nten roubles a possession he valued, though, three hours later, he was in\npossession of thousands.... But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna\n(the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's) he learned the very disturbing\nfact of Smerdyakov's illness. He heard the story of his fall in the\ncellar, his fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch's anxiety; he heard\nwith interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning for\nMoscow.\n\n\"Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,\" thought Dmitri, but\nhe was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. \"What will happen now? Who'll\nkeep watch for me? Who'll bring me word?\" he thought. He began greedily\nquestioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before.\nThey quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completely\nreassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the\nnight; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He\nwould certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at\nSamsonov's gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here and\nthere, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had to\ncarry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure\nof its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to\nsacrifice an hour to it: \"In an hour I shall know everything, I shall\nsettle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov's. I'll\ninquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be back here again, stay\ntill eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to bring her home.\" This was\nwhat he decided.\n\nHe flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, and\nwent to Madame Hohlakov's. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He had\nresolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he\nfelt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. It\nmay be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at\nfirst, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he\ndid not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how\nto speak.\n\nBut the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had\nseen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not\nendure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to\nKaterina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the\ndesire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the\n\"charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.\"\nMitya's manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had\nonce said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was\nuncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck\nhim: \"If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna\" (and he\nknew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) \"why should she\nrefuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and\nget away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their\nhearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice.\nBesides, she's so rich,\" Mitya argued.\n\nAs for his \"plan\" it was just the same as before; it consisted of the\noffer of his rights to Tchermashnya--but not with a commercial object, as\nit had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the\npossibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand--but simply as a\nsecurity for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted\nwith it, but so it always was with him in all his undertakings, in all his\nsudden decisions. He gave himself up to every new idea with passionate\nenthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he\nfelt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as\na mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke\ndown, nothing else was left him in the world, but to \"rob and murder some\none for the three thousand.\" It was half-past seven when he rang at the\nbell.\n\nAt first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced he\nwas received with extraordinary rapidity. \"As though she were waiting for\nme,\" thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the drawing-room,\nthe lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she was\nexpecting him.\n\n\"I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no reason to suppose\nyou would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I did expect\nyou. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was\nconvinced all the morning that you would come.\"\n\n\"That is certainly wonderful, madam,\" observed Mitya, sitting down limply,\n\"but I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On a matter of\nsupreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and I\nhasten--\"\n\n\"I know you've come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; it's\nnot a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculous\n(have you heard about Father Zossima?). This is a case of mathematics: you\ncouldn't help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna;\nyou couldn't, you couldn't, that's a mathematical certainty.\"\n\n\"The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow me to\nexplain--\"\n\n\"Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now. I've seen\ntoo much of miracles. You've heard that Father Zossima is dead?\"\n\n\"No, madam, it's the first time I've heard of it.\" Mitya was a little\nsurprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.\n\n\"Last night, and only imagine--\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said Mitya, \"I can imagine nothing except that I'm in a desperate\nposition, and that if you don't help me, everything will come to grief,\nand I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but\nI'm in a fever--\"\n\n\"I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, and\nwhatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinking\nover your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying\nit.... Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an experienced\npatient,\" said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, \"and I feel that if you\nare watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my\nruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I\nhave ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you.... I have\ncome, madam--\"\n\n\"Don't explain it. It's of secondary importance. But as for help, you're\nnot the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likely\nheard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, 'had come to\ngrief,' as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I\nrecommended him to take to horse-breeding, and now he's doing well. Have\nyou any idea of horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?\"\n\n\"Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!\" cried Mitya, in\nnervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. \"I simply implore\nyou, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech that\nI may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have\ncome. Besides, I am short of time. I'm in a fearful hurry,\" Mitya cried\nhysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, and\nhoping to cut her short. \"I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of\ndespair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on\nsafe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!\nOnly let me explain--\"\n\n\"You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!\" Madame Hohlakov with a\ngesture demanded silence in her turn, \"and whatever you may tell me, I\nknow it all beforehand; I've told you so already. You ask for a certain\nsum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I\nwill save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.\"\n\nMitya started from his seat again.\n\n\"Madam, will you really be so good!\" he cried, with strong feeling. \"Good\nGod, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a\nbullet.... My eternal gratitude--\"\n\n\"I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!\" cried Madame\nHohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.\n\n\"Infinitely? But I don't need so much. I only need that fatal three\nthousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite\ngratitude, and I propose a plan which--\"\n\n\"Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done.\" Madame Hohlakov cut him\nshort, with the modest triumph of beneficence: \"I have promised to save\nyou, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What do you\nthink of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?\"\n\n\"Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.\"\n\n\"But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again.\nI have been watching you for the last month. I've watched you a hundred\ntimes as you've walked past, saying to myself: That's a man of energy who\nought to be at the gold-mines. I've studied your gait and come to the\nconclusion: that's a man who would find gold.\"\n\n\"From my gait, madam?\" said Mitya, smiling.\n\n\"Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can be told\nfrom the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. I'm all for\nscience and realism now. After all this business with Father Zossima,\nwhich has so upset me, from this very day I'm a realist and I want to\ndevote myself to practical usefulness. I'm cured. 'Enough!' as Turgenev\nsays.\"\n\n\"But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me--\"\n\n\"It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. \"The\nmoney is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million,\nDmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I'll make you a present of the\nidea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become a\nleading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave\nit all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all\nsorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of\nrailways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You'll become famous and indispensable to\nthe Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The\ndepreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;\npeople don't know that side of me--\"\n\n\"Madam, madam!\" Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. \"I shall\nindeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall\nperhaps set off ... to the gold-mines.... I'll come and see you again\nabout it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so\ngenerously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... you\nsee, I haven't a minute, a minute to lose to-day--\"\n\n\"Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!\" Madame Hohlakov interrupted\nemphatically. \"The question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; have\nyou quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.\"\n\n\"I will go, madam, afterwards.... I'll go where you like ... but now--\"\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsome\nbureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer\nafter another, looking for something with desperate haste.\n\n\"The three thousand,\" thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, \"and at\nthe instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that's doing things\nin gentlemanly style! She's a splendid woman, if only she didn't talk so\nmuch!\"\n\n\"Here!\" cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, \"here is\nwhat I was looking for!\"\n\nIt was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the\nskin with a cross.\n\n\"This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" she went on reverently, \"from\nthe relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck myself,\nand with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.\"\n\nAnd she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it. In\nextreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last he got\nit under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.\n\n\"Now you can set off,\" Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down\ntriumphantly in her place again.\n\n\"Madam, I am so touched. I don't know how to thank you, indeed ... for\nsuch kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....\nThat sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity....\nOh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,\" Mitya\nexclaimed impulsively, \"then let me reveal to you ... though, of course,\nyou've known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been\nfalse to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I've behaved\ninhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another woman\n... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything\nalready, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three\nthousand now--\"\n\n\"Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" Madame Hohlakov interrupted in\nthe most decisive tone. \"Leave everything, especially women. Gold-mines\nare your goal, and there's no place for women there. Afterwards, when you\ncome back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the\nhighest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and\nadvanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained\nground, and the new woman will have appeared.\"\n\n\"Madam, that's not the point, not at all....\" Mitya clasped his hands in\nentreaty.\n\n\"Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing\nyou're yearning for, though you don't realize it yourself. I am not at all\nopposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The\ndevelopment of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the\nnear future--that's my ideal. I've a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\npeople don't know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author,\nShtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the\nvocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two\nlines: 'I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.\nPersevere.' And I signed myself, 'A Mother.' I thought of signing myself\n'A contemporary Mother,' and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple\n'Mother'; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And the\nword 'contemporary' might have reminded him of '_The Contemporary_'--a\npainful recollection owing to the censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the\nmatter!\"\n\n\"Madam!\" cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her in\nhelpless entreaty. \"You will make me weep if you delay what you have so\ngenerously--\"\n\n\"Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That's a noble feeling ...\nsuch a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later on\nyou will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on purpose\nto share your joy with me--\"\n\n\"But allow me, too!\" Mitya cried suddenly. \"For the last time I entreat\nyou, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when may\nI come for it?\"\n\n\"What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?\"\n\n\"The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously--\"\n\n\"Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,\" Madame\nHohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.\n\n\"Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in my\nhands--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you\nmisunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It's true I promised\nyou more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, but\nI was referring to the gold-mines.\"\n\n\"But the money? The three thousand?\" Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.\n\n\"Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any. I haven't a penny, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. I'm quarreling with my steward about it, and I've just\nborrowed five hundred roubles from Miuesov, myself. No, no, I've no money.\nAnd, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn't give it to\nyou. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means losing\nfriends. And I wouldn't give it to you particularly. I wouldn't give it\nyou, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is the\ngold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!\"\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fist\ndown on the table.\n\n\"Aie! Aie!\" cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other end\nof the drawing-room.\n\nMitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of the\nhouse, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one possessed,\nand beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had struck himself\ntwo days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he saw him in the dark,\non the road. What those blows upon his breast signified, _on that spot_,\nand what he meant by it--that was, for the time, a secret which was known\nto no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that\nsecret meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he had\ndetermined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay\nhis debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast, from _that\nspot on his breast_, the shame he carried upon it, that weighed on his\nconscience. All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, but\nnow that his last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance,\nburst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs'\nhouse. He walked on, and not knowing what he was doing, wiped away his\ntears with his fist. In this way he reached the square, and suddenly\nbecame aware that he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing\nwail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.\n\n\"Good Lord, you've nearly killed me! Why don't you look where you're\ngoing, scapegrace?\"\n\n\"Why, it's you!\" cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. It\nwas the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly\nnoticed the day before.\n\n\"And who are you, my good sir?\" said the old woman, in quite a different\nvoice. \"I don't know you in the dark.\"\n\n\"You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. You're the servant there?\"\n\n\"Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch's.... But I don't know\nyou now.\"\n\n\"Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?\" said Mitya,\nbeside himself with suspense. \"I saw her to the house some time ago.\"\n\n\"She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off again.\"\n\n\"What? Went away?\" cried Mitya. \"When did she go?\"\n\n\"Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told Kuzma\nKuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.\"\n\n\"You're lying, damn you!\" roared Mitya.\n\n\"Aie! Aie!\" shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.\n\nHe ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the\nmoment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not more\nthan a quarter of an hour after her departure.\n\nFenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the\nkitchen when \"the captain\" ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on\nseeing him.\n\n\"You scream?\" roared Mitya, \"where is she?\"\n\nBut without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fell\nall of a heap at her feet.\n\n\"Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don't know. You may kill me\nbut I can't tell you.\" Fenya swore and protested. \"You went out with her\nyourself not long ago--\"\n\n\"She came back!\"\n\n\"Indeed she didn't. By God I swear she didn't come back.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\" shouted Mitya. \"From your terror I know where she is.\"\n\nHe rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily.\nBut she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or she\nmight not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and\nold Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar,\nwith a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches\nlong. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the\nother, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.\n\n\"Oh, Lord! He's going to murder some one!\" cried Fenya, flinging up her\nhands.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. In The Dark\n\n\nWhere was he running? \"Where could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch's?\nShe must have run straight to him from Samsonov's, that was clear now. The\nwhole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.\" ... It all rushed whirling\nthrough his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna's. \"There was no\nneed to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ...\nthey would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the\nplot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!\"\n\nHe formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor\nPavlovitch's house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street,\nthen over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at\nthe back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle\nfence of a neighbor's kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence,\nthat ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. Here he chose a spot,\napparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he knew\nLizaveta had once climbed over it: \"If she could climb over it,\" the\nthought, God knows why, occurred to him, \"surely I can.\" He did in fact\njump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence.\nThen he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in\nthe garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see the\nlighted windows of the house too.\n\n\"Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there!\" and he leapt from\nthe fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very likely\nSmerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he instinctively\nhid himself, stood still, and began to listen. But there was dead silence\non all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not the\nslightest breath of wind.\n\n\"And naught but the whispering silence,\" the line for some reason rose to\nhis mind. \"If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not.\"\nStanding still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in the\ngarden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creeping\nstealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him five\nminutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under the\nwindow there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam.\nThe door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut;\nhe had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached\nthe bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. \"I must wait now,\" he\nthought, \"to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are\nlistening ... if only I don't cough or sneeze.\"\n\nHe waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at moments,\nhe could scarcely breathe. \"No, this throbbing at my heart won't stop,\" he\nthought. \"I can't wait any longer.\" He was standing behind a bush in the\nshadow. The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush.\n\n\"How red the whitebeam berries are!\" he murmured, not knowing why. Softly\nand noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and raised\nhimself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's bedroom lay open before him. It\nwas not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen,\n\"Chinese,\" as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word \"Chinese\"\nflashed into Mitya's mind, \"and behind the screen, is Grushenka,\" thought\nMitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his new\nstriped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord\nwith tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with\ngold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his head\nFyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen.\n\n\"He has got himself up,\" thought Mitya.\n\nHis father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought.\nSuddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing\nwent up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter\nand drank it off. Then he uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a moment,\nwalked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand\nraised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his\nbruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.\n\n\"He's alone,\" thought Mitya, \"in all probability he's alone.\"\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly to\nthe window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.\n\n\"She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she's asleep by now,\" he\nthought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the\nwindow. \"He's looking for her out of the window, so she's not there. Why\nshould he stare out into the dark? He's wild with impatience.\" ... Mitya\nslipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old\nman was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put\nhis elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya\nwatched him eagerly.\n\n\"He's alone, he's alone!\" he repeated again. \"If she were here, his face\nwould be different.\"\n\nStrange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she\nwas not here. \"It's not that she's not here,\" he explained to himself,\nimmediately, \"but that I can't tell for certain whether she is or not.\"\nMitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally\nclear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no\npoint. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision,\nwas growing in his heart with every instant. \"Is she here or not?\" The\nangry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out\nhis hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the\nold man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times\nmore quickly, the signal that meant \"Grushenka is here!\"\n\nThe old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to\nthe window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch opened\nthe window and thrust his whole head out.\n\n\"Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?\" he said, in a sort of trembling half-\nwhisper. \"Where are you, my angel, where are you?\" He was fearfully\nagitated and breathless.\n\n\"He's alone.\" Mitya decided.\n\n\"Where are you?\" cried the old man again; and he thrust his head out\nfarther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, right\nand left. \"Come here, I've a little present for you. Come, I'll show\nyou....\"\n\n\"He means the three thousand,\" thought Mitya.\n\n\"But where are you? Are you at the door? I'll open it directly.\"\n\nAnd the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the\nright, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the\ndarkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open the\ndoor without waiting for Grushenka's answer.\n\nMitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old man's profile\nthat he loathed so, his pendent Adam's apple, his hooked nose, his lips\nthat smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by the\nslanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A horrible fury of\nhatred suddenly surged up in Mitya's heart: \"There he was, his rival, the\nman who had tormented him, had ruined his life!\" It was a rush of that\nsudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as though\nforeseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to\nAlyosha's question, \"How can you say you'll kill our father?\" \"I don't\nknow, I don't know,\" he had said then. \"Perhaps I shall not kill him,\nperhaps I shall. I'm afraid he'll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that\nmoment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. I\nfeel a personal repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of, that's what may be\ntoo much for me.\" ... This personal repulsion was growing unendurable.\nMitya was beside himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his\npocket.\n\n                  -------------------------------------\n\n\"God was watching over me then,\" Mitya himself said afterwards. At that\nvery moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in the\nevening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described to\nIvan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, very\nstrong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wife\nrepeated a \"certain prayer\" over him, after which he had gone to bed.\nMarfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong\ndrink, slept like the dead beside her husband.\n\nBut Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a moment's\nreflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back, he sat up\nin bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhaps\nhis conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was\nunguarded \"in such perilous times.\" Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay\nmotionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. \"The stuff's\nbeen too much for the woman,\" Grigory thought, glancing at her, and\ngroaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out\nfrom the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and\nhis right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not\nlocked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the most\npunctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine,\nand habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went\ndown the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open.\nMechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something,\nperhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master's\nwindow open. No one was looking out of it then.\n\n\"What's it open for? It's not summer now,\" thought Grigory, and suddenly,\nat that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before\nhim in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running\nin the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his\nback, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut,\nevidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the\nbath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigory\nfollowed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything. He\nreached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory\ncried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two\nhands.\n\nYes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he,\nthe \"monster,\" the \"parricide.\"\n\n\"Parricide!\" the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could\nhear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck\nby lightning.\n\nMitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mitya's\nhands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The\npestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a\nmost conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure\nbefore him. The old man's head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his\nhand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had\nbeen awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man's\nskull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing\nhorribly; and in a moment Mitya's fingers were drenched with the hot\nstream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white\nhandkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame\nHohlakov, and putting it to the old man's head, senselessly trying to wipe\nthe blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly\nsoaked with blood.\n\n\"Good heavens! what am I doing it for?\" thought Mitya, suddenly pulling\nhimself together. \"If I have broken his skull, how can I find out now? And\nwhat difference does it make now?\" he added, hopelessly. \"If I've killed\nhim, I've killed him.... You've come to grief, old man, so there you must\nlie!\" he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over it\ninto the lane and fell to running--the handkerchief soaked with blood he\nheld, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the\nback pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met\nhim in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a\nman running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov's house.\n\nImmediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the\nchief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ's sake, \"not\nto let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.\" Nazar Ivanovitch\npromised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him,\nand meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from the\ncountry, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention\n\"the captain.\" Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly\nrecognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gate\nat once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humored\nsmile that \"Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.\"\n\n\"Where is she then, Prohor?\" asked Mitya, stopping short.\n\n\"She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.\"\n\n\"What for?\" cried Mitya.\n\n\"That I can't say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horses\nwere sent to fetch her.\"\n\nMitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.\n\n\n\nChapter V. A Sudden Resolution\n\n\nShe was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were both just\ngoing to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselves\nin. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her by the throat.\n\n\"Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?\" he roared\nfuriously.\n\nBoth the women squealed.\n\n\"Aie! I'll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I'll tell you\neverything directly, I won't hide anything,\" gabbled Fenya, frightened to\ndeath; \"she's gone to Mokroe, to her officer.\"\n\n\"What officer?\" roared Mitya.\n\n\"To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who threw her over\nfive years ago,\" cackled Fenya, as fast as she could speak.\n\nMitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat. He stood\nfacing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his eyes showed\nthat he realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed the whole\nposition. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observe\nwhether he understood or not. She remained sitting on the trunk as she had\nbeen when he ran into the room, trembling all over, holding her hands out\nbefore her as though trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grown\nrigid in that position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably\nupon him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared with\nblood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead with them,\nwiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and his right cheek\nwere blood-stained patches. Fenya was on the verge of hysterics. The old\ncook had jumped up and was staring at him like a mad woman, almost\nunconscious with terror.\n\nMitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next to\nFenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken, benumbed.\nYet everything was clear as day: that officer, he knew about him, he knew\neverything perfectly, he had known it from Grushenka herself, had known\nthat a letter had come from him a month before. So that for a month, for a\nwhole month, this had been going on, a secret from him, till the very\narrival of this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how could\nhe, how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten this\nofficer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him? That was the\nquestion that faced him like some monstrous thing. And he looked at this\nmonstrous thing with horror, growing cold with horror.\n\nBut suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child, he\nbegan speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he had\nscared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning Fenya with an extreme\npreciseness, astonishing in his position, and though the girl looked\nwildly at his blood-stained hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness and\nrapidity, answered every question as though eager to put the whole truth\nand nothing but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sort\nof enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to torment\nhim, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him. She\ndescribed the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin and\nAlyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress had set\noff, and how she had called out of the window to Alyosha to give him,\nMitya, her greetings, and to tell him \"to remember for ever how she had\nloved him for an hour.\"\n\nHearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush of\ncolor on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him, not a bit\nafraid now to be inquisitive:\n\n\"Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They're all over blood!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his hands and\nat once forgot them and Fenya's question.\n\nHe sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he had run in.\nHis first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed determination had\ntaken possession of him. He suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily.\n\n\"What has happened to you, sir?\" said Fenya, pointing to his hands again.\nShe spoke compassionately, as though she felt very near to him now in his\ngrief. Mitya looked at his hands again.\n\n\"That's blood, Fenya,\" he said, looking at her with a strange expression.\n\"That's human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But ... Fenya ...\nthere's a fence here\" (he looked at her as though setting her a riddle),\n\"a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn to-morrow, when the\nsun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You don't understand what\nfence, Fenya, and, never mind.... You'll hear to-morrow and understand ...\nand now, good-by. I won't stand in her way. I'll step aside, I know how to\nstep aside. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka\nKaramazov so for ever.... She always used to call me Mityenka, do you\nremember?\"\n\nAnd with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was almost\nmore frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when he ran in\nand attacked her.\n\nJust ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the young\nofficial with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by now half-past\neight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening tea, and had just put\nhis coat on again to go to the \"Metropolis\" to play billiards. Mitya\ncaught him coming out.\n\nSeeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered a\ncry of surprise.\n\n\"Good heavens! What is the matter?\"\n\n\"I've come for my pistols,\" said Mitya, \"and brought you the money. And\nthanks very much. I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of a\nbundle of bank-notes in Mitya's hand, and what was more, he had walked in\nholding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he had them\nin his right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them.\nPerhotin's servant-boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that\nhe walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in\nhis hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in the\nstreets. They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and the\nfingers holding them were covered with blood.\n\nWhen Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he said\nthat it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have been\ntwo thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, \"fat\" bundle. \"Dmitri\nFyodorovitch,\" so he testified afterwards, \"seemed unlike himself, too;\nnot drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same\ntime, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for\nsomething and unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste,\nanswered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all\ndejected but quite cheerful.\"\n\n\"But what _is_ the matter with you? What's wrong?\" cried Pyotr Ilyitch,\nlooking wildly at his guest. \"How is it that you're all covered with\nblood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!\"\n\nHe took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.\n\nSeeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.\n\n\"Damnation! That's the last straw,\" he muttered angrily, hurriedly\nchanging the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively jerked\nthe handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief turned out to be\nsoaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief he had used to wipe\nGrigory's face). There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not\nmerely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not\nbe pulled apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.\n\n\"Oh, damn it!\" he said. \"Haven't you a rag of some sort ... to wipe my\nface?\"\n\n\"So you're only stained, not wounded? You'd better wash,\" said Pyotr\nIlyitch. \"Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some water.\"\n\n\"A wash-stand? That's all right ... but where am I to put this?\"\n\nWith the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred-rouble\nnotes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him to\ndecide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.\n\n\"In your pocket, or on the table here. They won't be lost.\"\n\n\"In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that's all\nnonsense,\" he cried, as though suddenly coming out of his absorption.\n\"Look here, let's first settle that business of the pistols. Give them\nback to me. Here's your money ... because I am in great need of them ...\nand I haven't a minute, a minute to spare.\"\n\nAnd taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr\nIlyitch.\n\n\"But I shan't have change enough. Haven't you less?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not trusting\nhis own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones.\n\n\"No, they're all alike,\" he added, and again he looked inquiringly at\nPyotr Ilyitch.\n\n\"How have you grown so rich?\" the latter asked. \"Wait, I'll send my boy to\nPlotnikov's, they close late--to see if they won't change it. Here, Misha!\"\nhe called into the passage.\n\n\"To Plotnikov's shop--first-rate!\" cried Mitya, as though struck by an\nidea. \"Misha,\" he turned to the boy as he came in, \"look here, run to\nPlotnikov's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings,\nand will be there directly.... But listen, listen, tell them to have\nchampagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it was\nto take to Mokroe. I took four dozen with me then,\" he added (suddenly\naddressing Pyotr Ilyitch); \"they know all about it, don't you trouble,\nMisha,\" he turned again to the boy. \"Stay, listen; tell them to put in\ncheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything,\neverything they've got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty\nas before.... But wait: don't let them forget dessert, sweets, pears,\nwater-melons, two or three or four--no, one melon's enough, and chocolate,\ncandy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before,\nthree hundred roubles' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the\nsame again. And remember, Misha, if you are called Misha--His name is\nMisha, isn't it?\" He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching him\nuneasily, \"you'd better go yourself and tell them. He'll muddle it.\"\n\n\"He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for the\ncommission.... If you don't make a mistake, there's ten roubles for you,\nrun along, make haste.... Champagne's the chief thing, let them bring up\nchampagne. And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I had then....\nThey know what I had then.\"\n\n\"But listen!\" Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. \"I say, let\nhim simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and you go\nand tell them.... Give him your note. Be off, Misha! Put your best leg\nforward!\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boy\nremained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently\nunderstanding little of Mitya's orders, gazing up with amazement and\nterror at his blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers\nthat held the notes.\n\n\"Well, now come and wash,\" said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. \"Put the money on\nthe table or else in your pocket.... That's right, come along. But take\noff your coat.\"\n\nAnd beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:\n\n\"Look, your coat's covered with blood, too!\"\n\n\"That ... it's not the coat. It's only a little here on the sleeve.... And\nthat's only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have soaked through.\nI must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya's, and the blood's come\nthrough,\" Mitya explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness that\nwas astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.\n\n\"Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been fighting\nwith some one,\" he muttered.\n\nThey began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water.\nMitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands (they were trembling,\nand Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards). But the young official\ninsisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more. He seemed\nto exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on. It may be\nnoted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character.\n\n\"Look, you haven't got your nails clean. Now rub your face; here, on your\ntemples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you going?\nLook, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's all bloody,\" observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his shirt.\n\n\"Then change your shirt.\"\n\n\"I haven't time. You see I'll ...\" Mitya went on with the same confiding\ningenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel, and putting on his\ncoat. \"I'll turn it up at the wrist. It won't be seen under the coat....\nYou see!\"\n\n\"Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting with\nsome one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating that\ncaptain again?\" Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully. \"Whom have you been\nbeating now ... or killing, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Mitya.\n\n\"Why 'nonsense'?\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. \"I smashed an old\nwoman in the market-place just now.\"\n\n\"Smashed? An old woman?\"\n\n\"An old man!\" cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face,\nlaughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.\n\n\"Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?\"\n\n\"We made it up. We had a row--and made it up. In a place I know of. We\nparted friends. A fool.... He's forgiven me.... He's sure to have forgiven\nme by now ... if he had got up, he wouldn't have forgiven me\"--Mitya\nsuddenly winked--\"only damn him, you know, I say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him!\nDon't worry about him! I don't want to just now!\" Mitya snapped out,\nresolutely.\n\n\"Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ... Just\nas you did with that captain over some nonsense.... You've been fighting\nand now you're rushing off on the spree--that's you all over! Three dozen\nchampagne--what do you want all that for?\"\n\n\"Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I've no time now. I should\nlike to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven't the time. And\nthere's no need, it's too late for talking. Where's my money? Where have I\nput it?\" he cried, thrusting his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"You put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had you forgotten?\nMoney's like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are your pistols. It's\nan odd thing, at six o'clock you pledged them for ten roubles, and now\nyou've got thousands. Two or three I should say.\"\n\n\"Three, you bet,\" laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocket\nof his trousers.\n\n\"You'll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine?\"\n\n\"The mines? The gold-mines?\" Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and\nwent off into a roar of laughter. \"Would you like to go to the mines,\nPerhotin? There's a lady here who'll stump up three thousand for you, if\nonly you'll go. She did it for me, she's so awfully fond of gold-mines. Do\nyou know Madame Hohlakov?\"\n\n\"I don't know her, but I've heard of her and seen her. Did she really give\nyou three thousand? Did she really?\" said Pyotr Ilyitch, eyeing him\ndubiously.\n\n\"As soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as Phoebus, ever young, flies\nupwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this Madame Hohlakov,\nand ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not. Try and\nfind out.\"\n\n\"I don't know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively, I\nsuppose she did give it to you. You've got the money in your hand, but\ninstead of going to Siberia you're spending it all.... Where are you\nreally off to now, eh?\"\n\n\"To Mokroe.\"\n\n\"To Mokroe? But it's night!\"\n\n\"Once the lad had all, now the lad has naught,\" cried Mitya suddenly.\n\n\"How 'naught'? You say that with all those thousands!\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! I'm talking of the\nfemale character.\n\n\n    Fickle is the heart of woman\n    Treacherous and full of vice;\n\n\nI agree with Ulysses. That's what he says.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you!\"\n\n\"Am I drunk?\"\n\n\"Not drunk, but worse.\"\n\n\"I'm drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But that's enough!\"\n\n\"What are you doing, loading the pistol?\"\n\n\"I'm loading the pistol.\"\n\nUnfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder horn, and\ncarefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he took the bullet and,\nbefore inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the candle.\n\n\"Why are you looking at the bullet?\" asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching him\nwith uneasy curiosity.\n\n\"Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, would\nyou look at it or not?\"\n\n\"Why look at it?\"\n\n\"It's going into my brain, so it's interesting to look and see what it's\nlike. But that's foolishness, a moment's foolishness. Now that's done,\" he\nadded, putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod. \"Pyotr\nIlyitch, my dear fellow, that's nonsense, all nonsense, and if only you\nknew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper now.\"\n\n\"Here's some paper.\"\n\n\"No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That's right.\"\n\nAnd taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded the\npaper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He put the pistols\nin the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand. Then he looked at\nPyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.\n\n\"Now, let's go.\"\n\n\"Where are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking of putting\nthat bullet in your brain, perhaps?\" Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily.\n\n\"I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You may be\nsure of that. I love golden-haired Phoebus and his warm light.... Dear\nPyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'stepping aside'?\"\n\n\"Making way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I hate. And to\nlet the one I hate become dear--that's what making way means! And to say to\nthem: God bless you, go your way, pass on, while I--\"\n\n\"While you--?\"\n\n\"That's enough, let's go.\"\n\n\"Upon my word. I'll tell some one to prevent your going there,\" said Pyotr\nIlyitch, looking at him. \"What are you going to Mokroe for, now?\"\n\n\"There's a woman there, a woman. That's enough for you. You shut up.\"\n\n\"Listen, though you're such a savage I've always liked you.... I feel\nanxious.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old fellow. I'm a savage you say. Savages, savages! That's what I\nam always saying. Savages! Why, here's Misha! I was forgetting him.\"\n\nMisha ran in, post-haste, with a handful of notes in change, and reported\nthat every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs'; \"They're carrying down\nthe bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be ready directly.\"\nMitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch, then tossed\nanother ten-rouble note to Misha.\n\n\"Don't dare to do such a thing!\" cried Pyotr Ilyitch. \"I won't have it in\nmy house, it's a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here, put\nit here, why waste it? It would come in handy to-morrow, and I dare say\nyou'll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keep\nputting the notes in your side-pocket? Ah, you'll lose them!\"\n\n\"I say, my dear fellow, let's go to Mokroe together.\"\n\n\"What should I go for?\"\n\n\"I say, let's open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to drink,\nand especially to drink with you. I've never drunk with you, have I?\"\n\n\"Very well, we can go to the 'Metropolis.' I was just going there.\"\n\n\"I haven't time for that. Let's drink at the Plotnikovs', in the back\nroom. Shall I ask you a riddle?\"\n\n\"Ask away.\"\n\nMitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded it and\nshowed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: \"I punish myself for my\nwhole life, my whole life I punish!\"\n\n\"I will certainly speak to some one, I'll go at once,\" said Pyotr Ilyitch,\nafter reading the paper.\n\n\"You won't have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!\"\n\nPlotnikov's shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one to\nPyotr Ilyitch's. It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by no\nmeans a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants. They kept everything\nthat could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, wines\n\"bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,\" fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar,\nand so on. There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always\nemployed. Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners\nhad gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished\nas before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of\npurchasers for their goods.\n\nThey were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had vivid\nrecollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine and\ngoods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for in\ncash (they would never have let him have anything on credit, of course).\nThey remembered that then, as now, he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble\nnotes in his hand, and had scattered them at random, without bargaining,\nwithout reflecting, or caring to reflect what use so much wine and\nprovisions would be to him. The story was told all over the town that,\ndriving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had \"spent three thousand in\none night and the following day, and had come back from the spree without\na penny.\" He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped in our\nneighborhood at the time), who for two days got money without stint out of\nhim while he was drunk, and drank expensive wine without stint. People\nused to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he had given champagne to grimy-\nhanded peasants, and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and\nStrasburg pies. Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a risky\nproceeding, there was much laughter behind his back, especially in the\ntavern, at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of\nGrushenka by this \"escapade\" was \"permission to kiss her foot, and that\nwas the utmost she had allowed him.\"\n\nBy the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cart\nwith three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, the\ndriver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the shop they had\nalmost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were only\nwaiting for Mitya's arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart. Pyotr\nIlyitch was astounded.\n\n\"Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?\" he asked Mitya.\n\n\"I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here to the\nshop. There's no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but Timofey\nnow has gone on before me with the witch. Shall we be very late, Andrey?\"\n\n\"They'll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe. I\ngot Timofey ready to start. I know how he'll go. Their pace won't be ours,\nDmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They won't get there an hour\nearlier!\" Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driver, wearing a full-\nskirted coat, and with a kaftan on his arm, replied warmly.\n\n\"Fifty roubles for vodka if we're only an hour behind them.\"\n\n\"I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won't be half an hour\nbefore us, let alone an hour.\"\n\nThough Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his orders\nstrangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began a\nsentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to\ncome to the rescue.\n\n\"Four hundred roubles' worth, not less than four hundred roubles' worth,\njust as it was then,\" commanded Mitya. \"Four dozen champagne, not a bottle\nless.\"\n\n\"What do you want with so much? What's it for? Stay!\" cried Pyotr Ilyitch.\n\"What's this box? What's in it? Surely there isn't four hundred roubles'\nworth here?\"\n\nThe officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first\nbox contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only \"the most\nindispensable articles,\" such as savories, sweets, toffee, etc. But the\nmain part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off, as on the\nprevious occasion, in a special cart also with three horses traveling at\nfull speed, so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than\nDmitri Fyodorovitch himself.\n\n\"Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee and\nfondants. The girls there are so fond of it,\" Mitya insisted hotly.\n\n\"The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen of\nchampagne? One would be enough,\" said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry. He\nbegan bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to be\nsatisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles. In the end\nit was agreed that only three hundred roubles' worth should be sent.\n\n\"Well, you may go to the devil!\" cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second thoughts.\n\"What's it to do with me? Throw away your money, since it's cost you\nnothing.\"\n\n\"This way, my economist, this way, don't be angry.\" Mitya drew him into a\nroom at the back of the shop. \"They'll give us a bottle here directly.\nWe'll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for you're a nice\nfellow, the sort I like.\"\n\nMitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with a\ndirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagne\nsoon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen. \"First-class\noysters, the last lot in.\"\n\n\"Hang the oysters. I don't eat them. And we don't need anything,\" cried\nPyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.\n\n\"There's no time for oysters,\" said Mitya. \"And I'm not hungry. Do you\nknow, friend,\" he said suddenly, with feeling, \"I never have liked all\nthis disorder.\"\n\n\"Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word,\nthat's enough to make any one angry!\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean. I'm talking of a higher order. There's no order\nin me, no higher order. But ... that's all over. There's no need to grieve\nabout it. It's too late, damn it! My whole life has been disorder, and one\nmust set it in order. Is that a pun, eh?\"\n\n\"You're raving, not making puns!\"\n\n\n    \"Glory be to God in Heaven,\n    Glory be to God in me....\n\n\n\"That verse came from my heart once, it's not a verse, but a tear.... I\nmade it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain's beard,\nthough....\"\n\n\"Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all things are\nmade equal. That's the long and short of it.\"\n\n\"You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.\"\n\n\"That's all foolery, too! Drink, and don't be fanciful. I love life. I've\nloved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let's drink to life, dear\nboy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with myself? I'm a scoundrel,\nbut I'm satisfied with myself. And yet I'm tortured by the thought that\nI'm a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself. I bless the creation. I'm\nready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I must kill one\nnoxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others.... Let\nus drink to life, dear brother. What can be more precious than life?\nNothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!\"\n\n\"Let's drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.\"\n\nThey drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet he\nwas melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy, overwhelming anxiety\nwere weighing upon him.\n\n\"Misha ... here's your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink this\nglass to Phoebus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn....\"\n\n\"What are you giving it him for?\" cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!\"\n\n\"E--ech!\"\n\nMisha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.\n\n\"He'll remember it afterwards,\" Mitya remarked. \"Woman, I love woman! What\nis woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad, Pyotr\nIlyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? 'I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas,\npoor Yorick!' Perhaps that's me, Yorick? Yes, I'm Yorick now, and a skull\nafterwards.\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while.\n\n\"What dog's that you've got here?\" he asked the shopman, casually,\nnoticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.\n\n\"It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,\" answered the clerk. \"She\nbrought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her.\"\n\n\"I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...\" murmured Mitya dreamily, \"only\nthat one had its hind leg broken.... By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted\nto ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?\"\n\n\"What a question!\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean anything. From somebody's pocket, you know. I don't\nmean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do,\ntoo....\"\n\n\"You go to the devil.\"\n\n\"I'm talking of other people's money. Stealing straight out of a pocket?\nOut of a purse, eh?\"\n\n\"I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I took\nit off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.\"\n\n\"Well, and what happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, and\ngave it back.\"\n\n\"And what then?\"\n\n\"Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen something?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Mitya, winking slyly.\n\n\"What have you stolen?\" inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.\n\n\"I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and gave\nit back three days after.\"\n\nAs he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won't you come now?\" called Andrey from the door of\nthe shop.\n\n\"Are you ready? We'll come!\" Mitya started. \"A few more last words\nand--Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some brandy as well!\nThat box\" (the one with the pistols) \"put under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr\nIlyitch, don't remember evil against me.\"\n\n\"But you're coming back to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Will you settle the little bill now?\" cried the clerk, springing forward.\n\n\"Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.\"\n\nHe pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out three\nhundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of the\nshop. Every one followed him out, bowing and wishing him good luck.\nAndrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the\nbox. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise\nhe saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him\nwith a cry, and plumped down at his feet.\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don't harm my\nmistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don't murder him, he\ncame first, he's hers! He'll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That's why\nhe's come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don't take a\nfellow creature's life!\"\n\n\"Tut--tut--tut! That's it, is it? So you're off there to make trouble!\"\nmuttered Pyotr Ilyitch. \"Now, it's all clear, as clear as daylight. Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a\nman,\" he shouted aloud to Mitya. \"Do you hear, Dmitri?\"\n\n\"The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I'll throw them into the pool on the\nroad,\" answered Mitya. \"Fenya, get up, don't kneel to me. Mitya won't hurt\nany one, the silly fool won't hurt any one again. But I say, Fenya,\" he\nshouted, after having taken his seat. \"I hurt you just now, so forgive me\nand have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it doesn't matter if you\ndon't. It's all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full\nspeed!\"\n\nAndrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.\n\n\"Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...\"\n\n\"He's not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,\" Pyotr Ilyitch\nthought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the cart\npacked with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they would\ndeceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, he\nturned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards.\n\n\"He's a fool, though he's a good fellow,\" he muttered as he went. \"I've\nheard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame. Well, if he has turned\nup.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his nurse! Let them do\nwhat they like! Besides, it'll all come to nothing. They're a set of\nbrawlers, that's all. They'll drink and fight, fight and make friends\nagain. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by 'I'm\nstepping aside, I'm punishing myself?' It'll come to nothing! He's shouted\nsuch phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he's not\ndrunk. 'Drunk in spirit'--they're fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am I\nhis nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood. With\nwhom? I shall find out at the 'Metropolis.' And his handkerchief was\nsoaked in blood.... It's still lying on my floor.... Hang it!\"\n\nHe reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game. The game\ncheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly began telling one of\nhis partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash\nagain--something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again\nto spend it with Grushenka.... This news roused singular interest in his\nlisteners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity.\nThey left off playing.\n\n\"Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?\"\n\nQuestions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present was received\nwith skepticism.\n\n\"Hasn't he robbed his old father?--that's the question.\"\n\n\"Three thousand! There's something odd about it.\"\n\n\"He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him, here.\nAnd it was three thousand he talked about ...\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in his\nanswers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face and hands,\nthough he had meant to speak of it at first.\n\nThey began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away.\nBut by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for\nbilliards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he had\nintended, he walked out of the tavern. When he reached the market-place he\nstood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that what he\nwanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch's and find out if anything had\nhappened there. \"On account of some stupid nonsense--as it's sure to turn\nout--am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it,\nis it my business to look after them?\"\n\nIn a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya.\n\"Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,\" he thought with\nvexation, \"I should have heard everything.\" And the desire to speak to\nher, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he was\nhalf-way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where\nGrushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock\nin the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no\none answered him; every one in the house was asleep.\n\n\"And I shall be making a fuss!\" he thought, with a feeling of positive\ndiscomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking\nagain with all his might, filling the street with clamor.\n\n\"Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!\" he muttered at each\nknock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on\nthe gate.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. \"I Am Coming, Too!\"\n\n\nBut Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more\nthan twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three horses galloped at such a\npace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. The\nswift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big\nstars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the very\nhour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it\nfor ever and ever.\n\nAll was confusion, confusion, in Mitya's soul, but although many things\nwere goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning for\nher, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time.\nOne thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one instant.\nI shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt\nnot the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprung\nout of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene, he would have\nbeen jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with\nblood again. But as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no\nhostility even, for the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he\nhad not yet seen him.\n\n\"Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; this was\nher first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she had\nloved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What right\nhave I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is\nover apart from the officer--even if he had not appeared, everything would\nbe over ...\"\n\nThese words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been\ncapable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His present\nplan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya's first words, it\nhad sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its\nconsequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion in\nhis soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace.\nThere was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him,\nat moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death with\npen and paper: \"I punish myself,\" and the paper was lying there in his\npocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next\nmorning, he would meet the first warm ray of \"golden-haired Phoebus.\"\n\nAnd yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behind\nand that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought of it sank\ninto his heart with despair. There was one moment when he felt an impulse\nto stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his loaded pistol,\nand to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn. But that\nmoment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on, \"devouring space,\"\nand as he drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took\nmore and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful\nimages that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon her, if\nonly for a moment, if only from a distance!\n\n\"She's now with _him_,\" he thought, \"now I shall see what she looks like\nwith him, her first love, and that's all I want.\" Never had this woman,\nwho was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love in his\nbreast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, a\nfeeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her! \"I will\nefface myself!\" he said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.\n\nThey had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and though\nAndrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter a word,\neither. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his three\nlean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible\nanxiety:\n\n\"Andrey! What if they're asleep?\"\n\nThis thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him before.\n\n\"It may well be that they're gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\"\n\nMitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there ...\nwith such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep, perhaps,\nthere too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.\n\n\"Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!\" he cried, beside himself.\n\n\"But maybe they're not in bed!\" Andrey went on after a pause. \"Timofey\nsaid they were a lot of them there--\"\n\n\"At the station?\"\n\n\"Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn, where they\nlet out horses, too.\"\n\n\"I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that? Who are they?\"\ncried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.\n\n\"Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our town--who\nthey are I can't say--and there are two others, strangers, maybe more\nbesides. I didn't ask particularly. They've set to playing cards, so\nTimofey said.\"\n\n\"Cards?\"\n\n\"So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most likely not\nmore than eleven.\"\n\n\"Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!\" Mitya cried again, nervously.\n\n\"May I ask you something, sir?\" said Andrey, after a pause. \"Only I'm\nafraid of angering you, sir.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to\nharm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sir-- It's I am\ntaking you there ... forgive me, sir, it's my conscience ... maybe it's\nstupid of me to speak of it--\"\n\nMitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.\n\n\"Are you a driver?\" he asked frantically.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driver\nwho wouldn't make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush\npeople? No, a driver mustn't run over people. One can't run over a man.\nOne can't spoil people's lives. And if you have spoilt a life--punish\nyourself.... If only you've spoilt, if only you've ruined any one's\nlife--punish yourself and go away.\"\n\nThese phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey was\nsurprised at him, he kept up the conversation.\n\n\"That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one mustn't crush\nor torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is created\nby God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers,\ndrive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.\"\n\n\"To hell?\" Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short laugh.\n\"Andrey, simple soul,\" he seized him by the shoulders again, \"tell me,\nwill Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?\"\n\n\"I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see, sir,\nwhen the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went straight\ndown to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony.\nAnd the devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no more\nsinners in hell. And God said to him, then, 'Don't groan, for you shall\nhave all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and the\nrich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I\ncome again.' Those were His very words ...\"\n\n\"A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!\"\n\n\"So you see, sir, who it is hell's for,\" said Andrey, whipping up the left\nhorse, \"but you're like a little child ... that's how we look on you ...\nand though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your\nkind heart.\"\n\n\"And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?\"\n\n\"What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any harm.\"\n\n\"No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will you\nforgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!\"\n\n\"Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.\"\n\nBut Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering to\nhimself.\n\n\"Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let me\npass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself,\ndo not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love\nThee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there\nI shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to\nthe end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of\nThy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot\nhelp loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shall\nfall before her and say, 'You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell\nand forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!' \"\n\n\"Mokroe!\" cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.\n\nThrough the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of\nbuildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village of\nMokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were\nasleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.\n\n\"Drive on, Andrey, I come!\" Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.\n\n\"They're not asleep,\" said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to the\nPlastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The six\nwindows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.\n\n\"They're not asleep,\" Mitya repeated joyously. \"Quicker, Andrey! Gallop!\nDrive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I have\ncome. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!\"\n\nAndrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and\npulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.\n\nMitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed,\npeeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.\n\n\"Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?\"\n\nThe innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushed\nup to the guest with obsequious delight.\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?\"\n\nTrifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height,\nwith a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising,\nespecially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of assuming\nthe most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that it was to his\ninterest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on one\nside, and a full-skirted coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was\nfor ever dreaming of improving his position. More than half the peasants\nwere in his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.\nFrom the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which were\nworked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shake\noff. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of them was\nalready a widow and lived in the inn with her two children, his\ngrandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman. Another of his\ndaughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of the\ninn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniature\nphotograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes. The two\nyounger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting\ntight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when\nthey went to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as\nusual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean\nup after lodgers.\n\nIn spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch was\nvery fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering that\nnot a month ago he had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not three\nhundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his escapade with\nGrushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment\nMitya drove up to the steps.\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!\"\n\n\"Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,\" began Mitya, \"first and foremost, where is\nshe?\"\n\n\"Agrafena Alexandrovna?\" The inn-keeper understood at once, looking\nsharply into Mitya's face. \"She's here, too ...\"\n\n\"With whom? With whom?\"\n\n\"Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from his\nspeech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there's another with\nhim, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there's no telling. They're\ndressed like civilians.\"\n\n\"Well, are they feasting? Have they money?\"\n\n\"Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?\"\n\n\"They're two gentlemen from the town.... They've come back from Tcherny,\nand are putting up here. One's quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.\nMiuesov, he must be, but I've forgotten his name ... and I expect you know\nthe other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He's been on a pilgrimage, so\nhe says, to the monastery in the town. He's traveling with this young\nrelation of Mr. Miuesov.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of her?\nHow is she?\"\n\n\"Oh, she's only just come. She's sitting with them.\"\n\n\"Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?\"\n\n\"No, I think she's not laughing much. She's sitting quite dull. She's\ncombing the young gentleman's hair.\"\n\n\"The Pole--the officer?\"\n\n\"He's not young, and he's not an officer, either. Not him, sir. It's the\nyoung gentleman that's Mr. Miuesov's relation ... I've forgotten his name.\"\n\n\"Kalganov.\"\n\n\"That's it, Kalganov!\"\n\n\"All right. I'll see for myself. Are they playing cards?\"\n\n\"They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been drinking tea,\nthe official gentleman asked for liqueurs.\"\n\n\"Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for myself. Now\nanswer one more question: are the gypsies here?\"\n\n\"You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities have\nsent them away. But we've Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the\nvillage, so one might send for them. They'd come.\"\n\n\"Send for them. Certainly send for them!\" cried Mitya. \"And you can get\nthe girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, and\nArina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!\"\n\n\"Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by now\nthey're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such\ncoarseness and rudeness! What's the good of giving a peasant a cigar to\nsmoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I'll\nget my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. They've only\njust gone to bed, I'll give them a kick and set them singing for you. You\ngave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e--ech!\"\n\nFor all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hidden\nhalf a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked up\na hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in his\nclutches.\n\n\"Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I was\nhere. Do you remember?\"\n\n\"You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left three\nthousand behind you.\"\n\n\"Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?\"\n\nAnd he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the\ninnkeeper's nose.\n\n\"Now, listen and remember. In an hour's time the wine will arrive,\nsavories, pies, and sweets--bring them all up at once. That box Andrey has\ngot is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagne\nimmediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.\"\n\nHe turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.\n\n\"Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the drive, and\nfifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... Remember\nKaramazov!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, sir,\" faltered Andrey. \"Give me five roubles extra, but more\nI won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish words\n...\"\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\" asked Mitya, scanning him. \"Well, go to the\ndevil, if that's it!\" he cried, flinging him five roubles. \"Now, Trifon\nBorissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, so\nthat they don't see me. Where are they? In the blue room?\"\n\nTrifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once obediently\ndid his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went himself into the\nfirst large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, and\ntook the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in, and put him in a\ncorner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the company without being\nseen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he\nsaw her, his heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.\n\nShe was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her, on\nthe sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand and\nseemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at her, was\nsaying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of the\ntable, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at something. On\nthe sofa sat _he_, and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger.\nThe one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had\nan impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was\napparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger, struck\nMitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. He\ncaught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put the pistol-\ncase on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked, feeling cold all\nover, straight into the blue room to face the company.\n\n\"Aie!\" shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover\n\n\nWith his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering at\nevery word, \"I ... I'm all right! Don't be afraid!\" he exclaimed,\n\"I--there's nothing the matter,\" he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who had\nshrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand tightly.\n\"I ... I'm coming, too. I'm here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with\nyou till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this same\nroom?\"\n\nSo he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting on\nthe sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and\nobserved severely:\n\n\"_Panie_, we're here in private. There are other rooms.\"\n\n\"Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?\" answered Kalganov\nsuddenly. \"Sit down with us. How are you?\"\n\n\"Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a\nlot of you.\" Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out\nhis hand across the table.\n\n\"Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,\" laughed\nKalganov.\n\n\"He always squeezes like that, always,\" Grushenka put in gayly, with a\ntimid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face that he was not\ngoing to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity and\nstill some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him, and\nindeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and\nspeak like this at such a moment.\n\n\"Good evening,\" Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up to\nhim, too.\n\n\"Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too!\nGentlemen, gentlemen, I--\" (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe\nagain, evidently taking him for the most important person present.) \"I\nflew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, in\nthis very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,\n_panie_,\" he cried wildly, \"I flew here and vowed-- Oh, don't be afraid,\nit's my last night! Let's drink to our good understanding. They'll bring\nthe wine at once.... I brought this with me.\" (Something made him pull out\nhis bundle of notes.) \"Allow me, _panie_! I want to have music, singing, a\nrevel, as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl\naway, and there'll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy on\nmy last night.\"\n\nHe was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, but\nstrange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazed\nfixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at Grushenka,\nand was in evident perplexity.\n\n\"If my suverin lady is permitting--\" he was beginning.\n\n\"What does 'suverin' mean? 'Sovereign,' I suppose?\" interrupted Grushenka.\n\"I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what are\nyou talking about? Don't frighten us, please. You won't frighten us, will\nyou? If you won't, I am glad to see you ...\"\n\n\"Me, me frighten you?\" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. \"Oh, pass me\nby, go your way, I won't hinder you!...\"\n\nAnd suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by\nflinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his head\naway to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chair\ntight, as though embracing it.\n\n\"Come, come, what a fellow you are!\" cried Grushenka reproachfully.\n\"That's just how he comes to see me--he begins talking, and I can't make\nout what he means. He cried like that once before, and now he's crying\nagain! It's shameful! Why are you crying? _As though you had anything to\ncry for!_\" she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some\nirritability.\n\n\"I ... I'm not crying.... Well, good evening!\" He instantly turned round\nin his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh, but a\nlong, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.\n\n\"Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!\" Grushenka said\nto him persuasively. \"I'm very glad you've come, very glad, Mitya, do you\nhear, I'm very glad! I want him to stay here with us,\" she said\nperemptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words were\nobviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. \"I wish it, I wish it!\nAnd if he goes away I shall go, too!\" she added with flashing eyes.\n\n\"What my queen commands is law!\" pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing\nGrushenka's hand. \"I beg you, _panie_, to join our company,\" he added\npolitely, addressing Mitya.\n\nMitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another\ntirade, but the words did not come.\n\n\"Let's drink, _panie_,\" he blurted out instead of making a speech. Every\none laughed.\n\n\"Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!\" Grushenka exclaimed\nnervously. \"Do you hear, Mitya,\" she went on insistently, \"don't prance\nabout, but it's nice you've brought the champagne. I want some myself, and\nI can't bear liqueurs. And best of all, you've come yourself. We were\nfearfully dull here.... You've come for a spree again, I suppose? But put\nyour money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?\"\n\nMitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle of\nnotes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed. In\nconfusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At that\nmoment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, and\nglasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so bewildered\nthat he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him and\npoured out the champagne.\n\n\"Another! Another bottle!\" Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgetting\nto clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink to\ntheir good understanding, he drank off his glass without waiting for any\none else. His whole countenance suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic\nexpression with which he had entered vanished completely, and a look of\nsomething childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly\ngentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a\ncontinual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who\nhas done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten\neverything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of\ndelight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his\nchair close up to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two\nPoles, though he had formed no definite conception of them yet.\n\nThe Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his Polish\naccent; and, above all, by his pipe. \"Well, what of it? It's a good thing\nhe's smoking a pipe,\" he reflected. The Pole's puffy, middle-aged face,\nwith its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-looking\nmustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not\neven particularly struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with\nlove-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples. \"I suppose it's all\nright since he wears a wig,\" he went on, musing blissfully. The other,\nyounger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and\nlistening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressed\nMitya by his great height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole on\nthe sofa. \"If he stood up he'd be six foot three.\" The thought flitted\nthrough Mitya's mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the\nfriend of the other, as it were, a \"bodyguard,\" and no doubt the big Pole\nwas at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed\nto Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike\nsubmissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.\n\nGrushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely\nfailed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart, was that she was\nkind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him sit by her. He was\nbeside himself with delight, watching her sip her glass of champagne. The\nsilence of the company seemed somehow to strike him, however, and he\nlooked round at every one with expectant eyes.\n\n\"Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you begin doing\nsomething?\" his smiling eyes seemed to ask.\n\n\"He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,\" Kalganov began\nsuddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.\n\nMitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.\n\n\"He's talking nonsense?\" he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seeming\nsuddenly delighted at something--\"ha ha!\"\n\n\"Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry officers\nin the twenties married Polish women. That's awful rot, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Polish women?\" repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.\n\nKalganov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and he guessed\nabout the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him, perhaps did\nnot interest him at all; what he was interested in was Maximov. He had\ncome here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn for\nthe first time in his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once been\nwith some one to see her; but she had not taken to him. But here she\nlooked at him very affectionately: before Mitya's arrival, she had been\nmaking much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was a\nboy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charming fair-\nskinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair face looked out\nbeautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimes even deep\nexpression, beyond his age indeed, although the young man sometimes looked\nand talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed of it, even when\nhe was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very willful, even\ncapricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there was something fixed\nand obstinate in his expression. He would look at you and listen, seeming\nall the while to be persistently dreaming over something else. Often he\nwas listless and lazy, at other times he would grow excited, sometimes,\napparently, over the most trivial matters.\n\n\"Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the last four days,\"\nhe went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally though, without\nthe slightest affectation. \"Ever since your brother, do you remember,\nshoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That made me take an\ninterest in him at the time, and I took him into the country, but he keeps\ntalking such rot I'm ashamed to be with him. I'm taking him back.\"\n\n\"The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,\"\nthe Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.\n\nHe spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended. If\nhe used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.\n\n\"But I was married to a Polish lady myself,\" tittered Maximov.\n\n\"But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.\nWere you a cavalry officer?\" put in Kalganov at once.\n\n\"Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!\" cried Mitya, listening eagerly,\nand turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though there were\nno knowing what he might hear from each.\n\n\"No, you see,\" Maximov turned to him. \"What I mean is that those pretty\nPolish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when\none of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a\nkitten ... a little white one ... and the _pan_-father and _pan_-mother\nlook on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes\nand offers her his hand.... That's how it is ... offers her his hand, he\nhe!\" Maximov ended, tittering.\n\n\"The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!\" the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and\ncrossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught by his huge greased\nboot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles looked\nrather greasy.\n\n\"Well, now it's _lajdak_! What's he scolding about?\" said Grushenka,\nsuddenly vexed.\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls,\nand not ladies of good birth,\" the Pole with the pipe observed to\nGrushenka.\n\n\"You can reckon on that,\" the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.\n\n\"What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes it\ncheerful,\" Grushenka said crossly.\n\n\"I'm not hindering them, _pani_,\" said the Pole in the wig, with a long\nlook at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe\nagain.\n\n\"No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.\" Kalganov got excited\nagain, as though it were a question of vast import. \"He's never been in\nPoland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you weren't married in\nPoland, were you?\"\n\n\"No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to Russia\nbefore that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and another\nfemale relation with a grown-up son. He brought her straight from Poland\nand gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very nice\nyoung man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he didn't marry\nher, because she turned out to be lame.\"\n\n\"So you married a lame woman?\" cried Kalganov.\n\n\"Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. I\nthought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for fun.\"\n\n\"So pleased she was going to marry you!\" yelled Kalganov, in a ringing,\nchildish voice.\n\n\"Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.\nAfterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening,\nshe confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. 'I once jumped over\na puddle when I was a child,' she said, 'and injured my leg.' He he!\"\n\nKalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on the\nsofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.\n\n\"Do you know, that's the truth, he's not lying now,\" exclaimed Kalganov,\nturning to Mitya; \"and do you know, he's been married twice; it's his\nfirst wife he's talking about. But his second wife, do you know, ran away,\nand is alive now.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an\nexpression of the utmost astonishment.\n\n\"Yes. She did run away. I've had that unpleasant experience,\" Maximov\nmodestly assented, \"with a _monsieur_. And what was worse, she'd had all\nmy little property transferred to her beforehand. 'You're an educated\nman,' she said to me. 'You can always get your living.' She settled my\nbusiness with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: 'One of your wives\nwas lame, but the other was too light-footed.' He he!\"\n\n\"Listen, listen!\" cried Kalganov, bubbling over, \"if he's telling lies--and\nhe often is--he's only doing it to amuse us all. There's no harm in that,\nis there? You know, I sometimes like him. He's awfully low, but it's\nnatural to him, eh? Don't you think so? Some people are low from self-\ninterest, but he's simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was\narguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_\nabout him. Do you remember, there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom\nNozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, 'for inflicting bodily\ninjury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.' Would\nyou believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten!\nNow can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the\nbeginning of the twenties, so that the dates don't fit. He couldn't have\nbeen thrashed then, he couldn't, could he?\"\n\nIt was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his\nexcitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.\n\n\"Well, but if they did thrash him!\" he cried, laughing.\n\n\"It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is--\" put in\nMaximov.\n\n\"What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't.\"\n\n\"What o'clock is it, _panie_?\" the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall\nfriend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders in\nreply. Neither of them had a watch.\n\n\"Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people talk because\nyou're bored?\" Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding\nfault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya's mind.\nThis time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.\n\n\"_Pani_, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"All right then. Come, tell us your story,\" Grushenka cried to Maximov.\n\"Why are you all silent?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish,\" answered Maximov at once,\nwith evident satisfaction, mincing a little. \"Besides, all that's by way\nof allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryov\nwas really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, he\nwas called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he wasn't an\nItalian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her\npretty little legs in tights, and she had a little short skirt with\nspangles, and she kept turning round and round, only not for four hours\nbut for four minutes only, and she bewitched every one...\"\n\n\"But what were you beaten for?\" cried Kalganov.\n\n\"For Piron!\" answered Maximov.\n\n\"What Piron?\" cried Mitya.\n\n\"The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big party\nof us, in a tavern at that very fair. They'd invited me, and first of all\nI began quoting epigrams. 'Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!' and\nBoileau answers that he's going to a masquerade, that is to the baths, he\nhe! And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another,\nvery sarcastic, well known to all educated people:\n\n\n    Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!\n    But one grief is weighing on me.\n    You don't know your way to the sea!\n\n\nThey were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly\nway for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I began\ntelling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not accepted\ninto the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:\n\n\n    Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien,\n    Pas meme academicien.\n\n\nThey seized me and thrashed me.\"\n\n\"But what for? What for?\"\n\n\"For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,\" Maximov\nconcluded, briefly and sententiously.\n\n\"Eh, that's enough! That's all stupid, I don't want to listen. I thought\nit would be amusing,\" Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.\n\nMitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon his\nfeet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his element,\nbegan pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands behind his back.\n\n\"Ah, he can't sit still,\" said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously.\nMitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofa\nwas looking at him with an irritable expression.\n\n\"_Panie!_\" cried Mitya, \"let's drink! and the other _pan_, too! Let us\ndrink.\"\n\nIn a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them with\nchampagne.\n\n\"To Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland!\" cried Mitya.\n\n\"I shall be delighted, _panie_,\" said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity\nand affable condescension, and he took his glass.\n\n\"And the other _pan_, what's his name? Drink, most illustrious, take your\nglass!\" Mitya urged.\n\n\"Pan Vrublevsky,\" put in the Pole on the sofa.\n\nPan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.\n\n\"To Poland, _panovie!_\" cried Mitya, raising his glass. \"Hurrah!\"\n\nAll three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three\nglasses.\n\n\"Now to Russia, _panovie_, and let us be brothers!\"\n\n\"Pour out some for us,\" said Grushenka; \"I'll drink to Russia, too!\"\n\n\"So will I,\" said Kalganov.\n\n\"And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!\" tittered Maximov.\n\n\"All! All!\" cried Mitya. \"Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!\"\n\nThe other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table.\nMitya filled the glasses.\n\n\"To Russia! Hurrah!\" he shouted again. All drank the toast except the\nPoles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did not\ntouch theirs.\n\n\"How's this, _panovie_?\" cried Mitya, \"won't you drink it?\"\n\nPan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:\n\n\"To Russia as she was before 1772.\"\n\n\"Come, that's better!\" cried the other Pole, and they both emptied their\nglasses at once.\n\n\"You're fools, you _panovie_,\" broke suddenly from Mitya.\n\n\"_Panie!_\" shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a\ncouple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.\n\n\"Can one help loving one's own country?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Be silent! Don't quarrel! I won't have any quarreling!\" cried Grushenka\nimperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face glowed, her\neyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just drunk were\napparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.\n\n\"_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, I'm sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_\nVrublevsky, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!\" Grushenka scolded\nwith angry annoyance.\n\nEvery one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,\" Mitya began again, unable to make\nanything of Grushenka's words. \"Come, why are we sitting here? What shall\nwe do ... to amuse ourselves again?\"\n\n\"Ach, it's certainly anything but amusing!\" Kalganov mumbled lazily.\n\n\"Let's play faro again, as we did just now,\" Maximov tittered suddenly.\n\n\"Faro? Splendid!\" cried Mitya. \"If only the _panovie_--\"\n\n\"It's lite, _panovie_,\" the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were\nunwillingly.\n\n\"That's true,\" assented Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n\"Lite? What do you mean by 'lite'?\" asked Grushenka.\n\n\"Late, _pani_! 'a late hour' I mean,\" the Pole on the sofa explained.\n\n\"It's always late with them. They can never do anything!\" Grushenka almost\nshrieked in her anger. \"They're dull themselves, so they want others to be\ndull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning up\ntheir noses at me.\"\n\n\"My goddess!\" cried the Pole on the sofa, \"I see you're not well-disposed\nto me, that's why I'm gloomy. I'm ready, _panie_,\" added he, addressing\nMitya.\n\n\"Begin, _panie_,\" Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket, and\nlaying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. \"I want to lose a lot to\nyou. Take your cards. Make the bank.\"\n\n\"We'll have cards from the landlord, _panie_,\" said the little Pole,\ngravely and emphatically.\n\n\"That's much the best way,\" chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n\"From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let's get them from him.\nCards!\" Mitya shouted to the landlord.\n\nThe landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that the\ngirls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would most\nlikely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived.\nMitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders,\nbut only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did\nnot know himself what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told\nthem to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the\ntoffee and the fondants. \"And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!\" he\ncried in haste. \"I was rude to Andrey!\"\n\nSuddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Give me five roubles,\" he whispered to Mitya. \"I'll stake something at\nfaro, too, he he!\"\n\n\"Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!\"\n\nAgain he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten\nroubles. \"And if you lose that, come again, come again.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya,\ntoo, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had\nalready sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable,\nalmost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was\npreparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.\n\n\"To your places, gentlemen,\" cried Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n\"No, I'm not going to play any more,\" observed Kalganov, \"I've lost fifty\nroubles to them just now.\"\n\n\"The _pan_ had no luck, perhaps he'll be lucky this time,\" the Pole on the\nsofa observed in his direction.\n\n\"How much in the bank? To correspond?\" asked Mitya.\n\n\"That's according, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much as\nyou will stake.\"\n\n\"A million!\" laughed Mitya.\n\n\"The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?\"\n\n\"What Podvysotsky?\"\n\n\"In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.\nPodvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank.\nThe banker says, '_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or\nmust we trust to your honor?' 'To my honor, _panie_,' says Podvysotsky.\n'So much the better.' The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. 'Take\nit, _panie_,' says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a\nmillion. 'Take it, _panie_, this is your gain.' There was a million in the\nbank. 'I didn't know that,' says Podvysotsky. '_Panie_ Podvysotsky,' said\nthe banker, 'you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.' Podvysotsky took\nthe million.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" said Kalganov.\n\n\"_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn't say such things.\"\n\n\"As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!\" cried Mitya, but\nchecked himself at once. \"Forgive me, _panie_, it's my fault again, he\nwould, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You see\nhow I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.\"\n\n\"And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty little\n_panienotchka_, he he!\" laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, as\nthough trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up and crossed\nhimself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too.\n\n\"A corner!\" cried Mitya.\n\n\"I'll bet another rouble, a 'single' stake,\" Maximov muttered gleefully,\nhugely delighted at having won a rouble.\n\n\"Lost!\" shouted Mitya. \"A 'double' on the seven!\"\n\nThe seven too was trumped.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Kalganov suddenly.\n\n\"Double! Double!\" Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled the\nstake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakes\nkept winning.\n\n\"On the double!\" shouted Mitya furiously.\n\n\"You've lost two hundred, _panie_. Will you stake another hundred?\" the\nPole on the sofa inquired.\n\n\"What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!\"\n\nAnd pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling two\nhundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.\n\n\"That's enough!\" he shouted in his ringing voice.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Mitya stared at him.\n\n\"That's enough! I don't want you to play any more. Don't!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I don't. Hang it, come away. That's why. I won't let you go on\nplaying.\"\n\nMitya gazed at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You've lost a lot as it is,\" said\nGrushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose from\ntheir seats with a deeply offended air.\n\n\"Are you joking, _panie_?\" said the short man, looking severely at\nKalganov.\n\n\"How dare you!\" Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.\n\n\"Don't dare to shout like that,\" cried Grushenka. \"Ah, you turkey-cocks!\"\n\nMitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka's face\nsuddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed into\nhis mind--a strange new thought!\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrippina,\" the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger,\nwhen Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Most illustrious, two words with you.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"In the next room, I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very\npleasant. You'll be glad to hear it.\"\n\nThe little _pan_ was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He\nagreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.\n\n\"The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!\" cried\nMitya. \"March, _panovie_!\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Grushenka, anxiously.\n\n\"We'll be back in one moment,\" answered Mitya.\n\nThere was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes. His\nface had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before.\n\nHe led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was\nassembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the\nright, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two large\nbeds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candle\non a small deal table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down to\nthis table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside\nthem, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but were\nevidently inquisitive.\n\n\"What can I do for you, _panie_?\" lisped the little Pole.\n\n\"Well, look here, _panie_, I won't keep you long. There's money for you,\"\nhe pulled out his notes. \"Would you like three thousand? Take it and go\nyour way.\"\n\nThe Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.\n\n\"Three thousand, _panie_?\" He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.\n\n\"Three, _panovie_, three! Listen, _panie_, I see you're a sensible man.\nTake three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you--d'you\nhear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that,\n_panie_, for ever. Here's the door, you go out of it. What have you got\nthere, a great-coat, a fur coat? I'll bring it out to you. They'll get the\nhorses out directly, and then--good-by, _panie_!\"\n\nMitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression of\nextraordinary resolution passed over the Pole's face.\n\n\"And the money, _panie_?\"\n\n\"The money, _panie_? Five hundred roubles I'll give you this moment for\nthe journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred to-\nmorrow, in the town--I swear on my honor, I'll get it, I'll get it at any\ncost!\" cried Mitya.\n\nThe Poles exchanged glances again. The short man's face looked more\nforbidding.\n\n\"Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute,\ncash down!\" Mitya added, feeling something wrong. \"What's the matter,\n_panie_? Don't you trust me? I can't give you the whole three thousand\nstraight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to-morrow....\nBesides, I haven't the three thousand with me. I've got it at home in the\ntown,\" faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. \"Upon\nmy word, the money's there, hidden.\"\n\nIn an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in\nthe little man's face.\n\n\"What next?\" he asked ironically. \"For shame!\" and he spat on the floor.\nPan Vrublevsky spat too.\n\n\"You do that, _panie_,\" said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was\nover, \"because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You're a couple of\ncapons, that's what you are!\"\n\n\"This is a mortal insult!\" The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he\nwent out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word.\nVrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and\ncrestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the _pan_ would at\nonce raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the room\nand threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!\" he exclaimed. But\nGrushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her in\nthe tenderest spot.\n\n\"Speak Russian! Speak Russian!\" she cried, \"not another word of Polish!\nYou used to talk Russian. You can't have forgotten it in five years.\"\n\nShe was red with passion.\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrippina--\"\n\n\"My name's Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won't listen!\"\n\nThe Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered\nhimself in broken Russian:\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forget\nall that has happened till to-day--\"\n\n\"Forgive? Came here to forgive me?\" Grushenka cut him short, jumping up\nfrom her seat.\n\n\"Just so, _pani_, I'm not pusillanimous, I'm magnanimous. But I was\nastounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in\nthe other room to depart. I spat in the _pan's_ face.\"\n\n\"What? He offered you money for me?\" cried Grushenka, hysterically. \"Is it\ntrue, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?\"\n\n\"_Panie, panie!_\" yelled Mitya, \"she's pure and shining, and I have never\nbeen her lover! That's a lie....\"\n\n\"How dare you defend me to him?\" shrieked Grushenka. \"It wasn't virtue\nkept me pure, and it wasn't that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might\nhold up my head when I met him, and tell him he's a scoundrel. And he did\nactually refuse the money?\"\n\n\"He took it! He took it!\" cried Mitya; \"only he wanted to get the whole\nthree thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred straight\noff.\"\n\n\"I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!\"\n\n\"_Pani_ Agrippina!\" cried the little Pole. \"I'm--a knight, I'm--a nobleman,\nand not a _lajdak_. I came here to make you my wife and I find you a\ndifferent woman, perverse and shameless.\"\n\n\"Oh, go back where you came from! I'll tell them to turn you out and\nyou'll be turned out,\" cried Grushenka, furious. \"I've been a fool, a\nfool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn't for his sake,\nit was my anger made me miserable. And this isn't he at all! Was he like\nthis? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He was a\nfalcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to me.... And I've\nbeen crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!\"\n\nShe sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At that\ninstant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left--a\nrollicking dance song.\n\n\"A regular Sodom!\" Vrublevsky roared suddenly. \"Landlord, send the\nshameless hussies away!\"\n\nThe landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at\nthe door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling, at\nonce entered the room.\n\n\"What are you shouting for? D'you want to split your throat?\" he said,\naddressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.\n\n\"Animal!\" bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n\"Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave you\na pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send you to\nSiberia for playing with false cards, d'you know that, for it's just the\nsame as false banknotes....\"\n\nAnd going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and\nthe cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.\n\n\"Here's my pack unopened!\"\n\nHe held it up and showed it to all in the room. \"From where I stood I saw\nhim slip my pack away, and put his in place of it--you're a cheat and not a\ngentleman!\"\n\n\"And I twice saw the _pan_ change a card!\" cried Kalganov.\n\n\"How shameful! How shameful!\" exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, and\nblushing for genuine shame. \"Good Lord, he's come to that!\"\n\n\"I thought so, too!\" said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words,\nVrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at\nGrushenka, shouting:\n\n\"You low harlot!\"\n\nMitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in the\nair, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right, from\nwhich they had just come.\n\n\"I've laid him on the floor, there,\" he announced, returning at once,\ngasping with excitement. \"He's struggling, the scoundrel! But he won't\ncome back, no fear of that!...\"\n\nHe closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called\nout to the little Pole:\n\n\"Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?\"\n\n\"My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" said Trifon Borissovitch, \"make them give\nyou back the money you lost. It's as good as stolen from you.\"\n\n\"I don't want my fifty roubles back,\" Kalganov declared suddenly.\n\n\"I don't want my two hundred, either,\" cried Mitya, \"I wouldn't take it\nfor anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Mitya! You're a trump, Mitya!\" cried Grushenka, and there was a\nnote of fierce anger in the exclamation.\n\nThe little _pan_, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity, was\nmaking for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressing\nGrushenka:\n\n\"_Pani_, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.\"\n\nAnd swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This was\na man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after all\nthat had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya slammed\nthe door after him.\n\n\"Lock it,\" said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they had\nlocked it from within.\n\n\"That's capital!\" exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. \"Serve them right!\"\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. Delirium\n\n\nWhat followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.\nGrushenka was the first to call for wine.\n\n\"I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before. Do you\nremember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!\"\n\nMitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was at\nhand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.\n\n\"Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, 'let the stove\nand cottage dance'; as we had it last time,\" she kept exclaiming. She was\ntremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her. The chorus were in\nthe next room. The room in which they had been sitting till that moment\nwas too small, and was divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which was\na huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows.\nIn the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herself\njust at the door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had sat in the same\nplace to watch the dancing and singing \"the time before,\" when they had\nmade merry there. All the girls who had come had been there then; the\nJewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and at last the long\nexpected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions.\n\nMitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the room to\nlook on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep and\nattracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they had\nenjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting and\nembracing every one he knew. He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for\nevery one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for the\nchampagne. The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mitya\nhad chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars\nshould be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to\nhelp himself.\n\nAn absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his natural\nelement, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits rose. If the\npeasants had asked him for money at that moment, he would have pulled out\nhis notes and given them away right and left. This was probably why the\nlandlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him.\nHe seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but he\ndrank little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on\nMitya's interests after his own fashion. He intervened in the nick of\ntime, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away \"cigars\nand Rhine wine,\" and, above all, money to the peasants as he had done\nbefore. He was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur,\nand eating sweets.\n\n\"They're a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" he said. \"I'd give them a\nkick, every one of them, and they'd take it as an honor--that's all they're\nworth!\"\n\nMitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him. \"I\nwas rude to him just now,\" he repeated with a sinking, softened voice.\nKalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for the girls'\nsinging; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became\nextraordinarily lively, strolling about the room, laughing and praising\nthe music and the songs, admiring every one and everything. Maximov,\nblissfully drunk, never left his side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to\nget drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to Mitya:\n\n\"What a dear, charming boy he is!\"\n\nAnd Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were his\nhopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to refrain\nfrom speaking. But she looked at him from time to time with caressing and\npassionate eyes. At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him\nvigorously to her. She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the\ndoor.\n\n\"How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!... I was\nfrightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you really\nwant to?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to spoil your happiness!\" Mitya faltered blissfully. But\nshe did not need his answer.\n\n\"Well, go and enjoy yourself ...\" she sent him away once more. \"Don't cry,\nI'll call you back again.\"\n\nHe would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked at the\ndancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in another\nquarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run\nback to her.\n\n\"Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my coming\nhere yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?\"\n\nAnd Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,\nfeverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.\n\n\"What are you frowning at?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I'd give ten years of my life for him\nto get well, to know he was all right!\"\n\n\"Well, never mind him, if he's ill. So you meant to shoot yourself to-\nmorrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows as you,\"\nshe lisped, with a rather halting tongue. \"So you would go any length for\nme, eh? Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow, you stupid? No,\nwait a little. To-morrow I may have something to say to you.... I won't\nsay it to-day, but to-morrow. You'd like it to be to-day? No, I don't want\nto to-day. Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.\"\n\nOnce, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.\n\n\"Why are you sad? I see you're sad.... Yes, I see it,\" she added, looking\nintently into his eyes. \"Though you keep kissing the peasants and\nshouting, I see something. No, be merry. I'm merry; you be merry, too....\nI love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep,\npoor dear, he's drunk.\"\n\nShe meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for a\nmoment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink; he\nfelt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, \"bored.\" He was intensely\ndepressed by the girls' songs, which, as the drinking went on, gradually\nbecame coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad. Two girls\ndressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in\nher hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to \"show them.\"\n\n\"Look alive, Marya, or you'll get the stick!\"\n\nThe bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amid\nroars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women.\n\n\"Well, let them! Let them!\" said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstatic\nexpression on her face. \"When they do get a day to enjoy themselves, why\nshouldn't folks be happy?\"\n\nKalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.\n\n\"It's swinish, all this peasant foolery,\" he murmured, moving away; \"it's\nthe game they play when it's light all night in summer.\"\n\nHe particularly disliked one \"new\" song to a jaunty dance-tune. It\ndescribed how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to see\nwhether they would love him:\n\n\n    The master came to try the girls:\n    Would they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut the girls could not love the master:\n\n\n    He would beat me cruelly\n    And such love won't do for me.\n\n\nThen a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:\n\n\n    The gypsy came to try the girls:\n    Would they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut they couldn't love the gypsy either:\n\n\n    He would be a thief, I fear,\n    And would cause me many a tear.\n\n\nAnd many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier:\n\n\n    The soldier came to try the girls:\n    Would they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung\nwith absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The song\nends with a merchant:\n\n\n    The merchant came to try the girls:\n    Would they love him, would they not?\n\n\nAnd it appears that he wins their love because:\n\n\n    The merchant will make gold for me\n    And his queen I'll gladly be.\n\n\nKalvanov was positively indignant.\n\n\"That's just a song of yesterday,\" he said aloud. \"Who writes such things\nfor them? They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to\ntry his luck with the girls; they'd have carried all before them.\"\n\nAnd, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on the\nspot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.\nHis pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on the sofa\ncushion.\n\n\"Look how pretty he is,\" said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him. \"I was\ncombing his hair just now; his hair's like flax, and so thick....\"\n\nAnd, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganov\ninstantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with the most\nanxious air inquired where was Maximov?\n\n\"So that's who it is you want.\" Grushenka laughed. \"Stay with me a minute.\nMitya, run and find his Maximov.\"\n\nMaximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, only\nrunning away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur. He\nhad drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was red, and his nose was\ncrimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet. He ran up and announced\nthat he was going to dance the \"sabotiere.\"\n\n\"They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I was\nlittle....\"\n\n\"Go, go with him, Mitya, and I'll watch from here how he dances,\" said\nGrushenka.\n\n\"No, no, I'm coming to look on, too,\" exclaimed Kalganov, brushing aside\nin the most naive way Grushenka's offer to sit with him. They all went to\nlook on. Maximov danced his dance. But it roused no great admiration in\nany one but Mitya. It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping,\nkicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole\nof his foot. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.\n\n\"Thanks. You're tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would you\nlike some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?\"\n\n\"A cigarette.\"\n\n\"Don't you want a drink?\"\n\n\"I'll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?\"\n\n\"Yes, there's a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my dear\nsoul!\"\n\n\"I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!\"\n\n\"No, brother, we've none of that special sort.\"\n\n\"I say,\" the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya's ear. \"That girl\nthere, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to help me make\nfriends with her?\"\n\n\"So that's what you're after! No, brother, that won't do!\"\n\n\"I'd do no harm to any one,\" Maximov muttered disconsolately.\n\n\"Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, you\nknow, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be merry,\nmeanwhile. Don't you want money?\"\n\n\"Later on, perhaps,\" smiled Maximov.\n\n\"All right, all right....\"\n\nMitya's head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony which ran\nround the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the courtyard. The\nfresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark corner, and suddenly\nclutched his head in both hands. His scattered thoughts came together; his\nsensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind. A\nfearful and terrible light! \"If I'm to shoot myself, why not now?\" passed\nthrough his mind. \"Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here,\nin this dark dirty corner, make an end?\" Almost a minute he stood,\nundecided. A few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he was\npursued by disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that blood, that\nblood!... But yet it was easier for him then. Then everything was over: he\nhad lost her, given her up. She was gone, for him--oh, then his death\nsentence had been easier for him; at least it had seemed necessary,\ninevitable, for what had he to stay on earth for?\n\nBut now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at least was\nat an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had vanished,\nleaving no trace. The terrible phantom had turned into something so small,\nso comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in. It would\nnever return. She was ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom she\nloved. Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go on\nliving, he could not; oh, damnation! \"O God! restore to life the man I\nknocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me! Lord, thou\nhast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the old\nman's alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away. I\nwould restore the stolen money. I'd give it back; I'd get it somehow....\nNo trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever! But no,\nno; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!\"\n\nYet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped up and\nran back to the room--to her, to her, his queen for ever! Was not one\nmoment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies of\ndisgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart. \"To her, to her alone,\nto see her, to hear her, to think of nothing, to forget everything, if\nonly for that night, for an hour, for a moment!\" Just as he turned from\nthe balcony into the passage, he came upon the landlord, Trifon\nBorissovitch. He thought he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he had\ncome to find him.\n\n\"What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\" The landlord seemed disconcerted. \"Why should I be looking for\nyou? Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Why do you look so glum? You're not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you shall\nsoon get to bed.... What's the time?\"\n\n\"It'll be three o'clock. Past three, it must be.\"\n\n\"We'll leave off soon. We'll leave off.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it; it doesn't matter. Keep it up as long as you like....\"\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\" Mitya wondered for an instant, and he ran\nback to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was not there. She\nwas not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov asleep on\nthe sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain--she was there. She was sitting\nin the corner, on a trunk. Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bed\nclose by, she was crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobs\nthat she might not be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, and\nwhen he ran to her, she grasped his hand tightly.\n\n\"Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these five\nyears, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him, him!\nIt's a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was only\nseventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to me....\nOr so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it's not the\nsame man. Even his face is not the same; he's different altogether. I\nshouldn't have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was\nthinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we should\nlook at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as\nthough he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to me like\na schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so solemnly that I was\nstruck dumb. I couldn't get a word in. At first I thought he was ashamed\nto talk before his great big Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why\nI couldn't say a word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined\nhim; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed him\nlike that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed\nfor all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!\"\n\nAnd again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya's hand and did\nnot let it go.\n\n\"Mitya, darling, stay, don't go away. I want to say one word to you,\" she\nwhispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. \"Listen, tell me who it is\nI love? I love one man here. Who is that man? That's what you must tell\nme.\"\n\nA smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and her eyes\nshone in the half darkness.\n\n\"A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. 'Fool! that's the man you love!'\nThat was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in and all grew\nbright. What's he afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened; you\ncouldn't speak. It's not them he's afraid of--could you be frightened of\nany one? It's me he's afraid of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you,\nyou little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I'd\nloved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another.\nMitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one\nafter you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love\nme? Do you love me?\" She jumped up and held him with both hands on his\nshoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her eyes, at her face, at\nher smile, and suddenly clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed her\npassionately.\n\n\"You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite I\ntormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of his\nmind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the\nwine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank 'to my\nvile heart.' Mitya, my falcon, why don't you kiss me? He kissed me once,\nand now he draws back and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me,\nkiss me hard, that's right. If you love, well, then, love! I'll be your\nslave now, your slave for the rest of my life. It's sweet to be a slave.\nKiss me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I do\ndeserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won't have that....\" she\nsuddenly thrust him away. \"Go along, Mitya, I'll come and have some wine,\nI want to be drunk, I'm going to get drunk and dance; I must, I must!\" She\ntore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain. Mitya\nfollowed like a drunken man.\n\n\"Yes, come what may--whatever may happen now, for one minute I'd give the\nwhole world,\" he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole glass\nof champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She sat down in\nthe same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her face. Her cheeks\nwere glowing, her lips were burning, her flashing eyes were moist; there\nwas passionate appeal in her eyes. Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart\nand went up to her.\n\n\"Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?\" she said\nthickly. \"I'm drunk now, that's what it is.... And aren't you drunk? And\nwhy isn't Mitya drinking? Why don't you drink, Mitya? I'm drunk, and you\ndon't drink....\"\n\n\"I am drunk! I'm drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I'll be\ndrunk with wine, too.\"\n\nHe drank off another glass, and--he thought it strange himself--that glass\nmade him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although till that\nmoment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that moment\neverything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He walked,\nlaughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was doing. Only one\npersistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, \"like a red-hot\ncoal in his heart,\" he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her,\ngazed at her, listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling\nevery one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When\nthe girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross\nover her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amused\nby the \"little old man,\" as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to\nkiss her hands, \"each little finger,\" and finally he danced another dance\nto an old song, which he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to the\nrefrain:\n\n\n    The little pig says--umph! umph! umph!\n    The little calf says--moo, moo, moo,\n    The little duck says--quack, quack, quack,\n    The little goose says--ga, ga, ga.\n    The hen goes strutting through the porch;\n    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say,\n    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she'll say!\n\n\n\"Give him something, Mitya,\" said Grushenka. \"Give him a present, he's\npoor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I shall\ngo into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something to\nme to-day that I shall remember all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let us\ndance. To-morrow to the nunnery, but to-day we'll dance. I want to play\nto-day, good people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God,\nI'd forgive every one: 'My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive\nyou.' I'm going to beg forgiveness: 'Forgive me, good people, a silly\nwench.' I'm a beast, that's what I am. But I want to pray. I gave a little\nonion. Wicked as I've been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them dance, don't\nstop them. Every one in the world is good. Every one--even the worst of\nthem. The world's a nice place. Though we're bad the world's all right.\nWe're good and bad, good and bad.... Come, tell me, I've something to ask\nyou: come here every one, and I'll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I\nam good. I'm very good.... Come, why am I so good?\"\n\nSo Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last she\nannounced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her chair,\nstaggering. \"Mitya, don't give me any more wine--if I ask you, don't give\nit to me. Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's going round, the stove,\nand everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance ... let\nthem see how beautifully I dance....\"\n\nShe really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her\npocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave it in the\ndance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to break\ninto a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov, hearing that Grushenka\nwanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front of\nher, humming:\n\n\n    With legs so slim and sides so trim\n    And its little tail curled tight.\n\n\nBut Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.\n\n\"Sh-h! Mitya, why don't they come? Let every one come ... to look on. Call\nthem in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in? Tell them\nI'm going to dance. Let them look on, too....\"\n\nMitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began knocking\nto the Poles with his fist.\n\n\"Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she's going to dance. She calls you.\"\n\n\"_Lajdak!_\" one of the Poles shouted in reply.\n\n\"You're a _lajdak_ yourself! You're a little scoundrel, that's what you\nare.\"\n\n\"Leave off laughing at Poland,\" said Kalganov sententiously. He too was\ndrunk.\n\n\"Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn't mean that I called\nall Poland so. One _lajdak_ doesn't make a Poland. Be quiet, my pretty\nboy, eat a sweetmeat.\"\n\n\"Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won't they make\nfriends?\" said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke into\n\"Ah, my porch, my new porch!\" Grushenka flung back her head, half opened\nher lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief, and suddenly, with a violent\nlurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking bewildered.\n\n\"I'm weak....\" she said in an exhausted voice. \"Forgive me.... I'm weak, I\ncan't.... I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.\n\n\"I'm sorry.... Forgive me....\"\n\n\"The lady's been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,\" voices were\nheard saying.\n\n\"The lady's drunk too much,\" Maximov explained to the girls, giggling.\n\n\"Mitya, lead me away ... take me,\" said Grushenka helplessly. Mitya\npounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the precious\nburden through the curtains.\n\n\"Well, now I'll go,\" thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue room,\nhe closed the two halves of the door after him. But the orgy in the larger\nroom went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed\nand kissed her on the lips.\n\n\"Don't touch me....\" she faltered, in an imploring voice. \"Don't touch me,\ntill I'm yours.... I've told you I'm yours, but don't touch me ... spare\nme.... With them here, with them close, you mustn't. He's here. It's nasty\nhere....\"\n\n\"I'll obey you! I won't think of it ... I worship you!\" muttered Mitya.\n\"Yes, it's nasty here, it's abominable.\"\n\nAnd still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.\n\n\"I know, though you're a brute, you're generous,\" Grushenka articulated\nwith difficulty. \"It must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for the\nfuture ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but good ...\ntake me away, take me far away, do you hear? I don't want it to be here,\nbut far, far away....\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, it must be!\" said Mitya, pressing her in his arms. \"I'll\ntake you and we'll fly away.... Oh, I'd give my whole life for one year\nonly to know about that blood!\"\n\n\"What blood?\" asked Grushenka, bewildered.\n\n\"Nothing,\" muttered Mitya, through his teeth. \"Grusha, you wanted to be\nhonest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from Katya.... Disgrace, a\ndisgrace!\"\n\n\"From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it. Give it her\nback, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is\nyours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like us\nare bound to waste money. But we'd better go and work the land. I want to\ndig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha said\nso. I won't be your mistress, I'll be faithful to you, I'll be your slave,\nI'll work for you. We'll go to the young lady and bow down to her\ntogether, so that she may forgive us, and then we'll go away. And if she\nwon't forgive us, we'll go, anyway. Take her her money and love me....\nDon't love her.... Don't love her any more. If you love her, I shall\nstrangle her.... I'll put out both her eyes with a needle....\"\n\n\"I love you. I love only you. I'll love you in Siberia....\"\n\n\"Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care ... we'll\nwork ... there's snow in Siberia.... I love driving in the snow ... and\nmust have bells.... Do you hear, there's a bell ringing? Where is that\nbell ringing? There are people coming.... Now it's stopped.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an instant.\nThere had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance, but the\nringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast. He did not\nnotice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice that the songs\nhad ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there was\nabsolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened her eyes.\n\n\"What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I've been asleep and\ndreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was with\nsome one I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was holding you and\nkissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow glistened....\nYou know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines. It was as\nthough I was not on earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How\nsweet that is!...\"\n\n\"Close to you,\" murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom, her hands.\nAnd suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him that she was looking\nstraight before her, not at him, not into his face, but over his head,\nwith an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An expression of wonder, almost of\nalarm, came suddenly into her face.\n\n\"Mitya, who is that looking at us?\" she whispered.\n\nMitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains and\nseemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.\n\nHe jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.\n\n\"Here, come to us, come here,\" said a voice, speaking not loudly, but\nfirmly and peremptorily.\n\nMitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still. The\nroom was filled with people, but not those who had been there before. An\ninstantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered. He recognized\nall those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the overcoat and\nforage-cap with a cockade--was the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. And\nthat \"consumptive-looking\" trim dandy, \"who always has such polished\nboots\"--that was the deputy prosecutor. \"He has a chronometer worth four\nhundred roubles; he showed it to me.\" And that small young man in\nspectacles.... Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had seen him:\nhe was the \"investigating lawyer,\" from the \"school of jurisprudence,\" who\nhad only lately come to the town. And this man--the inspector of police,\nMavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well. And those fellows with the\nbrass plates on, why are they here? And those other two ... peasants....\nAnd there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....\n\n\"Gentlemen! What's this for, gentlemen?\" began Mitya, but suddenly, as\nthough beside himself, not knowing what he was doing, he cried aloud, at\nthe top of his voice:\n\n\"I un--der--stand!\"\n\nThe young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up to\nMitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:\n\n\"We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to the\nsofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.\"\n\n\"The old man!\" cried Mitya frantically. \"The old man and his blood!... I\nunderstand.\"\n\nAnd he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had been mown\ndown by a scythe.\n\n\"You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your father's\nblood cries out against you!\" the old captain of police roared suddenly,\nstepping up to Mitya.\n\nHe was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.\n\n\"This is impossible!\" cried the small young man. \"Mihail Makarovitch,\nMihail Makarovitch, this won't do!... I beg you'll allow me to speak. I\nshould never have expected such behavior from you....\"\n\n\"This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,\" cried the captain of\npolice; \"look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company of a\ndisreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his hands.... It's\ndelirium!...\"\n\n\"I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your\nfeelings,\" the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police\ncaptain, \"or I shall be forced to resort to--\"\n\nBut the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to Mitya, and\ndelivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:\n\n\"Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are charged\nwith the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, perpetrated\nthis night....\"\n\nHe said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, but\nthough Mitya heard them he did not understand them. He stared at them all\nwith wild eyes.\n\n\n\n\nBook IX. The Preliminary Investigation\n\n\n\nChapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotin's Official Career\n\n\nPyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates\nof the widow Morozov's house, ended, of course, by making himself heard.\nFenya, who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before,\nand too much \"upset\" to go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on\nhearing the furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen him\ndrive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking\nagain, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the house-porter,\nwho had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring him\nnot to open it. But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he\nwanted to see Fenya on very \"important business,\" the man made up his mind\nat last to open. Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya's kitchen, but the\ngirl begged him to allow the house-porter to be present, \"because of her\nmisgivings.\" He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital\nfact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for\nGrushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he\nreturned, the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with\nblood.\n\n\"And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!\" Fenya\nkept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of her\ndisordered imagination. But although not \"dripping,\" Pyotr Ilyitch had\nhimself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash them.\nMoreover, the question he had to decide was not how soon the blood had\ndried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather,\nwhether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, and how he could\nsatisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this\npoint, and though he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away a\nconviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his\nfather's house, and that therefore something must have happened there.\n\n\"And when he came back,\" Fenya added with excitement, \"I told him the\nwhole story, and then I began asking him, 'Why have you got blood on your\nhands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?' and he answered that that was human blood,\nand that he had just killed some one. He confessed it all to me, and\nsuddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking, where's he\nrun off to now like a madman? He'll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my\nmistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running to his\nlodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov's shop, and saw him just setting off,\nand there was no blood on his hands then.\" (Fenya had noticed this and\nremembered it.) Fenya's old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far as\nshe was capable. After asking some further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left\nthe house, even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.\n\nThe most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to go\nstraight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, to find out whether anything had happened\nthere, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain, as Pyotr\nIlyitch firmly intended doing, when he had satisfied himself of the fact.\nBut the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch's gates were strong, and he\nwould have to knock again. His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of\nthe slightest, and what if, after he had been knocking, they opened to\nhim, and nothing had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way\nwould go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called\nPerhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one had killed\nhim. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded\nmore than anything in the world.\n\nYet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he stamped\nhis foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not to Fyodor\nPavlovitch's but to Madame Hohlakov's. He decided that if she denied\nhaving just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he would go\nstraight to the police captain, but if she admitted having given him the\nmoney, he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning.\n\nIt is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of\ncausing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night to a fashionable lady,\na complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her an\namazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that is just how\nit is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one, with the\ndecisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was by\nno means phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all his life how a\nhaunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him, growing more and\nmore painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursing\nhimself, of course, all the way for going to this lady, but \"I will get to\nthe bottom of it, I will!\" he repeated for the tenth time, grinding his\nteeth, and he carried out his intention.\n\nIt was exactly eleven o'clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov's house. He\nwas admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his inquiry\nwhether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer, except\nthat she was usually in bed by that time.\n\n\"Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, she'll\nreceive you. If she won't, she won't.\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The footman\nwas unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid. Pyotr\nIlyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that an\nofficial, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on particular\nbusiness, and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would not\nhave ventured to come. \"Tell her in those words, in those words exactly,\"\nhe asked the girl.\n\nShe went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov herself\nwas already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt upset ever\nsince Mitya's visit, and had a presentiment that she would not get through\nthe night without the sick headache which always, with her, followed such\nexcitement. She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.\nShe irritably declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at\nsuch an hour, of an \"official living in the town,\" who was a total\nstranger, roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr\nIlyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to\ntake another message in these very words:\n\n\"That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that Madame\nHohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to see him\nnow.\"\n\n\"I plunged headlong,\" he described it afterwards.\n\nThe maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again.\nMadame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he looked\nlike, and learned that he was \"very well dressed, young and so polite.\" We\nmay note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking\nyoung man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to\nsee him. She was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a black\nshawl over her shoulders. \"The official\" was asked to walk into the\ndrawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly\nbefore. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiring\ncountenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once with the\nquestion:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our common\nacquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,\" Perhotin began.\n\nBut he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady's face showed signs of\nacute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a fury:\n\n\"How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?\" she cried\nhysterically. \"How dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a lady\nwho is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And to\nforce yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this very\ndrawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out of\nthe room, as no one would go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir,\nthat I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass.\nKindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I--\"\n\n\"Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?\"\n\n\"Why, has he killed somebody else?\" Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively.\n\n\"If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll explain it all\nin a couple of words,\" answered Perhotin, firmly. \"At five o'clock this\nafternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I know for\na fact he had no money. Yet at nine o'clock, he came to see me with a\nbundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, about two or three thousand\nroubles. His hands and face were all covered with blood, and he looked\nlike a madman. When I asked him where he had got so much money, he\nanswered that he had just received it from you, that you had given him a\nsum of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....\"\n\nMadame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and painful\nexcitement.\n\n\"Good God! He must have killed his old father!\" she cried, clasping her\nhands. \"I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don't say\nanother word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for a\nfact that you did not give him any money?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, I didn't! I refused to give it him, for he could not\nappreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but I\nslipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from you\nnow, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are we\nstanding? Ah, sit down.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, I....\"\n\n\"Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an awful\ndeath!\"\n\n\"But if he has killed him already?\"\n\n\"Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think we\nmust do now?\"\n\nMeantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself, facing\nhim. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her the history of\nthe affair, that part of it at least which he had himself witnessed. He\ndescribed, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her about the pestle. All\nthese details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who\nkept uttering shrieks, and covering her face with her hands....\n\n\"Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty,\nwhatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've looked at that awful\nman and always thought, that man will end by murdering me. And now it's\nhappened ... that is, if he hasn't murdered me, but only his own father,\nit's only because the finger of God preserved me, and what's more, he was\nashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from\nthe relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to think\nhow near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him and he\nstretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you\nsaid your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don't believe in miracles, but that\nikon and this unmistakable miracle with me now--that shakes me, and I'm\nready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about Father\nZossima?... But I don't know what I'm saying ... and only fancy, with the\nikon on his neck he spat at me.... He only spat, it's true, he didn't\nmurder me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we do\nnow? What do you think?\"\n\nPyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight to the\npolice captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do what he\nthought fit.\n\n\"Oh, he's an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I know him. Of\ncourse, he's the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr Ilyitch!\nHow well you've thought of everything! I should never have thought of it\nin your place!\"\n\n\"Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,\" observed Pyotr\nIlyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious to escape\nas quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not let him say\ngood-by and go away.\n\n\"And be sure, be sure,\" she prattled on, \"to come back and tell me what\nyou see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... how\nthey'll try him ... and what he's condemned to.... Tell me, we have no\ncapital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it's at three\no'clock at night, at four, at half-past four.... Tell them to wake me, to\nwake me, to shake me, if I don't get up.... But, good heavens, I shan't\nsleep! But wait, hadn't I better come with you?\"\n\n\"N--no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating that\nyou did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be of use\n... in case it's needed....\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau. \"And you\nknow I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense in\nsuch affairs. Are you in the service here? I'm delighted to think that\nyou're in the service here!\"\n\nAnd still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the\nfollowing lines:\n\n\n    I've never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri\n    Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy),\n    three thousand roubles to-day. I've never given him money, never:\n    That I swear by all that's holy!\n\n    K. HOHLAKOV.\n\n\n\"Here's the note!\" she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. \"Go, save him.\nIt's a noble deed on your part!\"\n\nAnd she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran out to\naccompany him to the passage.\n\n\"How grateful I am to you! You can't think how grateful I am to you for\nhaving come to me, first. How is it I haven't met you before? I shall feel\nflattered at seeing you at my house in the future. How delightful it is\nthat you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical ability!...\nThey must appreciate you, they must understand you. If there's anything I\ncan do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! I'm in love with young\npeople! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country.\nHer one hope.... Oh, go, go!...\"\n\nBut Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let him go so\nsoon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him,\nwhich had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such an\nunpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all know. \"She's by no means so\nelderly,\" he thought, feeling pleased, \"on the contrary I should have\ntaken her for her daughter.\"\n\nAs for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young man. \"Such\nsense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all that with\nsuch manners and appearance! People say the young people of to-day are no\ngood for anything, but here's an example!\" etc. So she simply forgot this\n\"dreadful affair,\" and it was only as she was getting into bed, that,\nsuddenly recalling \"how near death she had been,\" she exclaimed: \"Ah, it\nis awful, awful!\"\n\nBut she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.\n\nI would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details,\nif this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no means\nelderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of the\nwhole career of that practical and precise young man. His story is\nremembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I shall perhaps\nhave something to say about it, when I have finished my long history of\nthe Brothers Karamazov.\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Alarm\n\n\nOur police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired lieutenant-\ncolonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only come to us three\nyears previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly because he \"knew how\nto keep society together.\" He was never without visitors, and could not\nhave got on without them. Some one or other was always dining with him; he\nnever sat down to table without guests. He gave regular dinners, too, on\nall sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though the fare\nwas not _recherche_, it was abundant. The fish-pies were excellent, and\nthe wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.\n\nThe first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room, with\npictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls, an\nessential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor's billiard-room.\nThere was card-playing every evening at his house, if only at one table.\nBut at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the mammas\nand young ladies, assembled at his house to dance. Though Mihail\nMakarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone. His widowed daughter\nlived with him, with her two unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who had\nfinished their education. They were of agreeable appearance and lively\ncharacter, and though every one knew they would have no dowry, they\nattracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfather's house.\n\nMihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work, though he\nperformed his duties no worse than many others. To speak plainly, he was a\nman of rather narrow education. His understanding of the limits of his\nadministrative power could not always be relied upon. It was not so much\nthat he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign,\nas that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them. This\nwas not from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for\nhe was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.\n\n\"I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,\" he used to say\nof himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamental\nprinciples of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs,\nand only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year, involuntarily\nincreasing his knowledge by practice. And yet he was himself a landowner.\nPyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he would meet some of Mihail\nMakarovitch's visitors there that evening, but he didn't know which. As it\nhappened, at that moment the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district\ndoctor, a young man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after\ntaking a brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist\nat the police captain's. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was\nreally the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),\nwas rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined to be\nconsumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He was vain and\nirritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a kind heart. It\nseemed that all that was wrong with him was that he had a better opinion\nof himself than his ability warranted. And that made him seem constantly\nuneasy. He had, moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards\npsychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a special\nknowledge of the criminal and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this\nground, considering that he had been passed over in the service, and being\nfirmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properly\nappreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to give\nup his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected\nKaramazov case agitated him profoundly: \"It was a case that might well be\ntalked about all over Russia.\" But I am anticipating.\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who had\nonly come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next room\nwith the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards and wondered that\nall the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the evening of \"the\ncrime\" have been gathered together at the house of the executive\nauthority. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch's wife had had toothache for the last two days, and\nhe was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor, from the\nvery nature of his being, could not spend an evening except at cards.\nNikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days past to\ndrop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch's, so to speak casually, so as\nslyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showing\nthat he knew her secret, that he knew it was her birthday, and that she\nwas trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give a\ndance. He anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests about\nher age, and her being afraid to reveal it, about his knowing her secret\nand telling everybody, and so on. The charming young man was a great adept\nat such teasing; the ladies had christened him \"the naughty man,\" and he\nseemed to be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however,\nof good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of\npleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He was\nshort, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he\nalways wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his\nofficial duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though\nrealizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him.\nHe had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the\npeasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their respect,\nhe certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.\n\nPyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police\ncaptain's. He saw instantly that every one knew. They had positively\nthrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even Nikolay\nParfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous and\nready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news that old\nFyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his own house,\nmurdered and robbed. The news had only just reached them in the following\nmanner.\n\nMarfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senseless\nnear the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might well have slept\ntill morning after the draught she had taken. But, all of a sudden she\nwaked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov,\nwho was lying in the next room unconscious. That scream always preceded\nhis fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could never\nget accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov's\nroom. But it was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginning\nto gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out and was\ngoing to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when she had got up,\nhe was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the bedstead and began\ngroping with her hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he must have\ngone out--where? She ran to the steps and timidly called him. She got no\nanswer, of course, but she caught the sound of groans far away in the\ngarden in the darkness. She listened. The groans were repeated, and it was\nevident they came from the garden.\n\n\"Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!\" she thought\ndistractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate into\nthe garden was open.\n\n\"He must be out there, poor dear,\" she thought. She went up to the gate\nand all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her by name, \"Marfa!\nMarfa!\" in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.\n\n\"Lord, preserve us from harm!\" Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran towards\nthe voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she found him not by\nthe fence where he had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. It\nappeared later, that he had crawled away on coming to himself, and\nprobably had been a long time getting so far, losing consciousness several\ntimes. She noticed at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at\nthe top of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:\n\n\"He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream, silly ... run ...\nfetch some one....\"\n\nBut Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master's window was\nopen and that there was a candle alight in the window, she ran there and\nbegan calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in at the window, she saw a\nfearful sight. Her master was lying on his back, motionless, on the floor.\nHis light-colored dressing-gown and white shirt were soaked with blood.\nThe candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless\ndead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from\nthe window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran\nheadlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both mother\nand daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa's desperate and\npersistent screaming and knocking at the shutter. Marfa, shrieking and\nscreaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg for\nassistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his wanderings and\nwas staying the night with them. They got him up immediately and all three\nran to the scene of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered\nthat at about eight o'clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,\nand this was no doubt Grigory's scream, \"Parricide!\" uttered when he\ncaught hold of Mitya's leg.\n\n\"Some one person screamed out and then was silent,\" Marya Kondratyevna\nexplained as she ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the two\nwomen with the help of Foma carried him to the lodge. They lighted a\ncandle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he was writhing in\nconvulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing from\nhis lips. They moistened Grigory's forehead with water mixed with vinegar,\nand the water revived him at once. He asked immediately:\n\n\"Is the master murdered?\"\n\nThen Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that not\nonly the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open, though\nFyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every night and\ndid not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext. Seeing that door\nopen, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch \"for fear anything\nshould happen afterwards.\" And when they returned to Grigory, the old man\ntold them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ran\nthere and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain's. She\narrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story came,\nnot as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation, by a\nwitness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the criminal (a\ntheory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe till that\nmoment).\n\nIt was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector of the\ntown was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitch's\nhouse and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regular\nforms, which I will not go into here. The district doctor, a zealous man,\nnew to his work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, the\nprosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.\n\nI will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead,\nwith his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with the same\nweapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that weapon\nwas found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at once\ngiven, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knocked\ndown. They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass\npestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There were\nno signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. But\nby the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and\nthick envelope with the inscription: \"A present of three thousand roubles\nfor my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.\" And below had been\nadded by Fyodor Pavlovitch, \"For my little chicken.\" There were three\nseals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open and\nwas empty: the money had been removed. They found also on the floor a\npiece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up.\n\nOne piece of Pyotr Ilyitch's evidence made a great impression on the\nprosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that Dmitri\nFyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved to\ndo so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded them\nbefore him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc. When Pyotr\nIlyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell some\none so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: \"You'll be\ntoo late.\" So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before\nhe really did shoot himself.\n\n\"That's clear, that's clear!\" repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.\n\"That's just the way with mad fellows like that: 'I shall kill myself to-\nmorrow, so I'll make merry till I die!' \"\n\nThe story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the\nprosecutor more than ever.\n\n\"Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev,\ngentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair curled,\nand then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his hand in\nthe same way, he went off to the girls.\"\n\nAll were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the\nformalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took time and\nso, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer of\nthe rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in the\ntown the morning before to get his pay. He was instructed to avoid raising\nthe alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the\n\"criminal\" till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also\nwitnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on. Mavriky\nMavrikyevitch did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving no\none but his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of\nhis secret business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met the\nlandlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at once\na change in Trifon Borissovitch's face and voice. So neither Mitya nor any\none else knew that he was being watched. The box with the pistols had been\ncarried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. Only after\nfour o'clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain,\nthe prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each\ndrawn by three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch's to make\na post-mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly interested in\nthe condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.\n\n\"Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for\ntwenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to\nscience,\" he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they left\nthey laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor and the\ninvestigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor's saying that\nSmerdyakov could not outlive the night.\n\nAfter these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to\nthat moment of our tale at which we broke off.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First Ordeal\n\n\nAnd so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not understanding\nwhat was said to him. Suddenly he got up, flung up his hands, and shouted\naloud:\n\n\"I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty of that blood! I'm not guilty of my\nfather's blood.... I meant to kill him. But I'm not guilty. Not I.\"\n\nBut he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind the\ncurtain and flung herself at the police captain's feet.\n\n\"It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!\" she cried, in a heartrending\nvoice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands towards them. \"He\ndid it through me. I tortured him and drove him to it. I tortured that\npoor old man that's dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him to this!\nIt's my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!\"\n\n\"Yes, it's your fault! You're the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!\nYou're the most to blame!\" shouted the police captain, threatening her\nwith his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed. The\nprosecutor positively seized hold of him.\n\n\"This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!\" he cried. \"You are\npositively hindering the inquiry.... You're ruining the case....\" he\nalmost gasped.\n\n\"Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course!\" cried Nikolay\nParfenovitch, fearfully excited too, \"otherwise it's absolutely\nimpossible!...\"\n\n\"Judge us together!\" Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling. \"Punish\nus together. I will go with him now, if it's to death!\"\n\n\"Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!\" Mitya fell on his knees beside\nher and held her tight in his arms. \"Don't believe her,\" he cried, \"she's\nnot guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!\"\n\nHe remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her by\nseveral men, and that she was led out, and that when he recovered himself\nhe was sitting at the table. Beside him and behind him stood the men with\nmetal plates. Facing him on the other side of the table sat Nikolay\nParfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink a\nlittle water out of a glass that stood on the table.\n\n\"That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don't be frightened,\"\nhe added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it afterwards) became\nsuddenly intensely interested in his big rings, one with an amethyst, and\nanother with a transparent bright yellow stone, of great brilliance. And\nlong afterwards he remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted his\nattention through all those terrible hours of interrogation, so that he\nwas utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as\nthings that had nothing to do with his position. On Mitya's left side, in\nthe place where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening,\nthe prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya's right hand, where Grushenka\nhad been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting-jacket,\nwith ink and paper before him. This was the secretary of the investigating\nlawyer, who had brought him with him. The police captain was now standing\nby the window at the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was\nsitting there.\n\n\"Drink some water,\" said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenth\ntime.\n\n\"I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush me,\npunish me, decide my fate!\" cried Mitya, staring with terribly fixed wide-\nopen eyes at the investigating lawyer.\n\n\"So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your\nfather, Fyodor Pavlovitch?\" asked the investigating lawyer, softly but\ninsistently.\n\n\"I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not of\nmy father's. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the old man and knocked\nhim down.... But it's hard to have to answer for that murder with another,\na terrible murder of which I am not guilty.... It's a terrible accusation,\ngentlemen, a knock-down blow. But who has killed my father, who has killed\nhim? Who can have killed him if I didn't? It's marvelous, extraordinary,\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, who can have killed him?\" the investigating lawyer was beginning,\nbut Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him, addressed\nMitya.\n\n\"You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory Vassilyevitch.\nHe is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible blows\ninflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by you, there seems no\ndoubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at least.\"\n\n\"Alive? He's alive?\" cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His face beamed.\n\"Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a sinner and\nevildoer. That's an answer to my prayer. I've been praying all night.\" And\nhe crossed himself three times. He was almost breathless.\n\n\"So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence concerning\nyou, that--\" The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya suddenly jumped\nup from his chair.\n\n\"One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run to her--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch\nalmost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was seized by the men\nwith the metal plates, but he sat down of his own accord....\n\n\"Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute only; I wanted\nto tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone, that blood that was\nweighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a murderer now!\nGentlemen, she is my betrothed!\" he said ecstatically and reverently,\nlooking round at them all. \"Oh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute\nyou have given me new life, new heart!... That old man used to carry me in\nhis arms, gentlemen. He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three\nyears old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...\"\n\n\"And so you--\" the investigating lawyer began.\n\n\"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,\" interposed Mitya, putting\nhis elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands. \"Let me have\na moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is horribly\nupsetting, horribly. A man is not a drum, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Drink a little more water,\" murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\nMitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were confident.\nHe seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole bearing was\nchanged; he was once more the equal of these men, with all of whom he was\nacquainted, as though they had all met the day before, when nothing had\nhappened, at some social gathering. We may note in passing that, on his\nfirst arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captain's,\nbut later, during the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at\nall, and when the police captain met him, in the street, for instance,\nMitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. His\nacquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimes\npaid his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without\nquite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had, for\nsome reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not had time\nto get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had met him and talked\nto him twice, each time about the fair sex.\n\n\"You're a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,\" cried Mitya,\nlaughing gayly, \"but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen, I feel like a new\nman, and don't be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly.\nI'm rather drunk, too, I'll tell you that frankly. I believe I've had the\nhonor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman\nMiuesov's. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't pretend to be on equal terms with\nyou. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before you.\nOh, of course, there's a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if\nGrigory has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! It's awful, awful, I\nunderstand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will make\nan end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen! Since I know\nI'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute. Can't we? Can't we?\"\n\nMitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though he\npositively took his listeners to be his best friends.\n\n\"So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the charge\nbrought against you,\" said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively, and bending\ndown to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what to write.\n\n\"Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I consent, I\ngive my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay, stay, write\nthis. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of violence on a poor old man I\nam guilty. And there is something else at the bottom of my heart, of which\nI am guilty, too--but that you need not write down\" (he turned suddenly to\nthe secretary); \"that's my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn't concern\nyou, the bottom of my heart, that's to say.... But of the murder of my old\nfather I'm not guilty. That's a wild idea. It's quite a wild idea!... I\nwill prove you that and you'll be convinced directly.... You will laugh,\ngentlemen. You'll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!...\"\n\n\"Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" said the investigating lawyer evidently\ntrying to allay Mitya's excitement by his own composure. \"Before we go on\nwith our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to hear\nyou confirm the statement that you disliked your father, Fyodor\nPavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him. Here at\nleast, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill\nhim: 'I didn't kill him,' you said, 'but I wanted to kill him.' \"\n\n\"Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I did\nwant to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily, unhappily!\"\n\n\"You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives precisely led\nyou to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?\"\n\n\"What is there to explain, gentlemen?\" Mitya shrugged his shoulders\nsullenly, looking down. \"I have never concealed my feelings. All the town\nknows about it--every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I declared them\nin Father Zossima's cell.... And the very same day, in the evening I beat\nmy father. I nearly killed him, and I swore I'd come again and kill him,\nbefore witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud\nfor the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares you in\nthe face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,\nfeelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen\"--Mitya frowned--\"it seems\nto me that about feelings you've no right to question me. I know that you\nare bound by your office, I quite understand that, but that's my affair,\nmy private, intimate affair, yet ... since I haven't concealed my feelings\nin the past ... in the tavern, for instance, I've talked to every one, so\n... so I won't make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,\nthat there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every\none that I'd kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he's been killed. So it\nmust have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can\nquite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap myself, for who can have\nmurdered him, if not I? That's what it comes to, isn't it? If not I, who\ncan it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on knowing!\" he\nexclaimed suddenly. \"Where was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and\nwith what? Tell me,\" he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.\n\n\"We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his head\nbattered in,\" said the prosecutor.\n\n\"That's horrible!\" Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the table,\nhid his face in his right hand.\n\n\"We will continue,\" interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. \"So what was it that\nimpelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in public, I\nbelieve, that it was based upon jealousy?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.\"\n\n\"Disputes about money?\"\n\n\"Yes, about money, too.\"\n\n\"There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which you\nclaimed as part of your inheritance?\"\n\n\"Three thousand! More, more,\" cried Mitya hotly; \"more than six thousand,\nmore than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at them. But I\nmade up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was desperately in need\nof that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes for three thousand that\nI knew he kept under his pillow, ready for Grushenka, I considered as\nsimply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own\nproperty....\"\n\nThe prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and had\ntime to wink at him on the sly.\n\n\"We will return to that subject later,\" said the lawyer promptly. \"You\nwill allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked upon\nthat money as your own property?\"\n\n\"Write it down, by all means. I know that's another fact that tells\nagainst me, but I'm not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself. Do\nyou hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort of man\nfrom what I am,\" he added, suddenly gloomy and dejected. \"You have to deal\nwith a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above all--don't lose\nsight of it--a man who's done a lot of nasty things, but has always been,\nand still is, honorable at bottom, in his inner being. I don't know how to\nexpress it. That's just what's made me wretched all my life, that I\nyearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of\nhonor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and\nyet all my life I've been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemen\n... that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!...\nGentlemen, my head aches ...\" His brows contracted with pain. \"You see,\ngentlemen, I couldn't bear the look of him, there was something in him\nignoble, impudent, trampling on everything sacred, something sneering and\nirreverent, loathsome, loathsome. But now that he's dead, I feel\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't feel differently, but I wish I hadn't hated him so.\"\n\n\"You feel penitent?\"\n\n\"No, not penitent, don't write that. I'm not much good myself, I'm not\nvery beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive. That's what I\nmean. Write that down, if you like.\"\n\nSaying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more gloomy\nas the inquiry continued.\n\nAt that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka had\nbeen removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next but\none from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It was a\nlittle room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they had\ndanced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her\nbut Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her\nside, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants with\na metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her grief\nwas too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her arms and, with a loud\nwail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him, to her Mitya, and so\nunexpectedly that they had not time to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry,\ntrembled, jumped up, and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, not\nknowing what he was doing. But they were not allowed to come together,\nthough they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled, and\ntried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold him. She was\nseized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms to him, crying aloud as\nthey carried her away. When the scene was over, he came to himself again,\nsitting in the same place as before, opposite the investigating lawyer,\nand crying out to them:\n\n\"What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She's done nothing,\nnothing!...\"\n\nThe lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like this. At\nlast Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into the\nroom, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor:\n\n\"She's been removed, she's downstairs. Will you allow me to say one word\nto this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in your\npresence.\"\n\n\"By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,\" answered the investigating lawyer. \"In\nthe present case we have nothing against it.\"\n\n\"Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,\" began the police captain,\nand there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the luckless\nprisoner on his excited face. \"I took your Agrafena Alexandrovna\ndownstairs myself, and confided her to the care of the landlord's\ndaughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her all the time. And I\nsoothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed her. I impressed on her\nthat you have to clear yourself, so she mustn't hinder you, must not\ndepress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your\nevidence. In fact, I talked to her and she understood. She's a sensible\ngirl, my boy, a good-hearted girl, she would have kissed my old hands,\nbegging help for you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about\nher. And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you are\ncalm and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?\nI was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you,\nshe's a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So what am I to tell\nher, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet or not?\"\n\nThe good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular, but\nGrushenka's suffering, a fellow creature's suffering, touched his good-\nnatured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped up and rushed\ntowards him.\n\n\"Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!\" he cried. \"You've the\nheart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her. I\nwill, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in the kindness of your\nheart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be laughing in a\nminute, knowing that she has a guardian angel like you. I shall have done\nwith all this directly, and as soon as I'm free, I'll be with her, she'll\nsee, let her wait. Gentlemen,\" he said, turning to the two lawyers, \"now\nI'll open my whole soul to you; I'll pour out everything. We'll finish\nthis off directly, finish it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end,\nshan't we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me\ntell you that. That one thing I'll tell you now.... I see I'm with\nhonorable men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you knew!\nDid you hear her cry, 'I'll go to death with you'? And what have I, a\npenniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for me? How can a clumsy,\nugly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she is\nready to go to exile with me? And how she fell down at your feet for my\nsake, just now!... and yet she's proud and has done nothing! How can I\nhelp adoring her, how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did\njust now? Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.\"\n\nAnd he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands, burst\ninto tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered himself instantly. The\nold police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers also. They felt\nthat the examination was passing into a new phase. When the police captain\nwent out, Mitya was positively gay.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal. And if\nit were not for all these trivial details, we should understand one\nanother in a minute. I'm at those details again. I'm at your disposal,\ngentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in me\nand I in you, or there'll be no end to it. I speak in your interests. To\nbusiness, gentlemen, to business, and don't rummage in my soul; don't\ntease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what matters, and I\nwill satisfy you at once. And damn the details!\"\n\nSo spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Second Ordeal\n\n\n\"You don't know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by your\nreadiness to answer,\" said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air, and\nobvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent, short-sighted, light\ngray eyes, from which he had removed his spectacles a moment before. \"And\nyou have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence, without\nwhich it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such\nimportance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend\nhimself and is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everything\nin our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case.\nYou approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?\" He turned to the prosecutor.\n\n\"Oh, undoubtedly,\" replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat cold,\ncompared with Nikolay Parfenovitch's impulsiveness.\n\nI will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but lately\narrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit\nKirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his bosom friend. He\nwas almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit\nKirillovitch's extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in\nthe justice of his grievance. He had heard of him in Petersburg. On the\nother hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the whole\nworld whom our \"unappreciated\" prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way to\nMokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case.\nAnd now as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and\ninterpreted every indication on his senior colleague's face--half a word, a\nglance, or a wink.\n\n\"Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don't interrupt me with\ntrivial questions and I'll tell you everything in a moment,\" said Mitya\nexcitedly.\n\n\"Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your\ncommunication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of\ngreat interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at\nabout five o'clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend,\nPyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.\"\n\n\"I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more?\nThat's all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.\"\n\n\"You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn't you know?\"\n\nThe prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.\n\n\"Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic\ndescription of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards? Allow us,\nfor instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and just when\nyou left and when you came back--all those facts.\"\n\n\"You should have asked me like that from the beginning,\" cried Mitya,\nlaughing aloud, \"and, if you like, we won't begin from yesterday, but from\nthe morning of the day before; then you'll understand how, why, and where\nI went. I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the\ntown, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe\nsecurity. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.\"\n\n\"Allow me to interrupt you,\" the prosecutor put in politely. \"Why were you\nin such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?\"\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen, you needn't go into details, how, when and why, and why\njust so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole. Why, it'll\nrun to three volumes, and then you'll want an epilogue!\"\n\nMitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of a\nman who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best\nintentions.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\"--he corrected himself hurriedly--\"don't be vexed with me for my\nrestiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more, I feel the greatest\nrespect for you and understand the true position of affairs. Don't think\nI'm drunk. I'm quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk would be no\nhindrance. It's with me, you know, like the saying: 'When he is sober, he\nis a fool; when he is drunk, he is a wise man.' Ha ha! But I see,\ngentlemen, it's not the proper thing to make jokes to you, till we've had\nour explanation, I mean. And I've my own dignity to keep up, too. I quite\nunderstand the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position\nof a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And it's\nyour business to watch me. I can't expect you to pat me on the head for\nwhat I did to Grigory, for one can't break old men's heads with impunity.\nI suppose you'll put me away for him for six months, or a year perhaps, in\na house of correction. I don't know what the punishment is--but it will be\nwithout loss of the rights of my rank, without loss of my rank, won't it?\nSo you see, gentlemen, I understand the distinction between us.... But you\nmust see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions. 'How did\nyou step? Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did you\nstep?' I shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it\nall down against me. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even if\nit's nonsense I'm talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being\nmen of honor and refinement, will forgive me! I'll finish by asking you,\ngentlemen, to drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean,\nbeginning from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for\nbreakfast, how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention\nof the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, 'Whom\ndid you murder? Whom did you rob?' Ha ha! That's your regulation method,\nthat's where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off their\nguard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. I've been in the service,\ntoo. Ha ha ha! You're not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?\"\nhe cried, looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising.\n\"It's only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would be\ninexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the prosecutor did\nnot laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though anxious not\nto miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the smallest twitch of\nany feature of his face.\n\n\"That's how we have treated you from the beginning,\" said Nikolay\nParfenovitch, still laughing. \"We haven't tried to put you out by asking\nhow you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast. We began,\nindeed, with questions of the greatest importance.\"\n\n\"I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still more\nyour present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of your\nnoble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on the\nfooting of mutual confidence between educated, well-bred people, who have\nthe common bond of noble birth and honor. In any case, allow me to look\nupon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when\nmy honor is assailed. That's no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?\"\n\n\"On the contrary. You've expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\"\nNikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.\n\n\"And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those tricky\nquestions!\" cried Mitya enthusiastically. \"Or there's simply no knowing\nwhere we shall get to! Is there?\"\n\n\"I will follow your sensible advice entirely,\" the prosecutor interposed,\naddressing Mitya. \"I don't withdraw my question, however. It is now\nvitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I mean\nprecisely three thousand.\"\n\n\"Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to pay\na debt.\"\n\n\"A debt to whom?\"\n\n\"That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldn't, or\nbecause I shouldn't dare, or because it would be damaging, for it's all a\npaltry matter and absolutely trifling, but--I won't, because it's a matter\nof principle: that's my private life, and I won't allow any intrusion into\nmy private life. That's my principle. Your question has no bearing on the\ncase, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. I\nwanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won't\nsay.\"\n\n\"Allow me to make a note of that,\" said the prosecutor.\n\n\"By all means. Write down that I won't say, that I won't. Write that I\nshould think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you've nothing\nelse to do with your time.\"\n\n\"Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are\nunaware of it,\" the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern\nimpressiveness, \"that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions\nput to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from\nyou, if you decline to give it for one reason or another. That is entirely\na matter for your personal decision. But it is our duty, on the other\nhand, in such cases as the present, to explain and set before you the\ndegree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or\nthat piece of evidence. After which I will beg you to continue.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, I'm not angry ... I ...\" Mitya muttered in a rather\ndisconcerted tone. \"Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I went\nthen ...\"\n\nWe will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known to the\nreader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest\ndetail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over. But as he gave\nhis evidence it was written down, and therefore they had continually to\npull him up. Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though still\ngood-humoredly. He did, it is true, exclaim, from time to time,\n\"Gentlemen, that's enough to make an angel out of patience!\" Or,\n\"Gentlemen, it's no good your irritating me.\"\n\nBut even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially\nexpansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two\ndays before. (He had completely realized by now that he had been fooled.)\nThe sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was\nsomething new to the lawyers. They were at once greatly interested, and\neven, to Mitya's intense indignation, thought it necessary to write the\nfact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had\nhardly a farthing in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya began\nto grow surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, the\nnight spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to the\ntown. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a minute\naccount of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka's account.\n\nHe was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly into the\ncircumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna's house\nat the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden to keep watch on Grushenka, and\nof Smerdyakov's bringing him information. They laid particular stress on\nthis, and noted it down. Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length,\nand though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to\n\"public ignominy,\" so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in order\nto tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigating\nlawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he told\nhis story, disconcerted him at last considerably.\n\n\"That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense about\nwomen only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my\ntelling this to,\" he reflected mournfully. \"It's ignominious. 'Be patient,\nhumble, hold thy peace.' \" He wound up his reflections with that line. But\nhe pulled himself together to go on again. When he came to telling of his\nvisit to Madame Hohlakov, he regained his spirits and even wished to tell\na little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case. But\nthe investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he should\npass on to \"more essential matters.\" At last, when he described his\ndespair and told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakov's, he thought that\nhe'd \"get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,\" they\nstopped him again and noted down that he had \"meant to murder some one.\"\nMitya let them write it without protest. At last he reached the point in\nhis story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned\nfrom Samsonov's as soon as he left her there, though she had said that she\nwould stay there till midnight.\n\n\"If I didn't kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadn't\ntime,\" broke from him suddenly at that point in his story. That, too, was\ncarefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to tell\nhow he ran into his father's garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly\nstopped him, and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him\nhe brought out the brass pestle.\n\n\"Do you recognize this object?\" he asked, showing it to Mitya.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he laughed gloomily. \"Of course I recognize it. Let me have a\nlook at it.... Damn it, never mind!\"\n\n\"You have forgotten to mention it,\" observed the investigating lawyer.\n\n\"Hang it all, I shouldn't have concealed it from you. Do you suppose I\ncould have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.\"\n\n\"Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.\"\n\nAnd Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.\n\n\"But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon?\"\n\n\"What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.\"\n\n\"What for, if you had no object?\"\n\nMitya's wrath flared up. He looked intently at \"the boy\" and smiled\ngloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more ashamed at having\ntold \"such people\" the story of his jealousy so sincerely and\nspontaneously.\n\n\"Bother the pestle!\" broke from him suddenly.\n\n\"But still--\"\n\n\"Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything\nturned up.\"\n\n\"But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you\nwent out, since you're afraid of the dark?\"\n\n\"Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen! There's positively no talking to you!\" cried\nMitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimson\nwith anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in his voice:\n\n\"Write down at once ... at once ... 'that I snatched up the pestle to go\nand kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head\nwith it!' Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your minds\nrelieved?\" he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers.\n\n\"We quite understand that you made that statement just now through\nexasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consider\ntrivial, though they are, in fact, essential,\" the prosecutor remarked\ndryly in reply.\n\n\"Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does one\npick things up for at such moments? I don't know what for. I snatched it\nup and ran--that's all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or I declare I\nwon't tell you any more.\"\n\nHe sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He sat\nsideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of\nnausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare that\nhe wouldn't say another word, \"not if you hang me for it.\"\n\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" he said at last, with difficulty controlling\nhimself, \"you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It's a\ndream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it--it's always the same\n... that some one is hunting me, some one I'm awfully afraid of ... that\nhe's hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hide\nsomewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way,\nand the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but he pretends not to\nknow where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror....\nThat's just what you're doing now. It's just like that!\"\n\n\"Is that the sort of thing you dream about?\" inquired the prosecutor.\n\n\"Yes, it is. Don't you want to write it down?\" said Mitya, with a\ndistorted smile.\n\n\"No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.\"\n\n\"It's not a question of dreams now, gentlemen--this is realism, this is\nreal life! I'm a wolf and you're the hunters. Well, hunt him down!\"\n\n\"You are wrong to make such comparisons ...\" began Nikolay Parfenovitch,\nwith extraordinary softness.\n\n\"No, I'm not wrong, not at all!\" Mitya flared up again, though his\noutburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more good-\nhumored at every word. \"You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial\ntortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable impulses\nof the heart (I say that boldly!)--no! That you must believe you have no\nright indeed ... but--\n\n\n    Be silent, heart,\n    Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.\n\n\nWell, shall I go on?\" he broke off gloomily.\n\n\"If you'll be so kind,\" answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\n\nChapter V. The Third Ordeal\n\n\nThough Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying more than\never not to forget or miss a single detail of his story. He told them how\nhe had leapt over the fence into his father's garden; how he had gone up\nto the window; told them all that had passed under the window. Clearly,\nprecisely, distinctly, he described the feelings that troubled him during\nthose moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether\nGrushenka was with his father or not. But, strange to say, both the\nlawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him,\nasked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their faces.\n\n\"They're angry and offended,\" he thought. \"Well, bother them!\"\n\nWhen he described how he made up his mind at last to make the \"signal\" to\nhis father that Grushenka had come, so that he should open the window, the\nlawyers paid no attention to the word \"signal,\" as though they entirely\nfailed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection: so much so,\nthat Mitya noticed it. Coming at last to the moment when, seeing his\nfather peering out of the window, his hatred flared up and he pulled the\npestle out of his pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short.\nHe sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon\nhim.\n\n\"Well?\" said the investigating lawyer. \"You pulled out the weapon and ...\nand what happened then?\"\n\n\"Then? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his\nskull.... I suppose that's your story. That's it!\"\n\nHis eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with\nextraordinary violence in his soul.\n\n\"Our story?\" repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. \"Well--and yours?\"\n\nMitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.\n\n\"My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,\" he began softly. \"Whether\nit was some one's tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angel\nkissed me at that instant, I don't know. But the devil was conquered. I\nrushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was alarmed and,\nfor the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang back from the\nwindow. I remember that very well. I ran across the garden to the fence\n... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.\"\n\nAt that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners. They\nseemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention. A sort of\nparoxysm of indignation seized on Mitya's soul.\n\n\"Why, you're laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!\" he broke off\nsuddenly.\n\n\"What makes you think that?\" observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"You don't believe one word--that's why! I understand, of course, that I\nhave come to the vital point. The old man's lying there now with his skull\nbroken, while I--after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him,\nand how I snatched up the pestle--I suddenly run away from the window. A\nromance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha!\nYou are scoffers, gentlemen!\"\n\nAnd he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.\n\n\"And did you notice,\" asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not\nobserving Mitya's excitement, \"did you notice when you ran away from the\nwindow, whether the door into the garden was open?\"\n\n\"No, it was not open.\"\n\n\"It was not?\"\n\n\"It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!\" he seemed\nsuddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:\n\n\"Why, did you find the door open?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was open.\"\n\n\"Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?\" cried\nMitya, greatly astonished.\n\n\"The door stood open, and your father's murderer undoubtedly went in at\nthat door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same\ndoor,\" the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out\neach word separately. \"That is perfectly clear. The murder was committed\nin the room and _not through the __ window_; that is absolutely certain\nfrom the examination that has been made, from the position of the body and\neverything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.\"\n\nMitya was absolutely dumbfounded.\n\n\"But that's utterly impossible!\" he cried, completely at a loss. \"I ... I\ndidn't go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut the\nwhole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden. I only\nstood at the window and saw him through the window. That's all, that's\nall.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didn't remember, it would\nbe just the same. I know it, for no one knew the signals except\nSmerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he wouldn't have opened the door\nto any one in the world without the signals.\"\n\n\"Signals? What signals?\" asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almost\nhysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and\ndignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. He\nscented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and was already\nfilled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.\n\n\"So you didn't know!\" Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking\nsmile. \"What if I won't tell you? From whom could you find out? No one\nknew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was all.\nHeaven knew, too, but it won't tell you. But it's an interesting fact.\nThere's no knowing what you might build on it. Ha ha! Take comfort,\ngentlemen, I'll reveal it. You've some foolish idea in your hearts. You\ndon't know the man you have to deal with! You have to do with a prisoner\nwho gives evidence against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for I'm a man\nof honor and you--are not.\"\n\nThe prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling with\nimpatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them\neverything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov.\nHe told them exactly what every tap on the window meant, tapped the\nsignals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed\nhe, Mitya, had tapped the signal \"Grushenka has come,\" when he tapped to\nhis father, he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal, that\n\"Grushenka had come.\"\n\n\"So now you can build up your tower,\" Mitya broke off, and again turned\naway from them contemptuously.\n\n\"So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valet\nSmerdyakov? And no one else?\" Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more.\n\n\"Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven. That may\nbe of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.\"\n\nAnd they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But while they\nwrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea:\n\n\"But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all\nresponsibility for the death of your father, was it not he, perhaps, who\nknocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to open to him, and\nthen ... committed the crime?\"\n\nMitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred. His\nsilent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink.\n\n\"You've caught the fox again,\" commented Mitya at last; \"you've got the\nbeast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought,\nof course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout\nwith all my might, 'Aie! it's Smerdyakov; he's the murderer.' Confess\nthat's what you thought. Confess, and I'll go on.\"\n\nBut the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited.\n\n\"You're mistaken. I'm not going to shout 'It's Smerdyakov,' \" said Mitya.\n\n\"And you don't even suspect him?\"\n\n\"Why, do you suspect him?\"\n\n\"He is suspected, too.\"\n\nMitya fixed his eyes on the floor.\n\n\"Joking apart,\" he brought out gloomily. \"Listen. From the very beginning,\nalmost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I've\nhad the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I've been sitting here, shouting\nthat I'm innocent and thinking all the time 'Smerdyakov!' I can't get\nSmerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just\nnow; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, 'No, it's not\nSmerdyakov.' It's not his doing, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"In that case is there anybody else you suspect?\" Nikolay Parfenovitch\ninquired cautiously.\n\n\"I don't know any one it could be, whether it's the hand of Heaven or\nSatan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\" Mitya jerked out with decision.\n\n\"But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it's not\nhe?\"\n\n\"From my conviction--my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most\nabject character and a coward. He's not a coward, he's the epitome of all\nthe cowardice in the world walking on two legs. He has the heart of a\nchicken. When he talked to me, he was always trembling for fear I should\nkill him, though I never raised my hand against him. He fell at my feet\nand blubbered; he has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching me\n'not to frighten him.' Do you hear? 'Not to frighten him.' What a thing to\nsay! Why, I offered him money. He's a puling chicken--sickly, epileptic,\nweak-minded--a child of eight could thrash him. He has no character worth\ntalking about. It's not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He doesn't care for money;\nhe wouldn't take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for murdering\nthe old man? Why, he's very likely his son, you know--his natural son. Do\nyou know that?\"\n\n\"We have heard that legend. But you are your father's son, too, you know;\nyet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him.\"\n\n\"That's a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I'm not afraid! Oh,\ngentlemen, isn't it too base of you to say that to my face? It's base,\nbecause I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him, but I\nmight have done it. And, what's more, I went out of my way to tell you of\nmy own accord that I nearly murdered him. But, you see, I didn't murder\nhim; you see, my guardian angel saved me--that's what you've not taken into\naccount. And that's why it's so base of you. For I didn't kill him, I\ndidn't kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.\"\n\nHe was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during the whole\ninterrogation.\n\n\"And what has he told you, gentlemen--Smerdyakov, I mean?\" he added\nsuddenly, after a pause. \"May I ask that question?\"\n\n\"You may ask any question,\" the prosecutor replied with frigid severity,\n\"any question relating to the facts of the case, and we are, I repeat,\nbound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the servant Smerdyakov,\nconcerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his bed, in an epileptic\nfit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly, ten times. The\ndoctor who was with us told us, after seeing him, that he may possibly not\noutlive the night.\"\n\n\"Well, if that's so, the devil must have killed him,\" broke suddenly from\nMitya, as though until that moment he had been asking himself: \"Was it\nSmerdyakov or not?\"\n\n\"We will come back to this later,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch decided. \"Now,\nwouldn't you like to continue your statement?\"\n\nMitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted. After\nresting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed. He was\nexhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse the\nprosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally, by vexatious\ninterruptions about \"trifling points.\" Scarcely had Mitya described how,\nsitting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle,\nwhile the old man had hold of his left leg, and how he had then jumped\ndown to look at him, when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to\ndescribe exactly how he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was surprised.\n\n\"Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall and\none on the other.\"\n\n\"And the pestle?\"\n\n\"The pestle was in my hand.\"\n\n\"Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent blow\nyou gave him?\"\n\n\"It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and\nshowing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?\"\n\n\"You're making fun of me, aren't you?\" asked Mitya, looking haughtily at\nthe speaker; but the latter did not flinch.\n\nMitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm.\n\n\"This was how I struck him! That's how I knocked him down! What more do\nyou want?\"\n\n\"Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with\nwhat object, and what you had in view?\"\n\n\"Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I'd hurt ... I don't\nknow what for!\"\n\n\"Though you were so excited and were running away?\"\n\n\"Yes, though I was excited and running away.\"\n\n\"You wanted to help him?\"\n\n\"Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I don't remember.\"\n\n\"You don't remember? Then you didn't quite know what you were doing?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I remember everything--every detail. I jumped down to look at\nhim, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.\"\n\n\"We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to\nconsciousness?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure whether he\nwas alive or not.\"\n\n\"Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?\"\n\n\"I'm not a doctor. I couldn't decide. I ran away thinking I'd killed him.\nAnd now he's recovered.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" commented the prosecutor. \"Thank you. That's all I wanted.\nKindly proceed.\"\n\nAlas! it never entered Mitya's head to tell them, though he remembered it,\nthat he had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate figure\nhad even uttered some words of regret: \"You've come to grief, old\nman--there's no help for it. Well, there you must lie.\"\n\nThe prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumped\nback \"at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of\nascertaining whether the _only_ witness of his crime were dead; that he\nmust therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision and\nforesight even at such a moment,\" ... and so on. The prosecutor was\nsatisfied: \"I've provoked the nervous fellow by 'trifles' and he has said\nmore than he meant to.\"\n\nWith painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled up\nimmediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands so\ncovered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?\"\n\n\"Why, I didn't notice the blood at all at the time,\" answered Mitya.\n\n\"That's quite likely. It does happen sometimes.\" The prosecutor exchanged\nglances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"I simply didn't notice. You're quite right there, prosecutor,\" Mitya\nassented suddenly.\n\nNext came the account of Mitya's sudden determination to \"step aside\" and\nmake way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to open\nhis heart to them as before, and tell them about \"the queen of his soul.\"\nHe disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons \"who were\nfastening on him like bugs.\" And so in response to their reiterated\nquestions he answered briefly and abruptly:\n\n\"Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for? That\nquestion stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come back,\nthe man who wronged her but who'd hurried back to offer his love, after\nfive years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew it was all\nover for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that blood--Grigory's.... What\nhad I to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load\nthem and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And a grand feast the night before?\"\n\n\"Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make\nhaste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the\nvillage, and I'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning. And I\nhad a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin's when I loaded my\npistols. Here's the letter. Read it! It's not for you I tell it,\" he added\ncontemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the\ntable. The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to\nthe papers connected with the case.\n\n\"And you didn't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin's? You were\nnot afraid then of arousing suspicion?\"\n\n\"What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just the\nsame, and shot myself at five o'clock, and you wouldn't have been in time\nto do anything. If it hadn't been for what's happened to my father, you\nwould have known nothing about it, and wouldn't have come here. Oh, it's\nthe devil's doing. It was the devil murdered father, it was through the\ndevil that you found it out so soon. How did you manage to get here so\nquick? It's marvelous, a dream!\"\n\n\"Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in your\nhands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a\nbundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his servant-boy saw it too.\"\n\n\"That's true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.\"\n\n\"Now, there's one little point presents itself. Can you inform us,\"\nNikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, \"where did you get so\nmuch money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from the\nreckoning of time, that you had not been home?\"\n\nThe prosecutor's brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly,\nbut he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"No, I didn't go home,\" answered Mitya, apparently perfectly composed, but\nlooking at the floor.\n\n\"Allow me then to repeat my question,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as\nthough creeping up to the subject. \"Where were you able to procure such a\nsum all at once, when by your own confession, at five o'clock the same day\nyou--\"\n\n\"I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin, and\nthen went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she wouldn't\ngive me, and so on, and all the rest of it,\" Mitya interrupted sharply.\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands turned up,\neh? Do you know, gentlemen, you're both afraid now 'what if he won't tell\nus where he got it?' That's just how it is. I'm not going to tell you,\ngentlemen. You've guessed right. You'll never know,\" said Mitya, chipping\nout each word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silent\nfor a moment.\n\n\"You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for us\nto know,\" said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.\n\n\"I understand; but still I won't tell you.\"\n\nThe prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that he\nwas at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it to his\ninterest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do himself by his\nsilence, especially in a case of such importance as--\n\n\"And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I've heard that rigmarole\nbefore,\" Mitya interrupted again. \"I can see for myself how important it\nis, and that this is the vital point, and still I won't say.\"\n\n\"What is it to us? It's not our business, but yours. You are doing\nyourself harm,\" observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.\n\n\"You see, gentlemen, joking apart\"--Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly\nat them both--\"I had an inkling from the first that we should come to\nloggerheads at this point. But at first when I began to give my evidence,\nit was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and I was so\nsimple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing\nbetween us. Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the\nquestion, for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-\nblock. And now we've come to it! It's impossible and there's an end of it!\nBut I don't blame you. You can't believe it all simply on my word. I\nunderstand that, of course.\"\n\nHe relapsed into gloomy silence.\n\n\"Couldn't you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the\nchief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight hint as\nto the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to\nrefuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?\"\n\nMitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.\n\n\"I'm much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I'll tell you the\nreason why and give you that hint, though you don't deserve it. I won't\nspeak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my honor. The\nanswer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far\ngreater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I had\nmurdered and robbed him. That's why I can't tell you. I can't for fear of\ndisgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?\"\n\n\"Yes, we'll write it down,\" lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"You ought not to write that down about 'disgrace.' I only told you that\nin the goodness of my heart. I needn't have told you. I made you a present\nof it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once. Oh, well, write--write\nwhat you like,\" he concluded, with scornful disgust. \"I'm not afraid of\nyou and I can still hold up my head before you.\"\n\n\"And can't you tell us the nature of that disgrace?\" Nikolay Parfenovitch\nhazarded.\n\nThe prosecutor frowned darkly.\n\n\"No, no, _c'est fini_, don't trouble yourselves. It's not worth while\nsoiling one's hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.\nYou're not worth it--no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. I'm not going on.\"\n\nThis was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist\nfurther, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch's eyes he saw that he had not given\nup hope.\n\n\"Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when you\nwent into Mr. Perhotin's--how many roubles exactly?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you that.\"\n\n\"You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three thousand\nfrom Madame Hohlakov.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won't say how much I had.\"\n\n\"Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you\nhave done since you arrived?\"\n\n\"Oh! you might ask the people here about that. But I'll tell you if you\nlike.\"\n\nHe proceeded to do so, but we won't repeat his story. He told it dryly and\ncurtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but told them that he\nabandoned his determination to shoot himself, owing to \"new factors in the\ncase.\" He told the story without going into motives or details. And this\ntime the lawyers did not worry him much. It was obvious that there was no\nessential point of interest to them here.\n\n\"We shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the examination\nof the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your presence,\"\nsaid Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. \"And now allow me to request you\nto lay on the table everything in your possession, especially all the\nmoney you still have about you.\"\n\n\"My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary. I'm\nsurprised, indeed, that you haven't inquired about it before. It's true I\ncouldn't get away anywhere. I'm sitting here where I can be seen. But\nhere's my money--count it--take it. That's all, I think.\"\n\nHe turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change--two pieces of\ntwenty copecks--he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket. They counted the\nmoney, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles, and forty\ncopecks.\n\n\"And is that all?\" asked the investigating lawyer.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles\nat Plotnikovs'. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver twenty, here you lost\ntwo hundred, then....\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily. They\nrecollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. Nikolay\nParfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.\n\n\"With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at\nfirst?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" snapped Mitya.\n\n\"How is it they all assert there was much more?\"\n\n\"Let them assert it.\"\n\n\"But you asserted it yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, too.\"\n\n\"We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet\nexamined. Don't be anxious about your money. It will be properly taken\ncare of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning\n... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved that you have undisputed\nright to it. Well, and now....\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly that it\nwas his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search \"of\nyour clothes and everything else....\"\n\n\"By all means, gentlemen. I'll turn out all my pockets, if you like.\"\n\nAnd he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.\n\n\"It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.\"\n\n\"What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won't you search me as I am! Can't you?\"\n\n\"It's utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take off your\nclothes.\"\n\n\"As you like,\" Mitya submitted gloomily; \"only, please, not here, but\nbehind the curtains. Who will search them?\"\n\n\"Behind the curtains, of course.\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore an\nexpression of peculiar solemnity.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya\n\n\nSomething utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could\nnever, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like\nthat to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was something\nhumiliating in it, and on their side something \"supercilious and\nscornful.\" It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to\nundress further, or rather not asked but \"commanded,\" he quite understood\nthat. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Several\npeasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the\ncurtain. \"To be ready if force is required,\" thought Mitya, \"and perhaps\nfor some other reason, too.\"\n\n\"Well, must I take off my shirt, too?\" he asked sharply, but Nikolay\nParfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in\nexamining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was\nevident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. \"They make no\nbones about it,\" thought Mitya, \"they don't keep up the most elementary\npoliteness.\"\n\n\"I ask you for the second time--need I take off my shirt or not?\" he said,\nstill more sharply and irritably.\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,\" Nikolay\nParfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it\nseemed to Mitya.\n\nMeantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.\nThere turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the\nback, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were bloodstains\non the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence of\nthe peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and\nall the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking for\nsomething--money, of course. He didn't even hide from Mitya his suspicion\nthat he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes.\n\n\"He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,\" Mitya muttered to\nhimself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing\nfrankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain,\nfussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch's attention to\nthe cap, which they were also fingering.\n\n\"You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,\" observed the secretary. \"Last\nsummer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to have\nlost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why, in just\nsuch pipings in his cap. The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in\nlittle rolls and sewed in the piping.\"\n\nBoth the lawyers remembered Gridyenko's case perfectly, and so laid aside\nMitya's cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly\nexamined later.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the right\ncuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, \"excuse me,\nwhat's that, blood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mitya jerked out.\n\n\"That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?\"\n\nMitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after\nGrigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at\nPerhotin's.\n\n\"You must take off your shirt, too. That's very important as material\nevidence.\"\n\nMitya flushed red and flew into a rage.\n\n\"What, am I to stay naked?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take off\nyour socks.\"\n\n\"You're not joking? Is that really necessary?\" Mitya's eyes flashed.\n\n\"We are in no mood for joking,\" answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.\n\n\"Well, if I must--\" muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he took\noff his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he was\nnaked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in\ntheir presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he was\ninferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him.\n\n\"When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one's the\nonly one undressed and everybody is looking, it's degrading,\" he kept\nrepeating to himself, again and again. \"It's like a dream, I've sometimes\ndreamed of being in such degrading positions.\" It was a misery to him to\ntake off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were his underclothes,\nand now every one could see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet.\nAll his life he had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularly\nloathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they\nwould all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and\nintentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.\n\n\"Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed to?\"\n\n\"No, there's no need to, at present.\"\n\n\"Well, am I to stay naked like this?\" he added savagely.\n\n\"Yes, that can't be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a\nwhile. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... I'll see\nto all this.\"\n\nAll the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search was\ndrawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were\ncarried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left\nalone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off\nhim. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet\nstuck out, and he couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them.\nNikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, \"an insufferable\ntime.\" \"He thinks of me as a puppy,\" thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth.\n\"That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts\nhim to see me naked!\"\n\nMitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned\nto him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back\nwith quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a peasant.\n\n\"Here are clothes for you,\" he observed airily, seeming well satisfied\nwith the success of his mission. \"Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these\nfor this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he had them\nall in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.\"\n\nMitya flew into a passion.\n\n\"I won't have other people's clothes!\" he shouted menacingly, \"give me my\nown!\"\n\n\"It's impossible!\"\n\n\"Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!\"\n\nIt was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded\nsomehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes,\nbeing stained with blood, must be \"included with the other material\nevidence,\" and that they \"had not even the right to let him have them now\n... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.\" Mitya at\nlast understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly\ndressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes\nwere much better than his old ones, and that he disliked \"gaining by the\nchange.\" The coat was, besides, \"ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up\nlike a fool ... for your amusement?\"\n\nThey urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only\na little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. But\nthe coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.\n\n\"Damn it all! I can hardly button it,\" Mitya grumbled. \"Be so good as to\ntell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his clothes, and it's not\nmy doing that they've dressed me up like a clown.\"\n\n\"He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you his\nclothes, but sorry about all this business,\" mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?\"\n\nHe was asked to go back to the \"other room.\" Mitya went in, scowling with\nanger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. Dressed in another man's\nclothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, and\nof Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in the\ndoorway, and vanished immediately. \"He's come to look at me dressed up,\"\nthought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd\nnightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.\n\n\"Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's left for\nyou,\" he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He would\nnot turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak to him.\n\n\"He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purpose\nto show every one how dirty they were--the scoundrel!\"\n\n\"Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,\" observed\nNikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's question.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on\nsomething.\n\n\"We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" Nikolay\nParfenovitch went on, \"but having received from you such an uncompromising\nrefusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money\nfound upon you, we are, at the present moment--\"\n\n\"What is the stone in your ring?\" Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though\nawakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large rings\nadorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.\n\n\"Ring?\" repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.\n\n\"Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it,\nwhat stone is that?\" Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.\n\n\"That's a smoky topaz,\" said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. \"Would you\nlike to look at it? I'll take it off ...\"\n\n\"No, don't take it off,\" cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and\nangry with himself. \"Don't take it off ... there's no need.... Damn it!...\nGentlemen, you've sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would conceal\nit from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie,\nand hide myself? No, that's not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn't\ndo, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn't have waited for your coming,\nor for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself\nbefore this, without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I\ncouldn't have learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in this\naccursed night!... And should I have been like this on this night, and at\nthis moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I have\nmoved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, if\nI had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought of\nhaving accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night--not from\nfear--oh, not simply from fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And\nyou expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and\nbelieve in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another\nnasty thing I've done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from\nyour accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my\nfather and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he?\nI'm racking my brains and can't think who. But I can tell you it was not\nDmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can tell you, and that's enough,\nenough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but don't bother me any\nmore. I'll say no more. Call your witnesses!\"\n\nMitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be\nabsolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the whole\ntime and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were the\nmost ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:\n\n\"Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well\ninform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of\nthe greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us by\nGrigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly and\nemphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming out\nto the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his mind to go\ninto it through the little gate which stood open, before he noticed you\nrunning, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open window\nwhere you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while\nnoticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him,\nthe door, standing wide open--that door which you have stated to have been\nshut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from you\nthat Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must\nhave run from that door, though, of course, he did not see you do so with\nhis own eyes, since he only noticed you first some distance away in the\ngarden, running towards the fence.\"\n\nMitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, \"it's a barefaced lie. He\ncouldn't have seen the door open because it was shut. He's lying!\"\n\n\"I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He does\nnot waver. He adheres to it. We've cross-examined him several times.\"\n\n\"Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch\nconfirmed warmly.\n\n\"It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the\nhallucination of a madman,\" Mitya still shouted. \"He's simply raving, from\nloss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he came to....\nHe's raving.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after his\ninjuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from the\nlodge.\"\n\n\"But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He's slandering me from\nspite.... He couldn't have seen it ... I didn't come from the door,\"\ngasped Mitya.\n\nThe prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him\nimpressively:\n\n\"Confront him with it.\"\n\n\"Do you recognize this object?\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official\nenvelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope was\nempty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.\n\n\"It ... it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope that\ncontained the three thousand roubles ... and if there's inscribed on it,\nallow me, 'For my little chicken' ... yes--three thousand!\" he shouted, \"do\nyou see, three thousand, do you see?\"\n\n\"Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was empty, and\nlying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.\"\n\nFor some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.\n\n\"Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!\" he shouted suddenly, at the top of his\nvoice. \"It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No one else knew\nwhere the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov, that's clear, now!\"\n\n\"But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.\"\n\n\"I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time I've looked\nat it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only one who\nknew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't know ...\" Mitya was\ncompletely breathless.\n\n\"But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased\nfather's pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so\nyou must have known it.\"\n\n\"We've got it written down,\" confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"Nonsense! It's absurd! I'd no idea it was under the pillow. And perhaps\nit wasn't under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance guess that it\nwas under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you asked him where\nit was? What does Smerdyakov say? that's the chief point.... And I went\nout of my way to tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking\nthat it was under the pillow, and now you-- Oh, you know how one says the\nwrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, only\nSmerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn't even tell me where it was! But\nit's his doing, his doing; there's no doubt about it, he murdered him,\nthat's as clear as daylight now,\" Mitya exclaimed more and more\nfrantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more\nexasperated and excited. \"You must understand that, and arrest him at\nonce.... He must have killed him while I was running away and while\nGrigory was unconscious, that's clear now.... He gave the signal and\nfather opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without\nthe signal father would never have opened the door....\"\n\n\"But you're again forgetting the circumstance,\" the prosecutor observed,\nstill speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph,\n\"that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open\nwhen you were there, while you were in the garden....\"\n\n\"The door, the door,\" muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the\nprosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.\n\n\"Yes, the door!... It's a nightmare! God is against me!\" he exclaimed,\nstaring before him in complete stupefaction.\n\n\"Come, you see,\" the prosecutor went on with dignity, \"and you can judge\nfor yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence of\nthe open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us.\nOn the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak,\nobdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the\nmoney which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours\nearlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten\nroubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we to\nbelieve, and what can we depend upon? And don't accuse us of being\n'frigid, cynical, scoffing people,' who are incapable of believing in the\ngenerous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter into our position ...\"\n\nMitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.\n\n\"Very well!\" he exclaimed suddenly. \"I will tell you my secret. I'll tell\nyou where I got the money!... I'll reveal my shame, that I may not have to\nblame myself or you hereafter.\"\n\n\"And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in a\nvoice of almost pathetic delight, \"that every sincere and complete\nconfession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immense\ninfluence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover--\"\n\nBut the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he checked\nhimself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. Mitya's Great Secret. Received With Hisses\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he began, still in the same agitation, \"I want to make a full\nconfession: that money was _my own_.\" The lawyers' faces lengthened. That\nwas not at all what they expected.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, \"when at five o'clock on\nthe same day, from your own confession--\"\n\n\"Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession! That's nothing\nto do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is, stolen by me\n... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen hundred\nroubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...\"\n\n\"But where did you get it?\"\n\n\"I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here,\nround my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I'd had it round my neck a long time,\nit's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace!\"\n\n\"And from whom did you ... appropriate it?\"\n\n\"You mean, 'steal it'? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I\npractically stole it, but, if you prefer, I 'appropriated it.' I consider\nI stole it. And last night I stole it finally.\"\n\n\"Last night? But you said that it's a month since you ... obtained it?...\"\n\n\"Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be uneasy. I\ndidn't steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you without\ninterrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sent\nfor by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"I know you know her. She's a noble creature, noblest of the noble. But\nshe has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with good\nreason, good reason!\"\n\n\"Katerina Ivanovna!\" Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The\nprosecutor, too, stared.\n\n\"Oh, don't take her name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her into it.\nYes, I've seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very first,\neven that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. You're unworthy\neven to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only tell you that\nshe sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to\nher sister and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn't have\nsent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my\nlife when I ... well, in fact, when I'd just come to love another, her,\nshe's sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroe\nthen, and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand, but the\nother half I kept on me. Well, I've kept that other half, that fifteen\nhundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent\nit. What's left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now,\nNikolay Parfenovitch. That's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent\nthree thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.\"\n\n\"Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?\"\n\n\"Why, you told every one yourself that you'd spent exactly three\nthousand.\"\n\n\"It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so.\nAnd here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. Yet I\ndidn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteen\nhundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how it was, gentlemen. That's\nwhere I got that money yesterday....\"\n\n\"This is almost miraculous,\" murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n\"Allow me to inquire,\" observed the prosecutor at last, \"have you informed\nany one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteen\nhundred left about you a month ago?\"\n\n\"I told no one.\"\n\n\"That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?\"\n\n\"Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.\"\n\n\"What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for making\nsuch a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at last your\nsecret, in your words, so 'disgraceful,' though in reality--that is, of\ncourse, comparatively speaking--this action, that is, the appropriation of\nthree thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only\nfor a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest\nrecklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration\nyour character.... Even admitting that it was an action in the highest\ndegree discreditable, still, discreditable is not 'disgraceful.'... Many\npeople have already guessed, during this last month, about the three\nthousand of Katerina Ivanovna's, that you have spent, and I heard the\nlegend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for\ninstance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but\nthe gossip of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not\nmistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the\nmoney was Katerina Ivanovna's, and so, it's extremely surprising to me\nthat hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an\nextraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently\nconnecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... It's not easy\nto believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a\nsecret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than\nconfessing it ...\"\n\nThe prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal his\nvexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated\nspleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.\n\n\"It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I put it apart\nfrom the rest of the three thousand,\" said Mitya firmly.\n\n\"Why?\" smiled the prosecutor irritably. \"What is there disgraceful, to\nyour thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had\ndiscreditably, if you prefer, 'disgracefully,' appropriated? Your taking\nthe three thousand is more important than what you did with it. And by the\nway, why did you do that--why did you set apart that half, for what\npurpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?\"\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!\" cried Mitya. \"I put it\naside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be\ncalculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on\na whole month.\"\n\n\"It's incomprehensible.\"\n\n\"I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is\nincomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate three\nthousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all,\nand next morning I go to her and say, 'Katya, I've done wrong, I've\nsquandered your three thousand,' well, is that right? No, it's not\nright--it's dishonest and cowardly, I'm a beast, with no more self-control\nthan a beast, that's so, isn't it? But still I'm not a thief? Not a\ndownright thief, you'll admit! I squandered it, but I didn't steal it. Now\na second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may\nget confused again--my head's going round--and so, for the second\nalternative: I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand,\nthat is, only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: 'Katya, take\nthis fifteen hundred from me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy\nscoundrel, for I've wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so\nkeep me from temptation!' Well, what of that alternative? I should be a\nbeast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not\naltogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but\nhave kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back half,\nI should pay back what I'd spent, that I should never give up trying to,\nthat I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should be\na scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!\"\n\n\"I admit that there is a certain distinction,\" said the prosecutor, with a\ncold smile. \"But it's strange that you see such a vital difference.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps\nevery man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an\narch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don't know how to make these\nfine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that's my\nconviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make\nup my mind to give it back to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I\ncannot make up my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day,\nand every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I\ncan't bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is that\nright?\"\n\n\"Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that I\ndon't dispute,\" answered the prosecutor with reserve. \"And let us give up\nall discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will be\nso kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have still not\ntold us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the first place, you halved\nthe money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For what purpose\nexactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that fifteen\nhundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course!\" cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; \"forgive\nme, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or you'd\nunderstand in a minute, for it's just the motive of it that's the\ndisgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. He\nwas always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous; I thought\nthen that she was hesitating between me and him. So I kept thinking every\nday, suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she\nwere to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, 'I love\nyou, not him; take me to the other end of the world.' And I'd only forty\ncopecks; how could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You\nsee, I didn't know her then, I didn't understand her, I thought she wanted\nmoney, and that she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly\ncounted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on\nit, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off\nto get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?\"\n\nBoth the lawyers laughed aloud.\n\n\"I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have\nsquandered it all,\" chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, \"for after all what\ndoes it amount to?\"\n\n\"Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify me\nby not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up\nround my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, 'You're a thief!\nyou're a thief!' Yes, that's why I've been so savage all this month,\nthat's why I fought in the tavern, that's why I attacked my father, it was\nbecause I felt I was a thief. I couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare\neven to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was\nsuch a scoundrel and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried\nit I said to myself at the same time every hour: 'No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\nyou may yet not be a thief.' Why? Because I might go next day and pay back\nthat fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made up my mind to\ntear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya's to Perhotin. I hadn't\nbeen able till that moment to bring myself to it. And it was only when I\ntore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man\nfor the rest of my life. Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my\ndream of going to Katya and saying, 'I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!' Do\nyou understand now? Do you understand?\"\n\n\"What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?\" Nikolay Parfenovitch\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five\no'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no difference\nwhether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it's not so, it turns\nout that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what has\ntortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I'd\nkilled the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my\nlove was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh, that did\ntorture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned\nconsciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and\nspent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you\nagain, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I\nhave learnt that it's not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but\nimpossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....\"\n\nMitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his\nbeing intensely excited.\n\n\"I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" the prosecutor\nsaid slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. \"But all this, if\nyou'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... your\noverwrought nerves, that's what it is. And why, for instance, should you\nnot have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going and\nreturning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you?\nAnd why could you not have explained things to her, and in view of your\nposition, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had\nrecourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one's mind,\nthat is, after honorably confessing your errors to her, why could you not\nhave asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, with\nher generous heart, she would certainly not have refused you in your\ndistress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on the\nsecurity you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I\nsuppose you still regard that security as of value?\"\n\nMitya suddenly crimsoned.\n\n\"Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You\ncan't be speaking in earnest?\" he said, with indignation, looking the\nprosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears.\n\n\"I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not serious?\" It\nwas the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.\n\n\"Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are\ntorturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll confess all my\ninfernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you'll be surprised\nyourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions\ncan sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan you\nspoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that\nthought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of\ndeciding to go to Katya--I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to\ntell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out,\nfor the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to\nbeg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the\nother, the rival, who hated and insulted her--to think of it! You must be\nmad, prosecutor!\"\n\n\"Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that\nfeminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you\nassert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,\" said the\nprosecutor, smiling.\n\n\"But that would have been so infamous!\" Mitya brought his fist down on the\ntable fiercely. \"That would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, do\nyou know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she would have\ngiven it, too; she'd have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me,\nshe'd have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me,\nfor hers is an infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd\nhave taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have taken\nit, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen,\nI'm making such an outcry because I've had that thought in my mind so\nlately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having all\nthat bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I\nremember, till that happened ...\"\n\n\"Till what happened?\" put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mitya\ndid not hear it.\n\n\"I have made you an awful confession,\" Mitya said gloomily in conclusion.\n\"You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must respect it, for if not,\nif that leaves your souls untouched, then you've simply no respect for me,\ngentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessed\nit to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already\nthat you don't believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?\" he\ncried in dismay.\n\n\"Yes, what you said just now,\" said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at him\nin surprise, \"that is, that up to the last hour you were still\ncontemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... I\nassure you, that's a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you,\nparticularly important for you.\"\n\n\"Have mercy, gentlemen!\" Mitya flung up his hands. \"Don't write that,\nanyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart asunder before you, and\nyou seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves....\nOh, my God!\"\n\nIn despair he hid his face in his hands.\n\n\"Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" observed the prosecutor,\n\"everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and\nwhat you don't agree to we'll alter as you like. But now I'll ask you one\nlittle question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heard\nfrom you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost\nimpossible to believe.\"\n\n\"No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood anything!\nLet me alone!\"\n\n\"Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's plenty of\ntime for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses\nthat you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere\nabout the three thousand you'd spent here; three thousand, not fifteen\nhundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday,\nyou gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand\nwith you.\"\n\n\"You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses,\ntwo hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!\" cried Mitya.\n\n\"Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ means\nsomething.\"\n\n\"It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.\"\n\n\"But what need had you to 'talk rot,' as you call it?\"\n\n\"The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much\nmoney.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes,\nthat was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?\nWell, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't\ncare to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?\"\n\n\"That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man\ntell lies,\" observed the prosecutor impressively. \"Tell me, though, was\nthat 'amulet,' as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?\"\n\n\"No, not big.\"\n\n\"How big, for instance?\"\n\n\"If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the size.\"\n\n\"You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.\"\n\n\"Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are.\"\n\n\"But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According to\nyour own evidence you didn't go home.\"\n\n\"When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I tore it off my\nneck and took out the money.\"\n\n\"In the dark?\"\n\n\"What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one minute.\"\n\n\"Without scissors, in the street?\"\n\n\"In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag. It\nwas torn in a minute.\"\n\n\"Where did you put it afterwards?\"\n\n\"I dropped it there.\"\n\n\"Where was it, exactly?\"\n\n\"In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows whereabouts.\nWhat do you want to know for?\"\n\n\"That's extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be material\nevidence in your favor. How is it you don't understand that? Who helped\nyou to sew it up a month ago?\"\n\n\"No one helped me. I did it myself.\"\n\n\"Can you sew?\"\n\n\"A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.\"\n\n\"Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed the\nmoney?\"\n\n\"Are you laughing at me?\"\n\n\"Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"I don't know where I got the rag from--somewhere, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.\"\n\n\"That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the\nshirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag was\nit, cloth or linen?\"\n\n\"Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didn't tear\nit off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it up in a\ncap of my landlady's.\"\n\n\"In your landlady's cap?\"\n\n\"Yes. I took it from her.\"\n\n\"How did you get it?\"\n\n\"You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my pen\non. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore it\nup, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it was in that\nvery rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.\"\n\n\"And you remember that for certain now?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang\nit, what does it matter?\"\n\n\"In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?\"\n\n\"No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an old\nrag not worth a farthing.\"\n\n\"And where did you get the needle and thread?\"\n\n\"I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!\" said Mitya, losing\nhis temper at last.\n\n\"It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw\nthe pieces in the market-place.\"\n\n\"Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhaps\nyou'll find it,\" said Mitya, sneering. \"Enough, gentlemen, enough!\" he\ndecided, in an exhausted voice. \"I see you don't believe me! Not for a\nmoment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why,\nwhy did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? It's a joke to\nyou. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a\nhymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you torturers!\"\n\nHe bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were silent.\nA minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly. His\nface now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat mute and passive\nas though hardly conscious of what was happening. In the meantime they had\nto finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examining\nthe witnesses. It was by now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had\nbeen extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been\ncontinually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had\nbeen going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very\ntired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain\nstreamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.\n\n\"May I look out of the window?\" he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, as much as you like,\" the latter replied.\n\nMitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its little\ngreenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the house, and\nfarther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts,\nlooking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought of \"Phoebus the\ngolden-haired,\" and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray.\n\"Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,\" he thought with\na smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his\n\"torturers.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about her,\nI beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? She's innocent, you\nknow, she was out of her mind when she cried last night 'It's all my\nfault!' She's done nothing, nothing! I've been grieving over her all night\nas I sat with you.... Can't you, won't you tell me what you are going to\ndo with her now?\"\n\n\"You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\"\nthe prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity. \"We have, so far,\nno grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested. I\ntrust that it may be the same in the later development of the case.... On\nthe contrary, we'll do everything that lies in our power in that matter.\nSet your mind completely at rest.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward\npeople in spite of everything. You've taken a load off my heart.... Well,\nwhat are we to do now? I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnesses\nwithout delay. That must be done in your presence and therefore--\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we have some tea first?\" interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, \"I\nthink we've deserved it!\"\n\nThey decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had, no\ndoubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then \"go on and\non,\" putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable\nopportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya at\nfirst refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him,\nbut afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked\nsurprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculean\nstrength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent\nemotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he could\nhardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects about him\nseemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. \"A little more and I shall\nbegin raving,\" he said to himself.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The Babe\n\n\nThe examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our story\nin such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay\nParfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his\nevidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he would\nafterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every witness was\ncalled upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and so on. We will only\nnote that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the\nquestion of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here,\nat Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand\nor fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen\nhundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned out to\nbe against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some witnesses\nintroduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his, Mitya's,\nstory.\n\nThe first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not in the\nleast abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the contrary, an\nair of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him an\nappearance of truthfulness and personal dignity. He spoke little, and with\nreserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and deliberately.\nFirmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month\nbefore could not have been less than three thousand, that all the peasants\nabout here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand\nmentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. \"What a lot of money he flung\naway on the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them\nalone.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I gave them five hundred,\" was Mitya's gloomy comment on\nthis. \"It's a pity I didn't count the money at the time, but I was\ndrunk....\"\n\nMitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He listened\ngloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he would say:\n\n\"Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.\"\n\n\"More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\" retorted Trifon\nBorissovitch firmly. \"You flung it about at random and they picked it up.\nThey were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers, they've been driven\naway from here, or maybe they'd bear witness themselves how much they got\nfrom you. I saw the sum in your hands, myself--count it I didn't, you\ndidn't let me, that's true enough--but by the look of it I should say it\nwas far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen\nmoney too. We can judge of amounts....\"\n\nAs for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had\ntold him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three thousand with\nhim.\n\n\"Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?\" replied Mitya. \"Surely I\ndidn't declare so positively that I'd brought three thousand?\"\n\n\"You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andrey\nhimself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when you were\ntreating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave your\nsixth thousand here--that is with what you spent before, we must\nunderstand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too,\nwas standing beside you at the time. Maybe he'd remember it....\"\n\nThe evidence as to the \"sixth\" thousand made an extraordinary impression\non the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning;\nthree and three made six, three thousand then and three now made six, that\nwas clear.\n\nThey questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch, Stepan\nand Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The peasants and the driver\nunhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch's evidence. They noted down,\nwith particular care, Andrey's account of the conversation he had had with\nMitya on the road: \" 'Where,' says he, 'am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going,\nto heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?' \"\n\nThe psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile, and\nended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nwould go should be \"included in the case.\"\n\nKalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored, and\nhe spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his\nlife, though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day\nfor a long time past. He began by saying that \"he knew nothing about it\nand didn't want to.\" But it appeared that he had heard of the \"sixth\"\nthousand, and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the\nmoment. As far as he could see he \"didn't know\" how much money Mitya had\nin his hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply to\nreiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned out,\nMitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved, and\nthat she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna\nwith reserve and respect, as though she had been a lady of the best\nsociety, and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka. In spite of\nthe young man's obvious repugnance at giving evidence, Ippolit\nKirillovitch examined him at great length, and only from him learnt all\nthe details of what made up Mitya's \"romance,\" so to say, on that night.\nMitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go,\nand he left the room with unconcealed indignation.\n\nThe Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in their room,\nthey had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police officers\nthey hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would certainly be\nsent for. They gave their evidence with dignity, though not without some\nuneasiness. The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the\ntwelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His name\nwas Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated\ndentist. Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering\nthe room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was\nstanding on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most important\nperson and in command, and addressed him at every word as \"Pan Colonel.\"\nOnly after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they grasped\nthat they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It\nturned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their\naccent in some words. Of his relations with Grushenka, past and present,\nPan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at\nonce and declared that he would not allow the \"scoundrel\" to speak like\nthat in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the\nword \"scoundrel\" and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.\nMitya fumed with rage.\n\n\"He's a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, too,\nthat, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he's a scoundrel!\" he\ncried.\n\nThough Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he showed the\nmost praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly reprimanding Mitya,\nhe cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case, and\nhastened to pass to what was essential. One piece of evidence given by the\nPoles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very\nroom, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him\nthree thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down,\nand the remaining two thousand three hundred \"to be paid next day in the\ntown.\" He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at\nMokroe, but that his money was in the town. Mitya observed hotly that he\nhad not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in\nthe town. But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after\nthinking for a moment admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the\nPoles stated, that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed have\nsaid so.\n\nThe prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It seemed to\nestablish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base this deduction\non it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had come into\nMitya's hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town, or\neven, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe. This would explain the\ncircumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only eight hundred\nroubles were to be found in Mitya's hands. This circumstance had been the\none piece of evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told,\nto some extent, in Mitya's favor. Now this one piece of evidence in his\nfavor had broken down. In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry, where he\nwould have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he\nhimself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently\nreplied that he had meant to offer the \"little chap,\" not money, but a\nformal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya,\nthose rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov.\nThe prosecutor positively smiled at the \"innocence of this subterfuge.\"\n\n\"And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for\ntwo thousand three hundred roubles in cash?\"\n\n\"He certainly would have accepted it,\" Mitya declared warmly. \"Why, look\nhere, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for it. He\nwould have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and might have\ngot, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the old man.\"\n\nThe evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the protocol\nin the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The incident of the\ncheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay Parfenovitch was too\nwell pleased with them, as it was, and did not want to worry them with\ntrifles, moreover, it was nothing but a foolish, drunken quarrel over\ncards. There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night.... So the\ntwo hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles.\n\nThen old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached with little\nsteps, looking very disheveled and depressed. He had, all this time, taken\nrefuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her, and \"now and then\nhe'd begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue check\nhandkerchief,\" as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards. So that she\nherself began trying to pacify and comfort him. The old man at once\nconfessed that he had done wrong, that he had borrowed \"ten roubles in my\npoverty,\" from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.\nTo Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he noticed how much money\nDmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have been able to see the\nsum better than any one when he took the note from him, Maximov, in the\nmost positive manner, declared that there was twenty thousand.\n\n\"Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?\" inquired\nNikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.\n\n\"To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my\nlittle property. She'd only let me look at it from a distance, boasting of\nit to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored notes. And\nDmitri Fyodorovitch's were all rainbow-colored....\"\n\nHe was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. Nikolay\nParfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might\nhave on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition to him, but Mitya\nbowed his head in silence, giving him to understand \"that he would not\nmake a scene.\" Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in. She entered\nwith a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed and sat down\nquietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was very\npale, she seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her\nmagnificent black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverish\nchill--the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Her\ngrave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorable\nimpression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit\n\"fascinated.\" He admitted himself, when talking about it afterwards, that\nonly then had he seen \"how handsome the woman was,\" for, though he had\nseen her several times before, he had always looked upon her as something\nof a \"provincial hetaira.\" \"She has the manners of the best society,\" he\nsaid enthusiastically, gossiping about her in a circle of ladies. But this\nwas received with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediately\ncalled him a \"naughty man,\" to his great satisfaction.\n\nAs she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya,\nwho looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at once. After the\nfirst inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her,\nhesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous manner, on what\nterms she was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov.\nTo this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied:\n\n\"He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance during the\nlast month.\" To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and\nwith complete frankness, that, though \"at times\" she had thought him\nattractive, she had not loved him, but had won his heart as well as his\nold father's \"in my nasty spite,\" that she had seen that Mitya was very\njealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only amused\nher. She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply been\nlaughing at him. \"I had no thoughts for either of them all this last\nmonth. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,\" she\nsaid in conclusion, \"that there's no need for you to inquire about that,\nnor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair.\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissed\nthe \"romantic\" aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is,\nto the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles.\nGrushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had\ncertainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had\nnot counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand\nfrom Dmitri Fyodorovitch's own lips.\n\n\"Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear\nhim speak of it to others in your presence?\" the prosecutor inquired\nimmediately.\n\nTo which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other\npeople, and had heard him say so when they were alone.\n\n\"Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?\" inquired the\nprosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.\nFurther examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money\nhad come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina\nIvanovna.\n\n\"And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not\nthree thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that\nsum for his own use?\"\n\n\"No, I never heard that,\" answered Grushenka.\n\nIt was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her\nthat he hadn't a farthing.\n\n\"He was always expecting to get some from his father,\" said Grushenka in\nconclusion.\n\n\"Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\"\nNikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \"that he intended to make an attempt\non his father's life?\"\n\n\"Ach, he did say so,\" sighed Grushenka.\n\n\"Once or several times?\"\n\n\"He mentioned it several times, always in anger.\"\n\n\"And did you believe he would do it?\"\n\n\"No, I never believed it,\" she answered firmly. \"I had faith in his noble\nheart.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, allow me,\" cried Mitya suddenly, \"allow me to say one word to\nAgrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.\"\n\n\"You can speak,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.\n\n\"Agrafena Alexandrovna!\" Mitya got up from his chair, \"have faith in God\nand in me. I am not guilty of my father's murder!\"\n\nHaving uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair. Grushenka\nstood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. \"Thanks be to Thee,\nO Lord,\" she said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still standing,\nshe turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added:\n\n\"As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He'll say anything as a\njoke or from obstinacy, but he'll never deceive you against his\nconscience. He's telling the whole truth, you may believe it.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you've given me fresh courage,\" Mitya\nresponded in a quivering voice.\n\nAs to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not know\nwhat sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had three\nthousand with him. And to the question where he got the money, she said\nthat he had told her that he had \"stolen\" it from Katerina Ivanovna, and\nthat she had replied to that that he hadn't stolen it, and that he must\npay the money back next day. On the prosecutor's asking her emphatically\nwhether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he\nhad spent yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she\ndeclared that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was how\nshe understood him.\n\nGrushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her\nimpulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could\nbe of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she would care\nfor an escort, he ... would be--\n\n\"I thank you sincerely,\" said Grushenka, bowing to him, \"I'm going with\nthis old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and meanwhile,\nif you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri\nFyodorovitch.\"\n\nShe went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only for\na moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness.\nHis eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the witnesses was,\nat last, over. They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya\ngot up, moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a\nlarge chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.\n\nHe had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the\ntime.\n\nHe was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed long\nago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses,\nthrough snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November, and the\nsnow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched the\nearth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair, long beard. He\nwas not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on a gray peasant's\nsmock. Not far off was a village, he could see the black huts, and half\nthe huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.\nAnd as they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a\nlot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of\nbrownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman, who looked\nforty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin face. And in her\narms was a little baby crying. And her breasts seemed so dried up that\nthere was not a drop of milk in them. And the child cried and cried, and\nheld out its little bare arms, with its little fists blue from cold.\n\n\"Why are they crying? Why are they crying?\" Mitya asked, as they dashed\ngayly by.\n\n\"It's the babe,\" answered the driver, \"the babe weeping.\"\n\nAnd Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, \"the babe,\" and he\nliked the peasant's calling it a \"babe.\" There seemed more pity in it.\n\n\"But why is it weeping?\" Mitya persisted stupidly, \"why are its little\narms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?\"\n\n\"The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm it.\"\n\n\"But why is it? Why?\" foolish Mitya still persisted.\n\n\"Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're begging\nbecause they've been burnt out.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. \"Tell me why it is\nthose poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe poor?\nWhy is the steppe barren? Why don't they hug each other and kiss? Why\ndon't they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black misery? Why\ndon't they feed the babe?\"\n\nAnd he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,\nyet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way. And\nhe felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, was\nrising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do something\nfor them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that the dark-\nfaced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tears\nagain from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at once,\nregardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.\n\n\"And I'm coming with you. I won't leave you now for the rest of my life,\nI'm coming with you,\" he heard close beside him Grushenka's tender voice,\nthrilling with emotion. And his heart glowed, and he struggled forward\ntowards the light, and he longed to live, to live, to go on and on,\ntowards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!\n\n\"What! Where?\" he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the chest,\nas though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay\nParfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the\nprotocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an\nhour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenly\nstruck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head, which hadn't\nbeen there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.\n\n\"Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?\" he cried, with a\nsort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some great\nkindness had been shown him.\n\nHe never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant\nwitnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary, had compassionately\nthought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole soul was quivering\nwith tears. He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they\nliked.\n\n\"I've had a good dream, gentlemen,\" he said in a strange voice, with a new\nlight, as of joy, in his face.\n\n\n\nChapter IX. They Carry Mitya Away\n\n\nWhen the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to\nthe prisoner and read him the \"Committal,\" setting forth, that in such a\nyear, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer of such-\nand-such a district court, having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya)\naccused of this and of that (all the charges were carefully written out)\nand having considered that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges\nmade against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while the\nwitnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such\ntestify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of\nthe Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order to preclude so-and-\nso (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he be detained\nin such-and-such a prison, which he hereby notifies to the accused and\ncommunicates a copy of this same \"Committal\" to the deputy prosecutor, and\nso on, and so on.\n\nIn brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a prisoner,\nand that he would be driven at once to the town, and there shut up in a\nvery unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I don't blame you. I'm ready.... I understand that\nthere's nothing else for you to do.\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at once\nby the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be on\nthe spot....\n\n\"Stay,\" Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable\nfeeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:\n\n\"Gentlemen, we're all cruel, we're all monsters, we all make men weep, and\nmothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now,\nof all I am the lowest reptile! I've sworn to amend, and every day I've\ndone the same filthy things. I understand now that such men as I need a\nblow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a\nforce from without. Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the\nthunderbolt has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my public\nshame, I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps I\nshall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not\nguilty of my father's blood. I accept my punishment, not because I killed\nhim, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really might have\nkilled him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I warn you of that.\nI'll fight it out with you to the end, and then God will decide. Good-by,\ngentlemen, don't be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the\nexamination. Oh, I was still such a fool then.... In another minute I\nshall be a prisoner, but now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri\nKaramazov offers you his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to all\nmen.\"\n\nHis voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay\nParfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden, almost\nnervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya instantly noticed\nthis, and started. He let his outstretched hand fall at once.\n\n\"The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,\" Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered,\nsomewhat embarrassed. \"We will continue it in the town, and I, for my\npart, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your defense....\nAs a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I've always been disposed to\nregard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty. All of us here,\nif I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready to recognize that\nyou are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas, one who has been\ncarried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree....\"\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch's little figure was positively majestic by the time\nhe had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another minute this\n\"boy\" would take his arm, lead him to another corner, and renew their\nconversation about \"girls.\" But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate\nthoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to\nexecution.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _her_ to say 'good-by'\nfor the last time?\" asked Mitya.\n\n\"Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it's impossible except in the\npresence of--\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!\"\n\nGrushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words,\nand did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka made a deep bow\nto Mitya.\n\n\"I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow you for\never, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though\nyou've been your own undoing.\"\n\nHer lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.\n\n\"Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.\"\n\nMitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went out. He\nwas at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him. At the\nbottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day\nbefore with Andrey's three horses, two carts stood in readiness. Mavriky\nMavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed\nabout something, some sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. He\nasked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.\n\n\"When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a different\nface,\" thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was a crowd of\npeople, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down the\nsteps too. All stared at Mitya.\n\n\"Forgive me at parting, good people!\" Mitya shouted suddenly from the\ncart.\n\n\"Forgive us too!\" he heard two or three voices.\n\n\"Good-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!\"\n\nBut Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps, too\nbusy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something. It appeared that\neverything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two constables\nwere to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had been ordered\nto drive the second cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly maintaining\nthat it was not his turn to go, but Akim's. But Akim was not to be seen.\nThey ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.\n\n\"You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They've no shame!\"\nexclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. \"Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the day\nbefore yesterday. You've drunk it all and now you cry out. I'm simply\nsurprised at your good-nature, with our low peasants, Mavriky\nMavrikyevitch, that's all I can say.\"\n\n\"But what do we want a second cart for?\" Mitya put in. \"Let's start with\nthe one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won't be unruly, I won't run away from\nyou, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?\"\n\n\"I'll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you've never been\ntaught. I'm not 'old fellow' to you, and you can keep your advice for\nanother time!\" Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as though glad\nto vent his wrath.\n\nMitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment later he felt\nsuddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was still\novercast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face.\n\n\"I've taken a chill,\" thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.\n\nAt last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down heavily,\nand, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the corner. It is\ntrue that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had been\nlaid upon him.\n\n\"Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!\" Mitya shouted again, and felt himself,\nthat he had not called out this time from good-nature, but involuntarily,\nfrom resentment.\n\nBut Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his back,\nand staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he made no\nreply.\n\n\"Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!\" he heard all at once the voice of\nKalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he held out\nhis hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.\n\nMitya had time to seize and press his hand.\n\n\"Good-by, dear fellow! I shan't forget your generosity,\" he cried warmly.\n\nBut the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and\nMitya was driven off.\n\nKalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face in\nhis hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that, crying\nas though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty. Oh, he\nbelieved almost without doubt in Mitya's guilt.\n\n\"What are these people? What can men be after this?\" he exclaimed\nincoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that moment he had\nno desire to live.\n\n\"Is it worth it? Is it worth it?\" exclaimed the boy in his grief.\n\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\n\n\nBook X. The Boys\n\n\n\nChapter I. Kolya Krassotkin\n\n\nIt was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost, eleven\ndegrees Reaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the\nfrozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and\nblowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the\nmarket-place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.\n\nNot far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there stood a\nsmall house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to Madame\nKrassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been dead\nfor fourteen years. His widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two,\nwas living in her neat little house on her private means. She lived in\nrespectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition.\nShe was about eighteen at the time of her husband's death; she had been\nmarried only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of his\ndeath she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her\nprecious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately\nthose fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than happiness.\nShe had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid\nhe would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a\nchair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When Kolya began going to\nschool, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him\nso as to help him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened to\nmake the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to\nKolya's schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving\nKolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far\nthat the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him\nwith being a \"mother's darling.\"\n\nBut the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy, \"tremendously\nstrong,\" as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to be the fact; he\nwas agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper. He\nwas good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he could\nbeat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Though\nhe looked down upon every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious.\nHe accepted his schoolfellows' respect as his due, but was friendly with\nthem. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself\non occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped\nthat last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach\nof discipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion\nas the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of\nmischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something\neffective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make even\nhis mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her.\nShe gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one\nthought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her. She\nwas always fancying that Kolya was \"unfeeling\" to her, and at times,\ndissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him with his\ncoldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feeling\nwere demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them. Yet\nit was not intentional on his part but instinctive--it was his character.\nHis mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He only disliked\n\"sheepish sentimentality,\" as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.\n\nThere was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his\nfather's. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them by\nhimself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at\nseeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead\nof going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for\nhis age.\n\nThough the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his mischief, he\nhad of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm. It\nis true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild mad\nrecklessness.\n\nIt happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and son\nwent to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with a\ndistant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway station\n(the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month later\nIvan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There Kolya began by\ncarefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowing\nthat he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly\nacquired knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the place\nwith whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the station,\nothers in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all between\ntwelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town. The boys played\ntogether, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya's stay at the station, a\nmad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest\nof the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was\nmoved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he\nwould lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train\nwas due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over\nhim at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation, from\nwhich it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails\nthat the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was no\njoke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at\nhim, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on.\nWhat piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses\nat him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as \"a\nsmall boy,\" not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable\ninsult.\n\nAnd so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station,\nso that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the\nstation. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. At\nthe time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had\ntaken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts\nbeating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last\nthey heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.\nTwo red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it\napproached.\n\n\"Run, run away from the rails,\" the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes,\nbreathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew\npast. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling\nat him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word.\nThen he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to\nfrighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as\nhe confessed long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as \"a\ndesperate character,\" was established for ever. He returned home to the\nstation as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous\nfever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The\nincident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the town\nit penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters. But\nthen Kolya's mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy's behalf,\nand in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exerted\nhimself in his favor, and the affair was ignored.\n\nDardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in love\nwith Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about a\nyear previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of his\nsentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage. But she\nrefused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an act of\ntreachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certain\nmysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an object of\naversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya's\nmad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for\nhis intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was\na faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy\nthat it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy. He was\nfond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win\nhim over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, kept\nhim at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he was\nsecond in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class\nfirmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he could\n\"beat\" even Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, \"Who\nfounded Troy?\" to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring\nto the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period,\nto the mythical legends. But the question, \"Who had founded Troy?\" that\nis, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for some reason\nregarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the boys remained\nconvinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of\nthe founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in\nhis father's bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the\nquestion, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell\nhis secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.\n\nAfter the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya's\nattitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard of\nher son's exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She had\nsuch terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several\ndays, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor that\nsuch pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the\nholy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's\ninstance, and the \"manly\" Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And\nall that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's\narms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as \"unfeeling\" as before, but he had\nbecome more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.\n\nSix weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even\nbrought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a\nscrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as it\nturned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.\nBut of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more\nuneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must be\nnoted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov's heart\nand, of course, despised him profoundly for his \"feelings\"; he had in the\npast been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting\nvaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the\nrailway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not\nallow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more\nrespectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman at\nonce appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the slightest mention of\nDardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's presence, she would flush as pink as a\nrose. At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling,\nor would investigate the state of his boots, or would shout angrily for\n\"Perezvon,\" the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month\nbefore, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not\nshowing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully,\nteaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him\nwhenever he was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with\ndelight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground\npretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he had\ntaught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of his\nexcited and grateful heart.\n\nI have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy\nstabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son\nof Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when the\nschoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname \"wisp of tow.\"\n\n\n\nChapter II. Children\n\n\nAnd so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkin\nwas sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school. It had just\nstruck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out \"on very urgent\nbusiness,\" but he was left alone in charge of the house, for it so\nhappened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and\nsingular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated from\nthe rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor's wife with her two small\nchildren. This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great\nfriend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve\nmonths before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the\nlast six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it not been for her\nfriendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to the\nforsaken lady, she would certainly have completely dissolved away in\ntears. And now, to add to her misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was\nsuddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her mistress's\namazement, that she proposed to bring a child into the world before\nmorning. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed\nthe probability of it before. The astounded doctor's wife decided to move\nKaterina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept\nby a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant,\nshe promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her.\nBy the morning all Madame Krassotkin's friendly sympathy and energy were\ncalled upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the\ncase.\n\nSo both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins' servant,\nAgafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time to\nprotect and look after \"the kids,\" that is, the son and daughter of the\ndoctor's wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking care of\nthe house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without\nmoving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro\nthrough the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two\nloud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the\nwhistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless\ndog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that\ntroubled Kolya was \"the kids.\" He looked, of course, with the utmost scorn\non Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he was very fond of the bereaved\n\"kiddies,\" and had already taken them a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, a\ngirl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond\nof being read to by her. Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more\ndiverting entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side by\nside and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the\nhouse. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so\nmuch so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses\nwith the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like a\ntrace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out\nthat to play horses with boys of one's own age, boys of thirteen, would\ncertainly be disgraceful \"at this date,\" but that he did it for the sake\nof \"the kids\" because he liked them, and no one had a right to call him to\naccount for his feelings. The two \"kids\" adored him.\n\nBut on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very important\nbusiness of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhile\ntime was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children,\nwould not come back from market. He had several times already crossed the\npassage, opened the door of the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at \"the\nkids\" who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he\nopened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do\nsomething delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not go\nin.\n\nAt last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if\nthat \"damned\" Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out\nwithout waiting for her, making \"the kids\" promise, of course, to be brave\nwhen he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright. With this\nidea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar,\nslung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother's\nconstantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in\nsuch cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall\nand went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor\nclothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with his\ntail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya,\nseeing his dog's passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach of\ndiscipline, kept him for another minute under the bench, and only when he\nhad opened the door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up\nlike a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.\n\nKolya opened the door to peep at \"the kids.\" They were both sitting as\nbefore at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something. The\nchildren often argued together about various exciting problems of life,\nand Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya did not\nagree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his\nverdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time the \"kids'\"\ndiscussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage\nto listen. The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute\nwith even greater energy.\n\n\"I shall never, never believe,\" Nastya prattled, \"that the old women find\nbabies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It's winter now and there\nare no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn't have taken Katerina a\ndaughter.\"\n\nKolya whistled to himself.\n\n\"Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who are\nmarried.\"\n\nKostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.\n\n\"Nastya, how silly you are!\" he said at last, firmly and calmly. \"How can\nKaterina have a baby when she isn't married?\"\n\nNastya was exasperated.\n\n\"You know nothing about it,\" she snapped irritably. \"Perhaps she has a\nhusband, only he is in prison, so now she's got a baby.\"\n\n\"But is her husband in prison?\" the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired\ngravely.\n\n\"Or, I tell you what,\" Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely\nrejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. \"She hasn't a husband, you\nare right there, but she wants to be married, and so she's been thinking\nof getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now she's got it,\nthat is, not a husband but a baby.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps so,\" Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. \"But you didn't\nsay so before. So how could I tell?\"\n\n\"Come, kiddies,\" said Kolya, stepping into the room. \"You're terrible\npeople, I see.\"\n\n\"And Perezvon with you!\" grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingers\nand calling Perezvon.\n\n\"I am in a difficulty, kids,\" Krassotkin began solemnly, \"and you must\nhelp me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up till\nnow, that's certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?\"\n\nThe children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showed\nsigns of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of\nthem.\n\n\"You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on the cupboard and\nbreak your legs? You won't be frightened alone and cry?\"\n\nA look of profound despondency came into the children's faces.\n\n\"And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon which\ncan be fired with real gunpowder.\"\n\nThe children's faces instantly brightened. \"Show us the cannon,\" said\nKostya, beaming all over.\n\nKrassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronze\ncannon stood it on the table.\n\n\"Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels.\" He rolled the toy\non along the table. \"And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded with\nshot and fired off.\"\n\n\"And it could kill any one?\"\n\n\"It can kill any one; you've only got to aim at anybody,\" and Krassotkin\nexplained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolled\nin, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kicked\nwhen it was fired.\n\nThe children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck\ntheir imagination was that the cannon kicked.\n\n\"And have you got any powder?\" Nastya inquired.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Show us the powder, too,\" she drawled with a smile of entreaty.\n\nKrassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask\ncontaining a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw of\npaper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm\nof his hand.\n\n\"One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow up and kill\nus all,\" Krassotkin warned them sensationally.\n\nThe children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only\nintensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.\n\n\"And does the shot burn?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No, it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Give me a little shot,\" he asked in an imploring voice.\n\n\"I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it to your\nmother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's gunpowder, and\nwill die of fright and give you a thrashing.\"\n\n\"Mother never does whip us,\" Nastya observed at once.\n\n\"I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you ever deceive\nyour mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can\nI go out? You won't be frightened and cry when I'm gone?\"\n\n\"We sha--all cry,\" drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.\n\n\"We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,\" Nastya chimed in with timid\nhaste.\n\n\"Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! There's no\nhelp for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don't know how\nlong. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!\"\n\n\"Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!\" Kostya begged.\n\n\"There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. _Ici_,\nPerezvon.\" And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his\ntricks.\n\nHe was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of lilac-\ngray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was torn. He\nwhined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on his back with\nhis paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While this last\nperformance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's\nservant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox, appeared in the\ndoorway. She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in\nher hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood\nstill to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return,\nhe did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon dead for\nthe usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped up and began\nbounding about in his joy at having done his duty.\n\n\"Only think, a dog!\" Agafya observed sententiously.\n\n\"Why are you late, female?\" asked Krassotkin sternly.\n\n\"Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.\"\n\n\"Brat?\"\n\n\"Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you may be sure\nI have good reason,\" muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove,\nwithout a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed quite\npleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master.\n\n\"Listen, you frivolous young woman,\" Krassotkin began, getting up from the\nsofa, \"can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something\nelse besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence?\nI am going out.\"\n\n\"And what am I going to swear for?\" laughed Agafya. \"I shall look after\nthem without that.\"\n\n\"No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't go.\"\n\n\"Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out; stay at\nhome.\"\n\n\"Kids,\" Kolya turned to the children, \"this woman will stay with you till\nI come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been back\nlong ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll give them something,\nAgafya, won't you?\"\n\n\"That I can do.\"\n\n\"Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,\" he added\ngravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, \"I hope you'll spare their\ntender years and not tell them any of your old woman's nonsense about\nKaterina. _Ici_, Perezvon!\"\n\n\"Get along with you!\" retorted Agafya, really angry this time. \"Ridiculous\nboy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that's what you want!\"\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Schoolboy\n\n\nBut Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at the\ngate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying \"It is\nfreezing,\" went straight along the street and turned off to the right\ntowards the market-place. When he reached the last house but one before\nthe market-place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of his\npocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal. He had\nnot to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven,\nwearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This\nwas Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya\nKrassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden by\nhis parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a\ndesperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly.\nHe was--if the reader has not forgotten--one of the group of boys who two\nmonths before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the one who told Alyosha\nKaramazov about Ilusha.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,\" said Smurov\nstolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.\n\n\"I am late,\" answered Krassotkin. \"I was detained by circumstances. You\nwon't be thrashed for coming with me?\"\n\n\"Come, I say, I'm never thrashed! And you've got Perezvon with you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're taking him, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!\"\n\n\"That's impossible. Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mists\nof obscurity.\"\n\n\"Ah! couldn't we do this?\" Smurov suddenly stood still. \"You see Ilusha\nsays that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon.\nCouldn't you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe you?\"\n\n\"Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object--that's\nanother. Above all, I hope you've not told them anything about my coming.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won't comfort him with\nPerezvon,\" said Smurov, with a sigh. \"You know his father, the captain,\n'the wisp of tow,' told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff\npup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I\ndoubt it.\"\n\n\"And how is Ilusha?\"\n\n\"Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he's in consumption: he is quite\nconscious, but his breathing! His breathing's gone wrong. The other day he\nasked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to walk, but\nhe couldn't stand. 'Ah, I told you before, father,' he said, 'that those\nboots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.' He fancied it\nwas his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really.\nHe won't live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they are\nrich again--they've got heaps of money.\"\n\n\"They are rogues.\"\n\n\"Who are rogues?\"\n\n\"Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of course,\nindividually. I don't believe in medicine. It's a useless institution. I\nmean to go into all that. But what's that sentimentality you've got up\nthere? The whole class seems to be there every day.\"\n\n\"Not the whole class: it's only ten of our fellows who go to see him every\nday. There's nothing in that.\"\n\n\"What I don't understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is\ntaking in it. His brother's going to be tried to-morrow or next day for\nsuch a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with\nboys.\"\n\n\"There's no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make it\nup with Ilusha.\"\n\n\"Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one to\nanalyze my actions.\"\n\n\"And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you are\ncoming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn't come all this time?\" Smurov\ncried with sudden warmth.\n\n\"My dear boy, that's my business, not yours. I am going of myself because\nI choose to, but you've all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov--there's\na difference, you know. And how do you know? I may not be going to make it\nup at all. It's a stupid expression.\"\n\n\"It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his doing. Our fellows began going\nthere of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And\nthere's been nothing of that sort--no silliness. First one went, and then\nanother. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply\ngo out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha's dying. And he\nseems so glad we've made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that\nwas all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind\nor hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very\ndecent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that murderer\nwho beat him then.\"\n\n\"Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his\nacquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.\nBesides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.\"\n\nKolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, of\ncourse, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a\nlevel with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya's saying that\nhe was \"going of himself\" to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be some\nmystery in Kolya's suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day.\nThey crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded\nwagons from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market women\nwere selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These\nSunday markets were naively called \"fairs\" in the town, and there were\nmany such fairs in the year.\n\nPerezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side,\nthen the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other\nover according to the rules of canine etiquette.\n\n\"I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,\" said Kolya suddenly.\n\"Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It seems\nto be a law of their nature.\"\n\n\"Yes; it's a funny habit.\"\n\n\"No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny in nature,\nhowever funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs could reason\nand criticize us they'd be sure to find just as much that would be funny\nto them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, their\nmasters--far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am convinced that there\nis far more foolishness among us. That's Rakitin's idea--a remarkable idea.\nI am a Socialist, Smurov.\"\n\n\"And what is a Socialist?\" asked Smurov.\n\n\"That's when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no\nmarriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best, and all\nthe rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet. It's cold,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just now.\"\n\n\"Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don't feel so\ncold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do\nnow, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelve\ndegrees, especially when there is not much snow. It's because people are\nnot used to it. Everything is habit with men, everything even in their\nsocial and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What a\nfunny-looking peasant!\"\n\nKolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a long\nsheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together his\nhands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long fair\nbeard was all white with frost.\n\n\"That peasant's beard's frozen,\" Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice\nas he passed him.\n\n\"Lots of people's beards are frozen,\" the peasant replied, calmly and\nsententiously.\n\n\"Don't provoke him,\" observed Smurov.\n\n\"It's all right; he won't be cross; he's a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Is your name Matvey?\"\n\n\"Yes. Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. It was a guess.\"\n\n\"You don't say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You get whipped, I expect?\"\n\n\"Nothing to speak of--sometimes.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, it does.\"\n\n\"Ech, what a life!\" The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his\nheart.\n\n\"Good-by, Matvey.\"\n\n\"Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.\"\n\nThe boys went on.\n\n\"That was a nice peasant,\" Kolya observed to Smurov. \"I like talking to\nthe peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.\"\n\n\"Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?\" asked Smurov.\n\n\"I had to say that to please him.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing twice. I like\npeople to understand at the first word. Some things can't be explained.\nAccording to a peasant's notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must be\nwhipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped? And if I were\nto tell him we are not, he'd be disappointed. But you don't understand\nthat. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.\"\n\n\"Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another scrape as you\ndid about that goose.\"\n\n\"So you're afraid?\"\n\n\"Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be awfully\ncross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.\"\n\n\"Don't be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!\" he\nshouted to a market woman in one of the booths.\n\n\"Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,\" the middle-aged market\nwoman shouted at him.\n\n\"I am so glad it's Marya. Good-by!\"\n\n\"Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!\"\n\n\"I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.\" Kolya\nwaved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he her.\n\n\"I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent young\nmonkey. I didn't say anything,\" bawled Marya. \"You want a whipping, that's\nwhat you want, you saucy jackanapes!\"\n\nThere was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her.\nSuddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close\nby. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hair\nand a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and\na peaked cap, and looked like a merchant's clerk. He was in a state of\nstupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.\n\n\"I know you!\" he cried angrily, \"I know you!\"\n\nKolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row with\nthe man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could\nhardly remember them all.\n\n\"Do you?\" he asked sarcastically.\n\n\"I know you! I know you!\" the man repeated idiotically.\n\n\"So much the better for you. Well, it's time I was going. Good-by!\"\n\n\"You are at your saucy pranks again?\" cried the man. \"You are at your\nsaucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!\"\n\n\"It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,\" said\nKolya, standing still and scanning him.\n\n\"Not my business?\"\n\n\"No; it's not your business.\"\n\n\"Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?\"\n\n\"It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours.\"\n\n\"What Trifon Nikititch?\" asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement\nat Kolya, but still as angry as ever.\n\nKolya scanned him gravely.\n\n\"Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?\" he suddenly asked him,\nwith stern emphasis.\n\n\"What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven't,\" said the young man,\nsomewhat taken aback.\n\n\"Do you know Sabaneyev?\" Kolya went on even more emphatically and even\nmore severely.\n\n\"What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him.\"\n\n\"Well then you can go to the devil,\" said Kolya, cutting short the\nconversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his\nway as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not\neven know Sabaneyev.\n\n\"Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?\" the young man recovered from his momentary\nstupefaction and was as excited as before. \"What did he say?\" He turned to\nthe market women with a silly stare.\n\nThe women laughed.\n\n\"You can never tell what he's after,\" said one of them.\n\n\"What Sabaneyev is it he's talking about?\" the young man repeated, still\nfurious and brandishing his right arm.\n\n\"It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that's who it must\nbe,\" one of the women suggested.\n\nThe young man stared at her wildly.\n\n\"For the Kuzmitchovs?\" repeated another woman. \"But his name wasn't\nTrifon. His name's Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch,\nso it can't be the same.\"\n\n\"His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it's Tchizhov,\" put in suddenly\na third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely. \"Alexey\nIvanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov,\" a fourth woman emphatically\nconfirmed the statement.\n\nThe bewildered youth gazed from one to another.\n\n\"But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?\" he cried\nalmost in desperation. \" 'Do you know Sabaneyev?' says he. And who the\ndevil's to know who is Sabaneyev?\"\n\n\"You're a senseless fellow. I tell you it's not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov,\nAlexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that's who it is!\" one of the women shouted at\nhim impressively.\n\n\"What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.\"\n\n\"That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.\"\n\n\"And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?\"\n\n\"How can I tell what he's to do with you?\" put in another. \"You ought to\nknow yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor about him.\nHe spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Don't you really know\nhim?\"\n\n\"Know whom?\"\n\n\"Tchizhov.\"\n\n\"The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a hiding, that I\nwill. He was laughing at me!\"\n\n\"Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are a\nfool, that's what you are!\"\n\n\"Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. I'll give\nthe boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!\"\n\nThe woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along\nwith a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at the\nshouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was still\nafraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya's company.\n\n\"What Sabaneyev did you mean?\" he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his answer\nwould be.\n\n\"How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to\nstir up fools in every class of society. There's another blockhead, that\npeasant there. You know, they say 'there's no one stupider than a stupid\nFrenchman,' but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much. Can't\nyou see it all over his face that he is a fool, that peasant, eh?\"\n\n\"Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on.\"\n\n\"Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!\"\n\nA sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard,\nwho was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed not\nquite sober.\n\n\"Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,\" he said deliberately in\nreply.\n\n\"And if I am?\" laughed Kolya.\n\n\"Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no harm in a\njoke.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.\"\n\n\"Well, God forgive you!\"\n\n\"Do you forgive me, too?\"\n\n\"I quite forgive you. Go along.\"\n\n\"I say, you seem a clever peasant.\"\n\n\"Cleverer than you,\" the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same\ngravity.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.\n\n\"It's true, though.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is.\"\n\n\"It is, brother.\"\n\n\"Good-by, peasant!\"\n\n\"Good-by!\"\n\n\"There are all sorts of peasants,\" Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief\nsilence. \"How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always ready to\nrecognize intelligence in the peasantry.\"\n\nIn the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The boys made\nhaste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's lodging, a\nconsiderable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces from\nthe house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov\nto come out to him.\n\n\"One must sniff round a bit first,\" he observed to Smurov.\n\n\"Why ask him to come out?\" Smurov protested. \"You go in; they will be\nawfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making friends in the frost\nout here?\"\n\n\"I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,\" Kolya cut him short\nin the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with \"small boys,\" and Smurov\nran to do his bidding.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Lost Dog\n\n\nKolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for Alyosha\nto appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had heard a great deal\nabout him from the boys, but hitherto he had always maintained an\nappearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned, and he had\neven \"criticized\" what he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a great\nlonging to make his acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and\nattractive in all he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment was\nimportant: to begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show his\nindependence, \"Or he'll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy,\nlike the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I shall ask him\nwhen I get to know him. It's a pity I am so short, though. Tuzikov is\nyounger than I am, yet he is half a head taller. But I have a clever face.\nI am not good-looking. I know I'm hideous, but I've a clever face. I\nmustn't talk too freely; if I fall into his arms all at once, he may\nthink--Tfoo! how horrible if he should think--!\"\n\nSuch were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost to\nassume the most independent air. What distressed him most was his being so\nshort; he did not mind so much his \"hideous\" face, as being so short. On\nthe wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark to\nshow his height, and every two months since he anxiously measured himself\nagainst it to see how much he had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly,\nand this sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His face was in reality\nby no means \"hideous\"; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with a\nfair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively gray eyes had a fearless\nlook, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high cheekbones; small,\nvery red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and unmistakably\nturned up. \"I've a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,\" Kolya used to\nmutter to himself when he looked in the looking-glass, and he always left\nit with indignation. \"But perhaps I haven't got a clever face?\" he\nsometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But it must not be supposed that\nhis mind was preoccupied with his face and his height. On the contrary,\nhowever bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him, he\nquickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, \"abandoning himself\nentirely to ideas and to real life,\" as he formulated it to himself.\n\nAlyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he reached him,\nKolya could see that he looked delighted. \"Can he be so glad to see me?\"\nKolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing, that\nAlyosha's appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him\nlast. He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a\nsoft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this was very\nbecoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His charming face always\nhad a good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in\nhis good-humor. To Kolya's surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as he\nwas, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He held out his\nhand to Kolya at once.\n\n\"Here you are at last! How anxious we've been to see you!\"\n\n\"There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to\nmake your acquaintance. I've long been hoping for an opportunity, and have\nheard a great deal about you,\" Kolya muttered, a little breathless.\n\n\"We should have met anyway. I've heard a great deal about you, too; but\nyou've been a long time coming here.\"\n\n\"Tell me, how are things going?\"\n\n\"Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.\"\n\n\"How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,\" cried\nKolya warmly.\n\n\"Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, in\ndelirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to him\n... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then there's another\nreason.... Tell me, is that your dog?\"\n\n\"Yes, Perezvon.\"\n\n\"Not Zhutchka?\" Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. \"Is she\nlost for ever?\"\n\n\"I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I've heard all about it.\"\nKolya smiled mysteriously. \"Listen, Karamazov, I'll tell you all about it.\nThat's what I came for; that's what I asked you to come out here for, to\nexplain the whole episode to you before we go in,\" he began with\nanimation. \"You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory class\nlast spring. Well, you know what our preparatory class is--a lot of small\nboys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and,\nof course, I only look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weak\nand small, but he wouldn't give in to them; he fought with them. I saw he\nwas proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that. And\nthey teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was horribly dressed\nat the time, his breeches were too small for him, and there were holes in\nhis boots. They worried him about it; they jeered at him. That I can't\nstand. I stood up for him at once, and gave it to them hot. I beat them,\nbut they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?\" Kolya boasted impulsively;\n\"but I am always fond of children. I've two chickens in my hands at home\nnow--that's what detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I\ntook him under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that,\nthe boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he\ndid my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copy\nme. In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once, and\nI'd go about with him. On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an older\nboy makes friends with a younger one like that; but that's a prejudice. If\nit's my fancy, that's enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Why\nshouldn't I develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken up\nwith all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the younger\ngeneration--to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you this\ntrait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than\nanything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was a sort\nof softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have a\npositive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from a\nbaby. There were contradictions in him, too: he was proud, but he was\nslavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he'd\nrefuse to agree with me; he'd argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to\npropound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he\ndisagreed with the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me,\nbecause I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order to\ntrain him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became. I did it on\npurpose: that was my idea. My object was to form his character, to lick\nhim into shape, to make a man of him ... and besides ... no doubt, you\nunderstand me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession\nhe was downcast and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for\nsomething else, something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was.\nI have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know\nSmerdyakov, who was footman to your late father--it was before his death,\nof course--and he taught the little fool a silly trick--that is, a brutal,\nnasty trick. He told him to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it,\nand throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without\nbiting it, and then to watch and see what would happen. So they prepared a\npiece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there's\nbeen such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never fed\nit at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking,\nKaramazov? I can't stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, and\nbegan to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as it\nran out of sight. That was Ilusha's own account of it. He confessed it to\nme, and cried bitterly. He hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on\nrepeating 'He ran away squealing': the sight of that haunted him. He was\ntormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined\nto give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I wasn't\nquite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than I\nwas. 'You've done a nasty thing,' I said, 'you are a scoundrel. I won't\ntell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with you for a\ntime. I'll think it over and let you know through Smurov'--that's the boy\nwho's just come with me; he's always ready to do anything for me--'whether\nI will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up\nfor good as a scoundrel.' He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I'd\ngone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I\nthought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him\nthat I would not speak to him again. That's what we call it when two\nschoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another.\nSecretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then, if\nI saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him again. That was my\nintention. But what do you think happened? He heard Smurov's message, his\neyes flashed. 'Tell Krassotkin from me,' he cried, 'that I will throw\nbread with pins to all the dogs--all--all of them!' 'So he's going in for a\nlittle temper. We must smoke it out of him.' And I began to treat him with\ncontempt; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. And\njust then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You must\nrealize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already. The\nboys, seeing I'd given him up, set on him and taunted him, shouting, 'Wisp\nof tow, wisp of tow!' And he had soon regular skirmishes with them, which\nI am very sorry for. They seem to have given him one very bad beating. One\nday he flew at them all as they were coming out of school. I stood a few\nyards off, looking on. And, I swear, I don't remember that I laughed; it\nwas quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him, in another minute I\nwould have run up to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I don't\nknow what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and\nstruck at my thigh, here in my right leg. I didn't move. I don't mind\nowning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him\ncontemptuously, as though to say, 'This is how you repay all my kindness!\nDo it again, if you like, I'm at your service.' But he didn't stab me\nagain; he broke down, he was frightened at what he had done, he threw away\nthe knife, burst out crying, and ran away. I did not sneak on him, of\ncourse, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn't come to the ears\nof the masters. I didn't even tell my mother till it had healed up. And\nthe wound was a mere scratch. And then I heard that the same day he'd been\nthrowing stones and had bitten your finger--but you understand now what a\nstate he was in! Well, it can't be helped: it was stupid of me not to come\nand forgive him--that is, to make it up with him--when he was taken ill. I\nam sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now I've told you all\nabout it ... but I'm afraid it was stupid of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a pity,\" exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, \"that I didn't know\nbefore what terms you were on with him, or I'd have come to you long ago\nto beg you to go to him with me. Would you believe it, when he was\nfeverish he talked about you in delirium. I didn't know how much you were\nto him! And you've really not succeeded in finding that dog? His father\nand the boys have been hunting all over the town for it. Would you believe\nit, since he's been ill, I've three times heard him repeat with tears,\n'It's because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God is\npunishing me for it.' He can't get that idea out of his head. And if the\ndog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy the joy\nwould cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him?\" Kolya\nasked, with great curiosity. \"Why did you reckon on me rather than any one\nelse?\"\n\n\"There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you would\nbring it when you'd found it. Smurov said something of the sort. We've all\nbeen trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that it's been seen.\nThe boys brought him a live hare; he just looked at it, with a faint\nsmile, and asked them to set it free in the fields. And so we did. His\nfather has just this moment come back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hoping\nto comfort him with that; but I think it only makes it worse.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him, but what\ndo you make of him--a mountebank, a buffoon?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed.\nBuffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom they\ndaren't speak the truth, from having been for years humiliated and\nintimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery is\nsometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is centered in Ilusha,\nand if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with grief or kill himself. I\nfeel almost certain of that when I look at him now.\"\n\n\"I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,\" Kolya\nadded, with feeling.\n\n\"And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you were\nbringing.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is\nPerezvon. I'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more\nthan the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in a\nminute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!\" Kolya cried suddenly. \"You've\nno overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we\nare all egoists, Karamazov!\"\n\n\"Don't trouble; it is cold, but I don't often catch cold. Let us go in,\nthough, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called Kolya,\nbut what else?\"\n\n\"Nikolay--Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in official\ndocuments, 'Krassotkin son.' \" Kolya laughed for some reason, but added\nsuddenly, \"Of course I hate my name Nikolay.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"It's so trivial, so ordinary.\"\n\n\"You are thirteen?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"No, fourteen--that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight. I'll\nconfess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since it's our first\nmeeting, so that you may understand my character at once. I hate being\nasked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... there's a libelous story\ngoing about me, that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys.\nIt's a fact that I did play with them, but it's a perfect libel to say I\ndid it for my own amusement. I have reasons for believing that you've\nheard the story; but I wasn't playing for my own amusement, it was for the\nsake of the children, because they couldn't think of anything to do by\nthemselves. But they've always got some silly tale. This is an awful town\nfor gossip, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what's the\nharm?\"\n\n\"Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don't play horses, do you?\"\n\n\"But you must look at it like this,\" said Alyosha, smiling. \"Grown-up\npeople go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes\nare represented--sometimes there are robbers and battles, too--and isn't\nthat just the same thing, in a different form, of course? And young\npeople's games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in\nits first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic instincts\nof the young. And sometimes these games are much better than performances\nin the theater, the only difference is that people go there to look at the\nactors, while in these games the young people are the actors themselves.\nBut that's only natural.\"\n\n\"You think so? Is that your idea?\" Kolya looked at him intently. \"Oh, you\nknow, that's rather an interesting view. When I go home, I'll think it\nover. I'll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I've come to\nlearn of you, Karamazov,\" Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneous\nfeeling.\n\n\"And I of you,\" said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.\n\nKolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that he\ntreated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he\nwere \"quite grown up.\"\n\n\"I'll show you something directly, Karamazov; it's a theatrical\nperformance, too,\" he said, laughing nervously. \"That's why I've come.\"\n\n\"Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys\nleave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm only coming in for a minute. I'll keep on my overcoat. Perezvon\nwill stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon, lie down and\nbe dead! You see how he's dead. I'll go in first and explore, then I'll\nwhistle to him when I think fit, and you'll see, he'll dash in like mad.\nOnly Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment. I'll arrange\nit all and you'll see something.\"\n\n\n\nChapter V. By Ilusha's Bedside\n\n\nThe room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is\nalready familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment\nwith a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and\nthough all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha\nwho had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the\nfact. All the art he had used had been to take them, one by one, to\nIlusha, without \"sheepish sentimentality,\" appearing to do so casually and\nwithout design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. He\nwas greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy\nshown him by these boys, who had been his enemies. Krassotkin was the only\none missing and his absence was a heavy load on Ilusha's heart. Perhaps\nthe bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing Krassotkin, who\nhad been his one friend and protector. Clever little Smurov, who was the\nfirst to make it up with Ilusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted\nto Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something, the\nlatter cut him short, bidding Smurov tell \"Karamazov\" at once that he knew\nbest what to do, that he wanted no one's advice, and that, if he went to\nsee Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he had \"his own reasons.\"\n\nThat was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha had not been\nto see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited, he sent Smurov to\nhim twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt, impatient\nrefusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any more, that if he\ncame himself, he, Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha at all. Up to the\nvery last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that\nmorning, and only the evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolya\nabruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning, for he would go\nwith him to the Snegiryovs', but warned him on no account to say he was\ncoming, as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov's fancy\nthat Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya had\ndropped that \"they must be asses not to find the dog, if it was alive.\"\nWhen Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly hinted at his guess about\nthe dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent rage. \"I'm not such an ass as to\ngo hunting about the town for other people's dogs when I've got a dog of\nmy own! And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a\npin? Sheepish sentimentality, that's what it is!\"\n\nFor the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikons\nin the corner. He had not been to school since the day he met Alyosha and\nbit his finger. He was taken ill the same day, though for a month\nafterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and\npassage. But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without\nhelp from his father. His father was terribly concerned about him. He even\ngave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die.\nAnd often, especially after leading him round the room on his arm and\nputting him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the passage and,\nleaning his head against the wall, he would break into paroxysms of\nviolent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha.\n\nReturning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to amuse and\ncomfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories, funny anecdotes, or\nwould mimic comic people he had happened to meet, even imitate the howls\nand cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear to see his father fooling\nand playing the buffoon. Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked\nit, he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt,\nand he was continually haunted by the memory of the \"wisp of tow\" and that\n\"terrible day.\"\n\nNina, Ilusha's gentle, crippled sister, did not like her father's\nbuffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg\nto study at the university). But the half-imbecile mother was greatly\ndiverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or\nperforming something. It was the only way she could be amused; all the\nrest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now every one had\nforgotten her, that no one treated her with respect, that she was\nslighted, and so on. But during the last few days she had completely\nchanged. She began looking constantly at Ilusha's bed in the corner and\nseemed lost in thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried,\nshe cried quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change in\nher with mournful perplexity. The boys' visits at first only angered her,\nbut later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her, and at\nlast she liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming, she\nwould have felt dreary without them. When the children told some story or\nplayed a game, she laughed and clapped her hands. She called some of them\nto her and kissed them. She was particularly fond of Smurov.\n\nAs for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who came to\ncheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy. He\neven hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression, and that that\nwould hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about Ilusha, he had not,\ntill lately, felt one minute's doubt of his boy's ultimate recovery.\n\nHe met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot; he\nwas ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back,\nbut Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up. He began buying\nlittle things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and cut them\nsandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money. He\nhad taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha\nhad predicted he would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more\nabout their circumstances and Ilusha's illness, visited them herself, made\nthe acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the half-\nimbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping them, and the\ncaptain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying,\nforgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance.\n\nAll this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna,\ncame punctually every other day, but little was gained by his visits and\nhe dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday morning a new doctor\nwas expected, who had come from Moscow, where he had a great reputation.\nKaterina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense, not\nexpressly for Ilusha, but for another object of which more will be said in\nits place hereafter. But, as he had come, she had asked him to see Ilusha\nas well, and the captain had been told to expect him. He hadn't the\nslightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wished\nfor a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.\n\nAt the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room, the\ncaptain and all the boys were round Ilusha's bed, looking at a tiny\nmastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the captain\nhad bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was still\nfretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard\nthree days before that he was to be presented with a puppy, not an\nordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff (a very important point, of\ncourse), tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased.\nBut his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only\nserved to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had\nkilled. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling sadly,\nstroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked the puppy,\nbut ... it wasn't Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy,\ntoo, then he would have been completely happy.\n\n\"Krassotkin!\" cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first to see him\ncome in.\n\nKrassotkin's entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away and\nstood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full view of Ilusha.\nThe captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.\n\n\"Please come in ... you are welcome!\" he said hurriedly. \"Ilusha, Mr.\nKrassotkin has come to see you!\"\n\nBut Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly showed his\ncomplete knowledge of the manners of good society. He turned first to the\ncaptain's wife sitting in her arm-chair, who was very ill-humored at the\nmoment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha's bed\nand did not let her see the new puppy. With the greatest courtesy he made\nher a bow, scraping his foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as the\nonly other lady present, a similar bow. This polite behavior made an\nextremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.\n\n\"There, you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought\nup,\" she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; \"but as for our other\nvisitors they come in one on the top of another.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that?\" muttered\nthe captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her account.\n\n\"That's how they ride in. They get on each other's shoulders in the\npassage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange sort of\nvisitors!\"\n\n\"But who's come in like that, mamma?\"\n\n\"Why, that boy came in riding on that one's back and this one on that\none's.\"\n\nKolya was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy turned visibly paler.\nHe raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya. Kolya had not\nseen his little friend for two months, and he was overwhelmed at the sight\nof him. He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted, yellow\nface, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands.\nHe saw, with grieved surprise, Ilusha's rapid, hard breathing and dry\nlips. He stepped close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed,\nhe said:\n\n\"Well, old man ... how are you?\" But his voice failed him, he couldn't\nachieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched and the corners\nof his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile, still unable\nto utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it over\nIlusha's hair.\n\n\"Never mind!\" he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or perhaps not\nknowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent again.\n\n\"Hallo, so you've got a new puppy?\" Kolya said suddenly, in a most callous\nvoice.\n\n\"Ye--es,\" answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.\n\n\"A black nose, that means he'll be fierce, a good house-dog,\" Kolya\nobserved gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared about was the\npuppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had to do his utmost to\ncontrol his feelings not to burst out crying like a child, and do what he\nwould he could not control it. \"When it grows up, you'll have to keep it\non the chain, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"He'll be a huge dog!\" cried one of the boys.\n\n\"Of course he will,\" \"a mastiff,\" \"large,\" \"like this,\" \"as big as a\ncalf,\" shouted several voices.\n\n\"As big as a calf, as a real calf,\" chimed in the captain. \"I got one like\nthat on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents are huge and\nvery fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor.... Sit down here,\non Ilusha's bed, or here on the bench. You are welcome, we've been hoping\nto see you a long time.... You were so kind as to come with Alexey\nFyodorovitch?\"\n\nKrassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha's feet. Though he had\nperhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way,\nnow he completely lost the thread of it.\n\n\"No ... I came with Perezvon. I've got a dog now, called Perezvon. A\nSlavonic name. He's out there ... if I whistle, he'll run in. I've brought\na dog, too,\" he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. \"Do you remember\nZhutchka, old man?\" he suddenly fired the question at him.\n\nIlusha's little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression at\nKolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not to\nspeak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.\n\n\"Where ... is Zhutchka?\" Ilusha asked in a broken voice.\n\n\"Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka's lost and done for!\"\n\nIlusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya.\nAlyosha, catching Kolya's eye, signed to him vigorously again, but he\nturned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.\n\n\"It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a meal\nlike that,\" Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a little\nbreathless. \"But I've got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I've\nbrought him to show you.\"\n\n\"I don't want him!\" said Ilusha suddenly.\n\n\"No, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him on\npurpose.... He's the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to call in\nmy dog, madam?\" He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable\nexcitement in his manner.\n\n\"I don't want him, I don't want him!\" cried Ilusha, with a mournful break\nin his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes.\n\n\"You'd better,\" the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which\nhe had just sat down, \"you'd better ... another time,\" he muttered, but\nKolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to Smurov, \"Open the\ndoor,\" and as soon as it was open, he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed\nheadlong into the room.\n\n\"Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!\" shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stood\nerect on its hind-legs by Ilusha's bedside. What followed was a surprise\nto every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent over\nPerezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.\n\n\"It's ... Zhutchka!\" he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy and\nsuffering.\n\n\"And who did you think it was?\" Krassotkin shouted with all his might, in\na ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him\nup to Ilusha.\n\n\"Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn, just\nthe marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I found him\ndirectly. He did not belong to any one!\" he explained, turning quickly to\nthe captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha. \"He used to\nlive in the Fedotovs' back-yard. Though he made his home there, they did\nnot feed him. He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I\nfound him.... You see, old man, he couldn't have swallowed what you gave\nhim. If he had, he must have died, he must have! So he must have spat it\nout, since he is alive. You did not see him do it. But the pin pricked his\ntongue, that is why he squealed. He ran away squealing and you thought\nhe'd swallowed it. He might well squeal, because the skin of dogs' mouths\nis so tender ... tenderer than in men, much tenderer!\" Kolya cried\nimpetuously, his face glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could not\nspeak. White as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his great\neyes almost starting out of his head. And if Krassotkin, who had no\nsuspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a\nmoment might have on the sick child's health, nothing would have induced\nhim to play such a trick on him. But Alyosha was perhaps the only person\nin the room who realized it. As for the captain he behaved like a small\nchild.\n\n\"Zhutchka! It's Zhutchka!\" he cried in a blissful voice, \"Ilusha, this is\nZhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!\" He was almost weeping.\n\n\"And I never guessed!\" cried Smurov regretfully. \"Bravo, Krassotkin! I\nsaid he'd find the dog and here he's found him.\"\n\n\"Here he's found him!\" another boy repeated gleefully.\n\n\"Krassotkin's a brick!\" cried a third voice.\n\n\"He's a brick, he's a brick!\" cried the other boys, and they began\nclapping.\n\n\"Wait, wait,\" Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. \"I'll\ntell you how it happened, that's the whole point. I found him, I took him\nhome and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not show\nhim to any one till to-day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight,\nbut I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess. And\nmeanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all\nthe things he can do! I trained him so as to bring you a well-trained dog,\nin good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, 'See, old man,\nwhat a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!' Haven't you a bit of meat? He'll\nshow you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat,\nhaven't you got any?\"\n\nThe captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking\nwas done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted to\nPerezvon, \"Dead!\" And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back\nwith its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with the\nsame suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dog's\nperformance was \"mamma.\" She laughed at the dog and began snapping her\nfingers and calling it, \"Perezvon, Perezvon!\"\n\n\"Nothing will make him get up, nothing!\" Kolya cried triumphantly, proud\nof his success. \"He won't move for all the shouting in the world, but if I\ncall to him, he'll jump up in a minute. Ici, Perezvon!\" The dog leapt up\nand bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran back with a piece\nof cooked beef.\n\n\"Is it hot?\" Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air, taking\nthe meat. \"Dogs don't like hot things. No, it's all right. Look,\neverybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren't you looking? He does\nnot look at him, now I've brought him.\"\n\nThe new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose\nout and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The luckless\ndog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as long as his\nmaster chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for half an hour.\nBut he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.\n\n\"Paid for!\" cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog's\nnose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and\nsurprise.\n\n\"Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the\ndog?\" exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Simply for that!\" answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. \"I wanted to\nshow him in all his glory.\"\n\n\"Perezvon! Perezvon,\" called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingers\nand beckoning to the dog.\n\n\"What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!\" Kolya slapped\nthe bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both arms round\nhis head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek. Ilusha crept close to\nhim, stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog's shaggy\ncoat.\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again on the\nedge of the bed.\n\n\"Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I've brought you a little cannon.\nYou remember, I told you about it before and you said how much you'd like\nto see it. Well, here, I've brought it to you.\"\n\nAnd Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon. He\nhurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have waited\ntill the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he hurried on\nregardless of all consideration. \"You are all happy now,\" he felt, \"so\nhere's something to make you happier!\" He was perfectly enchanted himself.\n\n\"I've been coveting this thing for a long while; it's for you, old man,\nit's for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he had it from\nhis brother. I swopped a book from father's book-case for it, _A Kinsman\nof Mahomet or Salutary Folly_, a scandalous book published in Moscow a\nhundred years ago, before they had any censorship. And Morozov has a taste\nfor such things. He was grateful to me, too....\"\n\nKolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it.\nIlusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round the dog, he\ngazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even greater when Kolya\nannounced that he had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off at\nonce \"if it won't alarm the ladies.\" \"Mamma\" immediately asked to look at\nthe toy closer and her request was granted. She was much pleased with the\nlittle bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap.\nShe readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea\nof what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot. The\ncaptain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minute\nquantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be put off till another\ntime. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an empty part of the\nroom, three grains of powder were thrust into the touch-hole and a match\nwas put to it. A magnificent explosion followed. Mamma was startled, but\nat once laughed with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. But\nthe captain, looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them. Kolya\npicked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together with\nthe powder and the shot.\n\n\"I got it for you, for you! I've been keeping it for you a long time,\" he\nrepeated once more in his delight.\n\n\"Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!\" mamma began begging like a\nlittle child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it.\nKolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily.\n\n\"Mamma, mamma,\" he ran to her, \"the cannon's yours, of course, but let\nIlusha have it, because it's a present to him, but it's just as good as\nyours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both of\nyou, both of you.\"\n\n\"No, I don't want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine\naltogether, not Ilusha's,\" persisted mamma, on the point of tears.\n\n\"Take it, mother, here, keep it!\" Ilusha cried. \"Krassotkin, may I give it\nto my mother?\" he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as though\nhe were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to some one\nelse.\n\n\"Of course you may,\" Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the cannon\nfrom Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow. She was so\ntouched that she cried.\n\n\"Ilusha, darling, he's the one who loves his mamma!\" she said tenderly,\nand at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again.\n\n\"Mamma, let me kiss your hand.\" The captain darted up to her at once and\ndid so.\n\n\"And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,\" said the\ngrateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.\n\n\"And I'll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the powder\nourselves now. Borovikov found out how it's made--twenty-four parts of\nsaltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal. It's all pounded\ntogether, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy\nsieve--that's how it's done.\"\n\n\"Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it's not real\ngunpowder,\" responded Ilusha.\n\n\"Not real?\" Kolya flushed. \"It burns. I don't know, of course.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't mean that,\" put in the captain with a guilty face. \"I only\nsaid that real powder is not made like that, but that's nothing, it can be\nmade so.\"\n\n\"I don't know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it burned\nsplendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash. But that was only\nthe paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best, I\ndon't know.... And Bulkin's father thrashed him on account of our powder,\ndid you hear?\" he turned to Ilusha.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense interest and\nenjoyment.\n\n\"We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his\nbed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and thrashed him on the\nspot. He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters. He is\nnot allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go about with me\nnow. Smurov is not allowed to either, I've got a bad name with every one.\nThey say I'm a 'desperate character,' \" Kolya smiled scornfully. \"It all\nbegan from what happened on the railway.\"\n\n\"Ah, we've heard of that exploit of yours, too,\" cried the captain. \"How\ncould you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren't the least\nafraid, lying there under the train? Weren't you frightened?\"\n\nThe captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.\n\n\"N--not particularly,\" answered Kolya carelessly. \"What's blasted my\nreputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,\" he said,\nturning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an unconcerned air as he\ntalked, he still could not control himself and was continually missing the\nnote he tried to keep up.\n\n\"Ah! I heard about the goose!\" Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. \"They\ntold me, but I didn't understand. Did they really take you to the court?\"\n\n\"The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill as\nthey always do,\" Kolya began carelessly. \"I was walking through the\nmarket-place here one day, just when they'd driven in the geese. I stopped\nand looked at them. All at once a fellow, who is an errand-boy at\nPlotnikov's now, looked at me and said, 'What are you looking at the geese\nfor?' I looked at him; he was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am\nalways on the side of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to the\npeasants.... We've dropped behind the peasants--that's an axiom. I believe\nyou are laughing, Karamazov?\"\n\n\"No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,\" said Alyosha with a most good-natured\nair, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.\n\n\"My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,\" he hurried on again, looking\npleased. \"I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their\ndue, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a _sine qua non_ ... But I\nwas telling you about the goose. So I turned to the fool and answered, 'I\nam wondering what the goose thinks about.' He looked at me quite stupidly,\n'And what does the goose think about?' he asked. 'Do you see that cart\nfull of oats?' I said. 'The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the\ngoose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up--do you\nsee?' 'I see that quite well,' he said. 'Well,' said I, 'if that cart were\nto move on a little, would it break the goose's neck or not?' 'It'd be\nsure to break it,' and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted.\n'Come on, then,' said I, 'let's try.' 'Let's,' he said. And it did not\ntake us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed, and\nI stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasn't looking, he\nwas talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its head\nin after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I\nwinked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose's neck\nwas broken in half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at\nthat moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. 'You did that on\npurpose!' 'No, not on purpose.' 'Yes, you did, on purpose!' Well, they\nshouted, 'Take him to the justice of the peace!' They took me, too. 'You\nwere there, too,' they said, 'you helped, you're known all over the\nmarket!' And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,\"\nKolya added conceitedly. \"We all went off to the justice's, they brought\nthe goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubbering\nlike a woman. And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number\nof geese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses. The justice of\nthe peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a rouble\nfor the goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was warned not to\nplay such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. 'It\nwasn't me,' he said, 'it was he egged me on,' and he pointed to me. I\nanswered with the utmost composure that I hadn't egged him on, that I\nsimply stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically. The\njustice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for having\nsmiled. 'I'll complain to your masters of you, so that for the future you\nmayn't waste your time on such general propositions, instead of sitting at\nyour books and learning your lessons.' He didn't complain to the masters,\nthat was a joke, but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears of\nthe masters. Their ears are long, you know! The classical master,\nKolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off\nagain. But Kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass. Did\nyou know, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles,\nand his bride's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.\nThe third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it:\n\n\n    Astounding news has reached the class,\n    Kolbasnikov has been an ass.\n\n\nAnd so on, awfully funny, I'll bring it to you later on. I say nothing\nagainst Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there's no doubt about it. I\nrespect men like that and it's not because he stood up for me.\"\n\n\"But you took him down about the founders of Troy!\" Smurov put in\nsuddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He was\nparticularly pleased with the story of the goose.\n\n\"Did you really take him down?\" the captain inquired, in a flattering way.\n\"On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me about it\nat the time.\"\n\n\"He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!\" put in\nIlusha; \"he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top in every\nsubject....\"\n\nIlusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.\n\n\"Oh, that's all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this an\nunimportant question,\" said Kolya with haughty humility. He had by now\ncompletely recovered his dignity, though he was still a little uneasy. He\nfelt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose,\nfor instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious\nand had not said a word all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees to\nhave a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, and\nthought he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything like\nthat Kolya would--\n\n\"I regard the question as quite a trivial one,\" he rapped out again,\nproudly.\n\n\"And I know who founded Troy,\" a boy, who had not spoken before, said\nsuddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent and seemed to be\nshy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He was sitting\nnear the door. Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.\n\nThe fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret\nfor the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by reading\nSmaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when Kolya's back\nwas turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolya's\nbooks, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation\nof Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could not bring\nhimself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy, afraid\nof what might happen and of Krassotkin's somehow putting him to shame over\nit. But now he couldn't resist saying it. For weeks he had been longing\nto.\n\n\"Well, who did found it?\" asked Kolya, turning to him with haughty\nsuperciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and at once\nmade up his mind how to take it. There was, so to speak, a discordant note\nin the general harmony.\n\n\"Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,\" the boy rapped out\nat once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so, that it was\npainful to look at him. But the boys stared at him, stared at him for a\nwhole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were\nfastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy with\ndisdainful composure.\n\n\"In what sense did they found it?\" he deigned to comment at last. \"And\nwhat is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do? Did they go\nand each lay a brick, do you suppose?\"\n\nThere was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson. He was\nsilent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so for a minute.\n\n\"Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a\nnationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,\" he admonished\nhim in stern, incisive tones. \"But I attach no consequence to these old\nwives' tales and I don't think much of universal history in general,\" he\nadded carelessly, addressing the company generally.\n\n\"Universal history?\" the captain inquired, looking almost scared.\n\n\"Yes, universal history! It's the study of the successive follies of\nmankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are mathematics and\nnatural science,\" said Kolya. He was showing off and he stole a glance at\nAlyosha; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there. But Alyosha was\nstill silent and still serious as before. If Alyosha had said a word it\nwould have stopped him, but Alyosha was silent and \"it might be the\nsilence of contempt,\" and that finally irritated Kolya.\n\n\"The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing more.\nYou seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?\"\n\n\"I don't agree,\" said Alyosha, with a faint smile.\n\n\"The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a police\nmeasure, that's simply why it has been introduced into our schools.\" By\ndegrees Kolya began to get breathless again. \"Latin and Greek were\nintroduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect.\nIt was dull before, so what could they do to make things duller? It was\nsenseless enough before, so what could they do to make it more senseless?\nSo they thought of Greek and Latin. That's my opinion, I hope I shall\nnever change it,\" Kolya finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.\n\n\"That's true,\" assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of conviction.\nHe had listened attentively.\n\n\"And yet he is first in Latin himself,\" cried one of the group of boys\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin,\" echoed Ilusha.\n\n\"What of it?\" Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise was\nvery sweet to him. \"I am fagging away at Latin because I have to, because\nI promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that whatever you\ndo, it's worth doing it well. But in my soul I have a profound contempt\nfor the classics and all that fraud.... You don't agree, Karamazov?\"\n\n\"Why 'fraud'?\" Alyosha smiled again.\n\n\"Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all languages,\nso it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin,\nbut solely as a police measure, to stupefy the intelligence. So what can\none call it but a fraud?\"\n\n\"Why, who taught you all this?\" cried Alyosha, surprised at last.\n\n\"In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being\ntaught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics being translated\nour teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class.\"\n\n\"The doctor has come!\" cried Nina, who had been silent till then.\n\nA carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate. The captain,\nwho had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed headlong out to\nmeet him. \"Mamma\" pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.\nAlyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight. Nina,\nfrom her invalid chair, anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. The\nboys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to come again in the\nevening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.\n\n\"I won't go away, I won't go away,\" Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. \"I'll\nwait in the passage and come back when the doctor's gone, I'll come back\nwith Perezvon.\"\n\nBut by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person with long,\ndark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat. As he\ncrossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback; he probably fancied he had\ncome to the wrong place. \"How is this? Where am I?\" he muttered, not\nremoving his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of\nthe room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. The\ncaptain, bent double, was bowing low before him.\n\n\"It's here, sir, here, sir,\" he muttered cringingly; \"it's here, you've\ncome right, you were coming to us...\"\n\n\"Sne-gi-ryov?\" the doctor said loudly and pompously. \"Mr. Snegiryov--is\nthat you?\"\n\n\"That's me, sir!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw\noff his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck. The\ncaptain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took off his cap.\n\n\"Where is the patient?\" he asked emphatically.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. Precocity\n\n\n\"What do you think the doctor will say to him?\" Kolya asked quickly. \"What\na repulsive mug, though, hasn't he? I can't endure medicine!\"\n\n\"Ilusha is dying. I think that's certain,\" answered Alyosha, mournfully.\n\n\"They are rogues! Medicine's a fraud! I am glad to have made your\nacquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time. I\nam only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.\"\n\nKolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more\ndemonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this, smiled, and\npressed his hand.\n\n\"I've long learned to respect you as a rare person,\" Kolya muttered again,\nfaltering and uncertain. \"I have heard you are a mystic and have been in\nthe monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasn't put me off.\nContact with real life will cure you.... It's always so with characters\nlike yours.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?\" Alyosha was rather\nastonished.\n\n\"Oh, God and all the rest of it.\"\n\n\"What, don't you believe in God?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but\n... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all\nthat ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented,\"\nadded Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might\nthink he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was\n\"grown up.\" \"I haven't the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to\nhim,\" Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly\nannoyed.\n\n\"I must confess I can't endure entering on such discussions,\" he said with\na final air. \"It's possible for one who doesn't believe in God to love\nmankind, don't you think so? Voltaire didn't believe in God and loved\nmankind?\" (\"I am at it again,\" he thought to himself.)\n\n\"Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don't\nthink he loved mankind very much either,\" said Alyosha quietly, gently,\nand quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age,\nor even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha's apparent\ndiffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the\nquestion for him, little Kolya, to settle.\n\n\"Have you read Voltaire?\" Alyosha finished.\n\n\"No, not to say read.... But I've read _Candide_ in the Russian\ntranslation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again!\nagain!)\"\n\n\"And did you understand it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn't\nunderstand it? There's a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I\ncan understand that it's a philosophical novel and written to advocate an\nidea....\" Kolya was getting mixed by now. \"I am a Socialist, Karamazov, I\nam an incurable Socialist,\" he announced suddenly, apropos of nothing.\n\n\"A Socialist?\" laughed Alyosha. \"But when have you had time to become one?\nWhy, I thought you were only thirteen?\"\n\nKolya winced.\n\n\"In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in a\nfortnight,\" he flushed angrily, \"and in the second place I am at a\ncomplete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The question is\nwhat are my convictions, not what is my age, isn't it?\"\n\n\"When you are older, you'll understand for yourself the influence of age\non convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your own\nideas,\" Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya interrupted him\nhotly:\n\n\"Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the Christian\nreligion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and the powerful\nto keep the lower classes in slavery. That's so, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!\"\ncried Alyosha.\n\n\"I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me so. I\ncan think for myself.... I am not opposed to Christ, if you like. He was a\nmost humane person, and if He were alive to-day, He would be found in the\nranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a conspicuous part....\nThere's no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made friends\nwith?\" exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n\"Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked to\nMr. Rakitin, of course, but ... old Byelinsky said that, too, so they\nsay.\"\n\n\"Byelinsky? I don't remember. He hasn't written that anywhere.\"\n\n\"If he didn't write it, they say he said it. I heard that from a ... but\nnever mind.\"\n\n\"And have you read Byelinsky?\"\n\n\"Well, no ... I haven't read all of him, but ... I read the passage about\nTatyana, why she didn't go off with Onyegin.\"\n\n\"Didn't go off with Onyegin? Surely you don't ... understand that\nalready?\"\n\n\"Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov,\" said Kolya, with a grin of\nirritation. \"But please don't suppose I am such a revolutionist. I often\ndisagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at all for\nthe emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a subject race and\nmust obey. _Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.\" Kolya, for some\nreason, smiled, \"And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with\nthat pseudo-great man. I think, too, that to leave one's own country and\nfly to America is mean, worse than mean--silly. Why go to America when one\nmay be of great service to humanity here? Now especially. There's a\nperfect mass of fruitful activity open to us. That's what I answered.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going to\nAmerica already?\"\n\n\"I must own, they've been at me to go, but I declined. That's between\nourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one. I say\nthis only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the\nsecret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.\n\n\n    _Long will you remember_\n    _The house at the Chain bridge._\n\n\nDo you remember? It's splendid. Why are you laughing? You don't suppose I\nam fibbing, do you?\" (\"What if he should find out that I've only that one\nnumber of _The Bell_ in father's bookcase, and haven't read any more of\nit?\" Kolya thought with a shudder.)\n\n\"Oh, no, I am not laughing and don't suppose for a moment that you are\nlying. No, indeed, I can't suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly\ntrue. But tell me, have you read Pushkin--_Onyegin_, for instance?... You\nspoke just now of Tatyana.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no prejudices,\nKaramazov; I want to hear both sides. What makes you ask?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?\" Kolya rapped out\nsuddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he were on drill.\n\"Be so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.\"\n\n\"I have a contempt for you?\" Alyosha looked at him wondering. \"What for? I\nam only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by\nall this crude nonsense before you have begun life.\"\n\n\"Don't be anxious about my nature,\" Kolya interrupted, not without\ncomplacency. \"But it's true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely\nsensitive. You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to--\"\n\n\"Oh, my smile meant something quite different. I'll tell you why I smiled.\nNot long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in\nRussia, on our students and schoolboys of to-day. 'Show a Russian\nschoolboy,' he writes, 'a map of the stars, which he knows nothing about,\nand he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.' No\nknowledge and unbounded conceit--that's what the German meant to say about\nthe Russian schoolboy.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's perfectly right,\" Kolya laughed suddenly, \"exactly so! Bravo\nthe German! But he did not see the good side, what do you think? Conceit\nmay be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, on\nthe other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood,\nboldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these sausage\nmakers, groveling before authority.... But the German was right all the\nsame. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same. Though\nthey are so good at science and learning they must be strangled.\"\n\n\"Strangled, what for?\" smiled Alyosha.\n\n\"Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childish\nsometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can't restrain myself\nand am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are chattering away here\nabout nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there. But perhaps\nhe's examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked that Nina,\nyou know. She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away, 'Why didn't\nyou come before?' And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she is\nawfully nice and pathetic.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! Well, you'll be coming often, you will see what she is like. It\nwould do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn to\nvalue a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,\"\nAlyosha observed warmly. \"That would have more effect on you than\nanything.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!\" Kolya\nexclaimed, with bitter feeling.\n\n\"Yes, it's a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child\nwas to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!\"\n\n\"Don't tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept me\nfrom coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly\nwilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I've been struggling\nwith it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways,\nKaramazov!\"\n\n\"No, you have a charming nature, though it's been distorted, and I quite\nunderstand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidly\nsensitive boy,\" Alyosha answered warmly.\n\n\"And you say that to me!\" cried Kolya; \"and would you believe it, I\nthought--I've thought several times since I've been here--that you despised\nme! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!\"\n\n\"But are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it, just\nnow, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, that\nyou must be very sensitive!\"\n\n\"You thought so? What an eye you've got, I say! I bet that was when I was\ntalking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you had a great\ncontempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for a moment I\nquite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool. Then I fancied--just\nnow, here--when I said that if there were no God He would have to be\ninvented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge,\nespecially as I got that phrase out of a book. But I swear I wasn't\nshowing off out of vanity, though I really don't know why. Because I was\nso pleased? Yes, I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it's\nperfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing directly they are pleased,\nI know that. But I am convinced now that you don't despise me; it was all\nmy imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. I sometimes fancy\nall sorts of things, that every one is laughing at me, the whole world,\nand then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things.\"\n\n\"And you worry every one about you,\" smiled Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tell\nme, am I very ridiculous now?\"\n\n\"Don't think about that, don't think of it at all!\" cried Alyosha. \"And\nwhat does ridiculous mean? Isn't every one constantly being or seeming\nridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of\nbeing ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at is\nthat you should be feeling that so early, though I've observed it for some\ntime past, and not only in you. Nowadays the very children have begun to\nsuffer from it. It's almost a sort of insanity. The devil has taken the\nform of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; it's simply the\ndevil,\" added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that Kolya, staring at\nhim, expected to see. \"You are like every one else,\" said Alyosha, in\nconclusion, \"that is, like very many others. Only you must not be like\neverybody else, that's all.\"\n\n\"Even if every one is like that?\"\n\n\"Yes, even if every one is like that. You be the only one not like it. You\nreally are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to confess to\nsomething bad and even ridiculous. And who will admit so much in these\ndays? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self-\ncriticism. Don't be like every one else, even if you are the only one.\"\n\n\"Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one. Oh, how\nI have longed to know you, Karamazov! I've long been eager for this\nmeeting. Can you really have thought about me, too? You said just now that\nyou thought of me, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'd heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if it's partly\nvanity that makes you ask, it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,\"\nsaid Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice. \"That's not ridiculous, is\nit?\"\n\n\"Not at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn't matter, because it's\nbeen a good thing.\" Alyosha smiled brightly.\n\n\"But do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed\nyourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.\" Kolya smiled with a sort of sly\nhappiness.\n\n\"Why ashamed?\"\n\n\"Well, why are you blushing?\"\n\n\"It was you made me blush,\" laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. \"Oh,\nwell, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don't know...\" he muttered,\nalmost embarrassed.\n\n\"Oh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are\nrather ashamed! Because you are just like me,\" cried Kolya, in positive\necstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.\n\n\"You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,\" something made\nAlyosha say suddenly.\n\n\"I know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!\" Kolya agreed at once.\n\n\"But you will bless life on the whole, all the same.\"\n\n\"Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together,\nKaramazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quite\nlike an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But\nwe shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, I've been saying to\nmyself, 'Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part\nenemies to the grave!' \"\n\n\"And saying that, of course, you loved me,\" Alyosha laughed gayly.\n\n\"I did. I loved you awfully. I've been loving and dreaming of you. And how\ndo you know it all beforehand? Ah, here's the doctor. Goodness! What will\nhe tell us? Look at his face!\"\n\n\n\nChapter VII. Ilusha\n\n\nThe doctor came out of the room again, muffled in his fur coat and with\nhis cap on his head. His face looked almost angry and disgusted, as though\nhe were afraid of getting dirty. He cast a cursory glance round the\npassage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so. Alyosha waved\nfrom the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought the\ndoctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and, bowing\napologetically, stopped him to get the last word. The poor fellow looked\nutterly crushed; there was a scared look in his eyes.\n\n\"Your Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?\" he began, but could\nnot go on and clasped his hands in despair. Yet he still gazed imploringly\nat the doctor, as though a word from him might still change the poor boy's\nfate.\n\n\"I can't help it, I am not God!\" the doctor answered offhand, though with\nthe customary impressiveness.\n\n\"Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?\"\n\n\"You must be prepared for anything,\" said the doctor in emphatic and\nincisive tones, and dropping his eyes, he was about to step out to the\ncoach.\n\n\"Your Excellency, for Christ's sake!\" the terror-stricken captain stopped\nhim again. \"Your Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely nothing save him\nnow?\"\n\n\"It's not in my hands now,\" said the doctor impatiently, \"but h'm!...\" he\nstopped suddenly. \"If you could, for instance ... send ... your patient\n... at once, without delay\" (the words \"at once, without delay,\" the\ndoctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain\nstart) \"to Syracuse, the change to the new be-ne-ficial climatic\nconditions might possibly effect--\"\n\n\"To Syracuse!\" cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said.\n\n\"Syracuse is in Sicily,\" Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation. The\ndoctor looked at him.\n\n\"Sicily! your Excellency,\" faltered the captain, \"but you've seen\"--he\nspread out his hands, indicating his surroundings--\"mamma and my family?\"\n\n\"N--no, Sicily is not the place for the family, the family should go to\nCaucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus,\nand your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her\nrheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist\nLepelletier; I could give you a note to him, and then ... there might be a\nchange--\"\n\n\"Doctor, doctor! But you see!\" The captain flung wide his hands again\ndespairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.\n\n\"Well, that's not my business,\" grinned the doctor. \"I have only told you\nthe answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment.\nAs for the rest, to my regret--\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, apothecary, my dog won't bite you,\" Kolya rapped out\nloudly, noticing the doctor's rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who was\nstanding in the doorway. There was a wrathful note in Kolya's voice. He\nused the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he\nexplained afterwards, used it \"to insult him.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise at\nKolya. \"Who's this?\" he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him to\nexplain.\n\n\"It's Perezvon's master, don't worry about me,\" Kolya said incisively\nagain.\n\n\"Perezvon?\"(7) repeated the doctor, perplexed.\n\n\"He hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good-by, we shall meet\nin Syracuse.\"\n\n\"Who's this? Who's this?\" The doctor flew into a terrible rage.\n\n\"He is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice of\nhim,\" said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. \"Kolya, hold your\ntongue!\" he cried to Krassotkin. \"Take no notice of him, doctor,\" he\nrepeated, rather impatiently.\n\n\"He wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!\" The doctor stamped in a perfect\nfury.\n\n\"And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!\" said Kolya, turning\npale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. \"_Ici_, Perezvon!\"\n\n\"Kolya, if you say another word, I'll have nothing more to do with you,\"\nAlyosha cried peremptorily.\n\n\"There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay\nKrassotkin--this is the man\"; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. \"I obey him, good-\nby!\"\n\nHe stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room.\nPerezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds in\namazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out quickly to\nthe carriage, repeating aloud, \"This is ... this is ... I don't know what\nit is!\" The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage. Alyosha\nfollowed Kolya into the room. He was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick\nboy was holding his hand and calling for his father. A minute later the\ncaptain, too, came back.\n\n\"Father, father, come ... we ...\" Ilusha faltered in violent excitement,\nbut apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms round his father\nand Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as tightly as he\ncould. The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs, and Kolya's\nlips and chin twitched.\n\n\"Father, father! How sorry I am for you!\" Ilusha moaned bitterly.\n\n\"Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we\nshall be happy ... the doctor ...\" the captain began.\n\n\"Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me.... I saw!\"\ncried Ilusha, and again he hugged them both with all his strength, hiding\nhis face on his father's shoulder.\n\n\"Father, don't cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ... choose\none of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha and love him instead of\nme....\"\n\n\"Hush, old man, you'll get well,\" Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice\nthat sounded angry.\n\n\"But don't ever forget me, father,\" Ilusha went on, \"come to my grave ...\nand, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walk,\nand come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... I\nshall expect you.... Father, father!\"\n\nHis voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was\ncrying quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying, \"mamma,\"\ntoo, burst into tears.\n\n\"Ilusha! Ilusha!\" she exclaimed.\n\nKrassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha's embrace.\n\n\"Good-by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,\" he said quickly.\n\"What a pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious.... But\nafter dinner I'll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole\nevening, and I'll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things. And\nI'll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me, because he will\nbegin to howl when I am away and bother you. Good-by!\"\n\nAnd he ran out into the passage. He didn't want to cry, but in the passage\nhe burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.\n\n\"Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will be\nterribly disappointed,\" Alyosha said emphatically.\n\n\"I will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before!\" muttered\nKolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.\n\nAt that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed the\ndoor behind him. His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling. He\nstood before the two and flung up his arms.\n\n\"I don't want a good boy! I don't want another boy!\" he muttered in a wild\nwhisper, clenching his teeth. \"If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my\ntongue--\" He broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the wooden\nbench. Pressing his fists against his head, he began sobbing with absurd\nwhimpering cries, doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in\nthe room.\n\nKolya ran out into the street.\n\n\"Good-by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself?\" he cried sharply and angrily\nto Alyosha.\n\n\"I will certainly come in the evening.\"\n\n\"What was that he said about Jerusalem?... What did he mean by that?\"\n\n\"It's from the Bible. 'If I forget thee, Jerusalem,' that is, if I forget\nall that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its place, then\nmay--\"\n\n\"I understand, that's enough! Mind you come! _Ici_, Perezvon!\" he cried\nwith positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went home.\n\n\n\n\nBook XI. Ivan\n\n\n\nChapter I. At Grushenka's\n\n\nAlyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov's house to\nsee Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an\nurgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned\nthat her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day.\nDuring the two months that had passed since Mitya's arrest, Alyosha had\ncalled frequently at the widow Morozov's house, both from his own\ninclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya's\narrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.\nFor one whole week she was unconscious. She was very much changed--thinner\nand a little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been well\nenough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than\nbefore, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her. A look of\nfirmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face. There were\nsigns of a spiritual transformation in her, and a steadfast, fine and\nhumble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her.\nThere was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming\nface a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance.\nThere was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.\n\nIt seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that had\novertaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a\nterrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of her\nillness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka\nhad not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in the\nonce proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire\nwhen she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her\nheart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever--Katerina\nIvanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium.\nAlyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet Katerina Ivanovna\nhad not once visited Mitya in his prison, though she might have done it\nwhenever she liked. All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he\nwas the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she\nwas continually asking advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.\n\nFull of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had returned\nfrom seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement with\nwhich she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been\nexpecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game of\n\"fools\" lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on\nthe other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it. He wore a dressing-\ngown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak, though he was\nsmiling blissfully. When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from\nMokroe two months before, he had simply stayed on and was still staying\nwith her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down on the sofa,\ndrenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid, appealing\nsmile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of\nfever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half-\nhour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently: he\nlaughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She called Fenya and told her to\ngive him something to eat. All that day he sat in the same place, almost\nwithout stirring. When it got dark and the shutters were closed, Fenya\nasked her mistress:\n\n\"Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?\"\n\n\"Yes; make him a bed on the sofa,\" answered Grushenka.\n\nQuestioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had\nliterally nowhere to go, and that \"Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me\nstraight that he wouldn't receive me again and gave me five roubles.\"\n\n\"Well, God bless you, you'd better stay, then,\" Grushenka decided in her\ngrief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man's heart\nand his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer\nhad stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when she\nwas ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but\nwent on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had\ngrown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun\nto visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and\nbegin talking to \"Maximushka\" about trifling matters, to keep her from\nthinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story-teller\non occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka saw\nscarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never\nstayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, \"at his last\ngasp\" as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after\nMitya's trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching,\nhe made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last\nand bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict orders\nto his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, \"The\nmaster wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.\"\nBut Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.\n\n\"You've come at last!\" she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully\ngreeting Alyosha, \"and Maximushka's been scaring me that perhaps you\nwouldn't come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you\nhave--coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes, please,\" said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. \"I am very\nhungry.\"\n\n\"That's right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,\" cried Grushenka. \"It's been made a\nlong time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they are\nhot. Do you know, we've had a storm over those pies to-day. I took them to\nthe prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: he\nwould not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it.\nSo I said to him: 'I shall leave them with the warder; if you don't eat\nthem before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for\nyou!' With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it?\nWhenever I go we quarrel.\"\n\nGrushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feeling\nnervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.\n\n\"What did you quarrel about this time?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"I didn't expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole.\n'Why are you keeping him?' he said. 'So you've begun keeping him.' He is\njealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping! He even\ntook it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.\"\n\n\"But he knew about the Pole before?\"\n\n\"Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning, but\nto-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed to\nrepeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps\nRakitin is egging him on. What do you think?\" she added carelessly.\n\n\"He loves you, that's what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is\nparticularly worried.\"\n\n\"I should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I went to him\nto say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think what's going to\nhappen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And he\ntalks about the Pole! He's too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,\" Maximov put in his word.\n\n\"Jealous of you?\" Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. \"Of whom could\nshe have been jealous?\"\n\n\"Of the servant girls.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry.\nDon't ogle the pies. I shan't give you any; they are not good for you, and\nI won't give you any vodka either. I have to look after him, too, just as\nthough I kept an almshouse,\" she laughed.\n\n\"I don't deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,\" said Maximov,\nwith tears in his voice. \"You would do better to spend your kindness on\npeople of more use than me.\"\n\n\"Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who's of most\nuse? If only that Pole didn't exist, Alyosha. He's taken it into his head\nto fall ill, too, to-day. I've been to see him also. And I shall send him\nsome pies, too, on purpose. I hadn't sent him any, but Mitya accused me of\nit, so now I shall send some! Ah, here's Fenya with a letter! Yes, it's\nfrom the Poles--begging again!\"\n\nPan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically\neloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the\nletter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it\nwithin three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had\nreceived many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former\nlover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two\nPoles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first\nletter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper\nand with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical\nthat Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head\nor tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was\nfollowed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a\nloan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that\nletter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed--one every\nday--all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually\ndiminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten,\nand finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her\nfor only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.\n\nThen Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round\nherself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost\ndestitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their\nlandlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at\nMokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting\nher with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio\nand pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former\nadmirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not\nin the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to\nGrushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had\nalways sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into his\nhead to be fearfully jealous.\n\n\"Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see\nMitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,\" Grushenka began again with nervous\nhaste. \"I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. 'Fancy,' I said, 'my Pole\nhad the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar. He\nthought I would be touched and marry him!' Mitya leapt up swearing.... So,\nthere, I'll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they've\nsent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and\ntell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did\nsend them the pies.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't tell him for anything,\" said Alyosha, smiling.\n\n\"Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he's jealous on purpose. He\ndoesn't care,\" said Grushenka bitterly.\n\n\"On purpose?\" queried Alyosha.\n\n\"I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all\nyour cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me. I\nwould be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am not\noffended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous myself.\nOnly what offends me is that he doesn't love me at all. I tell you he is\njealous now _on purpose_. Am I blind? Don't I see? He began talking to me\njust now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this and that, how she\nhad ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she had\nordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves her, if\nhe'll praise her to my face, more shame to him! He's treated me badly\nhimself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throw\nit all on me. 'You were with your Pole before me, so I can't be blamed for\nKaterina,' that's what it amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame on\nme. He attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I'll--\"\n\nGrushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes in\nher handkerchief and sobbed violently.\n\n\"He doesn't love Katerina Ivanovna,\" said Alyosha firmly.\n\n\"Well, whether he loves her or not, I'll soon find out for myself,\" said\nGrushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief from\nher eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being\nmild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful.\n\n\"Enough of this foolishness,\" she said suddenly; \"it's not for that I sent\nfor you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrow--what will happen to-morrow? That's\nwhat worries me! And it's only me it worries! I look at every one and no\none is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you thinking about it\neven? To-morrow he'll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried?\nYou know it's the valet, the valet killed him! Good heavens! Can they\ncondemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him? They\nhaven't troubled the valet at all, have they?\"\n\n\"He's been severely cross-examined,\" observed Alyosha thoughtfully; \"but\nevery one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying very ill.\nHe has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,\" added Alyosha.\n\n\"Oh, dear! couldn't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole\nthing by yourself? He's been brought from Petersburg for three thousand\nroubles, they say.\"\n\n\"We gave these three thousand together--Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and I--but\nshe paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counsel\nFetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known all\nover Russia; it's talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitch\nagreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has\nbecome so notorious. I saw him yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well? Did you talk to him?\" Grushenka put in eagerly.\n\n\"He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his\nopinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.\"\n\n\"Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They'll ruin him. And why did she\nsend for the doctor?\"\n\n\"As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya's mad and committed the\nmurder when he didn't know what he was doing\"; Alyosha smiled gently; \"but\nMitya won't agree to that.\"\n\n\"Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!\" cried Grushenka.\n\"He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am!\nBut, of course, he didn't do it, he didn't do it! And they are all against\nhim, the whole town. Even Fenya's evidence went to prove he had done it.\nAnd the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too,\nbefore, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, all\ncrying out against him.\"\n\n\"Yes, there's a fearful accumulation of evidence,\" Alyosha observed\ngrimly.\n\n\"And Grigory--Grigory Vassilyevitch--sticks to his story that the door was\nopen, persists that he saw it--there's no shaking him. I went and talked to\nhim myself. He's rude about it, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's perhaps the strongest evidence against him,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"And as for Mitya's being mad, he certainly seems like it now,\" Grushenka\nbegan with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. \"Do you know, Alyosha,\nI've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time. I go to him\nevery day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose he's\nalways talking about? He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I\nfancied he was talking of something intellectual that I couldn't\nunderstand in my foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a\nbabe--that is, about some child. 'Why is the babe poor?' he said. 'It's for\nthat babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to\nSiberia!' What that meant, what babe, I couldn't tell for the life of me.\nOnly I cried when he said it, because he said it so nicely. He cried\nhimself, and I cried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the\ncross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?\"\n\n\"It must be Rakitin, who's been going to see him lately,\" smiled Alyosha,\n\"though ... that's not Rakitin's doing. I didn't see Mitya yesterday. I'll\nsee him to-day.\"\n\n\"No, it's not Rakitin; it's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him.\nIt's his going to see him, that's what it is,\" Grushenka began, and\nsuddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.\n\n\"Ivan's going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan\nhasn't been once.\"\n\n\"There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurting things out!\" exclaimed\nGrushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. \"Stay, Alyosha, hush! Since\nI've said so much I'll tell the whole truth--he's been to see him twice,\nthe first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of\ncourse, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He\ntold Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to\ntell any one, in fact. He came secretly.\"\n\nAlyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently\nimpressed him.\n\n\"Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case,\" he said slowly. \"He's said very\nlittle to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems\nvexed at my coming, so I've not been to him for the last three weeks.\nH'm!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change\nin Mitya this week.\"\n\n\"There has been a change,\" Grushenka assented quickly. \"They have a\nsecret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and\nsuch a secret that Mitya can't rest. Before then, he was cheerful--and,\nindeed, he is cheerful now--but when he shakes his head like that, you\nknow, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his\nright temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind\nworrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is\ncheerful to-day.\"\n\n\"But you said he was worried.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a\nminute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha,\nI am constantly wondering at him--with this awful thing hanging over him,\nhe sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\"\n\n\"And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, 'Don't\ntell him'?\"\n\n\"Yes, he told me, 'Don't tell him.' It's you that Mitya's most afraid of.\nBecause it's a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling,\ngo to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\"\nGrushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \"Set my mind at rest that I\nmay know the worst that's in store for me. That's why I sent for you.\"\n\n\"You think it's something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn't have\ntold you there was a secret.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn't dare to. He warns\nme. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won't tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"What do you think yourself?\"\n\n\"What do I think? It's the end for me, that's what I think. They all three\nhave been plotting my end, for Katerina's in it. It's all Katerina, it all\ncomes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He\ntells me that beforehand--warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that's\nthe whole secret. They've planned it together, the three of them--Mitya,\nKaterina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I've been wanting to ask you a\nlong time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with\nKaterina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or\nnot? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.\"\n\n\"I won't tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that's\nwhat it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on\nme afterwards. He is stupid, he can't disguise what he is doing; he is so\nopen, you know.... But I'll give it to him, I'll give it to him! 'You\nbelieve I did it,' he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me\nwith that! God forgive him! You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the\ntrial! I'll just say a word then ... I'll tell everything then!\"\n\nAnd again she cried bitterly.\n\n\"This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\" Alyosha said, getting up.\n\"First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and\nyou only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don't\nwant to worm his secret out of him, but if he'll tell me of himself to-\nday, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then\nI'll come to you to-day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina\nIvanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something\nelse. That's certain. It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it\nseems to me. Good-by for now.\"\n\nAlyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that she\nput little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had her\nsorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her in such a\nstate of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many things to do\nstill.\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Injured Foot\n\n\nThe first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and he\nhurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late\nfor Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three\nweeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she was not in\nbed, she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in a\nfascinating but decorous _deshabille_. Alyosha had once noted with\ninnocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov had\nbegun to be rather dressy--top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made\ntheir appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed\nsuch ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the\nyoung official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.\n\nAlyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight to\nLise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to him\nthe previous day, specially asking him to come to her \"about something\nvery important,\" a request which, for certain reasons, had interest for\nAlyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise, Madame\nHohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and immediately sent to beg\nhim to come to her \"just for one minute.\" Alyosha reflected that it was\nbetter to accede to the mamma's request, or else she would be sending down\nto Lise's room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lying\non a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a\nstate of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries of\nrapture.\n\n\"It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole week--only\nthink of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday. You\nhave come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe,\nwithout my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only\nknew how worried I am about her! But of that later, though that's the most\nimportant thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you\nimplicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima--God rest his\nsoul!\" (she crossed herself)--\"I look upon you as a monk, though you look\ncharming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in these\nparts? No, no, that's not the chief thing--of that later. Forgive me for\nsometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,\"\nshe smiled coquettishly; \"but that will do later, too. The important thing\nis that I shouldn't forget what is important. Please remind me of it\nyourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say 'the\nimportant thing?' Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever\nsince Lise took back her promise--her childish promise, Alexey\nFyodorovitch--to marry you, you've realized, of course, that it was only\nthe playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her\nchair--thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from\nMoscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow--But why speak of to-\nmorrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to die\nof curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I paid\nhim fifty roubles for the visit. But that's not the point, that's not the\npoint again. You see, I'm mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry. Why\nam I in a hurry? I don't understand. It's awful how I seem growing unable\nto understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle. I\nam afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and that will be\nall I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here and no coffee?\nYulia, Glafira, coffee!\"\n\nAlyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just had\ncoffee.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At Agrafena Alexandrovna's.\"\n\n\"At ... at that woman's? Ah, it's she has brought ruin on every one. I\nknow nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though it's\nrather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What use is it\nnow? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you\nthat I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall\ncertainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my\nchair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, I\nam a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don't know what I\nshall say. One has to take an oath, hasn't one?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I don't think you will be able to go.\"\n\n\"I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, and\nthen they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all this\nso quickly, so quickly, everything's changing, and at last--nothing. All\ngrow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary.\nThis Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has disappointed all my hopes. Now\nshe is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia, and your other\nbrother is going to follow her, and will live in the nearest town, and\nthey will all torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of\nall--the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the\npapers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there's a\nparagraph that I was 'a dear friend' of your brother's ----, I can't repeat\nthe horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!\"\n\n\"Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?\"\n\n\"I'll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here, in\nthe Petersburg paper _Gossip_. The paper began coming out this year. I am\nawfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me out--this is\nwhat gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.\"\n\nAnd she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her\npillow.\n\nIt was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps\neverything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The paragraph was\nvery typical, and must have been a great shock to her, but, fortunately\nperhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that\nmoment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite\nforget the newspaper.\n\nAlyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all\nover Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother, about\nthe Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of those two\nmonths, among other equally credible items! One paper had even stated that\nhe had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his brother's\ncrime. Another contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, Father\nZossima, had broken into the monastery chest and \"made tracks from the\nmonastery.\" The present paragraph in the paper _Gossip_ was under the\nheading, \"The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.\" (That, alas! was the\nname of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief,\nand Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it. No names appeared,\nin fact. It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trial\nwas making such a sensation--retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and\nreactionary bully--was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and\nparticularly popular with certain ladies \"who were pining in solitude.\"\nOne such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a\ngrown-up daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the\ncrime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he would\nelope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on escaping\npunishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousand\nrather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his pining\nlady. This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst of\ngenerous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately\nabolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha\nfolded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.\n\n\"Well, that must be me,\" she hurried on again. \"Of course I am meant.\nScarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and here\nthey talk of 'middle-aged charms' as though that were my motive! He writes\nthat out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as\nI forgive him! You know it's-- Do you know who it is? It's your friend\nRakitin.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Alyosha, \"though I've heard nothing about it.\"\n\n\"It's he, it's he! No 'perhaps' about it. You know I turned him out of the\nhouse.... You know all that story, don't you?\"\n\n\"I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why it\nwas, I haven't heard ... from you, at least.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you've heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me\ndreadfully?\"\n\n\"Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you've given him up I\nhaven't heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed. We are\nnot friends.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll tell you all about it. There's no help for it, I'll\nconfess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a\nlittle, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn't count. You see, my\ndear boy\"--Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, though\nenigmatic, smile played about her lips--\"you see, I suspect ... You must\nforgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite the\ncontrary. I speak to you now as though you were my father--mother's quite\nout of place. Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima,\nthat's just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man,\nyour friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can't be angry with him. I feel\ncross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe it,\nseems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I only\nnoticed it later. At first--a month ago--he only began to come oftener to\nsee me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before. I\nknew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to\nnotice things with surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest,\ncharming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the\nservice here, began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him here\never so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man,\nisn't he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I should\nbe glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I\nlove young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost\nthe mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,\ncertainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On that\nawful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And your\nfriend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on the\ncarpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as he\nwas going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swell\ndirectly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here\nbefore, and would you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at\nhim, for some reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and\nlaughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone--no, I was laid up then.\nWell, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only\nfancy! brought me some verses of his own composition--a short poem, on my\nbad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minute--how did\nit go?\n\n\n    A captivating little foot.\n\n\nIt began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've got it here.\nI'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing--charming; and, you\nknow, it's not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too, a charming\nidea, only I've forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing for an album.\nSo, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently flattered. I'd hardly\nhad time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly\nlooked as black as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way,\nfor Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses.\nI had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr\nIlyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author. But I am convinced\nthat he guessed, though he won't own it to this day, and declares he had\nno idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at\nonce, and fell to criticizing it. 'Wretched doggerel,' he said they were,\n'some divinity student must have written them,' and with such vehemence,\nsuch vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage.\n'Good gracious!' I thought, 'they'll fly at each other.' 'It was I who\nwrote them,' said he. 'I wrote them as a joke,' he said, 'for I think it\ndegrading to write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a\nmonument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet, while I wrote\nwith a moral purpose, and you,' said he, 'are an advocate of serfdom.\nYou've no humane ideas,' said he. 'You have no modern enlightened\nfeelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,' he\nsaid, 'and you take bribes.' Then I began screaming and imploring them.\nAnd, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took up\nthe most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and\napologized. 'I'd no idea,' said he. 'I shouldn't have said it, if I had\nknown. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,' he said. In\nshort, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He\nexplained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in\nearnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, 'Would\nit, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for\nshouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?' And, would you believe it, I\nlay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not.\nI kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldn't\nmake up my mind whether to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be\ntelling me, 'Speak,' and the other 'No, don't speak.' And no sooner had\nthe second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there\nwas a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, 'It's painful for me to\nsay it, but I don't wish to see you in my house again.' So I turned him\nout. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it\non. I wasn't angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied--that\nwas what did it--that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believe\nme, it was quite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for several\ndays afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it.\nSo it's a fortnight since he's been here, and I kept wondering whether he\nwould come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night came\nthis _Gossip_. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must\nhave written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,\nand they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it's\nawful how I keep talking and don't say what I want to say. Ah! the words\ncome of themselves!\"\n\n\"It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,\"\nAlyosha faltered.\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is an\naberration?\"\n\n\"What aberration?\" asked Alyosha, wondering.\n\n\"In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.\nWhatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming creature,\nonly I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She was with me\nsome time ago and I couldn't get anything out of her. Especially as she\nwon't talk to me except on the surface now. She is always talking about my\nhealth and nothing else, and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I\nsimply said to myself, 'Well, so be it. I don't care'... Oh, yes. I was\ntalking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come?\nOf course, you know it--the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him.\nNo, it wasn't you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing. Well, you see, a man\nmay be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may be\nconscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration.\nAnd there's no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from\naberration. They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were\nreformed. It's all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor\nhas been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.\n'How did he seem then?' he asked me. He must have been in a state of\naberration. He came in shouting, 'Money, money, three thousand! Give me\nthree thousand!' and then went away and immediately did the murder. 'I\ndon't want to murder him,' he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him.\nThat's why they'll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet he\nmurdered him.\"\n\n\"But he didn't murder him,\" Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He felt\nmore and more sick with anxiety and impatience.\n\n\"Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.\"\n\n\"Grigory?\" cried Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down,\nand then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.\"\n\n\"But why, why?\"\n\n\"Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri\nFyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he\nwent and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn't, he very likely\ndoesn't remember. Only, you know, it'll be better, ever so much better, if\nDmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that's how it must have been, though\nI say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's\nbetter, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed\nhis father, I don't defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,\nand yet it would be better if it were he, as you'd have nothing to cry\nover then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was\nconscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit him--that's\nso humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew\nnothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time. And when I\nheard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at\nonce. And if he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts\nto dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to\nthe reformed law courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides, I'll\ninvite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did\nanything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in\nanother town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best\njudges. And, besides, who isn't suffering from aberration nowadays?--you,\nI, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so many\nexamples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him,\nhe takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one\nblames him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The\ndoctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my Lise is in a\nstate of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday, and the day before,\ntoo, and to-day I suddenly realized that it's all due to aberration. Oh,\nLise grieves me so! I believe she's quite mad. Why did she send for you?\nDid she send for you or did you come of yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.\" Alyosha got up\nresolutely.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's most\nimportant,\" Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. \"God\nknows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's no matter her\nsending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me, I\ncan't trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,\nthough I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only fancy,\nhe's been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!\"\n\n\"How? What? When?\" Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat down\nagain and listened standing.\n\n\"I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don't know\nnow why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me\ntwice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a friend to\ncall on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came because he\nheard she was here. I didn't, of course, expect him to come often, knowing\nwhat a lot he has to do as it is, _vous comprenez, cette affaire et la\nmort terrible de votre papa_. But I suddenly heard he'd been here again,\nnot to see me but to see Lise. That's six days ago now. He came, stayed\nfive minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days\nafterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for Lise\ndirectly. She laughed. 'He thought you were asleep,' she said, 'and came\nin to me to ask after your health.' Of course, that's how it happened. But\nLise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me! Would you believe it, one\nnight, four days ago, just after you saw her last time, and had gone away,\nshe suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never\nhave hysterics? Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the\nthird, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly\nscreamed out, 'I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting\nhim come to the house again.' I was struck dumb at these amazing words,\nand answered, 'On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent\nyoung man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?'--for all\nthis business is a misfortune, isn't it? She suddenly burst out laughing\nat my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I had\namused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse\nto see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without\nmy knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early this\nmorning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you\nbelieve it, slapped her in the face. That's monstrous; I am always polite\nto my servants. And an hour later she was hugging Yulia's feet and kissing\nthem. She sent a message to me that she wasn't coming to me at all, and\nwould never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her,\nshe rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of\nthe room without saying a word, so I couldn't find out what was the\nmatter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of\ncourse, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and\nfind out everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell\nme--me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply\nthe death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no\nmore. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then\nsomething awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!\" cried\nMadame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. \"You\nare late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense.\nWhat does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?\"\n\n\"To Lise.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you? It's a\nquestion of life and death!\"\n\n\"Of course, I won't forget, if I can ... but I am so late,\" muttered\nAlyosha, beating a hasty retreat.\n\n\"No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say 'If you can.' I shall die if\nyou don't,\" Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had already left\nthe room.\n\n\n\nChapter III. A Little Demon\n\n\nGoing in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair, in\nwhich she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk. She did not move\nto meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his face.\nThere was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and yellow.\nAlyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three\ndays. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand to him. He\ntouched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he\nsat down facing her, without a word.\n\n\"I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,\" Lise said curtly, \"and\nmamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been telling you about me and\nYulia.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do\nlisten, there's no harm in that. I don't apologize.\"\n\n\"You are upset about something?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been reflecting for the\nthirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your\nwife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you and give you\na note to take to the man I loved after you, you'd take it and be sure to\ngive it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you were forty, you would\nstill go on taking my love-letters for me.\"\n\nShe suddenly laughed.\n\n\"There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,\" Alyosha\nsmiled to her.\n\n\"The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you.\nWhat's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.\nAlyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very fond of you, but I don't\nrespect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't talk to you without shame,\nshould I?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't believe it.\"\n\nLise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.\n\n\"I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha,\nyou know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having so\nquickly allowed me not to love you.\"\n\n\"Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to\ntorture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I don't\nwant to be happy.\"\n\n\"You are in love with disorder?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keep\nimagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it must\nbe on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go on burning. And I\nshall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I am!\"\n\nShe waved her hand with a look of repulsion.\n\n\"It's your luxurious life,\" said Alyosha, softly.\n\n\"Is it better, then, to be poor?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is better.\"\n\n\"That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me be rich and all\nthe rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one\nelse. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything,\" she shook her hand at him,\nthough Alyosha had not opened his mouth. \"You've told me all that before,\nI know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder\nsomebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps--why do\nnothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry\nyou, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt,\nshall we? Do you know Kalganov?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, 'Why live in real life?\nIt's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful things, but real\nlife is a bore.' But he'll be married soon for all that; he's been making\nlove to me already. Can you spin tops?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning and\nthen to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, I'll keep\nhim spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things. I don't\nwant to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the\ngreatest sin? You must know all about that.\"\n\n\"God will censure you.\" Alyosha was watching her steadily.\n\n\"That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure me,\nand I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like to\nset fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don't believe me?\"\n\n\"Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set\nfire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's a sort of\ndisease.\"\n\n\"That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but that's not\nwhat I mean.\"\n\n\"You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your\nillness, perhaps.\"\n\n\"You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do good, I\nwant to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.\"\n\n\"Why do evil?\"\n\n\"So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be if\neverything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing a\nfearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a long\nwhile on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every one will\nstand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all.\nThat would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, to\nset fire to something. It happens sometimes.\"\n\n\"I not only say it, I shall do it.\"\n\n\"I believe you.\"\n\n\"Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying one\nlittle bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to\nannoy you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do\nthat in it, too.\"\n\n\"There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,\" she declared, with a\nstrange fire in her eyes.\n\nWhat struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not a\ntrace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun and\ngayety never deserted her even at her most \"earnest\" moments.\n\n\"There are moments when people love crime,\" said Alyosha thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves\ncrime, they love it always, not at some 'moments.' You know, it's as\nthough people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about\nit ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all\nlove it.\"\n\n\"And are you still reading nasty books?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal\nthem.\"\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?\"\n\n\"I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down between the\nrailway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, your\nbrother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves\nhis having killed his father.\"\n\n\"Loves his having killed his father?\"\n\n\"Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it's so awful, but\nsecretly they simply love it. I for one love it.\"\n\n\"There is some truth in what you say about every one,\" said Alyosha\nsoftly.\n\n\"Oh, what ideas you have!\" Lise shrieked in delight. \"And you a monk, too!\nYou wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies.\nOh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils.\nIt's night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils\nall over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the\ndoors; there's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and\nseize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross\nmyself and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they\nstand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have a\nfrightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come\ncrowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I cross myself\nagain and they all draw back. It's awful fun. it takes one's breath away.\"\n\n\"I've had the same dream, too,\" said Alyosha suddenly.\n\n\"Really?\" cried Lise, surprised. \"I say, Alyosha, don't laugh, that's\nawfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?\"\n\n\"It seems they can.\"\n\n\"Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important,\" Lise went on, with really\nexcessive amazement. \"It's not the dream that's important, but your having\nthe same dream as me. You never lie to me, don't lie now: is it true? You\nare not laughing?\"\n\n\"It's true.\"\n\nLise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was\nsilent.\n\n\"Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,\" she said suddenly,\nin a supplicating voice.\n\n\"I'll always come to see you, all my life,\" answered Alyosha firmly.\n\n\"You are the only person I can talk to, you know,\" Lise began again. \"I\ntalk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to you\nmore readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a\nbit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it\ntrue that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took a\nchild of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and then\ncrucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him, and\nafterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, within\nfour hours. That was 'soon'! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning and\nhe stood admiring it. That's nice!\"\n\n\"Nice?\"\n\n\"Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hang\nthere moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple _compote_. I\nam awfully fond of pineapple _compote_. Do you like it?\"\n\nAlyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly\ncontorted, her eyes burned.\n\n\"You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I kept\nfancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four years old\nunderstands, you know), and all the while the thought of pineapple\n_compote_ haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person,\nbegging him _particularly_ to come and see me. He came and I suddenly told\nhim all about the child and the pineapple _compote_. _All_ about it,\n_all_, and said that it was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice.\nThen he got up and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he\ndespise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise\nme or not?\" She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Alyosha asked anxiously, \"did you send for that person?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Did you send him a letter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Simply to ask about that, about that child?\"\n\n\"No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that at\nonce. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.\"\n\n\"That person behaved honorably,\" Alyosha murmured.\n\n\"And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?\"\n\n\"No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple _compote_ himself. He is\nvery ill now, too, Lise.\"\n\n\"Yes, he does believe in it,\" said Lise, with flashing eyes.\n\n\"He doesn't despise any one,\" Alyosha went on. \"Only he does not believe\nany one. If he doesn't believe in people, of course, he does despise\nthem.\"\n\n\"Then he despises me, me?\"\n\n\"You, too.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Lise seemed to grind her teeth. \"When he went out laughing, I felt\nthat it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is nice,\nand to be despised is nice....\"\n\nAnd she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious laugh.\n\n\"Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like--Alyosha, save me!\" She\nsuddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with both\nhands. \"Save me!\" she almost groaned. \"Is there any one in the world I\ncould tell what I've told you? I've told you the truth, the truth. I shall\nkill myself, because I loathe everything! I don't want to live, because I\nloathe everything! I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you\nlove me in the least?\" she finished in a frenzy.\n\n\"But I do love you!\" answered Alyosha warmly.\n\n\"And will you weep over me, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me and\ntrample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting _any one_. For\nI don't love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hate\nhim! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went to your brother\"; she tore herself\naway from him suddenly.\n\n\"How can I leave you like this?\" said Alyosha, almost in alarm.\n\n\"Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your hat. Give my\nlove to Mitya, go, go!\"\n\nAnd she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at her\nwith pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right\nhand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it and\ninstantly read the address, \"To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.\" He looked\nquickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.\n\n\"Give it to him, you must give it to him!\" she ordered him, trembling and\nbeside herself. \"To-day, at once, or I'll poison myself! That's why I sent\nfor you.\"\n\nAnd she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the note\nin his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to Madame\nHohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone, Lise\nunbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack and\nslammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten seconds\nafter, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat\nup straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the\nblood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept\nwhispering rapidly to herself:\n\n\"I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV. A Hymn And A Secret\n\n\nIt was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at the\nprison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he would\nbe admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, as\neverywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminary\ninquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews\nwith Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities. But later,\nthough the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at\nleast, of Mitya's visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews with\nthe prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically\n_tete-a-tete_.\n\nThese exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha and\nRakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police, Mihail\nMihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His abuse of her\nat Mokroe weighed on the old man's conscience, and when he learned the\nwhole story, he completely changed his view of her. And strange to say,\nthough he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in\nprison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. \"He\nwas a man of good heart, perhaps,\" he thought, \"who had come to grief from\ndrinking and dissipation.\" His first horror had been succeeded by pity. As\nfor Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for\na long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to see\nthe prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the \"police\ncaptain's young ladies,\" as he called them, and was always hanging about\ntheir house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,\ntoo, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his duties, was a kind-\nhearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long\nstanding with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him,\ngenerally on sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in\nawe of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself; \"self-\ntaught,\" of course. But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him.\nDuring the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal\nGospels, and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend.\nHe used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours\ntogether with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the\nprison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made\neasy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had\ngrown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so long\nas the authorities were satisfied.\n\nWhen Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to the\nplace set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came upon\nRakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talking\nloudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while Rakitin\nseemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of\nlate. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha\nenter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed\nin buttoning his big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at\nonce for his umbrella.\n\n\"I must mind not to forget my belongings,\" he muttered, simply to say\nsomething.\n\n\"Mind you don't forget other people's belongings,\" said Mitya, as a joke,\nand laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.\n\n\"You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've always been a\nslave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,\" he cried, suddenly trembling with\nanger.\n\n\"What's the matter? I was joking,\" cried Mitya. \"Damn it all! They are all\nlike that,\" he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin's hurriedly\nretreating figure. \"He was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all at\nonce he boils up like that. He didn't even nod to you. Have you broken\nwith him completely? Why are you so late? I've not been simply waiting,\nbut thirsting for you the whole morning. But never mind. We'll make up for\nit now.\"\n\n\"Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?\"\nasked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likely--a pig\nlike that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They can't understand a\njoke either, that's the worst of such people. They never understand a\njoke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prison\nwalls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever fellow, very\nclever. Well, Alexey, it's all over with me now.\"\n\nHe sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.\n\n\"Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?\" Alyosha said,\nwith an apprehensive feeling.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Mitya, looking at him rather\nuncertainly. \"Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we've been\ntalking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but I haven't said\na word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but it\nwasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you\nlook at me so critically?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mitya?\"\n\n\"Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?\"\n\n\"Ethics?\" asked Alyosha, wondering.\n\n\"Yes; is it a science?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can't explain to you\nwhat sort of science it is.\"\n\n\"Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He's not going to be a\nmonk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he'll go in for criticism of an\nelevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career,\ntoo. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career! Damn\nethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than\nany one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?\"\n\n\"Karl Bernard?\" Alyosha was surprised again.\n\n\"No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he?\nChemist or what?\"\n\n\"He must be a savant,\" answered Alyosha; \"but I confess I can't tell you\nmuch about him, either. I've heard of him as a savant, but what sort I\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"Well, damn him, then! I don't know either,\" swore Mitya. \"A scoundrel of\nsome sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make his\nway. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard. Ugh, these\nBernards! They are all over the place.\"\n\n\"But what is the matter?\" Alyosha asked insistently.\n\n\"He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his\nliterary career. That's what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants to\nprove some theory. He wants to say 'he couldn't help murdering his father,\nhe was corrupted by his environment,' and so on. He explained it all to\nme. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn\nthe fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don't care. He can't bear\nIvan, he hates him. He's not fond of you, either. But I don't turn him\nout, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him\njust now, 'The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for all\ntrue Russians are philosophers, and though you've studied, you are not a\nphilosopher--you are a low fellow.' He laughed, so maliciously. And I said\nto him, '_De ideabus non est disputandum_.' Isn't that rather good? I can\nset up for being a classic, you see!\" Mitya laughed suddenly.\n\n\"Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,\" Alyosha interposed.\n\n\"Why is it all over with me? H'm!... The fact of it is ... if you take it\nas a whole, I am sorry to lose God--that's why it is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'sorry to lose God'?\"\n\n\"Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head--that is, these nerves are\nthere in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, the\nlittle tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ... that\nis, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin\nquivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image\nappears ... it doesn't appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes\n... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment--devil\ntake the moment!--but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it!\nThat's why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at all\nbecause I've got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness.\nAll that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother,\nand it simply bowled me over. It's magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A\nnew man's arising--that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!\"\n\n\"Well, that's a good thing, anyway,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"That I am sorry to lose God? It's chemistry, brother, chemistry! There's\nno help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry. And\nRakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn't he dislike Him! That's the sore\npoint with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend.\n'Will you preach this in your reviews?' I asked him. 'Oh, well, if I did\nit openly, they won't let it through,' he said. He laughed. 'But what will\nbecome of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All\nthings are lawful then, they can do what they like?' 'Didn't you know?' he\nsaid laughing, 'a clever man can do what he likes,' he said. 'A clever man\nknows his way about, but you've put your foot in it, committing a murder,\nand now you are rotting in prison.' He says that to my face! A regular\npig! I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a\nlot of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week.\nI copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.\"\n\nMitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:\n\n\" 'In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to put\none's personality in contradiction to one's reality.' Do you understand\nthat?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him with\ncuriosity.\n\n\"I don't understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual.\n'Every one writes like that now,' he says, 'it's the effect of their\nenvironment.' They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry, too,\nthe rascal. He's written in honor of Madame Hohlakov's foot. Ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"I've heard about it,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Have you? And have you heard the poem?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I've got it. Here it is. I'll read it to you. You don't know--I haven't\ntold you--there's quite a story about it. He's a rascal! Three weeks ago he\nbegan to tease me. 'You've got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the\nsake of three thousand, but I'm going to collar a hundred and fifty\nthousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.' And\nhe told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She hadn't much brains in her\nyouth, and now at forty she has lost what she had. 'But she's awfully\nsentimental,' he says; 'that's how I shall get hold of her. When I marry\nher, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.'\nAnd his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for\nthe hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to see\nme every day. 'She is coming round,' he declared. He was beaming with\ndelight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house.\nPerhotin's carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly\nold noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had written this\ndoggerel. 'It's the first time I've soiled my hands with writing poetry,'\nhe said. 'It's to win her heart, so it's in a good cause. When I get hold\nof the silly woman's fortune, I can be of great social utility.' They have\nthis social justification for every nasty thing they do! 'Anyway it's\nbetter than your Pushkin's poetry,' he said, 'for I've managed to advocate\nenlightenment even in that.' I understand what he means about Pushkin, I\nquite see that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about\nwomen's feet. But wasn't Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity\nof these fellows! 'On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object\nof my affections'--he thought of that for a title. He's a waggish fellow.\n\n\n    A captivating little foot,\n    Though swollen and red and tender!\n    The doctors come and plasters put,\n    But still they cannot mend her.\n\n    Yet, 'tis not for her foot I dread--\n    A theme for Pushkin's muse more fit--\n    It's not her foot, it is her head:\n    I tremble for her loss of wit!\n\n    For as her foot swells, strange to say,\n    Her intellect is on the wane--\n    Oh, for some remedy I pray\n    That may restore both foot and brain!\n\n\nHe is a pig, a regular pig, but he's very arch, the rascal! And he really\nhas put in a progressive idea. And wasn't he angry when she kicked him\nout! He was gnashing his teeth!\"\n\n\"He's taken his revenge already,\" said Alyosha. \"He's written a paragraph\nabout Madame Hohlakov.\"\n\nAnd Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.\n\n\"That's his doing, that's his doing!\" Mitya assented, frowning. \"That's\nhim! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been\nwritten about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... H'm!\"\n\nHe walked across the room with a harassed air.\n\n\"Brother, I cannot stay long,\" Alyosha said, after a pause. \"To-morrow\nwill be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be\naccomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I\ndon't know what ...\"\n\n\"No, don't be amazed at me,\" Mitya broke in warmly. \"Am I to talk of that\nstinking dog? Of the murderer? We've talked enough of him. I don't want to\nsay more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you\nwill see. Hush!\"\n\nHe went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.\n\n\"Rakitin wouldn't understand it,\" he began in a sort of exaltation; \"but\nyou, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting for you. You\nsee, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here,\nwithin these peeling walls, but I haven't said a word about what matters\nmost; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I\nmust pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two months I've found\nin myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me,\nbut would never have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this blow\nfrom heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years in\nthe mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of that--it's\nsomething else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me. Even\nthere, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in another\nconvict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even\nthere one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen\nheart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bring\nup from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one\nmay bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them,\nhundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamed\nof that 'babe' at such a moment? 'Why is the babe so poor?' That was a\nsign to me at that moment. It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are all\nresponsible for all. For all the 'babes,' for there are big children as\nwell as little children. All are 'babes.' I go for all, because some one\nmust go for all. I didn't kill father, but I've got to go. I accept it.\nIt's all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are\nnumbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their\nhands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but\nthen, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man\ncannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it's His privilege--a grand\none. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground\nthere without God? Rakitin's laughing! If they drive God from the earth,\nwe shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison without God;\nit's even more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground\nwill sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whom\nis joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!\"\n\nMitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. He\nturned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\"Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,\" he began again. \"You\nwouldn't believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst for\nexistence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling\nwalls. Rakitin doesn't understand that; all he cares about is building a\nhouse and letting flats. But I've been longing for you. And what is\nsuffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am\nnot afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I\nwon't answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have such strength in\nme now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be\nable to say and to repeat to myself every moment, 'I exist.' In thousands\nof agonies--I exist. I'm tormented on the rack--but I exist! Though I sit\nalone on a pillar--I exist! I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun, I\nknow it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun\nis there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me.\nDamn them! Brother Ivan--\"\n\n\"What of brother Ivan?\" interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.\n\n\"You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden\naway in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were\nsurging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was to\nstifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not\nRakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he is\nalways silent. It's God that's worrying me. That's the only thing that's\nworrying me. What if He doesn't exist? What if Rakitin's right--that it's\nan idea made up by men? Then if He doesn't exist, man is the chief of the\nearth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good\nwithout God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom is\nman going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing\nthe hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without\nGod. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can't understand\nit. Life's easy for Rakitin. 'You'd better think about the extension of\ncivic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show\nyour love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by\nphilosophy.' I answered him, 'Well, but you, without a God, are more\nlikely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on\nevery copeck.' He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer\nme that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a\nChinaman, so it's a relative thing. Or isn't it? Is it not relative? A\ntreacherous question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's kept me awake two\nnights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.\nVanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It's beyond me. But he is silent.\nI believe he is a free-mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to\ndrink from the springs of his soul--he was silent. But once he did drop a\nword.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" Alyosha took it up quickly.\n\n\"I said to him, 'Then everything is lawful, if it is so?' He frowned.\n'Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,' he said, 'was a pig, but his ideas were\nright enough.' That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That was\ngoing one better than Rakitin.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Alyosha assented bitterly. \"When was he with you?\"\n\n\"Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing\nabout Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business here\nis over and the verdict has been given, then I'll tell you something. I'll\ntell you everything. We've something tremendous on hand.... And you shall\nbe my judge in it. But don't begin about that now; be silent. You talk of\nto-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about\nit.\"\n\n\"Have you talked to the counsel?\"\n\n\"What's the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He's a soft,\ncity-bred rogue--a Bernard! But he doesn't believe me--not a bit of it. Only\nimagine, he believes I did it. I see it. 'In that case,' I asked him, 'why\nhave you come to defend me?' Hang them all! They've got a doctor down,\ntoo, want to prove I'm mad. I won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to\ndo her 'duty' to the end, whatever the strain!\" Mitya smiled bitterly.\n\"The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe\nthat she was a woman of 'great wrath.' They repeated it. Yes, the facts\nagainst me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks to\nhis point. Grigory's honest, but a fool. Many people are honest because\nthey are fools: that's Rakitin's idea. Grigory's my enemy. And there are\nsome people who are better as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna.\nI am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground\nafter that four thousand. She'll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't\nwant her sacrifice; they'll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I\ncan stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the\ncourt, can't you? But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get through\nsomehow. I don't pity her. It's her own doing. She deserves what she gets.\nI shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.\" He smiled bitterly again.\n\"Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such\nsuffering to bear?\" he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. \"Grusha's killing\nme; the thought of her's killing me, killing me. She was with me just\nnow....\"\n\n\"She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.\"\n\n\"I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her as\nshe was going. I didn't ask her forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you?\" exclaimed Alyosha.\n\nSuddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.\n\n\"God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault\nfrom a woman you love. From one you love especially, however greatly you\nmay have been in fault. For a woman--devil only knows what to make of a\nwoman! I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are\nin fault to a woman. Say, 'I am sorry, forgive me,' and a shower of\nreproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply and\ndirectly, she'll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have\nnever happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her\nown, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it.\nShe'll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They are\nready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels\nwithout whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy,\nevery decent man ought to be under some woman's thumb. That's my\nconviction--not conviction, but feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and\nit's no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a Caesar! But\ndon't ever beg her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule\ngiven you by your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women. No, I'd\nbetter make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship\nher, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn't see it. No, she still thinks I\ndon't love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. The\npast was nothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers\nthat tortured me, but now I've taken all her soul into my soul and through\nher I've become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall\ndie of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you\nabout me?\"\n\nAlyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened,\nmade him repeat things, and seemed pleased.\n\n\"Then she is not angry at my being jealous?\" he exclaimed. \"She is a\nregular woman! 'I've a fierce heart myself!' Ah, I love such fierce\nhearts, though I can't bear any one's being jealous of me. I can't endure\nit. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely.\nWill they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That's the question. And\nwithout her I can't exist....\"\n\nMitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly\nseemed terribly worried.\n\n\"So there's a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against\nher, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka,\nthat's not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine\nway. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I'll tell you our secret!\"\n\nHe looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before\nhim, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one\ncould hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word\ncould reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.\n\n\"I will tell you all our secret,\" Mitya whispered hurriedly. \"I meant to\ntell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are\neverything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my\nangel. It's your decision will decide it. Perhaps it's you that is\nsuperior and not Ivan. You see, it's a question of conscience, question of\nthe higher conscience--the secret is so important that I can't settle it\nmyself, and I've put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it's too\nearly to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the\nverdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell\nyou now. You listen, but don't decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell\nyou everything. I'll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep\nquiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what\nshall I do with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes will tell me your\ndecision, even if you don't speak. Oo! I'm afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan\nsuggests my _escaping_. I won't tell you the details: it's all been\nthought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don't decide. I should go to\nAmerica with Grusha. You know I can't live without Grusha! What if they\nwon't let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan\nthinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a\nhammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other\nhand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has\ncome, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on\nit. Ivan says that in America, 'with the good-will,' I can be of more use\nthan underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? What's\nAmerica? America is vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in\nAmerica, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell\nyou, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand\nthis. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to others, all I've told\nyou of the hymn. They'll say I'm out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of\nmy mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He\nunderstands, only he doesn't answer--he doesn't speak. He doesn't believe\nin the hymn. Don't speak, don't speak. I see how you look! You have\nalready decided. Don't decide, spare me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait\ntill after the trial!\"\n\nMitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on his\nshoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brother's.\n\n\"They don't let convicts marry, do they?\" he repeated for the third time\nin a supplicating voice.\n\nAlyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" he said. \"Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was\nit?\"\n\n\"His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn't come to see me at first,\nthen he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away. He\nis awfully keen on it. He doesn't ask me, but orders me to escape. He\ndoesn't doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my heart as I\nhave to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me he'd arrange it;\nhe's found out about everything. But of that later. He's simply set on it.\nIt's all a matter of money: he'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me\ntwenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent\nescape for ten thousand.\"\n\n\"And he told you on no account to tell me?\" Alyosha asked again.\n\n\"To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He is\nafraid, no doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience. Don't tell\nhim I told you. Don't tell him, for anything.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" Alyosha pronounced; \"it's impossible to decide anything\nbefore the trial is over. After the trial you'll decide of yourself. Then\nyou'll find that new man in yourself and he will decide.\"\n\n\"A new man, or a Bernard who'll decide _a la_ Bernard, for I believe I'm a\ncontemptible Bernard myself,\" said Mitya, with a bitter grin.\n\n\"But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?\"\n\nMitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. \"Alyosha,\ndarling, it's time you were going,\" he said, with a sudden haste. \"There's\nthe superintendent shouting in the yard. He'll be here directly. We are\nlate; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the cross,\ndarling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow.\"\n\nThey embraced and kissed.\n\n\"Ivan,\" said Mitya suddenly, \"suggests my escaping; but, of course, he\nbelieves I did it.\"\n\nA mournful smile came on to his lips.\n\n\"Have you asked him whether he believes it?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I hadn't the courage. But I\nsaw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!\"\n\nOnce more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when\nMitya suddenly called him back.\n\n\"Stand facing me! That's right!\" And again he seized Alyosha, putting both\nhands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it\nwas dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips\ntwitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.\n\n\"Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe\nI did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don't\nlie!\" he cried desperately.\n\nEverything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a\nstab at his heart.\n\n\"Hush! What do you mean?\" he faltered helplessly.\n\n\"The whole truth, the whole, don't lie!\" repeated Mitya.\n\n\"I've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!\" broke in\na shaking voice from Alyosha's breast, and he raised his right hand in the\nair, as though calling God to witness his words.\n\nMitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss.\n\n\"Thank you!\" he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him\nafter fainting. \"Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it,\ntill this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go!\nYou've given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along!\nLove Ivan!\" was Mitya's last word.\n\nAlyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of\nconfidence even to him, to Alyosha--all this suddenly opened before Alyosha\nan unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his\nunhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly.\nThere was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \"Love Ivan!\"--he suddenly\nrecalled Mitya's words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see\nIvan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more\nthan ever now.\n\n\n\nChapter V. Not You, Not You!\n\n\nOn the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was\nliving. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved\nto go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now\nit struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the\nterrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted\nby a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he\nrecognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina\nIvanovna.\n\n\"Ah, it's only you,\" said Ivan dryly. \"Well, good-by! You are going to\nher?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her more.\"\n\nA door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:\n\n\"No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been with him.\"\n\n\"Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch,\nyou must come back, you must. Do you hear?\"\n\nThere was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan, after a\nmoment's hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.\n\n\"She was listening,\" he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it.\n\n\"Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,\" said Ivan, going into the drawing-\nroom. \"I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a minute.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" said Katerina Ivanovna, though she\nremained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but there\nwas an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that\nshe had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment.\n\n\"What did he ask you to tell me?\"\n\n\"Only one thing,\" said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, \"that\nyou would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what\" (he was a\nlittle confused) \"... passed between you ... at the time of your first\nacquaintance ... in that town.\"\n\n\"Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!\" She broke into a\nbitter laugh. \"Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to\nspare--whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!\"\n\nAlyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.\n\n\"Both yourself and him,\" he answered softly.\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly\nblushed.\n\n\"You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" she said menacingly. \"And I\ndon't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to trample me under foot after\nmy examination to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You will give your evidence honorably,\" said Alyosha; \"that's all that's\nwanted.\"\n\n\"Women are often dishonorable,\" she snarled. \"Only an hour ago I was\nthinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a\nreptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Is\nhe the murderer?\" she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning\nquickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question\nbefore, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first\ntime, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.\n\n\"I've been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he\nmurdered his father. It's only you I believed!\" she continued, still\naddressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at\nher tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.\n\n\"Well, that's enough, anyway,\" Ivan cut short the conversation. \"I am\ngoing. I'll come to-morrow.\" And turning at once, he walked out of the\nroom and went straight downstairs.\n\nWith an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands.\n\n\"Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!\" she said,\nin a hurried whisper. \"He's mad! Don't you know that he's mad? He is in a\nfever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....\"\n\nAlyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of\nhim.\n\n\"What do you want?\" He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was\nrunning after him. \"She told you to catch me up, because I'm mad. I know\nit all by heart,\" he added irritably.\n\n\"She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,\" said\nAlyosha. \"I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.\"\n\nIvan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.\n\n\"And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their\nmind?\" Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of\nirritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.\n\n\"No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\"\n\n\"And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?\"\n\n\"I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\" Alyosha\nanswered with surprise.\n\nIvan paused for half a minute.\n\n\"If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,\" said Alyosha timidly,\nand he took Lise's note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were\njust under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.\n\n\"Ah, from that little demon!\" he laughed maliciously, and, without opening\nthe envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were\nscattered by the wind.\n\n\"She's not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,\" he said\ncontemptuously, striding along the street again.\n\n\"How do you mean, offering herself?\" exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n\"As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.\"\n\n\"How can you, Ivan, how can you?\" Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved\nvoice. \"She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is very\nill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped to\nhear something from you ... that would save her.\"\n\n\"You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Be\nquiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.\"\n\nThey were silent again for a moment.\n\n\"She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to\nact to-morrow at the trial,\" he said sharply and angrily again.\n\n\"You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?\"\n\n\"Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray for light from\nabove. She can't make up her mind for herself, you see. She has not had\ntime to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants me to sing\nlullabies to her.\"\n\n\"Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,\" said Alyosha sadly.\n\n\"Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.\"\n\n\"She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give\nher hope?\" Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. \"I know that you've given\nher hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,\" he added.\n\n\"I can't behave to her as I ought--break off altogether and tell her so\nstraight out,\" said Ivan, irritably. \"I must wait till sentence is passed\non the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge herself on\nme by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she hates him and\nknows she hates him. It's all a lie--lie upon lie! As long as I don't break\noff with her, she goes on hoping, and she won't ruin that monster, knowing\nhow I want to get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would\ncome!\"\n\nThe words \"murderer\" and \"monster\" echoed painfully in Alyosha's heart.\n\n\"But how can she ruin Mitya?\" he asked, pondering on Ivan's words. \"What\nevidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?\"\n\n\"You don't know that yet. She's got a document in her hands, in Mitya's\nown writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor\nPavlovitch.\"\n\n\"That's impossible!\" cried Alyosha.\n\n\"Why is it impossible? I've read it myself.\"\n\n\"There can't be such a document!\" Alyosha repeated warmly. \"There can't\nbe, because he's not the murderer. It's not he murdered father, not he!\"\n\nIvan suddenly stopped.\n\n\"Who is the murderer then, according to you?\" he asked, with apparent\ncoldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.\n\n\"You know who,\" Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.\n\n\"Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,\nSmerdyakov?\"\n\nAlyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.\n\n\"You know who,\" broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.\n\n\"Who? Who?\" Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly\nvanished.\n\n\"I only know one thing,\" Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, \"_it\nwasn't you_ killed father.\"\n\n\" 'Not you'! What do you mean by 'not you'?\" Ivan was thunderstruck.\n\n\"It was not you killed father, not you!\" Alyosha repeated firmly.\n\nThe silence lasted for half a minute.\n\n\"I know I didn't. Are you raving?\" said Ivan, with a pale, distorted\nsmile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under a\nlamp-post.\n\n\"No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are the murderer.\"\n\n\"When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?\" Ivan\nfaltered helplessly.\n\n\"You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone during\nthese two dreadful months,\" Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as\nbefore. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his\nown will, but obeying some irresistible command. \"You have accused\nyourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no\none else. But you didn't do it: you are mistaken: you are not the\nmurderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.\"\n\nThey were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They were\nboth standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They were both pale.\nSuddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha's shoulder.\n\n\"You've been in my room!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"You've been there at\nnight, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean--Mitya?\" Alyosha asked, bewildered.\n\n\"Not him, damn the monster!\" Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. \"Do you know that\nhe visits me? How did you find out? Speak!\"\n\n\"Who is _he_! I don't know whom you are talking about,\" Alyosha faltered,\nbeginning to be alarmed.\n\n\"Yes, you do know ... or how could you--? It's impossible that you don't\nknow.\"\n\nSuddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to reflect.\nA strange grin contorted his lips.\n\n\"Brother,\" Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, \"I have said this to\nyou, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and for\nall, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into my heart to\nsay this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.\"\n\nBut by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.\n\n\"Alexey Fyodorovitch,\" he said, with a cold smile, \"I can't endure\nprophets and epileptics--messengers from God especially--and you know that\nonly too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment and\nprobably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. It's the way to\nyour lodgings, too. You'd better be particularly careful not to come to me\nto-day! Do you hear?\"\n\nHe turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.\n\n\"Brother,\" Alyosha called after him, \"if anything happens to you to-day,\nturn to me before any one!\"\n\nBut Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross\nroads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and walked\nslowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neither\nof them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch's empty house. Alyosha\nhad a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived some\ndistance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge\nattached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of\nan official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who\nwent to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.\nIvan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and very\nfond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one room he\nlived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode.\n\nHe reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when he\nsuddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.\nSuddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked with\nrapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half to a\ntiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the\nneighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and to\nwhom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now\nlodging. She had sold their little house, and was now living here with her\nmother. Smerdyakov, who was ill--almost dying--had been with them ever since\nFyodor Pavlovitch's death. It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by a\nsudden and irresistible prompting.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov\n\n\nThis was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his\nreturn from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him was\non the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, a\nfortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that it\nwas now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard\nanything of him.\n\nIvan had only returned five days after his father's death, so that he was\nnot present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back.\nThe cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address,\nhad to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, not\nknowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning\non Ivan's going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did\nnot go to them till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram,\nhe had, of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him\nwas Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to\nthe general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion\nagainst Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on,\nafter seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the\ndetails of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised at\nAlyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly\nfeeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very\nfond.\n\nBy the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his brother\nDmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassion\nfor him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance.\nMitya's whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractive\nto him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna's love for his\nbrother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and\nthat interview, far from shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively\nstrengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya\nhad been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violent\nlanguage, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked\nprincipally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had been\n\"stolen\" from him by his father.\n\n\"The money was mine, it was my money,\" Mitya kept repeating. \"Even if I\nhad stolen it, I should have had the right.\"\n\nHe hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a\nfact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardly\nseemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite the\ncontrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; he\nwas continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughed\ncontemptuously at Grigory's evidence about the open door, and declared\nthat it was \"the devil that opened it.\" But he could not bring forward any\ncoherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan\nduring their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for\npeople who declared that \"everything was lawful,\" to suspect and question\nhim. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.\nImmediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time\nto see Smerdyakov.\n\nIn the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of\nSmerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he\nwent away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he\ngave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the\ntime, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov,\nwho was at that time in the hospital.\n\nDoctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital,\nconfidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent questions, that\nSmerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised\nindeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day\nof the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an\nexceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that\nthe patient's life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after\nthey had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the\npatient would survive. \"Though it might well be,\" added Doctor\nHerzenstube, \"that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period,\nif not permanently.\" On Ivan's asking impatiently whether that meant that\nhe was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full\nsense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan\ndecided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.\n\nAt the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov was\nlying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was only one other bed in\nthe room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, who\nwas obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to their\nconversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the\nfirst instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only\nmomentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by\nSmerdyakov's composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he\nwas very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his\ntongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the\ninterview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining of headache\nand of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate face seemed to have\nbecome so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his crest of curls in front\nstood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye, which was screwed up and\nseemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged.\n\"It's always worth while speaking to a clever man.\" Ivan was reminded of\nthat at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with\npainful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to\nspeak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.\n\n\"Can you talk to me?\" asked Ivan. \"I won't tire you much.\"\n\n\"Certainly I can,\" mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. \"Has your honor\nbeen back long?\" he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous\nvisitor.\n\n\"I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.\" Smerdyakov\nsighed.\n\n\"Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,\" Ivan blurted out.\n\nSmerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.\n\n\"How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell\nit would turn out like that?\"\n\n\"What would turn out? Don't prevaricate! You've foretold you'd have a fit;\non the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.\"\n\n\"Have you said so at the examination yet?\" Smerdyakov queried with\ncomposure.\n\nIvan felt suddenly angry.\n\n\"No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great deal\nto me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with\nme!\"\n\n\"Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God\nAlmighty?\" said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment\nclosing his eyes.\n\n\"In the first place,\" began Ivan, \"I know that epileptic fits can't be\ntold beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in. You can't\nforetell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour\nbeforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you would\nfall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn't sham a fit on\npurpose?\"\n\n\"I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,\"\nSmerdyakov drawled deliberately. \"I fell from the garret just in the same\nway a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and hour of a fit\nbeforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.\"\n\n\"But you did foretell the day and the hour!\"\n\n\"In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctors\nhere. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; it's no use my\nsaying any more about it.\"\n\n\"And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?\"\n\n\"You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to the\ncellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most was\nlosing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I went down\ninto the cellar thinking, 'Here, it'll come on directly, it'll strike me\ndown directly, shall I fall?' And it was through this fear that I suddenly\nfelt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying. All that and\nall my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when\nI told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that\nto Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer,\nand it's all been written down in the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr.\nVarvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it\nbrought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that\nthe fit seized me. And so they've written it down, that it's just how it\nmust have happened, simply from my fear.\"\n\nAs he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.\n\n\"Then you have said all that in your evidence?\" said Ivan, somewhat taken\naback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their\nconversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all\nhimself.\n\n\"What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,\"\nSmerdyakov pronounced firmly.\n\n\"And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?\"\n\n\"No, not to say every word.\"\n\n\"And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't tell them that either.\"\n\n\"Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.\"\n\n\"You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get\nout of the way of trouble.\"\n\n\"That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,\nforeseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare\nmyself even more. That's why I told you to get out of harm's way, that you\nmight understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would\nremain at home to protect your father.\"\n\n\"You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!\" Ivan suddenly fired\nup.\n\n\"How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that\nmade me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have been\napprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away\nthat money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tell\nthat it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he would only\ncarry off the three thousand that lay under the master's mattress in the\nenvelope, and you see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either,\nsir?\"\n\n\"But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could I have\nguessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!\" said Ivan,\npondering.\n\n\"You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to\nMoscow.\"\n\n\"How could I guess it from that?\"\n\nSmerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.\n\n\"You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to\nMoscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for\nMoscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not far\noff, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might have\ncome to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch's\nillness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those\nknocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that\nDmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would\nguess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn't go\nto Tchermashnya even, but would stay.\"\n\n\"He talks very coherently,\" thought Ivan, \"though he does mumble; what's\nthe derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?\"\n\n\"You are cunning with me, damn you!\" he exclaimed, getting angry.\n\n\"But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,\" Smerdyakov parried\nwith the simplest air.\n\n\"If I'd guessed, I should have stayed,\" cried Ivan.\n\n\"Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in\nsuch a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save\nyourself in your fright.\"\n\n\"You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, I thought you were like me.\"\n\n\"Of course, I ought to have guessed,\" Ivan said in agitation; \"and I did\nguess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying,\nyou are lying again,\" he cried, suddenly recollecting. \"Do you remember\nhow you went up to the carriage and said to me, 'It's always worth while\nspeaking to a clever man'? So you were glad I went away, since you praised\nme?\"\n\nSmerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.\n\n\"If I was pleased,\" he articulated rather breathlessly, \"it was simply\nbecause you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it was\nnearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way of\npraise, but of reproach. You didn't understand it.\"\n\n\"What reproach?\"\n\n\"Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and\nwould not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealing\nthat three thousand.\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" Ivan swore again. \"Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and the\ninvestigating lawyer about those knocks?\"\n\n\"I told them everything just as it was.\"\n\nIvan wondered inwardly again.\n\n\"If I thought of anything then,\" he began again, \"it was solely of some\nwickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would steal--I\ndid not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness from\nyou. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that\nfor?\"\n\n\"It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on\npurpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just\nfoolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.\"\n\n\"My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.\"\n\n\"What else is left for him to do?\" said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.\n\"And who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory\nVassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never\nmind him! He is trembling to save himself.\"\n\nHe slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added:\n\n\"And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is\nthe work of my hands--I've heard that already. But as to my being clever at\nshamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one,\nif I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been\nplanning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such\nevidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is\nthat likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one\nhears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to\ntell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me\ncompletely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if\nhe is so open-hearted beforehand? Any one can see that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by\nSmerdyakov's last argument. \"I don't suspect you at all, and I think it's\nabsurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you for\nsetting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but I'll come again. Meanwhile,\ngood-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?\"\n\n\"I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me,\nand provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good people\nvisit me every day.\"\n\n\"Good-by. But I shan't say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and\nI don't advise you to, either,\" something made Ivan say suddenly.\n\n\"I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say nothing\nof that conversation of ours at the gate.\"\n\nThen it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozen\nsteps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insulting\nsignificance in Smerdyakov's last words. He was almost on the point of\nturning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering,\n\"Nonsense!\" he went out of the hospital.\n\nHis chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not\nSmerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might have\nbeen expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the reason\nfor this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his\nsensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something.\nIn the following days he became convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he got to\nknow all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people\nof no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it\nwas almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at\nPlotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence\nseemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of\nthe knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory's evidence as\nto the open door. Grigory's wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions,\ndeclared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the\npartition wall. \"He was not three paces from our bed,\" and that although\nshe was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, \"He\nwas moaning the whole time, moaning continually.\"\n\nTalking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was\nnot mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle\nsmile.\n\n\"Do you know how he spends his time now?\" he asked; \"learning lists of\nFrench words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the\nFrench words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he\nhe!\"\n\nIvan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without\nrepulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that\nDmitri was not the murderer, and that \"in all probability\" Smerdyakov was.\nIvan always felt that Alyosha's opinion meant a great deal to him, and so\nhe was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that\nAlyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he\nnever began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,\nstruck Ivan particularly.\n\nBut he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart\nfrom that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to\nhis mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time\nto begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan's, which left its mark on\nall the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another\nnovel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here\nthat when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related\nalready, told him, \"I am not keen on her,\" it was an absolute lie: he\nloved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have\nmurdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by\nwhat had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan's return to meet him as\nher one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings.\nAnd here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently\nbefore (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she\nconsidered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not\nabandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov\nviolence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She was\ncontinually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted\nMitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were\nnumerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyosha\n\"lies upon lies.\" There was, of course, much that was false in it, and\nthat angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.\n\nHe did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's existence, and yet,\na fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted by the\nsame strange thoughts as before. It's enough to say that he was\ncontinually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in Fyodor\nPavlovitch's house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and\nlistened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he recalled that\nafterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly so\ndepressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to\nhimself, \"I am a scoundrel\"? And now he almost fancied that these\ntormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so\ncompletely did they take possession of him again. It was just after\nfancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once,\nand put a question to him:\n\n\"Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and\nafterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved 'the right to\ndesire'?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father's death or\nnot?\"\n\n\"I did think so,\" answered Alyosha, softly.\n\n\"It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you fancy\nthen that what I wished was just that 'one reptile should devour another';\nthat is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ...\nand that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?\"\n\nAlyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother's face.\n\n\"Speak!\" cried Ivan, \"I want above everything to know what you thought\nthen. I want the truth, the truth!\"\n\nHe drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.\n\n\"Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,\" whispered Alyosha, and\nhe did not add one softening phrase.\n\n\"Thanks,\" snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way.\nFrom that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and\nseemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gave\nup going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had not\ngone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov\n\n\nBy that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knew\nhis new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a\npassage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother, and\non the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them,\nwhether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had\ncome to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living\nthere for a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and\ndaughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly\nsuperior to themselves.\n\nIvan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the\npassage. By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he went straight to the better\nroom on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in the\nroom and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with blue paper, which\nwas a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroaches\nswarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling from\nthem. The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and two\nchairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with\npink patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little\nwindows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table stood a\nlittle copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But\nSmerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at the\ntable on a bench. He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing\nwith a pen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick,\nbut with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that\nhe had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,\nfuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the\nsides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather\ndirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which Ivan had\nnever seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenly\nredoubled Ivan's anger: \"A creature like that and wearing spectacles!\"\n\nSmerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor\nthrough his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from the\nbench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least\npossible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly; he\ntook it all in and noted it at once--most of all the look in Smerdyakov's\neyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. \"What do you want to\nintrude for?\" it seemed to say; \"we settled everything then; why have you\ncome again?\" Ivan could scarcely control himself.\n\n\"It's hot here,\" he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.\n\n\"Take off your coat,\" Smerdyakov conceded.\n\nIvan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He\ntook a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakov\nmanaged to sit down on his bench before him.\n\n\"To begin with, are we alone?\" Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. \"Can\nthey overhear us in there?\"\n\n\"No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a passage.\"\n\n\"Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving the\nhospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, you\nwouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate?\nWhat do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by it? Were you threatening\nme? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am\nafraid of you?\"\n\nIvan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obvious\nintention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show\nhis cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye winked, and\nhe at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and deliberation.\n\"You want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,\"\nhe seemed to say.\n\n\"This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowing\nbeforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his fate, and\nthat people mightn't after that conclude any evil about your feelings and\nperhaps of something else, too--that's what I promised not to tell the\nauthorities.\"\n\nThough Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself,\nyet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic, resentful\nand insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist passed before\nIvan's eyes for the first moment.\n\n\"How? What? Are you out of your mind?\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I _knew_ of the murder?\" Ivan cried at last, and he\nbrought his fist violently on the table. \"What do you mean by 'something\nelse, too'? Speak, scoundrel!\"\n\nSmerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.\n\n\"Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that 'something else, too'?\"\n\n\"The 'something else' I meant was that you probably, too, were very\ndesirous of your parent's death.\"\n\nIvan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so that\nhe fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed in tears.\nSaying, \"It's a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,\" he dried his eyes with\na very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minute\npassed.\n\n\"That's enough! Leave off,\" Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.\n\"Don't put me out of all patience.\"\n\nSmerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered face\nreflected the insult he had just received.\n\n\"So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant to\nkill my father?\"\n\n\"I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then,\" said Smerdyakov\nresentfully; \"and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that\nvery point.\"\n\n\"To sound what, what?\"\n\n\"Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be\nmurdered or not.\"\n\nWhat infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent tone\nto which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.\n\n\"It was you murdered him?\" he cried suddenly.\n\nSmerdyakov smiled contemptuously.\n\n\"You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered him. And I\nshould have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of\nit again.\"\n\n\"But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?\"\n\n\"As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a\nposition, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to\nsound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then\nthe business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago.\"\n\n\"I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought\nyou'd understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible man\nyou wouldn't care to talk of it openly.\"\n\n\"What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I\nhave done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?\"\n\n\"As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want to, but as\nfor wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.\"\n\n\"And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it;\nwhat grounds had I for wanting it?\"\n\n\"What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?\" said Smerdyakov\nsarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. \"Why, after your parent's\ndeath there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and very\nlikely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady,\nAgrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made over to her\ndirectly after the wedding, for she's plenty of sense, so that your parent\nwould not have left you two roubles between the three of you. And were\nthey far from a wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only\nto lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with\nhis tongue out.\"\n\nIvan restrained himself with painful effort.\n\n\"Very good,\" he commented at last. \"You see, I haven't jumped up, I\nhaven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you. Speak on. So, according to\nyou, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?\"\n\n\"How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would lose\nall the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go off to\nexile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother\nAlexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you'd each have not forty, but\nsixty thousand each. There's not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri\nFyodorovitch.\"\n\n\"What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on any\none then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I did\nexpect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember my\nimpression!\"\n\n\"I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on me\nas well,\" said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. \"So that it was just by\nthat more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. For if you\nhad a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me,\n'You can murder my parent, I won't hinder you!' \"\n\n\"You scoundrel! So that's how you understood it!\"\n\n\"It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go to\nMoscow and refused all your father's entreaties to go to Tchermashnya--and\nsimply at a foolish word from me you consented at once! What reason had\nyou to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to Tchermashnya with no\nreason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected something\nfrom me.\"\n\n\"No, I swear I didn't!\" shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.\n\n\"You didn't? Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had me taken to\nthe lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, to\nhave given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bit\nangry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish\nword and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayed\nto save your parent's life. How could I help drawing my conclusions?\"\n\nIvan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.\n\n\"Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face,\" he said with a bitter\nsmile. \"I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would have\nbelieved me and what charge could I bring against you? But the punch in\nthe face ... oh, I'm sorry I didn't think of it. Though blows are\nforbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.\"\n\nSmerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.\n\n\"In the ordinary occasions of life,\" he said in the same complacent and\nsententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about\nreligion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, \"in the ordinary occasions of life,\nblows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have given\nthem up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows,\nnot only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republic\nof France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave\noff, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.\"\n\n\"What are you learning French words for?\" Ivan nodded towards the\nexercise-book lying on the table.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that\nI may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?\"\n\n\"Listen, monster.\" Ivan's eyes flashed and he trembled all over. \"I am not\nafraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I\ndon't beat you to death, it's simply because I suspect you of that crime\nand I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask you.\"\n\n\"To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of,\nconsidering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if you\nbegin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.\"\n\n\"Do you think I am afraid of you now?\"\n\n\"If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the public\nwill, and you will be ashamed.\"\n\n\"That's as much as to say, 'It's always worth while speaking to a sensible\nman,' eh?\" snarled Ivan.\n\n\"You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible.\"\n\nIvan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and\nwithout replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him,\nwalked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him.\nThere was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations\nfilled his soul. \"Shall I go at once and give information against\nSmerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On\nthe contrary, he'll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for\nTchermashnya then? What for? What for?\" Ivan asked himself. \"Yes, of\ncourse, I was expecting something and he is right....\" And he remembered\nfor the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father's house, he\nhad listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish\nthat he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. \"Yes, I\nexpected it then, that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder!\nDid I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don't\ndare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!\"\n\nIvan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed\nher by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his\nconversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn't be calmed,\nhowever much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room,\nspeaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on\nthe table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange\nsentence: \"If it's not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share\nhis guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if\nhe is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer,\ntoo.\"\n\nWhen Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a\nword, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out a\nsheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which\nIvan spoke to Alyosha later on as a \"conclusive proof\" that Dmitri had\nkilled his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna\nwhen he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on\nthe way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when\nGrushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed\nto Grushenka. I don't know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was\nat the \"Metropolis,\" where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen\nand paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was\na wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was\nlike the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with\nextraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has\njust been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine\nfellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out;\nand all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with\ndrunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty\npiece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the\ntavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was\nevidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only\nfilled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.\nThe letter ran as follows:\n\n\n    FATAL KATYA: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three\n    thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my\n    love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it from\n    every one, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of honor I\n    shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from\n    under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to\n    Siberia for it, I'll give you back your three thousand. And\n    farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for I've been a\n    scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be\n    happier and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love\n    another woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can\n    you forgive? I will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you\n    all and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not _her_\n    either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!\n\n    P.S.--I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. One\n    string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I\n    shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three\n    thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I've been a\n    scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand.\n    The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a\n    thief, but I'll murder my thief. Katya, don't look disdainful.\n    Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father\n    and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your\n    pride. And he doesn't love you.\n\n    P.P.S.--I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.--Katya, pray to God\n    that some one'll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in\n    gore, and if no one does--I shall! Kill me!\n\n    Your slave and enemy,\n\n    D. KARAMAZOV.\n\n\nWhen Ivan read this \"document\" he was convinced. So then it was his\nbrother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This\nletter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There\ncould be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya's guilt. The suspicion\nnever occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the\nmurder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not\nfit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he\nonly thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later\nhe positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at\nhis suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him.\nSo passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice\nhe happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind.\n\n\"He'll end in madness,\" the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and\nIvan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself\nbegan to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been\nsent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time\nhis relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were\nlike two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna's \"returns\"\nto Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his\nfavor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene\ndescribed above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan\nhad never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya's\nguilt, in spite of those \"returns\" that were so hateful to him. It is\nremarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more\nevery day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya's \"returns\"\nthat he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_.\nHe was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.\n\nNevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed\nto him a plan of escape--a plan he had obviously thought over a long time.\nHe was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart\nfrom a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was to his, Ivan's, advantage that\nhis brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance\nand Alyosha's from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to\nsacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya's escape. On his return from\nseeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel\nthat he was anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place\nby sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. \"Is it because I\nam as much a murderer at heart?\" he asked himself. Something very deep\ndown seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered\ncruelly all that month. But of that later....\n\nWhen, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his\nhand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden\nand peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina\nIvanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha's presence: \"It was\nyou, you, persuaded me of his\" (that is, Mitya's) \"guilt!\" Ivan was\nthunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her\nthat Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in\nher presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_,\nshe, who had produced that \"document\" and proved his brother's guilt. And\nnow she suddenly exclaimed: \"I've been at Smerdyakov's myself!\" When had\nshe been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so\nsure of Mitya's guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What,\nwhat, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could\nnot understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words\npass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and\nrushed off to Smerdyakov. \"I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,\" he\nthought on the way.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov\n\n\nWhen he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing early\nthat morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly. It did\nnot lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the wind, and soon there\nwas a regular snowstorm. There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of\nthe town where Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness,\nunconscious of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His head\nached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that his\nhands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna's\ncottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant. He was\nwearing a coarse and patched coat, and was walking in zigzags, grumbling\nand swearing to himself. Then suddenly he would begin singing in a husky\ndrunken voice:\n\n\n    \"Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;\n    I won't wait till he comes back.\"\n\n\nBut he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again;\nthen he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an intense hatred for\nhim before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he realized his\npresence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down. At that\nmoment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt\nagainst Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. The peasant went flying\nbackwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground. He uttered one\nplaintive \"O--oh!\" and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He was\nlying on his back, without movement or consciousness. \"He will be frozen,\"\nthought Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov's.\n\nIn the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with a\ncandle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, \"It's not that\nhe's laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even told us to take the\ntea away; he wouldn't have any.\"\n\n\"Why, does he make a row?\" asked Ivan coarsely.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he's very quiet. Only please don't talk\nto him too long,\" Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan opened the door and\nstepped into the room.\n\nIt was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room. One of\nthe benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been put a\nlarge old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up, with\nfairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearing\nthe same dressing-gown. The table had been brought out in front of the\nsofa, so that there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a thick book\nin yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to be\nsitting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was\napparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change in\nhis face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and there\nwere blue marks under them.\n\n\"Why, you really are ill?\" Ivan stopped short. \"I won't keep you long, I\nwon't even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?\"\n\nHe went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down on\nit.\n\n\"Why do you look at me without speaking? I've only come with one question,\nand I swear I won't go without an answer. Has the young lady, Katerina\nIvanovna, been with you?\"\n\nSmerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.\nSuddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" cried Ivan.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'nothing'?\"\n\n\"Yes, she has. It's no matter to you. Let me alone.\"\n\n\"No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?\"\n\n\"Why, I'd quite forgotten about her,\" said Smerdyakov, with a scornful\nsmile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him with a look of\nfrenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on him at their last\ninterview, a month before.\n\n\"You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don't look like\nyourself,\" he said to Ivan.\n\n\"Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.\"\n\n\"But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow. Are you so\nworried?\" He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright.\n\n\"Listen; I've told you I won't go away without an answer!\" Ivan cried,\nintensely irritated.\n\n\"Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?\" said Smerdyakov,\nwith a look of suffering.\n\n\"Damn it! I've nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and I'll go\naway.\"\n\n\"I've no answer to give you,\" said Smerdyakov, looking down again.\n\n\"You may be sure I'll make you answer!\"\n\n\"Why are you so uneasy?\" Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply with\ncontempt, but almost with repulsion. \"Is this because the trial begins to-\nmorrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you believe that at last? Go\nhome, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't be afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?\" Ivan\narticulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in\nfact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.\n\n\"You don't understand?\" he drawled reproachfully. \"It's a strange thing a\nsensible man should care to play such a farce!\"\n\nIvan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious tone\nof this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in itself. He\nhad not taken such a tone even at their last interview.\n\n\"I tell you, you've nothing to be afraid of. I won't say anything about\nyou; there's no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling!\nWhy are your fingers moving like that? Go home, _you_ did not murder him.\"\n\nIvan started. He remembered Alyosha.\n\n\"I know it was not I,\" he faltered.\n\n\"Do you?\" Smerdyakov caught him up again.\n\nIvan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!\"\n\nSmerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes on Ivan\nwith insane hatred.\n\n\"Well, it was you who murdered him, if that's it,\" he whispered furiously.\n\nIvan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He laughed\nmalignantly.\n\n\"You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?\"\n\n\"You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understand\nit now.\"\n\n\"All I understand is that you are mad.\"\n\n\"Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the use of going\non keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it all\non me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real murderer, I was\nonly your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your\nwords I did it.\"\n\n\"_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?\" Ivan turned cold.\n\nSomething seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over with\na cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly; probably\nthe genuineness of Ivan's horror struck him.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you really did not know?\" he faltered\nmistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still gazed\nat him, and seemed unable to speak.\n\n\n    Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg;\n    I won't wait till he comes back,\n\n\nsuddenly echoed in his head.\n\n\"Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting before\nme,\" he muttered.\n\n\"There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he is\nhere, that third, between us.\"\n\n\"Who is he? Who is here? What third person?\" Ivan cried in alarm, looking\nabout him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.\n\n\"That third is God Himself--Providence. He is the third beside us now. Only\ndon't look for Him, you won't find Him.\"\n\n\"It's a lie that you killed him!\" Ivan cried madly. \"You are mad, or\nteasing me again!\"\n\nSmerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of fear. He\ncould still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied that Ivan\nknew everything and was trying to \"throw it all on him to his face.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing up\nhis left leg from under the table, he began turning up his trouser leg. He\nwas wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he took off his\ngarter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and\nsuddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror.\n\n\"He's mad!\" he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that he\nknocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and\nstraight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirely\nunaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his stocking, as though he\nwere making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull\nit out. At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that\nit was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it\nout and laid it on the table.\n\n\"Here,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Ivan, trembling.\n\n\"Kindly look at it,\" Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.\n\nIvan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began\nunfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from\ncontact with a loathsome reptile.\n\n\"Your hands keep twitching,\" observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately\nunfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets of\nhundred-rouble notes.\n\n\"They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not count\nthem. Take them,\" Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes. Ivan\nsank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief.\n\n\"You frightened me ... with your stocking,\" he said, with a strange grin.\n\n\"Can you really not have known till now?\" Smerdyakov asked once more.\n\n\"No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!\" He\nsuddenly clutched his head in both hands.\n\n\"Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or without?\"\n\n\"It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri\nFyodorovitch is quite innocent.\"\n\n\"All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I\ncan't speak properly.\"\n\n\"You were bold enough then. You said 'everything was lawful,' and how\nfrightened you are now,\" Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. \"Won't you have\nsome lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's very refreshing. Only I\nmust hide this first.\"\n\nAnd again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up and call\nat the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them,\nbut, looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see\nthem, he first took out his handkerchief, and as it turned out to be very\ndirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on\nthe table, and put it over the notes. The book was _The Sayings of the\nHoly Father Isaac the Syrian_. Ivan read it mechanically.\n\n\"I won't have any lemonade,\" he said. \"Talk of me later. Sit down and tell\nme how you did it. Tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot.\" Ivan, as\nthough he'd only just thought of it, took off his coat, and, without\ngetting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.\n\n\"Speak, please, speak.\"\n\nHe seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell him\n_all_ about it.\n\n\"How it was done?\" sighed Smerdyakov. \"It was done in a most natural way,\nfollowing your very words.\"\n\n\"Of my words later,\" Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete self-\npossession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting as before. \"Only\ntell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as it happened. Don't forget\nanything. The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.\"\n\n\"You'd gone away, then I fell into the cellar.\"\n\n\"In a fit or in a sham one?\"\n\n\"A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down the steps to\nthe very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a scream,\nand struggled, till they carried me out.\"\n\n\"Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the hospital?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me to the\nhospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than I've had for\nyears. For two days I was quite unconscious.\"\n\n\"All right, all right. Go on.\"\n\n\"They laid me on the bed. I knew I'd be the other side of the partition,\nfor whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there, near them.\nShe's always been very kind to me, from my birth up. At night I moaned,\nbut quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.\"\n\n\"Expecting him? To come to you?\"\n\n\"Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I'd no doubt that\nhe'd come that night, for being without me and getting no news, he'd be\nsure to come and climb over the fence, as he used to, and do something.\"\n\n\"And if he hadn't come?\"\n\n\"Then nothing would have happened. I should never have brought myself to\nit without him.\"\n\n\"All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don't hurry; above all,\ndon't leave anything out!\"\n\n\"I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain, for\nI had prepared him for it ... during the last few days.... He knew about\nthe knocks, that was the chief thing. With his suspiciousness and the fury\nwhich had been growing in him all those days, he was bound to get into the\nhouse by means of those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expecting\nhim.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" Ivan interrupted; \"if he had killed him, he would have taken the\nmoney and carried it away; you must have considered that. What would you\nhave got by it afterwards? I don't see.\"\n\n\"But he would never have found the money. That was only what I told him,\nthat the money was under the mattress. But that wasn't true. It had been\nlying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was\nthe only person he trusted, to hide the envelope with the notes in the\ncorner behind the ikons, for no one would have guessed that place,\nespecially if they came in a hurry. So that's where the envelope lay, in\nthe corner behind the ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it under\nthe mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was\nunder the mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nhad committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have run away\nin a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or he\nwould have been arrested. So I could always have clambered up to the ikons\nand have taken away the money next morning or even that night, and it\nwould have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon\nthat.\"\n\n\"But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?\"\n\n\"If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take the\nmoney, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he would\nbeat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then I'd\nmake out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nwho had taken the money after beating him.\"\n\n\"Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him;\nyou only took the money?\"\n\n\"No, he didn't kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now that he\nwas the murderer.... But I don't want to lie to you now, because ...\nbecause if you really haven't understood till now, as I see for myself,\nand are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face,\nyou are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the murder and\ncharged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it. And so I want to\nprove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the\nwhole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him. You\nare the rightful murderer.\"\n\n\"Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!\" Ivan cried, unable to restrain\nhimself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself\ntill the end of the conversation. \"You still mean that Tchermashnya? Stay,\ntell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took Tchermashnya for\nconsent? How will you explain that now?\"\n\n\"Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't have made\nan outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if I'd been\nsuspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice; on the\ncontrary, you would have protected me from others.... And when you got\nyour inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all the\nrest of your life. For you'd have received your inheritance through me,\nseeing that if he had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had\na farthing.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,\" snarled Ivan.\n\"And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had informed against you?\"\n\n\"What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to Tchermashnya?\nThat's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you would either have\ngone away or have stayed. If you had stayed, nothing would have happened.\nI should have known that you didn't want it done, and should have\nattempted nothing. As you went away, it meant you assured me that you\nwouldn't dare to inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook\nmy having the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn't have prosecuted me\nafterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court; that is,\nnot that I had stolen the money or killed him--I shouldn't have said\nthat--but that you'd put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didn't\nconsent to it. That's why I needed your consent, so that you couldn't have\ncornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have had? I could always\nhave cornered you, revealing your eagerness for your father's death, and I\ntell you the public would have believed it all, and you would have been\nashamed for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"Was I then so eager, was I?\" Ivan snarled again.\n\n\"To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doing\nit.\" Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He was very weak and spoke\nslowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him on. He evidently\nhad some design. Ivan felt that.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said. \"Tell me what happened that night.\"\n\n\"What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard the master\nshout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came\nout, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence and darkness.\nI lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldn't bear it. I got up at\nlast, went out. I saw the window open on the left into the garden, and I\nstepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and I\nheard the master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. 'Ech!' I\nthought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, 'It's I.' And he\nshouted to me, 'He's been, he's been; he's run away.' He meant Dmitri\nFyodorovitch had been. 'He's killed Grigory!' 'Where?' I whispered.\n'There, in the corner,' he pointed. He was whispering, too. 'Wait a bit,'\nI said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and there I came upon\nGrigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless. So\nit's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that\ncame into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, as\nGrigory Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, as\nhe lay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake\nup. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came over\nme, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the master\nand said, 'She's here, she's come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants\nto be let in.' And he started like a baby. 'Where is she?' he fairly\ngasped, but couldn't believe it. 'She's standing there,' said I. 'Open.'\nHe looked out of the window at me, half believing and half distrustful,\nbut afraid to open. 'Why, he is afraid of me now,' I thought. And it was\nfunny. I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we'd agreed\nupon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his\neyes. He didn't seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps,\nhe ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, but\nhe stood in the way to prevent me passing. 'Where is she? Where is she?'\nHe looked at me, all of a tremble. 'Well,' thought I, 'if he's so\nfrightened of me as all that, it's a bad look out!' And my legs went weak\nwith fright that he wouldn't let me in or would call out, or Marfa\nIgnatyevna would run up, or something else might happen. I don't remember\nnow, but I must have stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, 'Why,\nshe's there, there, under the window; how is it you don't see her?' I\nsaid. 'Bring her then, bring her.' 'She's afraid,' said I; 'she was\nfrightened at the noise, she's hidden in the bushes; go and call to her\nyourself from the study.' He ran to the window, put the candle in the\nwindow. 'Grushenka,' he cried, 'Grushenka, are you here?' Though he cried\nthat, he didn't want to lean out of the window, he didn't want to move\naway from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn't\ndare to turn his back on me. 'Why, here she is,' said I. I went up to the\nwindow and leaned right out of it. 'Here she is; she's in the bush,\nlaughing at you, don't you see her?' He suddenly believed it; he was all\nof a shake--he was awfully crazy about her--and he leaned right out of the\nwindow. I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table; do you\nremember, weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on the top\nof the skull with the corner of it. He didn't even cry out. He only sank\ndown suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time I\nknew I'd broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face upwards,\ncovered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on me, not a spot.\nI wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up to the ikons, took the\nmoney out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on the floor and the\npink ribbon beside it. I went out into the garden all of a tremble,\nstraight to the apple-tree with a hollow in it--you know that hollow. I'd\nmarked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I\nwrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And\nthere it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out\nof the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, 'If Grigory\nVassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me, but if\nhe is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he'll bear\nwitness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he must have killed\nhim and taken the money.' Then I began groaning with suspense and\nimpatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last\nshe got up and she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch\nwas not there, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And that\nset it all going and set my mind at rest.\"\n\nHe stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without\nstirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov\nglanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept his eyes\naverted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated and was breathing\nhard. The perspiration stood out on his face. But it was impossible to\ntell whether it was remorse he was feeling, or what.\n\n\"Stay,\" cried Ivan, pondering. \"What about the door? If he only opened the\ndoor to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before? For Grigory saw\nit before you went.\"\n\nIt was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone, not\nangry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment and\npeeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded that they were\ntalking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.\n\n\"As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it open, that's\nonly his fancy,\" said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. \"He is not a man, I\nassure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't see it, but fancied he had\nseen it, and there's no shaking him. It's just our luck he took that\nnotion into his head, for they can't fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nafter that.\"\n\n\"Listen ...\" said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making an\neffort to grasp something. \"Listen. There are a lot of questions I want to\nask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.\nYes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and leave it\nthere on the floor? Why didn't you simply carry off the envelope?... When\nyou were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the\nright thing to do ... but why, I can't understand....\"\n\n\"I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about it, as I\ndid for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and perhaps had put\nthem in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up and\naddressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done the murder, what\nshould have made him tear open the envelope afterwards, especially in such\ndesperate haste, since he'd know for certain the notes must be in the\nenvelope? No, if the robber had been some one like me, he'd simply have\nput the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he\ncould. But it'd be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knew\nabout the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he'd found it,\nfor instance, under the mattress, he'd have torn it open as quickly as\npossible to make sure the notes were in it. And he'd have thrown the\nenvelope down, without having time to think that it would be evidence\nagainst him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had never directly\nstolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born, and if he did bring\nhimself to steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking what\nwas his own, for he'd told the whole town he meant to before, and had even\nbragged aloud before every one that he'd go and take his property from\nFyodor Pavlovitch. I didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was\nbeing examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as\nthough I didn't see it myself, and as though he'd thought of it himself\nand I hadn't prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor's mouth positively\nwatered at my suggestion.\"\n\n\"But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?\" cried Ivan,\novercome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm.\n\n\"Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry? It\nwas all thought out beforehand.\"\n\n\"Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!\" Ivan cried again. \"No, you\nare not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....\"\n\nHe got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was in terrible\ndistress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room to\npass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stood\nand sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, as\nhe suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before.\n\n\"Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don't you understand that\nif I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am keeping you to answer\nto-morrow at the trial. God sees,\" Ivan raised his hand, \"perhaps I, too,\nwas guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father's ...\ndeath, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn't\nurge you on at all. No, no, I didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will\ngive evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial. I'm determined to! I\nshall tell everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance together.\nAnd whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you\ngive, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you. I'll confirm it all myself!\nBut you must confess, too! You must, you must; we'll go together. That's\nhow it shall be!\"\n\nIvan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it\ncould be seen that it would be so.\n\n\"You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,\" Smerdyakov\ncommented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact.\n\n\"We'll go together,\" Ivan repeated. \"And if you won't go, no matter, I'll\ngo alone.\"\n\nSmerdyakov paused as though pondering.\n\n\"There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go,\" he concluded at last\npositively.\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.\n\n\"You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what's more, it\nwill be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never said\nanything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it looks\nlike it, too), or that you're so sorry for your brother that you are\nsacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me, for\nyou've always thought no more of me than if I'd been a fly. And who will\nbelieve you, and what single proof have you got?\"\n\n\"Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.\"\n\nSmerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.\n\n\"Take that money away with you,\" Smerdyakov sighed.\n\n\"Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you\ncommitted the murder for the sake of it?\" Ivan looked at him with great\nsurprise.\n\n\"I don't want it,\" Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a\ngesture of refusal. \"I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that\nmoney in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chiefly\nbecause 'all things are lawful.' That was quite right what you taught me,\nfor you talked a lot to me about that. For if there's no everlasting God,\nthere's no such thing as virtue, and there's no need of it. You were right\nthere. So that's how I looked at it.\"\n\n\"Did you come to that of yourself?\" asked Ivan, with a wry smile.\n\n\"With your guidance.\"\n\n\"And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back the\nmoney?\"\n\n\"No, I don't believe,\" whispered Smerdyakov.\n\n\"Then why are you giving it back?\"\n\n\"Leave off ... that's enough!\" Smerdyakov waved his hand again. \"You used\nto say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so upset,\ntoo? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself.... Only\nthere'll be nothing of the sort! You won't go to give evidence,\"\nSmerdyakov decided with conviction.\n\n\"You'll see,\" said Ivan.\n\n\"It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I know\nthat. You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud; you are far\ntoo fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living in\nundisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any one--that's what you\ncare most about. You won't want to spoil your life for ever by taking such\na disgrace on yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like\nhim than any of his children; you've the same soul as he had.\"\n\n\"You are not a fool,\" said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to his\nface. \"You are serious now!\" he observed, looking suddenly at Smerdyakov\nwith a different expression.\n\n\"It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the money.\"\n\nIvan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without\nwrapping them in anything.\n\n\"I shall show them at the court to-morrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own; you may\nsimply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court.\"\n\nIvan rose from his seat.\n\n\"I repeat,\" he said, \"the only reason I haven't killed you is that I need\nyou for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!\"\n\n\"Well, kill me. Kill me now,\" Smerdyakov said, all at once looking\nstrangely at Ivan. \"You won't dare do that even!\" he added, with a bitter\nsmile. \"You won't dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!\"\n\n\"Till to-morrow,\" cried Ivan, and moved to go out.\n\n\"Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.\"\n\nIvan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at them\nfor ten seconds.\n\n\"Well, you can go,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Ivan Fyodorovitch!\"\nhe called after him again.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Ivan turned without stopping.\n\n\"Good-by!\"\n\n\"Till to-morrow!\" Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage.\n\nThe snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, but\nsuddenly began staggering. \"It's something physical,\" he thought with a\ngrin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was conscious\nof unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering that had so\ntortured him of late. His determination was taken, \"and now it will not be\nchanged,\" he thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against\nsomething and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feet\nthe peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless. The\nsnow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized him and lifted him in his\narms. Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up, knocked\nat the shutters, and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him\ncarry the peasant to the police-station, promising him three roubles. The\nman got ready and came out. I won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded\nin his object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging\nfor a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the\nexpenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan\nwas well content with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.\n\n\"If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,\" he reflected\nwith satisfaction, \"I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after\nthe peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his being\nfrozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,\" he thought at\nthe same instant, with still greater satisfaction, \"although they have\ndecided that I am going out of my mind!\"\n\nJust as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself suddenly\nhadn't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything. He\ndecided the question by turning back to the house. \"Everything together\nto-morrow!\" he whispered to himself, and, strange to say, almost all his\ngladness and self-satisfaction passed in one instant.\n\nAs he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his\nheart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of something\nagonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and had\nbeen there before. He sank wearily on his sofa. The old woman brought him\na samovar; he made tea, but did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt\ngiddy. He felt that he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop\nasleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his\ndrowsiness. At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illness\nthat he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round, as\nthough searching for something. This happened several times. At last his\neyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush\nsuffused his face. He sat a long time in his place, his head propped on\nboth arms, though he looked sideways at the same point, at the sofa that\nstood against the opposite wall. There was evidently something, some\nobject, that irritated him there, worried him and tormented him.\n\n\n\nChapter IX. The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare\n\n\nI am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must\ninevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan's illness.\nAnticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment on\nthe very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long been\naffected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the\nend gained complete mastery over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, I\nventure to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terrible\neffort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of\ncourse, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he loathed\nthe thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis in\nhis life, when he needed to have all his wits about him, to say what he\nhad to say boldly and resolutely and \"to justify himself to himself.\"\n\nHe had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from\nMoscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's to which I have\nreferred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor came\nto the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the\nbrain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had\nreluctantly made him. \"Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,\"\nthe doctor opined, \"though it would be better to verify them ... you must\ntake steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go badly with\nyou.\" But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to\nhis bed to be nursed. \"I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I\ndrop, it'll be different then, any one may nurse me who likes,\" he\ndecided, dismissing the subject.\n\nAnd so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as I\nhave said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa against\nthe opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodness\nknows how he had come in, for he had not been in the room when Ivan came\ninto it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more\naccurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer\nyoung, _qui faisait la cinquantaine_, as the French say, with rather long,\nstill thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed\nbeard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently\nmade by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,\nthat had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two\nyears. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are\nworn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his\nlinen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare. The\nvisitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light in\ncolor and too tight for the present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat was\nout of keeping with the season.\n\nIn brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. It\nlooked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners\nwho used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had unmistakably been, at\nsome time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections,\nhad possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming\ngradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into the\nposition of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old\nfriend to another and received by them for his companionable and\naccommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could\nbe asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place of\nhonor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who\ncan tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion\nfor any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary\ncreatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but\nif so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some\naunt's, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming\nashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children\naltogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas\nletter from them and sometimes even answer it.\n\nThe countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, as\naccommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might\narise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black\nribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring\nwith a cheap opal stone in it.\n\nIvan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The visitor\nwaited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his\nroom to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeing\nthat his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was ready for any\naffable conversation as soon as his host should begin it. All at once his\nface expressed a sudden solicitude.\n\n\"I say,\" he began to Ivan, \"excuse me, I only mention it to remind you.\nYou went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you came\naway without finding out anything about her, you probably forgot--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. \"Yes,\nI'd forgotten ... but it doesn't matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,\"\nhe muttered to himself, \"and you,\" he added, addressing his visitor, \"I\nshould have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was\ntormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you\nprompted me, and that I didn't remember it of myself?\"\n\n\"Don't believe it then,\" said the gentleman, smiling amicably, \"what's the\ngood of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to\nbelieving, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he saw\nChrist risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look at the\nspiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them ... only fancy,\nthey imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because the\ndevils show them their horns from the other world. That, they say, is a\nmaterial proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world. The other\nworld and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does\nproving there's a devil prove that there's a God? I want to join an\nidealist society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist,\nbut not a materialist, he he!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Ivan suddenly got up from the table. \"I seem to be delirious....\nI am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I don't care! You\nwon't drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehow\nashamed.... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes don't see you\nand don't even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess what\nyou are prating, for it's I, _I myself speaking, not you_. Only I don't\nknow whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I'll\nwet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air.\"\n\nIvan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a\nwet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.\n\n\"I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,\" the visitor began.\n\n\"Fool,\" laughed Ivan, \"do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you?\nI am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead ... and in the\ntop of my head ... only please don't talk philosophy, as you did last\ntime. If you can't take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk\ngossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What a\nnightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I'll get the better of you.\nI won't be taken to a mad-house!\"\n\n\"_C'est charmant_, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what\nam I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you and\nam rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for\nsomething real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring last\ntime--\"\n\n\"Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,\" Ivan cried with a\nsort of fury. \"You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. It's\nonly that I don't know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a\ntime. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, but\nonly of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the\nnastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of\ninterest to me, if only I had time to waste on you--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under\nthe lamp-post this evening and shouted to him, 'You learnt it from _him_!\nHow do you know that _he_ visits me?' you were thinking of me then. So for\none brief moment you did believe that I really exist,\" the gentleman\nlaughed blandly.\n\n\"Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn't believe in you. I\ndon't know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only\ndreaming then and didn't see you really at all--\"\n\n\"And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I've\ntreated him badly over Father Zossima.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!\" Ivan laughed again.\n\n\"You scold me, but you laugh--that's a good sign. But you are ever so much\nmore polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution\nof yours--\"\n\n\"Don't speak of my resolution,\" cried Ivan, savagely.\n\n\"I understand, I understand, _c'est noble, c'est charmant_, you are going\nto defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _C'est\nchevaleresque_.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!\"\n\n\"I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained. If you\nkick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don't kick ghosts.\nJoking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you like, though it's\nbetter to be a trifle more polite even to me. 'Fool, flunkey!' what\nwords!\"\n\n\"Scolding you, I scold myself,\" Ivan laughed again, \"you are myself,\nmyself, only with a different face. You just say what I am thinking ...\nand are incapable of saying anything new!\"\n\n\"If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,\" the\ngentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.\n\n\"You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the stupid ones.\nYou are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I can't put up with\nyou! What am I to do, what am I to do?\" Ivan said through his clenched\nteeth.\n\n\"My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to\nbe recognized as such,\" the visitor began in an excess of deprecating and\nsimple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. \"I am poor, but ... I\nwon't say very honest, but ... it's an axiom generally accepted in society\nthat I am a fallen angel. I certainly can't conceive how I can ever have\nbeen an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's\nno harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being a\ngentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. I\nlove men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! Here when I stay with\nyou from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and that's what I\nlike most of all. You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I\nlove the realism of earth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed,\nhere all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but\nindeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming.\nBesides, on earth I become superstitious. Please don't laugh, that's just\nwhat I like, to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I've\ngrown fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go\nand steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becoming\nincarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant's wife\nweighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she believes. My ideal is to\ngo to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it\nis. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like being doctored\ntoo; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was\nvaccinated in a foundling hospital--if only you knew how I enjoyed myself\nthat day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But you\nare not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this evening? I\nknow you went yesterday to that doctor ... well, what about your health?\nWhat did the doctor say?\"\n\n\"Fool!\" Ivan snapped out.\n\n\"But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't ask out of\nsympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has come in again--\"\n\n\"Fool!\" repeated Ivan.\n\n\"You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism\nlast year that I remember it to this day.\"\n\n\"The devil have rheumatism!\"\n\n\"Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form and I\ntake the consequences. Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto_.\"\n\n\"What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... that's not bad for the\ndevil!\"\n\n\"I am glad I've pleased you at last.\"\n\n\"But you didn't get that from me.\" Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.\n\"That never entered my head, that's strange.\"\n\n\"_C'est du nouveau, n'est-ce pas?_ This time I'll act honestly and explain\nto you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestion\nor anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and\nreal actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such\na plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the\nlast button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet such\ndreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people,\nofficials, journalists, priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A\nstatesman confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him\nwhen he was asleep. Well, that's how it is now, though I am your\nhallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which had\nnot entered your head before. So I don't repeat your ideas, yet I am only\nyour nightmare, nothing more.\"\n\n\"You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my\nnightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I've adopted a special method to-day, I'll explain it to\nyou afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I caught cold then,\nonly not here but yonder.\"\n\n\"Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can't you go away?\" Ivan\nexclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat down on the\nsofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in both\nhands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation. It was\nevidently of no use.\n\n\"Your nerves are out of order,\" observed the gentleman, with a carelessly\neasy, though perfectly polite, air. \"You are angry with me even for being\nable to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way. I was\nhurrying then to a diplomatic _soiree_ at the house of a lady of high rank\nin Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry. Well, an\nevening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows where and had to\nfly through space to reach your earth.... Of course, it took only an\ninstant, but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight\nminutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat. Spirits don't\nfreeze, but when one's in fleshly form, well ... in brief, I didn't think,\nand set off, and you know in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is\nabove the firmament, there's such a frost ... at least one can't call it\nfrost, you can fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game the\nvillage girls play--they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees\nof frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin\noff, so it bleeds. But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagine\nit would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it would be the end of\nit ... if only there could be an ax there.\"\n\n\"And can there be an ax there?\" Ivan interrupted, carelessly and\ndisdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the\ndelusion and not to sink into complete insanity.\n\n\"An ax?\" the guest interrupted in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, what would become of an ax there?\" Ivan cried suddenly, with a sort\nof savage and insistent obstinacy.\n\n\"What would become of an ax in space? _Quelle idee!_ If it were to fall to\nany distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth without\nknowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would calculate the rising\nand the setting of the ax, _Gatzuk_ would put it in his calendar, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"You are stupid, awfully stupid,\" said Ivan peevishly. \"Fib more cleverly\nor I won't listen. You want to get the better of me by realism, to\nconvince me that you exist, but I don't want to believe you exist! I won't\nbelieve it!\"\n\n\"But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth is unhappily hardly\never amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big of me, and\nperhaps something fine. That's a great pity, for I only give what I can--\"\n\n\"Don't talk philosophy, you ass!\"\n\n\"Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning and\ngroaning. I've tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnose\nbeautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips, but\nthey've no idea how to cure you. There was an enthusiastic little student\nhere, 'You may die,' said he, 'but you'll know perfectly what disease you\nare dying of!' And then what a way they have sending people to\nspecialists! 'We only diagnose,' they say, 'but go to such-and-such a\nspecialist, he'll cure you.' The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of\ndisease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are only\nspecialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrong\nwith your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European\nspecialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris, he'll look at your nose; I\ncan only cure your right nostril, he'll tell you, for I don't cure the\nleft nostril, that's not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there's a\nspecialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I fell\nback on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub myself with\nhoney and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an extra bath I went,\nsmeared myself all over and it did me no good at all. In despair I wrote\nto Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a book and some drops, bless him,\nand, only fancy, Hoff's malt extract cured me! I bought it by accident,\ndrank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took it away\ncompletely. I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I was\nprompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a\nbother: not a single paper would take my letter. 'It would be very\nreactionary,' they said, 'no one will believe it. _Le diable n'existe\npoint._ You'd better remain anonymous,' they advised me. What use is a\nletter of thanks if it's anonymous? I laughed with the men at the\nnewspaper office; 'It's reactionary to believe in God in our days,' I\nsaid, 'but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.' 'We quite understand\nthat,' they said. 'Who doesn't believe in the devil? Yet it won't do, it\nmight injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.' But I thought as a\njoke it wouldn't be very witty. So it wasn't printed. And do you know, I\nhave felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, for\ninstance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.\"\n\n\"Philosophical reflections again?\" Ivan snarled malignantly.\n\n\"God preserve me from it, but one can't help complaining sometimes. I am a\nslandered man. You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can see\nyou are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn't the only thing! I have\nnaturally a kind and merry heart. 'I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.'\nYou seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more\nserious one. Before time was, by some decree which I could never make out,\nI was pre-destined 'to deny' and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not\nat all inclined to negation. 'No, you must go and deny, without denial\nthere's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of\ncriticism?' Without criticism it would be nothing but one 'hosannah.' But\nnothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried in\nthe crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style. But I don't meddle in\nthat, I didn't create it, I am not answerable for it. Well, they've chosen\ntheir scapegoat, they've made me write the column of criticism and so life\nwas made possible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask\nfor annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there'd be nothing without you.\nIf everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen. There\nwould be no events without you, and there must be events. So against the\ngrain I serve to produce events and do what's irrational because I am\ncommanded to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farce\nas something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course\n... but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for\nsuffering is life. Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? It\nwould be transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but\ntedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don't live. I am x in\nan indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all\nbeginning and end, and who has even forgotten his own name. You are\nlaughing-- no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. You are for ever\nangry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that I would\ngive away all this super-stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply to\nbe transformed into the soul of a merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone\nand set candles at God's shrine.\"\n\n\"Then even you don't believe in God?\" said Ivan, with a smile of hatred.\n\n\"What can I say?--that is, if you are in earnest--\"\n\n\"Is there a God or not?\" Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.\n\n\"Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don't know.\nThere! I've said it now!\"\n\n\"You don't know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you are\nmyself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!\"\n\n\"Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true.\n_Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest, all these\nworlds, God and even Satan--all that is not proved, to my mind. Does all\nthat exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical\ndevelopment of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make haste\nto stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.\"\n\n\"You'd better tell me some anecdote!\" said Ivan miserably.\n\n\"There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an\nanecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you don't\nbelieve. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are all\nin a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there used\nto be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung together\nsomehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since we've\nlearned that you've discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and\nthe devil knows what, we had to lower our crest. There's a regular muddle,\nand, above all, superstition, scandal; there's as much scandal among us as\namong you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for we\nhave our secret police department where private information is received.\nWell, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages--not yours, but ours--and\nno one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen stone,\nnot your old ladies I mean, but ours. We've everything you have, I am\nrevealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you; though it's\nforbidden. This legend is about Paradise. There was, they say, here on\nearth a thinker and philosopher. He rejected everything, 'laws,\nconscience, faith,' and, above all, the future life. He died; he expected\nto go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before\nhim. He was astounded and indignant. 'This is against my principles!' he\nsaid. And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me, I am\njust repeating what I heard myself, it's only a legend ... he was\nsentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we've adopted the\nmetric system, you know) and when he has finished that quadrillion, the\ngates of heaven would be opened to him and he'll be forgiven--\"\n\n\"And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion\nkilometers?\" asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.\n\n\"What tortures? Ah, don't ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now they\nhave taken chiefly to moral punishments--'the stings of conscience' and all\nthat nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of your\nmanners. And who's the better for it? Only those who have got no\nconscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have\nnone? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor suffer\nfor it. Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them,\nespecially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but\nmischief! The ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemned\nto the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down\nacross the road. 'I won't go, I refuse on principle!' Take the soul of an\nenlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah,\nwho sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and you\nget the character of that thinker who lay across the road.\"\n\n\"What did he lie on there?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not laughing?\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he was\nlistening with an unexpected curiosity. \"Well, is he lying there now?\"\n\n\"That's the point, that he isn't. He lay there almost a thousand years and\nthen he got up and went on.\"\n\n\"What an ass!\" cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming to be\npondering something intently. \"Does it make any difference whether he lies\nthere for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take a\nbillion years to walk it?\"\n\n\"Much more than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I could work it\nout. But he got there long ago, and that's where the story begins.\"\n\n\"What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do it?\"\n\n\"Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present earth may\nhave been repeated a billion times. Why, it's become extinct, been frozen;\ncracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again 'the water\nabove the firmament,' then again a comet, again a sun, again from the sun\nit becomes earth--and the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly\nand exactly the same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferably\ntedious--\"\n\n\"Well, well, what happened when he arrived?\"\n\n\"Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked in, before\nhe had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to my thinking his\nwatch must have long dissolved into its elements on the way), he cried out\nthat those two seconds were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometers but\na quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the quadrillionth power! In fact,\nhe sang 'hosannah' and overdid it so, that some persons there of lofty\nideas wouldn't shake hands with him at first--he'd become too rapidly\nreactionary, they said. The Russian temperament. I repeat, it's a legend.\nI give it for what it's worth. So that's the sort of ideas we have on such\nsubjects even now.\"\n\n\"I've caught you!\" Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight, as though\nhe had succeeded in remembering something at last. \"That anecdote about\nthe quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen then, I was at\nthe high school. I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow\ncalled Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic\nthat I couldn't have taken it from anywhere. I thought I'd forgotten it\n... but I've unconsciously recalled it--I recalled it myself--it was not you\ntelling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that\neven when people are being taken to execution ... it's come back to me in\na dream. You are that dream! You are a dream, not a living creature!\"\n\n\"From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,\" laughed the\ngentleman, \"I am convinced that you believe in me.\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest! I haven't a hundredth part of a grain of faith in\nyou!\"\n\n\"But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses perhaps are the\nstrongest. Confess that you have faith even to the ten-thousandth of a\ngrain.\"\n\n\"Not for one minute,\" cried Ivan furiously. \"But I should like to believe\nin you,\" he added strangely.\n\n\"Aha! There's an admission! But I am good-natured. I'll come to your\nassistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me. I told you your\nanecdote you'd forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in me\ncompletely.\"\n\n\"You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of your\nexistence!\"\n\n\"Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and\ndisbelief--is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as you\nare, that it's better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you are\ninclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling you\nthat anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and I have my\nmotive in it. It's the new method. As soon as you disbelieve in me\ncompletely, you'll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but\na reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained my object, which is an\nhonorable one. I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will\ngrow into an oak-tree--and such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you will\nlong to enter the ranks of 'the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly\nwomen,' for that is what you are secretly longing for. You'll dine on\nlocusts, you'll wander into the wilderness to save your soul!\"\n\n\"Then it's for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, you\nscoundrel?\"\n\n\"One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you are!\"\n\n\"Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed\nseventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I've done nothing else. One forgets the whole world and\nall the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he is a very\nprecious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes worth a whole\nconstellation. We have our system of reckoning, you know. The conquest is\npriceless! And some of them, on my word, are not inferior to you in\nculture, though you won't believe it. They can contemplate such depths of\nbelief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems\nthat they are within a hair's-breadth of being 'turned upside down,' as\nthe actor Gorbunov says.\"\n\n\"Well, did you get your nose pulled?\"(8)\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" observed the visitor sententiously, \"it's better to get\noff with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an afflicted\nmarquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated by a specialist)\nin confession to his spiritual father--a Jesuit. I was present, it was\nsimply charming. 'Give me back my nose!' he said, and he beat his breast.\n'My son,' said the priest evasively, 'all things are accomplished in\naccordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and what seems a\nmisfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits.\nIf stern destiny has deprived you of your nose, it's to your advantage\nthat no one can ever pull you by your nose.' 'Holy father, that's no\ncomfort,' cried the despairing marquis. 'I'd be delighted to have my nose\npulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.' 'My\nson,' sighs the priest, 'you can't expect every blessing at once. This is\nmurmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, for\nif you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be glad to have\nyour nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already been\nfulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by the\nnose.' \"\n\n\"Fool, how stupid!\" cried Ivan.\n\n\"My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's the\ngenuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for word as\nI've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble. The\nunhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got home. I was by\nhis side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit confessionals are really\nmy most delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another\nincident that happened only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl of\ntwenty--a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth\nwater--comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her sin into the\ngrating. 'Why, my daughter, have you fallen again already?' cries the\npriest. 'O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not the same man this time, how\nlong is this going on? Aren't you ashamed!' '_Ah, mon pere_,' answers the\nsinner with tears of penitence, '_ca lui fait tant de plaisir, et a moi si\npeu de peine!_' Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of\nnature, better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin on\nthe spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the\npriest at the grating making an appointment with her for the\nevening--though he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! It\nwas nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turning\nup your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to please you--\"\n\n\"Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare,\"\nIvan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition. \"I am bored with\nyou, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give anything to be able to\nshake you off!\"\n\n\"I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me 'everything\ngreat and noble' and you'll see how well we shall get on,\" said the\ngentleman impressively. \"You are really angry with me for not having\nappeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with scorched\nwings, but have shown myself in such a modest form. You are wounded, in\nthe first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride.\nHow could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is\nthat romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can't\nhelp it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of\nappearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the\nCaucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I was\npositively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for daring to\npin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the Polar Star\nor the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid, but, mercy on us! I\nmake no claim to be equal to you in intelligence. Mephistopheles declared\nto Faust that he desired evil, but did only good. Well, he can say what he\nlikes, it's quite the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all\ncreation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good. I was there when\nthe Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom\nthe soul of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim\nsinging and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim\nwhich shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that's\nsacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all. The\nword had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you know\nhow susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am. But common sense--oh,\na most unhappy trait in my character--kept me in due bounds and I let the\nmoment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have\nhappened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been\nextinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so, solely\nfrom a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress the\ngood moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody takes all the credit\nof what's good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me. But\nI don't envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious.\nWhy am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent\npeople and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to\ntake such consequences sometimes? I know, of course, there's a secret in\nit, but they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps,\nseeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable\nminus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme\nthroughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the end of\neverything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who would take them in?\nI know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled. I, too, shall\nwalk my quadrillion and learn the secret. But till that happens I am\nsulking and fulfill my destiny though it's against the grain--that is, to\nruin thousands for the sake of saving one. How many souls have had to be\nruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that\none righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days!\nYes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for\nme--one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the\nother my own. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better....\nAre you asleep?\"\n\n\"I might well be,\" Ivan groaned angrily. \"All my stupid ideas--outgrown,\nthrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass--you present to\nme as something new!\"\n\n\"There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by my\nliterary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad, was it? And\nthen that ironical tone _a la_ Heine, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a flunkey\nlike you?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russian\ngentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, the\nauthor of a promising poem entitled _The Grand Inquisitor_. I was only\nthinking of him!\"\n\n\"I forbid you to speak of _The Grand Inquisitor_,\" cried Ivan, crimson\nwith shame.\n\n\"And the _Geological Cataclysm_. Do you remember? That was a poem, now!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, or I'll kill you!\"\n\n\"You'll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to\nthat pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quivering\nwith eagerness for life! 'There are new men,' you decided last spring,\nwhen you were meaning to come here, 'they propose to destroy everything\nand begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didn't ask my advice! I\nmaintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the\nidea of God in man, that's how we have to set to work. It's that, that we\nmust begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon\nas men have all of them denied God--and I believe that period, analogous\nwith geological periods, will come to pass--the old conception of the\nuniverse will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what's more, the\nold morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from\nlife all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.\nMan will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-\ngod will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature\ninfinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from\nhour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of\nthe joys of heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept\ndeath proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it's\nuseless for him to repine at life's being a moment, and he will love his\nbrother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment\nof life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify\nits fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the\ngrave'... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!\"\n\nIvan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears,\nbut he began trembling all over. The voice continued.\n\n\"The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such\na period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanity\nis settled for ever. But as, owing to man's inveterate stupidity, this\ncannot come about for at least a thousand years, every one who recognizes\nthe truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the\nnew principles. In that sense, 'all things are lawful' for him. What's\nmore, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no\nGod and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if\nhe is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position,\nhe may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the\nold slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands,\nthe place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ...\n'all things are lawful' and that's the end of it! That's all very\ncharming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for\ndoing it? But that's our modern Russian all over. He can't bring himself\nto swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth--\"\n\nThe visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence, speaking\nlouder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he did not\nsucceed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table and\nflung it at the orator.\n\n\"_Ah, mais c'est bete enfin_,\" cried the latter, jumping up from the sofa\nand shaking the drops of tea off himself. \"He remembers Luther's inkstand!\nHe takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It's like a woman!\nI suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears.\"\n\nA loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan jumped\nup from the sofa.\n\n\"Do you hear? You'd better open,\" cried the visitor; \"it's your brother\nAlyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll be bound!\"\n\n\"Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and of\ncourse he has not come for nothing; of course he brings 'news,' \" Ivan\nexclaimed frantically.\n\n\"Open, open to him. There's a snowstorm and he is your brother. _Monsieur\nsait-il le temps qu'il fait? C'est a ne pas mettre un chien dehors_.\"\n\nThe knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something\nseemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break his\nchains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. At\nlast the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked\nround him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just\nthrown at his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one\non the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on\npersistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his\ndream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.\n\n\"It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened just\nnow!\" cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.\n\n\"Alyosha, I told you not to come,\" he cried fiercely to his brother. \"In\ntwo words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?\"\n\n\"An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,\" Alyosha answered from the yard.\n\n\"Come round to the steps, I'll open at once,\" said Ivan, going to open the\ndoor to Alyosha.\n\n\n\nChapter X. \"It Was He Who Said That\"\n\n\nAlyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya\nKondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken\nhis own life. \"I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a\nnail in the wall.\" On Alyosha's inquiring whether she had informed the\npolice, she answered that she had told no one, \"but I flew straight to\nyou, I've run all the way.\" She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported,\nand was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he\nfound Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: \"I destroy my\nlife of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.\"\nAlyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain\nand told him all about it. \"And from him I've come straight to you,\" said\nAlyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's face. He had not\ntaken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though struck by\nsomething in his expression.\n\n\"Brother,\" he cried suddenly, \"you must be terribly ill. You look and\ndon't seem to understand what I tell you.\"\n\n\"It's a good thing you came,\" said Ivan, as though brooding, and not\nhearing Alyosha's exclamation. \"I knew he had hanged himself.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told me so just\nnow.\"\n\nIvan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same brooding\ntone, looking at the ground.\n\n\"Who is _he_?\" asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.\n\n\"He's slipped away.\"\n\nIvan raised his head and smiled softly.\n\n\"He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a 'pure cherub.' Dmitri\ncalls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim.\nWhat are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps that\nconstellation is only a chemical molecule. There's a constellation of the\nLion and the Sun. Don't you know it?\"\n\n\"Brother, sit down,\" said Alyosha in alarm. \"For goodness' sake, sit down\non the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow, that's right.\nWould you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps it will do you good.\"\n\n\"Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down there.\"\n\n\"It's not here. Don't worry yourself. I know where it is--here,\" said\nAlyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivan's dressing-\ntable in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked strangely at the towel:\nrecollection seemed to come back to him for an instant.\n\n\"Stay\"--he got up from the sofa--\"an hour ago I took that new towel from\nthere and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ...\nHow is it it's dry? There was no other.\"\n\n\"You put that towel on your head?\" asked Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles\nburnt down so? What's the time?\"\n\n\"Nearly twelve.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" Ivan cried suddenly. \"It was not a dream. He was here; he\nwas sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw a\nglass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but this\ndream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha\n... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ...\nthough I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is\nfrightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.\" Ivan laughed suddenly\nand began pacing about the room.\n\n\"Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?\" Alyosha asked anxiously\nagain.\n\n\"The devil! He's taken to visiting me. He's been here twice, almost three\ntimes. He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not\nSatan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning. But he is not Satan:\nthat's a lie. He is an impostor. He is simply a devil--a paltry, trivial\ndevil. He goes to the baths. If you undressed him, you'd be sure to find\nhe had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun\ncolor.... Alyosha, you are cold. You've been in the snow. Would you like\nsome tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some? _C'est a ne\npas mettre un chien dehors._...\"\n\nAlyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to sit\ndown again, and put the wet towel round his head. He sat down beside him.\n\n\"What were you telling me just now about Lise?\" Ivan began again. (He was\nbecoming very talkative.) \"I like Lise. I said something nasty about her.\nIt was a lie. I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more\nafraid of her than of anything. On account of the future. She will cast me\noff to-morrow and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruining\nMitya from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it's not so.\nTo-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang myself. Do you\nknow, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it because I am base? I am\nnot a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that Smerdyakov had\nhanged himself? Yes, it was _he_ told me so.\"\n\n\"And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?\" asked\nAlyosha.\n\n\"Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him away. You did\ndrive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I love your face,\nAlyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ is myself, Alyosha.\nAll that's base in me, all that's mean and contemptible. Yes, I am a\nromantic. He guessed it ... though it's a libel. He is frightfully stupid;\nbut it's to his advantage. He has cunning, animal cunning--he knew how to\ninfuriate me. He kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was how\nhe made me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great deal\nthat was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it to\nmyself. Do you know, Alyosha,\" Ivan added in an intensely earnest and\nconfidential tone, \"I should be awfully glad to think that it was _he_ and\nnot I.\"\n\n\"He has worn you out,\" said Alyosha, looking compassionately at his\nbrother.\n\n\"He's been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so cleverly.\n'Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why am I\ntormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind for the\nseven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we shall be gods.' It was\nhe said that, it was he said that!\"\n\n\"And not you, not you?\" Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly at\nhis brother. \"Never mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him.\nAnd let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,\"\nIvan said, with a shudder of offense. \"But he was unfair to me, unfair to\nme about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. 'Oh, you are\ngoing to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your\nfather, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.' \"\n\n\"Brother,\" Alyosha interposed, \"restrain yourself. It was not you murdered\nhim. It's not true!\"\n\n\"That's what he says, he, and he knows it. 'You are going to perform an\nact of heroic virtue, and you don't believe in virtue; that's what\ntortures you and makes you angry, that's why you are so vindictive.' He\nsaid that to me about me and he knows what he says.\"\n\n\"It's you say that, not he,\" exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, \"and you say it\nbecause you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.\"\n\n\"No, he knows what he says. 'You are going from pride,' he says. 'You'll\nstand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror?\nYou are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!' He said\nthat about me. 'And do you know you are longing for their praise--\"he is a\ncriminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his\nbrother and he confessed.\" ' That's a lie, Alyosha!\" Ivan cried suddenly,\nwith flashing eyes. \"I don't want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I\ndon't! That's a lie! That's why I threw the glass at him and it broke\nagainst his ugly face.\"\n\n\"Brother, calm yourself, stop!\" Alyosha entreated him.\n\n\"Yes, he knows how to torment one. He's cruel,\" Ivan went on, unheeding.\n\"I had an inkling from the first what he came for. 'Granting that you go\nthrough pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and\nsent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while you would only be\npunished with moral condemnation' ('Do you hear?' he laughed then)--'and\nsome people will praise you. But now Smerdyakov's dead, he has hanged\nhimself, and who'll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you are\ngoing, you'll go all the same, you've decided to go. What are you going\nfor now?' That's awful, Alyosha. I can't endure such questions. Who dare\nask me such questions?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" interposed Alyosha--his heart sank with terror, but he still\nseemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason--\"how could he have told you of\nSmerdyakov's death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was no\ntime for any one to know of it?\"\n\n\"He told me,\" said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. \"It was all he\ndid talk about, if you come to that. 'And it would be all right if you\nbelieved in virtue,' he said. 'No matter if they disbelieve you, you are\ngoing for the sake of principle. But you are a little pig like Fyodor\nPavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to go\nmeddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you don't know\nyourself why you go! Oh, you'd give a great deal to know yourself why you\ngo! And can you have made up your mind? You've not made up your mind.\nYou'll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;\nyou know you'll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decision\ndoes not depend on you. You'll go because you won't dare not to go. Why\nwon't you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That's a riddle for\nyou!' He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me a\ncoward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l'enigme_ is that I am a coward. 'It is not\nfor such eagles to soar above the earth.' It was he added that--he! And\nSmerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I've seen\nthat for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! 'You are going\nin order to be praised.' That's a brutal lie! And you despise me too,\nAlyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I\nhate the monster! I don't want to save the monster. Let him rot in\nSiberia! He's begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow I'll go, stand before\nthem, and spit in their faces!\"\n\nHe jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and\ndown the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. \"I seem to be\nsleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.\" It seemed to\nbe just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed\nthrough his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his\nbrother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees\nIvan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking,\ntalking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his\nwords with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in\ntime to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed\nhim somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two\nhours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and\nevenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without\nundressing.\n\nAs he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand\nIvan's illness. \"The anguish of a proud determination. An earnest\nconscience!\" God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining\nmastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. \"Yes,\" the thought\nfloated through Alyosha's head as it lay on the pillow, \"yes, if\nSmerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan's evidence; but he will go\nand give it.\" Alyosha smiled softly. \"God will conquer!\" he thought. \"He\nwill either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he'll perish in hate,\nrevenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does\nnot believe in,\" Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.\n\n\n\n\nBook XII. A Judicial Error\n\n\n\nChapter I. The Fatal Day\n\n\nAt ten o'clock in the morning of the day following the events I have\ndescribed, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.\n\nI hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable\nof reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in\nthe actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full\nexplanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I\nmay not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have\nselected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may\nhave omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall\ndo better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for\nhimself that I have done all I can.\n\nAnd, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what\nsurprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was\nsurprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great\ninterest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to\nbegin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and\nsurmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too,\nthat the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not\nimagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every\none, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident at\nthe trial this day.\n\nVisitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, but\nfrom several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and Petersburg.\nAmong them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguished\npersonages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched up. A special\nplace behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the\nmost distinguished and important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs\nhad been placed there--something exceptional, which had never been allowed\nbefore. A large proportion--not less than half of the public--were ladies.\nThere was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not\nknow where to seat them, for every ticket had long since been eagerly\nsought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the room, behind the\nplatform, a special partition hurriedly put up, behind which all these\nlawyers were admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standing\nroom there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space, and the\ncrowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed,\nshoulder to shoulder.\n\nSome of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made their\nappearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority of the\nladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed hysterical,\nintense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar fact--established afterwards\nby many observations--was that almost all the ladies, or, at least the vast\nmajority of them, were on Mitya's side and in favor of his being\nacquitted. This was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror\nof female hearts. It was known that two women rivals were to appear in the\ncase. One of them--Katerina Ivanovna--was an object of general interest. All\nsorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes of her\npassion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and \"aristocratic\nconnections\" were particularly insisted upon (she had called upon scarcely\nany one in the town). People said she intended to petition the Government\nfor leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him\nsomewhere in the mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited\nwith no less impatience. The public was looking forward with anxious\ncuriosity to the meeting of the two rivals--the proud aristocratic girl and\n\"the hetaira.\" But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of\nthe district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen \"the woman who\nhad ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,\" and all, almost without\nexception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with \"such a\nvery common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.\"\n\nIn brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that there\nwere several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in our town. Many\nladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion\nabout the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the husbands of\nthese ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner, should\nenter the court bitterly prejudiced against him. In fact, one may say\npretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine,\npart of the audience were biased against the prisoner. There were numbers\nof severe, frowning, even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to\noffend many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,\nof course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of\nMitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the majority\nof the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal,\nexcept perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than in\nthe moral aspect of the case.\n\nEverybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,\nFetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first time\nhe had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And if he\ndefended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over\nRussia. There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about the\nPresident of the Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a\ntremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from the\nbeginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitive\nprosecutor, who always considered that he had been aggrieved by some one\nin Petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated, was\nkeenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of\nrebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,\nwas his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutor\nwas not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the\ncontrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase of danger. It\nmust be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly\nimpressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case and work at it\nas though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result.\nThis was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this\ncharacteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have\nbeen expected from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his\npassion for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor\nwas, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed.\nBut with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset\nof his career and had never made up for it later.\n\nAs for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a humane and\ncultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressive\nviews. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself greatly about\nhis future career. The great aim of his life was to be a man of advanced\nideas. He was, too, a man of connections and property. He felt, as we\nlearnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a\nsocial, not from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a\nsocial phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product of\nour social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on,\nand so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic\nsignificance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner, was\nrather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.\n\nThe court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their\nappearance. Our court is the best hall in the town--spacious, lofty, and\ngood for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on a raised platform,\na table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury. On the\nleft was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense. In\nthe middle of the court, near the judges, was a table with the \"material\nproofs.\" On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch's white silk dressing-gown, stained\nwith blood; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been\ncommitted; Mitya's shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat, stained\nwith blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put his\nhandkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by now quite\nyellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin's with a view to suicide,\nand taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the\nenvelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for\nGrushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied, and many\nother articles I don't remember. In the body of the hall, at some\ndistance, came the seats for the public. But in front of the balustrade a\nfew chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after\ngiving their evidence.\n\nAt ten o'clock the three judges arrived--the President, one honorary\njustice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, entered\nimmediately after. The President was a short, stout, thick-set man of\nfifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut short,\nand a red ribbon, of what Order I don't remember. The prosecutor struck me\nand the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost green. His face\nseemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I\nhad seen him looking as usual only two days before. The President began\nwith asking the court whether all the jury were present.\n\nBut I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I did not\nhear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most of\nall because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space to\nmention everything that was said and done. I only know that neither side\nobjected to very many of the jurymen. I remember the twelve jurymen--four\nwere petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and six peasants and\nartisans of the town. I remember, long before the trial, questions were\ncontinually asked with some surprise, especially by ladies: \"Can such a\ndelicate, complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to\npetty officials and even peasants?\" and \"What can an official, still more\na peasant, understand in such an affair?\" All the four officials in the\njury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one who\nwas rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in society,\nwho had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly,\nunpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and\nstockings. At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of course,\nhad never read a single book. The two merchants looked respectable, but\nwere strangely silent and stolid. One of them was close-shaven, and was\ndressed in European style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a\nred ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need\nto speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans of\nSkotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of\nthem also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier\nand more uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might well\nwonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, \"what men like that\ncould possibly make of such a case?\" Yet their faces made a strangely\nimposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and frowning.\n\nAt last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor Pavlovitch\nKaramazov. I don't quite remember how he described him. The court usher\nwas told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his appearance. There\nwas a hush through the court. One could have heard a fly. I don't know how\nit was with others, but Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He\nlooked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards that\nhe had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own\ntailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves and\nexquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking stiffly\nstraight in front of him, and sat down in his place with a most\nunperturbed air.\n\nAt the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated Fetyukovitch,\nentered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court. He was a\ntall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely long, thin, pale\nfingers, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, rather short hair, and thin\nlips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile.\nHe looked about forty. His face would have been pleasant, if it had not\nbeen for his eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set\nremarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing\nline between them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about\nhis face. He was in evening dress and white tie.\n\nI remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his name, his\ncalling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was so\nunexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the\nprisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to take\npart in the proceedings--that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was a\nlong list. Four of the witnesses were not present--Miuesov, who had given\nevidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov\nand Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his\nsudden death, of which an official statement from the police was\npresented. The news of Smerdyakov's death produced a sudden stir and\nwhisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of\nthe sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya's sudden outburst As\nsoon as the statement of Smerdyakov's death was made, he cried out aloud\nfrom his place:\n\n\"He was a dog and died like a dog!\"\n\nI remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President addressed\nhim, threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity were\nrepeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times\nabruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret:\n\n\"I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it again.\"\n\nAnd, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the\npublic. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was under\nthe influence of this incident that the opening statement was read. It was\nrather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he\nhad been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great\nimpression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole\ntragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in\na fatal and pitiless light. I remember how, immediately after it had been\nread, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:\n\n\"Prisoner, do you plead guilty?\"\n\nMitya suddenly rose from his seat.\n\n\"I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,\" he exclaimed, again in a\nstartling, almost frenzied, voice, \"to idleness and debauchery. I meant to\nbecome an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck down\nby fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and my\nfather. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri\nKaramazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.\"\n\nHe sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President again\nbriefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was asked,\nand not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered the case\nto proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I saw\nthem all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to\ngive evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from the\npriest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit\nas far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them up\none by one.\n\n\n\nChapter II. Dangerous Witnesses\n\n\nI do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the\nprosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it\nwas arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. I\nonly know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first. I\nrepeat I don't intend to describe all the questions step by step. Besides,\nmy account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the speeches\nfor the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidence\nwas brought together and set in a strong and significant light, and I took\ndown parts of those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them\nin due course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected\nepisode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly\ninfluenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.\n\nI will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar\ncharacteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all, that is,\nthe overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the\narguments the defense had to rely upon. Every one realized it from the\nfirst moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single\npoint, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed.\nEvery one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute,\nthat there was no doubt about it, that there could be really no\ndiscussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form, and that the\nprisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine that\neven the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the\ninteresting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convinced\nof his guilt. What's more, I believe they would have been mortified if his\nguilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened the\neffect of the closing scene of the criminal's acquittal. That he would be\nacquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the\nvery last moment. \"He is guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives of\nhumanity, in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had\ncome into fashion,\" and so on, and so on. And that was why they had\ncrowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested in the\ncontest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All were\nwondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like\nFetyukovitch's make of such a desperate case; and so they followed his\nachievements, step by step, with concentrated attention.\n\nBut Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to his\nspeech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some design, that he\nwas working towards some object, but it was almost impossible to guess\nwhat it was. His confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable, however.\nEvery one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that he, after so short a stay,\nnot more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded\nin mastering the case and \"had studied it to a nicety.\" People described\nwith relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had \"taken down\" all the\nwitnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and,\nwhat's more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of\ntheir evidence. But it was supposed that he did this rather by way of\nsport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had been\nomitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he could do\nno real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was more\naware of this than any one, having some idea of his own in the background,\nsome concealed weapon of defense, which he would suddenly reveal when the\ntime came. But meanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed to be\ndiverting himself.\n\nSo, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch's old servant, who had\ngiven the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, was\nexamined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him when\nhis turn came to question him. It must be noted that Grigory entered the\nhall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least disconcerted by\nthe majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him. He gave\nevidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with his\nMarfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was impossible to make him\ncontradict himself. The prosecutor questioned him first in detail about\nthe family life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid\ncolors. It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and\nimpartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his\ndeceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to Mitya and\n\"hadn't brought up his children as he should. He'd have been devoured by\nlice when he was little, if it hadn't been for me,\" he added, describing\nMitya's early childhood. \"It wasn't fair either of the father to wrong his\nson over his mother's property, which was by right his.\"\n\nIn reply to the prosecutor's question what grounds he had for asserting\nthat Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money relations,\nGrigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bring\nforward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son was\n\"unfair,\" and that he ought \"to have paid him several thousand roubles\nmore.\" I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this question\nwhether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mitya's inheritance\nwith marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, not\nexcepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact information from any\none; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring forward any\ndistinct proof. Grigory's description of the scene at the dinner-table,\nwhen Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father, threatening to come back\nto kill him, made a sinister impression on the court, especially as the\nold servant's composure in telling it, his parsimony of words and peculiar\nphraseology, were as effective as eloquence. He observed that he was not\nangry with Mitya for having knocked him down and struck him on the face;\nhe had forgiven him long ago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov he\nobserved, crossing himself, that he was a lad of ability, but stupid and\nafflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch\nand his elder son who had taught him to be so. But he defended\nSmerdyakov's honesty almost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had\nonce found the master's money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it,\nhad taken it to his master, who had rewarded him with a \"gold piece\" for\nit, and trusted him implicitly from that time forward. He maintained\nobstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he was asked\nso many questions that I can't recall them all.\n\nAt last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him, and the\nfirst question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitch\nwas supposed to have put three thousand roubles for \"a certain person.\"\n\"Have you ever seen it, you, who were for so many years in close\nattendance on your master?\" Grigory answered that he had not seen it and\nhad never heard of the money from any one \"till everybody was talking\nabout it.\" This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every one\nwho could conceivably have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor\nasked his question about Dmitri's inheritance, and got the same answer\nfrom all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.\nFrom the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitch's persistence on this\nsubject.\n\n\"Now, with your permission I'll ask you a question,\" Fetyukovitch said,\nsuddenly and unexpectedly. \"Of what was that balsam, or, rather,\ndecoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you used\non that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?\"\n\nGrigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence\nmuttered, \"There was saffron in it.\"\n\n\"Nothing but saffron? Don't you remember any other ingredient?\"\n\n\"There was milfoil in it, too.\"\n\n\"And pepper perhaps?\" Fetyukovitch queried.\n\n\"Yes, there was pepper, too.\"\n\n\"Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?\"\n\n\"In spirit.\"\n\nThere was a faint sound of laughter in the court.\n\n\"You see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank what\nwas left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to your\nwife?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?\"\n\n\"It might have been a tumbler-full.\"\n\n\"A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?\"\n\nGrigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.\n\n\"A glass and a half of neat spirit--is not at all bad, don't you think? You\nmight see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?\"\n\nGrigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The\nPresident made a movement.\n\n\"Do you know for a fact,\" Fetyukovitch persisted, \"whether you were awake\nor not when you saw the open door?\"\n\n\"I was on my legs.\"\n\n\"That's not a proof that you were awake.\" (There was again laughter in the\ncourt.) \"Could you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you\na question--for instance, what year it is?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?\"\n\nGrigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.\nStrange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was.\n\n\"But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?\"\n\n\"I am a servant,\" Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. \"If\nmy betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.\"\n\nFetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,\nreminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowed\nwith dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness.\nThe public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt in\ntheir minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a\ncertain cure, have seen \"the gates of heaven,\" and who did not even know\nwhat year he was living in. But before Grigory left the box another\nepisode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him\nwhether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.\n\n\"Except about the door, all he has said is true,\" cried Mitya, in a loud\nvoice. \"For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my blows,\nI thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to\nmy father as seven hundred poodles.\"\n\n\"Prisoner, be careful in your language,\" the President admonished him.\n\n\"I am not a poodle,\" Grigory muttered.\n\n\"All right, it's I am a poodle myself,\" cried Mitya. \"If it's an insult, I\ntake it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. I\nwas cruel to AEsop too.\"\n\n\"What AEsop?\" the President asked sternly again.\n\n\"Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.\"\n\nThe President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly\nto be more careful in his language.\n\n\"You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.\"\n\nThe counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the\nevidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading\nwitnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. It\nappeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had been\neverywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the\nbiography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it\nis true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely\nMitya's exploits in the \"Metropolis,\" all his compromising doings and\nsayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov's \"wisp of tow.\" But even\nRakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya's inheritance, and confined\nhimself to contemptuous generalities.\n\n\"Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to the\nother, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one\ncould make head or tail of it?\" He attributed the tragic crime to the\nhabits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed\ncondition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions. He was,\nin fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This was the first occasion on\nwhich Rakitin showed what he could do, and attracted notice. The\nprosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the\ncase, and afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted some\nideas from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The picture\ndrawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly\nstrengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitin's discourse\nfascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility\nof its ideas. There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he\nspoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia.\n\nBut Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which the\ncounsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage. Answering certain\nquestions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of his own\nsentiments and his success, of which he was, of course, conscious, he went\nso far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as\n\"the kept mistress of Samsonov.\" He would have given a good deal to take\nback his words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it at\nonce. And it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having\nbeen able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so short\na time.\n\n\"Allow me to ask,\" began the counsel for the defense, with the most\naffable and even respectful smile, \"you are, of course, the same Mr.\nRakitin whose pamphlet, _The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father Zossima_,\npublished by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and religious\nreflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to the\nbishop, I have just read with such pleasure?\"\n\n\"I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,\"\nmuttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost\nashamed.\n\n\"Oh, that's excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to, take\nthe widest view of every social question. Your most instructive pamphlet\nhas been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop, and has\nbeen of appreciable service.... But this is the chief thing I should like\nto learn from you. You stated just now that you were very intimately\nacquainted with Madame Svyetlov.\" (It must be noted that Grushenka's\nsurname was Svyetlov. I heard it for the first time that day, during the\ncase.)\n\n\"I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and who\ncan be responsible for every one he meets?\" cried Rakitin, flushing all\nover.\n\n\"I understand, I quite understand,\" cried Fetyukovitch, as though he, too,\nwere embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. \"You, like any other,\nmight well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautiful\nwoman who would readily entertain the _elite_ of the youth of the\nneighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ... It has come to my\nknowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of months\nago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, and promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him\nto her in his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the evening\nof the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the\npresent investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov to\nMadame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from Madame\nSvyetlov as a reward, that's what I wanted to hear from you?\"\n\n\"It was a joke.... I don't see of what interest that can be to you.... I\ntook it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later....\"\n\n\"Then you did take-- But you have not given it back yet ... or have you?\"\n\n\"That's of no consequence,\" muttered Rakitin, \"I refuse to answer such\nquestions.... Of course I shall give it back.\"\n\nThe President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no more\nquestions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box not\nabsolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect left by the\nlofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitch's\nexpression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to suggest to the public\n\"this is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons who accuse him.\" I\nremember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreak\nfrom Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to\nGrushenka, he suddenly shouted \"Bernard!\" When, after Rakitin's cross-\nexamination, the President asked the prisoner if he had anything to say,\nMitya cried loudly:\n\n\"Since I've been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is a\ncontemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn't believe in God; he\ntook the bishop in!\"\n\nMitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his\nlanguage, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov's evidence was a\nfailure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared in ragged and\ndirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and expert\nobservation of the police officers, he turned out to be hopelessly drunk.\nOn being asked about Mitya's attack upon him, he refused to answer.\n\n\"God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me yonder.\"\n\n\"Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?\"\n\n\"Ilusha, my little son. 'Father, father, how he insulted you!' He said\nthat at the stone. Now he is dying....\"\n\nThe captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his knees before\nthe President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of the\npublic. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all.\n\nFetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazed\npeople more and more by his minute knowledge of the case. Thus, for\nexample, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, very\nprejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his fingers that on his\nfirst visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles, \"or\nvery little less. Just think what he squandered on those gypsy girls\nalone! And as for our lousy peasants, it wasn't a case of flinging half a\nrouble in the street, he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each,\nat least, he didn't give them less. And what a lot of money was simply\nstolen from him! And if any one did steal, he did not leave a receipt. How\ncould one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the\ntime? Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for their\nsouls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village girls! They're\ncompletely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be poor.\" He\nrecalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all up. So the\ntheory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been put\naside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.\n\n\"I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it with my\nown eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,\" cried\nTrifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy \"his betters.\"\n\nWhen Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried to refute\nhis evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal\nat Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another peasant\ncalled Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles\ndropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and had given them to Trifon\nBorissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so. \"Well,\"\nasked the lawyer, \"did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr.\nKaramazov?\" Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain.... He was obliged, after\nthe peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundred\nroubles, only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri\nFyodorovitch \"in perfect honesty, and it's only because his honor was in\nliquor at the time, he wouldn't remember it.\" But, as he had denied the\nincident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove\nit, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded\nwith great suspicion. So one of the most dangerous witnesses brought\nforward by the prosecution was again discredited.\n\nThe same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude of pride\nand independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the\nservice of the Crown, and that \"Pan Mitya\" had offered them three thousand\n\"to buy their honor,\" and that they had seen a large sum of money in his\nhands. Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words into\nhis sentences, and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the\neyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, and\nended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch caught them, too,\nin his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was forced, in spite of his\nevasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack of\ncards for the one he had provided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated\nduring the game. Kalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left the\nwitness-box with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.\n\nThen exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous\nwitnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, and\ndismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers and experts were lost\nin admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose\ncould be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case for the\nprosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more tragically\noverwhelming. But from the confidence of the \"great magician\" they saw\nthat he was serene, and they waited, feeling that \"such a man\" had not\ncome from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to return\nunsuccessful.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts\n\n\nThe evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the\nprisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much\nupon it. The medical line of defense had only been taken up through the\ninsistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor from\nMoscow on purpose. The case for the defense could, of course, lose nothing\nby it and might, with luck, gain something from it. There was, however, an\nelement of comedy about it, through the difference of opinion of the\ndoctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our\ndoctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two latter\nappeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nThe first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube.\nHe was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdy\nbuild. He was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town. He was\na conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or\nMoravian brother, I am not quite sure which. He had been living amongst us\nfor many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-hearted\nand humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited\nthem in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he was as\nobstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into his head, there was\nno shaking it. Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, that\nthe famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his presence\namong us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor\nHerzenstube's qualifications. Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five\nroubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to take\nadvantage of his arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense.\nAll these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube,\nand the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme\nharshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them,\n\"Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube? He, he!\"\nDoctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three\ndoctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined.\n\nDoctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner's\nmental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his grounds for this\nopinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was not only\nevident in many of the prisoner's actions in the past, but was apparent\neven now at this very moment. When he was asked to explain how it was\napparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple-hearted\ndirectness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had \"an\nextraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances\"; that he had \"marched\nin like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it would have been\nmore natural for him to look to the left where, among the public, the\nladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex\nand must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,\" the\nold man concluded in his peculiar language.\n\nI must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed in\nGerman style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always been\na weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly, better\nindeed than Russians. And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs,\nalways declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most\nexpressive sayings in the whole world. I may remark, too, that in\nconversation, through absent-mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary\nwords, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew them\nperfectly. The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German, and at\nsuch times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to\ncatch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he\nhad found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to have\nlooked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the\naudience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too,\nthat having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary\nconduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures. And so his unexpected\nobservation struck every one as very queer.\n\nThe Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and\nemphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner's mental condition\nabnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and with erudition of\n\"aberration\" and \"mania,\" and argued that, from all the facts collected,\nthe prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several\ndays before his arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him, it\nmust, even if he were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he\nhad not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.\n\nBut apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which\npremised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (It\nmust be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use of\nvery learned and professional language.) \"All his actions are in\ncontravention of common sense and logic,\" he continued. \"Not to refer to\nwhat I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole catastrophe,\nthe day before yesterday, while he was talking to me, he had an\nunaccountably fixed look in his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when there\nwas nothing to laugh at. He showed continual and inexplicable\nirritability, using strange words, 'Bernard!' 'Ethics!' and others equally\ninappropriate.\" But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that\nthe prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which\nhe considered himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary\nirritation, though he could speak comparatively lightly of other\nmisfortunes and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in the\npast, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on,\nflown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to be a disinterested\nand not grasping man.\n\n\"As to the opinion of my learned colleague,\" the Moscow doctor added\nironically in conclusion, \"that the prisoner would, on entering the court,\nhave naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him, I will\nonly say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radically\nunsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on entering the court\nwhere his fate will be decided, would not naturally look straight before\nhim in that fixed way, and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal\nmental condition, at the same time I maintain that he would naturally not\nlook to the left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to find\nhis legal adviser, on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defense\nall his future depends.\" The doctor expressed his opinion positively and\nemphatically.\n\nBut the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch\nof comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts. In his opinion\nthe prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a perfectly normal\ncondition, and, although he certainly must have been in a nervous and\nexceedingly excited state before his arrest, this might have been due to\nseveral perfectly obvious causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness,\nand so on. But this nervous condition would not involve the mental\naberration of which mention had just been made. As to the question whether\nthe prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering\nthe court, \"in his modest opinion,\" the prisoner would naturally look\nstraight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done, as that\nwas where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting. So that it\nwas just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectly\nnormal state of mind at the present. The young doctor concluded his\n\"modest\" testimony with some heat.\n\n\"Bravo, doctor!\" cried Mitya, from his seat, \"just so!\"\n\nMitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor's opinion had a\ndecisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appeared\nafterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor Herzenstube, when called\nas a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya. As an old resident\nin the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he furnished\nsome facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though\nrecalling something, he added:\n\n\"But the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he had a\ngood heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know. But the\nRussian proverb says, 'If a man has one head, it's good, but if another\nclever man comes to visit him, it would be better still, for then there\nwill be two heads and not only one.' \"\n\n\"One head is good, but two are better,\" the prosecutor put in impatiently.\nHe knew the old man's habit of talking slowly and deliberately, regardless\nof the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing, and\nhighly prizing his flat, dull and always gleefully complacent German wit.\nThe old man was fond of making jokes.\n\n\"Oh, yes, that's what I say,\" he went on stubbornly. \"One head is good,\nbut two are much better, but he did not meet another head with wits, and\nhis wits went. Where did they go? I've forgotten the word.\" He went on,\npassing his hand before his eyes, \"Oh, yes, _spazieren_.\"\n\n\"Wandering?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, wandering, that's what I say. Well, his wits went wandering and\nfell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he was a grateful\nand sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well, a little chap so high,\nleft neglected by his father in the back yard, when he ran about without\nboots on his feet, and his little breeches hanging by one button.\"\n\nA note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man's\nvoice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting something, and\ncaught at it instantly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty-five\nthen, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry for the boy then; I\nasked myself why shouldn't I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what? I've\nforgotten what it's called. A pound of what children are very fond of,\nwhat is it, what is it?\" The doctor began waving his hands again. \"It\ngrows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one....\"\n\n\"Apples?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are a\nlot of them, and all little. You put them in the mouth and crack.\"\n\n\"Nuts?\"\n\n\"Quite so, nuts, I say so.\" The doctor repeated in the calmest way as\nthough he had been at no loss for a word. \"And I bought him a pound of\nnuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before. And I\nlifted my finger and said to him, 'Boy, _Gott der Vater_.' He laughed and\nsaid, '_Gott der Vater_.'... '_Gott der Sohn_.' He laughed again and\nlisped, '_Gott der Sohn_.' '_Gott der heilige Geist_.' Then he laughed and\nsaid as best he could, '_Gott der heilige Geist_.' I went away, and two\ndays after I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me of himself,\n'Uncle, _Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_,' and he had only forgotten '_Gott\nder heilige Geist_.' But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for\nhim again. But he was taken away, and I did not see him again. Twenty-\nthree years passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, a white-haired\nold man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man, whom I\nshould never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,\nlaughing, '_Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_, and _Gott der heilige Geist_.\nI have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for\nno one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one that ever\ndid.' And then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard,\nwithout boots on his feet, and my heart was touched and I said, 'You are a\ngrateful young man, for you have remembered all your life the pound of\nnuts I bought you in your childhood.' And I embraced him and blessed him.\nAnd I shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian\noften laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. And\nnow, alas!...\"\n\n\"And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,\"\nMitya cried suddenly.\n\nIn any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the\npublic. But the chief sensation in Mitya's favor was created by the\nevidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,\nwhen the witnesses _a decharge_, that is, called by the defense, began\ngiving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to\nMitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to the\ncounsel for the defense. But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyosha\nwas examined, and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive\nevidence against one important point made by the prosecution.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya\n\n\nIt came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not required\nto take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him very gently\nand sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for goodness had\npreceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint, but\nhis warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to\none question, he sketched his brother's character as that of a man,\nviolent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same\ntime honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if\nnecessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka\nand his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an\nintolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the suggestion that\nhis brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though he\nrecognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession\nwith Mitya; that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he had\nbeen cheated of by his father, and that, indifferent as he was to money as\na rule, he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury. As\nfor the rivalry of the two \"ladies,\" as the prosecutor expressed it--that\nis, of Grushenka and Katya--he answered evasively and was even unwilling to\nanswer one or two questions altogether.\n\n\"Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your father?\"\nasked the prosecutor. \"You can refuse to answer if you think necessary,\"\nhe added.\n\n\"He did not tell me so directly,\" answered Alyosha.\n\n\"How so? Did he indirectly?\"\n\n\"He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at an\nextreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.\"\n\n\"And you believed him?\"\n\n\"I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higher\nfeeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed saved\nhim, for it was not he killed my father,\" Alyosha said firmly, in a loud\nvoice that was heard throughout the court.\n\nThe prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.\n\n\"Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your\nconviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for\nyour unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is\nknown to us already from the preliminary investigation. I won't attempt to\nconceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the\nother evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential\nto press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your\nbrother's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you\ngave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?\"\n\n\"I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,\"\nreplied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. \"I made no accusation against\nSmerdyakov of myself.\"\n\n\"Yet you gave evidence against him?\"\n\n\"I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told what took\nplace at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was\nexamined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he\ndidn't commit the murder, then--\"\n\n\"Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded\nof your brother's innocence?\"\n\n\"I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to me. I saw\nfrom his face he wasn't lying.\"\n\n\"Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?\"\n\n\"I have no other proof.\"\n\n\"And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother's\nword and the expression of his face?\"\n\n\"No, I have no other proof.\"\n\nThe prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left\nby Alyosha's evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been\ntalk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some\none had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered\ntogether some extraordinary proofs of his brother's innocence and\nSmerdyakov's guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except\ncertain moral convictions so natural in a brother.\n\nBut Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking Alyosha when\nit was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father and\nthat he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance, at\ntheir last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he answered,\nas though only just recollecting and understanding something.\n\n\"I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten myself. It\nwasn't clear to me at the time, but now--\"\n\nAnd, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he recounted\neagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree,\non the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, \"the\nupper part of the breast,\" and had repeated several times that he had a\nmeans of regaining his honor, that that means was here, here on his\nbreast. \"I thought, when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it\nwas in his heart,\" Alyosha continued, \"that he might find in his heart\nstrength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him\nand which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did think\nat the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace he\nwas shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some\nviolence to him. Yet it was just then that he pointed to something on his\nbreast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart\nis not on that part of the breast, but below, and that he struck himself\nmuch too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My\nidea seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to\nthat little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!\"\n\n\"Just so,\" Mitya cried from his place. \"That's right, Alyosha, it was the\nlittle bag I struck with my fist.\"\n\nFetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and at\nthe same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by his\nrecollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably\njust that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have returned to\nKaterina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he had yet\ndetermined not to repay her and to use for another purpose--namely, to\nenable him to elope with Grushenka, if she consented.\n\n\"It is so, it must be so,\" exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. \"My\nbrother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he said\n_half_ several times) he could free himself from at once, but that he was\nso unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldn't do it ... that he knew\nbeforehand he was incapable of doing it!\"\n\n\"And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on this\npart of the breast?\" Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.\n\n\"Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, 'Why does he strike\nhimself up there when the heart is lower down?' and the thought seemed\nstupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed\nthrough my mind. That's what brought it back to me just now. How could I\nhave forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant when he said\nhe had the means but wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred. And when he\nwas arrested at Mokroe he cried out--I know, I was told it--that he\nconsidered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had the\nmeans of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her,\nhe yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain\na thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what\ntorture that debt has been to him!\" Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion.\n\nThe prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe once\nmore how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the question,\n\"Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had simply\nstruck himself with his fist on the breast?\"\n\n\"But it was not with his fist,\" cried Alyosha; \"he pointed with his\nfingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so completely\nforgotten it till this moment?\"\n\nThe President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness's\nevidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to the\nfifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck, and\nthat that was, of course, the disgrace, \"A disgrace I cannot deny, the\nmost shameful act of my whole life,\" cried Mitya. \"I might have repaid it\nand didn't repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than\ngive it back. And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand\nI shouldn't give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!\"\n\nSo Alyosha's cross-examination ended. What was important and striking\nabout it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though this\nwere only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did go\nsome little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained\nfifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the\npreliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred\nroubles were \"his own.\" Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved\naway to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: \"How was\nit I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back to\nme now?\"\n\nKaterina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered something\nextraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettes\nand opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get a\nbetter view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned \"white as\na sheet\" on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly, almost\ntimidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated;\nbut there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark\nthat many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that\nmoment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the\ncourt. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear\ncomposed. The President began his examination discreetly and very\nrespectfully, as though afraid to touch on \"certain chords,\" and showing\nconsideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first\nquestions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly\nbetrothed to the prisoner, \"until he left me of his own accord...\" she\nadded quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had\nentrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, \"I didn't\ngive him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was\nin great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the\nunderstanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to.\nThere was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.\"\n\nI will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in\ndetail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.\n\n\"I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got\nmoney from his father,\" she went on. \"I have never doubted his\ndisinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money\nmatters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his\nfather, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with\nhis father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by\nhis father. I don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father.\nHe certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to me\nat that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that\nunlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see me ...\nand I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite\nhim.... And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,\" she\nadded suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her voice. \"I was\nonce indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand,\nand I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I should\never be in a position to repay my debt.\"\n\nThere was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch began\nhis cross-examination.\n\n\"Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?\"\nFetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way, instantly scenting\nsomething favorable. I must mention in parenthesis that, though\nFetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance of\nKaterina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing about the episode of the four\nthousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her \"bowing to the ground to\nhim.\" She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that was\nstrange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know\ntill the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the\ncourt, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.\n\nNo, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. She\ntold everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her\nbowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and her\ngoing to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that\nMitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should \"send him\nKaterina Ivanovna\" to fetch the money. She generously concealed that and\nwas not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run\nto the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money.\nIt was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. The\ncourt was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something unexampled.\nEven from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was,\nsuch an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation,\nseemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To save the man who had\ndeceived and insulted her and to help, in however small a degree, in\nsaving him, by creating a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the\nfigure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent\ngirl, handed her his last four thousand roubles--all he had in the\nworld--was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ... I\nhad a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it\nlater (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the town\nafterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite\ncomplete--that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young lady\ndepart \"with nothing but a respectful bow.\" It was hinted that something\nwas here omitted.\n\n\"And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,\" the\nmost highly respected of our ladies maintained, \"even then it's very\ndoubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way,\neven for the sake of saving her father.\"\n\nAnd can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid\nsensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like that?\nShe must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell everything.\nOf course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story\nonly arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by\nit. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost\nshame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture\nupon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her.\nOh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to\ngive his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same\nman to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three thousand--the\nidea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of\ntheft, at least, was as good as disproved. \"The case\" was thrown into\nquite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for\nhim.... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving\nher evidence, he jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his\nface in his hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a\nsobbing voice:\n\n\"Katya, why have you ruined me?\" and his sobs were audible all over the\ncourt. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:\n\n\"Now I am condemned!\"\n\nThen he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms\nacross his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in\nher place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who were\nsitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over as\nthough in a fever. Grushenka was called.\n\nI am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause\nof Mitya's ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one--all the lawyers said\nthe same afterwards--that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoner\nwould at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that later. A few\nwords first about Grushenka.\n\nShe, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black shawl\non her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her smooth, noiseless\ntread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure. She\nlooked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither to the right\nnor to the left. To my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment,\nand not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too,\nthat she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she\nwas simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and\ninquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not\nstand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry and eager\nto retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element of\ntimidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it was\nnot strange that her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry,\ncontemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note of self-\ncondemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a desperate\nplunge; as though she felt, \"I don't care what happens, I'll say it....\"\nApropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked curtly,\n\"That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester me?\" But a\nminute later she added, \"It was all my fault. I was laughing at them\nboth--at the old man and at him, too--and I brought both of them to this. It\nwas all on account of me it happened.\"\n\nSamsonov's name came up somehow. \"That's nobody's business,\" she snapped\nat once, with a sort of insolent defiance. \"He was my benefactor; he took\nme when I hadn't a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.\" The\nPresident reminded her, though very politely, that she must answer the\nquestions directly, without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka\ncrimsoned and her eyes flashed.\n\nThe envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heard\nfrom \"that wicked wretch\" that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with\nnotes for three thousand in it. \"But that was all foolishness. I was only\nlaughing. I wouldn't have gone to him for anything.\"\n\n\"To whom are you referring as 'that wicked wretch'?\" inquired the\nprosecutor.\n\n\"The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself last\nnight.\"\n\nShe was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a definite\naccusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for it.\n\n\"Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. The woman\nwho came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let me\ntell you,\" Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and\nthere was a vindictive note in her voice.\n\nShe was again asked to whom she was referring.\n\n\"The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered me\nchocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true shame about her, I\ncan tell you that....\"\n\nAt this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to moderate\nher language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning, and she did not\ncare what she did.\n\n\"When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,\" the prosecutor asked, \"every\none saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: 'It's all my\nfault. We'll go to Siberia together!' So you already believed him to have\nmurdered his father?\"\n\n\"I don't remember what I felt at the time,\" answered Grushenka. \"Every one\nwas crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it was my\nfault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when he said he\nwasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and always\nshall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.\"\n\nFetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among other\nthings he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles \"you paid him\nfor bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.\"\n\n\"There was nothing strange about his taking the money,\" sneered Grushenka,\nwith angry contempt. \"He was always coming to me for money: he used to get\nthirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had\nenough to keep him without my help.\"\n\n\"What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?\" Fetyukovitch asked, in\nspite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.\n\n\"Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister. But he's always\nbesought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of\nme.\"\n\nThis fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in\nthe monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned\npurple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she\ncame into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she\nwas angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his\nnoble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder\nof Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it\nwas another godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and,\nof course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. She\nleft a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of\ncontemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidence\nand sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina\nIvanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat as though\nturned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.\n\nIvan was called to give evidence.\n\n\n\nChapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe\n\n\nI may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of the\ncourt announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or\nsome sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was\nready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed to\nhave heard it and it only came out later.\n\nHis entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal\nwitnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned.\nCuriosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almost\nfatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably had\nlittle information to give after all that had been given. Time was\npassing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one,\nand with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was\nirreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression, on me at\nleast: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes\nwere lusterless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha\njumped up from his seat and moaned \"Ah!\" I remember that, but it was\nhardly noticed.\n\nThe President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath,\nthat he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he must\nbear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivan\nlistened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into a\nsmile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment,\nfinished, he laughed outright.\n\n\"Well, and what else?\" he asked in a loud voice.\n\nThere was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange.\nThe President showed signs of uneasiness.\n\n\"You ... are perhaps still unwell?\" he began, looking everywhere for the\nusher.\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell\nyou something interesting,\" Ivan answered with sudden calmness and\nrespectfulness.\n\n\"You have some special communication to make?\" the President went on,\nstill mistrustfully.\n\nIvan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered,\nalmost stammering:\n\n\"No ... I haven't. I have nothing particular.\"\n\nThey began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,\nwith extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more\nmarked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered that\nhe did not know. He knew nothing of his father's money relations with\nDmitri. \"I wasn't interested in the subject,\" he added. Threats to murder\nhis father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he\nhad heard from Smerdyakov.\n\n\"The same thing over and over again,\" he interrupted suddenly, with a look\nof weariness. \"I have nothing particular to tell the court.\"\n\n\"I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,\" the President began.\n\nHe turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them\nto examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in an\nexhausted voice:\n\n\"Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.\"\n\nAnd with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walk\nout of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though he\nhad reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.\n\n\"I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it go?\n'I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.' They were trying to put\non her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she said, 'I'll\nstand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.'... It's in some book about\nthe peasantry.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the President asked severely.\n\n\"Why, this,\" Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. \"Here's the money\n... the notes that lay in that envelope\" (he nodded towards the table on\nwhich lay the material evidence), \"for the sake of which our father was\nmurdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.\"\n\nThe usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President.\n\n\"How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same\nmoney?\" the President asked wonderingly.\n\n\"I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was with\nhim just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother, killed our\nfather. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who doesn't desire\nhis father's death?\"\n\n\"Are you in your right mind?\" broke involuntarily from the President.\n\n\"I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all of\nyou ... as all these ... ugly faces.\" He turned suddenly to the audience.\n\"My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,\" he\nsnarled, with furious contempt. \"They keep up the sham with one another.\nLiars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devours\nanother.... If there hadn't been a murder, they'd have been angry and gone\nhome ill-humored. It's a spectacle they want! _Panem et circenses_. Though\nI am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ's sake!\"\nHe suddenly clutched his head.\n\nThe usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, \"He is ill.\nDon't believe him: he has brain fever.\" Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively\nfrom her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and\ngreedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strange\nsmile.\n\n\"Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,\" Ivan began\nagain. \"You can't expect eloquence from a murderer,\" he added suddenly for\nsome reason and laughed a queer laugh.\n\nThe prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two other\njudges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears\nas he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The President seemed\nsuddenly to recollect himself.\n\n\"Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm\nyourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have something\nto tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not\ndelirious?\"\n\n\"That's just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won't send you\nproofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing but\nenvelopes--one is enough. I've no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,\" he\nsmiled thoughtfully.\n\n\"Who is your witness?\"\n\n\"He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! _Le diable\nn'existe point!_ Don't pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful devil,\" he\nadded suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.\n\"He is here somewhere, no doubt--under that table with the material\nevidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listen\nto me. I told him I don't want to keep quiet, and he talked about the\ngeological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the monster ... he's been\nsinging a hymn. That's because his heart is light! It's like a drunken man\nin the street bawling how 'Vanka went to Petersburg,' and I would give a\nquadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don't know me! Oh,\nhow stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him! I didn't\ncome for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?...\"\n\nAnd he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him again.\nBut the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, but\nthe court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.\n\n\"What are you about?\" he cried, staring into the man's face, and suddenly\nseizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But the\npolice were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And all\nthe time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed something\nincoherent.\n\nThe whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't remember everything as\nit happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. I only know that\nafterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood what\nhad happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he very\nreasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctor\nhad seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but\nthat, until he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively,\nso that nothing could have been foreseen--that he had, in fact, insisted on\ngiving evidence. But before every one had completely regained their\ncomposure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.\nKaterina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking\nloudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them not\nto remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:\n\n\"There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a\ndocument, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It's a letter\nfrom that monster ... that man there, there!\" she pointed to Mitya. \"It\nwas he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me how\nhe would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he is\ndelirious!\" she kept crying out, beside herself.\n\nThe court usher took the document she held out to the President, and she,\ndropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began convulsively\nand noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for\nfear she should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed up\nwas that letter Mitya had written at the \"Metropolis\" tavern, which Ivan\nhad spoken of as a \"mathematical proof.\" Alas! its mathematical\nconclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mitya\nmight have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less\nterrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What\nfollowed is still confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have\nat once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on\nboth sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness. On being\ngently asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently,\nKaterina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:\n\n\"I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,\" she added,\nevidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving\nevidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and\nunder what circumstances she received it.\n\n\"I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he wrote it the\nday before that, at the tavern--that is, two days before he committed the\ncrime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!\" she cried breathlessly.\n\"He hated me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and was\nrunning after that creature ... and because he owed me that three\nthousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of\nhis own meanness! This is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg\nyou, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father,\nhe came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and what he\nwanted it for. Yes, yes--to win that creature and carry her off. I knew\nthen that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I,\nI, who gave him that money, who offered it to him on the pretext of his\nsending it to my sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in\nthe face and said that he could send it when he liked, 'in a month's time\nwould do.' How, how could he have failed to understand that I was\npractically telling him to his face, 'You want money to be false to me\nwith your creature, so here's the money for you. I give it to you myself.\nTake it, if you have so little honor as to take it!' I wanted to prove\nwhat he was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it\nwith that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all\nabout it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money to\ntest him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take\nit from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and he\nunderstood it all and he took it--he carried off my money!\"\n\n\"That's true, Katya,\" Mitya roared suddenly, \"I looked into your eyes and\nI knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money. Despise me\nas a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved it!\"\n\n\"Prisoner,\" cried the President, \"another word and I will order you to be\nremoved.\"\n\n\"That money was a torment to him,\" Katya went on with impulsive haste. \"He\nwanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that's true; but he needed money for\nthat creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didn't repay me, and\nwent off with her to that village where he was arrested. There, again, he\nsquandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a\nday before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he wrote\nit. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite, and feeling\ncertain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, even\nif he did kill him, or else he wouldn't have written it. For he knew I\nshouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read it\nattentively--more attentively, please--and you will see that he had\ndescribed it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill his\nfather and where his money was kept. Look, please, don't overlook that,\nthere's one phrase there, 'I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone\naway.' So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,\"\nKaterina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant\ntriumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and\ndetected every meaning underlining it. \"If he hadn't been drunk, he\nwouldn't have written to me; but, look, everything is written there\nbeforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program of\nit!\" she exclaimed frantically.\n\nShe was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she\nhad foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with\nanger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she\nhad taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by\nthe clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming\nimpression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the\nletter.\n\n\"It's mine, mine!\" cried Mitya. \"I shouldn't have written it, if I hadn't\nbeen drunk!... We've hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear,\nI swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn't love me!\"\n\nHe sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutor\nand counsel for the defense began cross-examining her, chiefly to\nascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give her\nevidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.\n\n\"Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor and\nmy conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised me\nso!\" Katya cried madly. \"Oh, he has despised me horribly, he has always\ndespised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very moment that\nI bowed down to him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at\nthe time, but for a long time I wouldn't believe it. How often I have read\nit in his eyes, 'You came of yourself, though.' Oh, he didn't understand,\nhe had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but baseness, he\njudged me by himself, he thought every one was like himself!\" Katya hissed\nfuriously, in a perfect frenzy. \"And he only wanted to marry me, because\nI'd inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always\nsuspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was always\nconvinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him,\nbecause I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever\nfor it, and so to be superior to me--that's why he wanted to marry me!\nThat's so, that's all so! I tried to conquer him by my love--a love that\nknew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he\nunderstood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed? He is a\nmonster! I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought me\nfrom the tavern--and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to\nforgive him everything, everything--even his treachery!\"\n\nThe President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I can't\nhelp thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria\nand of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, \"We\nunderstand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,\"\nand so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving,\nhysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary clearness,\nwhich is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought\nstates, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last\ntwo months trying to save \"the monster and murderer,\" his brother.\n\n\"He tortured himself,\" she exclaimed, \"he was always trying to minimize\nhis brother's guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved his\nfather, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender, over-\ntender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He told me\neverything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as his only\nfriend. I have the honor to be his only friend!\" she cried suddenly with a\nsort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. \"He had been twice to see\nSmerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, 'If it was not my brother, but\nSmerdyakov committed the murder' (for the legend was circulating\neverywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), 'perhaps I too am guilty, for\nSmerdyakov knew I didn't like my father and perhaps believed that I\ndesired my father's death.' Then I brought out that letter and showed it\nhim. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done it, and he was\noverwhelmed by it. He couldn't endure the thought that his own brother was\na parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During the\nlast few days he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mind\nwas giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the\nstreets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day\nbefore yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever--and all\non his account, on account of this monster! And last night he learnt that\nSmerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind\n... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!\"\n\nOh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once in\na lifetime--at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold!\nBut it was in Katya's character, and it was such a moment in her life. It\nwas the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a\nyoung profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before,\nin her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty\nbefore all these people, telling of Mitya's generous conduct, in the hope\nof softening his fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself;\nbut this time it was for another, and perhaps only now--perhaps only at\nthis moment--she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She had\nsacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden that he\nhad ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the\nmurder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to save\nhis good name, his reputation!\n\nAnd yet one terrible doubt occurred to one--was she lying in her\ndescription of her former relations with Mitya?--that was the question. No,\nshe had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised\nher for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had been\nfirmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-hearted\nMitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and despising her.\nShe had loved him with an hysterical, \"lacerated\" love only from pride,\nfrom wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more like\nrevenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love,\nperhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness\nhad wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could not\nforgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and all\nthat had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended\nwoman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya,\nbut she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had she given full expression\nto her feelings than the tension of course was over and she was\noverwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor,\nsobbing and screaming. She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with\na wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.\n\n\"Mitya,\" she wailed, \"your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shown\nyou what she is!\" she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a\nsignal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from the\ncourt. She wouldn't allow it. She fought and struggled to get back to\nMitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was\noverpowered.\n\nYes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been\nsatisfied--the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscow\ndoctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sent\nthe court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announced\nto the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of\nbrain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer to questions\nfrom the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that the\npatient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and\nthat he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had\nnot consented to be looked after. \"He was certainly not in a normal state\nof mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he\nmet several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited\nhim every evening,\" said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his\nevidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina\nIvanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the\njudges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected\npieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.\n\nBut I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only\nrepeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their\ncharacteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the\nprosecutor's speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was\nexcited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were\nawaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense\nimpatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna's\nevidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had\nbeen taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was\njust eight o'clock when the President returned to his seat and our\nprosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The Prosecutor's Speech. Sketches Of Character\n\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with\ncold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. He\ndescribed this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his _chef-\nd'oeuvre_, the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of his whole life, as his swan-song. He died,\nit is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he had the\nright, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last\nsong. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that\nspeech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least\nsome feeling for the public welfare and \"the eternal question\" lay\nconcealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity.\nHe genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he was accusing him not as\nan official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a\ngenuine passion \"for the security of society.\" Even the ladies in the\naudience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted\nthat he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking\nvoice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his\nspeech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" began the prosecutor, \"this case has made a stir\nthroughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there so\npeculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes!\nThat's what's so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us.\nWhat ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this\nor that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our\nlukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an\nunenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of\nintellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in\nspite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their\nfoundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among\nus? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and\nevery citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn\nand still timid press has done good service to the public already, for\nwithout it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence\nand moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, not\nmerely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present\nreign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of things\nbeside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace.\nBut what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of\nviolence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us that\nit is difficult to contend against it.\n\n\"One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very\noutset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of\nconscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, and\nthe servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he could\nfind on him; 'it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable\nworld and for my career in the future.' After murdering them, he puts\npillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young\nhero 'decorated for bravery' kills the mother of his chief and benefactor,\nlike a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that\n'she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take\nno precautions.' Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in these\ndays that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but will\nfeel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul. In silence, alone\nwith his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, 'What is honor, and isn't\nthe condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?'\n\n\"Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that\nit is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say so--and\nheavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, don't believe\nme, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only\na twentieth part of what I say is true--even so it's awful! Look how our\nyoung people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet's question\nwhat there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all\nthat relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long\nbeen erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice,\nat our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present\ncase, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we\nall knew him, 'he lived among us!'...\n\n\"Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe will\nstudy the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it. But\nthis study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydom\nof to-day is farther behind us, so that it's possible to examine it with\nmore insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now we are either\nhorrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over the\nspectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our\ncynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children, we brush the\ndreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to\nour sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must one\nday begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society;\nit's time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least\nto make a beginning in that direction.\n\n\"A great writer(9) of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika\ngalloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, 'Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who\ninvented thee!' and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the\nworld stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping\ntroika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, but\nin my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in\nan access of childish and naive optimism, or simply in fear of the\ncensorship of the day. For if the troika were drawn by his heroes,\nSobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal,\nwhoever might be driving it. And those were the heroes of an older\ngeneration, ours are worse specimens still....\"\n\nAt this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's speech was interrupted by applause.\nThe liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The applause was,\nit's true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think it\nnecessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction\nof the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had never\nbeen applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get a hearing,\nand now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.\n\n\"What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an\nunenviable notoriety throughout Russia?\" he continued. \"Perhaps I am\nexaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the\neducated class of to-day are reflected in this family picture--only, of\ncourse, in miniature, 'like the sun in a drop of water.' Think of that\nunhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy\nend, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor\ndependent position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a small\nfortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though\nundeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew\nbolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics\ndisappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained.\nOn the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his vitality was\nexcessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he brought his\nchildren up to be the same. He had no feelings for his duties as a father.\nHe ridiculed those duties. He left his little children to the servants,\nand was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The old\nman's maxim was _Apres moi le deluge_. He was an example of everything\nthat is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant\nindividualism. 'The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all\nright,' and he was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living\nin the same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own\nson and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get his\nmistress from him. No, I don't intend to leave the prisoner's defense\naltogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the\ntruth myself, I can well understand what resentment he had heaped up in\nhis son's heart against him.\n\n\"But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Let\nus remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical fathers\nof to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of many\nmodern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professing\nsuch cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but their\nphilosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but\nyou have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not\nbelieve me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember\nsomething of my words.\n\n\"Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of them\nis the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him.\nOf the other two I will speak only cursorily.\n\n\"The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and\nvigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied\nand rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he was\na welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions, quite\nthe contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him\nnow, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazov\nfamily. Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his\nown hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and\npossibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the\npreliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan\nKaramazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. 'Everything in the\nworld is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in the\nfuture--that is what he always taught me.' I believe that idiot was driven\nout of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks\nfrom which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to\nunhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation,\nwhich would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is,\nindeed, why I've mentioned it: 'If there is one of the sons that is like\nFyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.'\n\n\"With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it\nindelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any further\nconclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's future. We've seen\nto-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his young\nheart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faith\nand cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance than by the\nexercise of independent thought.\n\n\"Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does not\nshare his elder brother's gloomy and destructive theory of life. He has\nsought to cling to the 'ideas of the people,' or to what goes by that name\nin some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery,\nand was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed\nunconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our\nunhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and\nmistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return\nto their 'native soil,' as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their\nmother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the\nwithered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only\nto escape the horrors that terrify them.\n\n\"For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I\ntrust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the\npeople may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into\ngloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism--two elements\nwhich are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to\nmisunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his\nelder brother is suffering.\"\n\nTwo or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and\nmysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own\neloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing\nof the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive\nman was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life. People\nsaid afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism\nof Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of\nhim in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to\ntake his revenge. But I don't know whether it was true. All this was only\nintroductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct consideration\nof the case.\n\n\"But to return to the eldest son,\" Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. \"He is\nthe prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before us;\nthe fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface. While his\nbrothers seem to stand for 'Europeanism' and 'the principles of the\npeople,' he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, not\nall! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our mother\nRussia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a\nmarvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture and\nSchiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon\ncompanions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only when all goes\nwell with him. What is more, he can be carried off his feet, positively\ncarried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves,\nif they fall from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He\ndislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that's so\nwith him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life (he\ncouldn't be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he\nwill show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must\nhave money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with\nwhat scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless\ndissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he is\nready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later,\nlet us take events in their chronological order.\n\n\"First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the back-\nyard 'without boots on his feet,' as our worthy and esteemed fellow\ncitizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat it\nagain, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse\nhim, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the\ninfluence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and\nbecomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to\none of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an\nofficer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so\nafter prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the\nlast six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he\npractically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with\nhis father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.\n\n\"Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant\neducation. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just\nheard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent.\nThe figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to\ntrue nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light\nbefore us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us\nimmediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture to\nconjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The same lady,\nbathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he, he of all\nmen, had despised her for her action, which, though incautious, reckless\nperhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the\ngirl's betrothed, looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more\ninsufferable from him than from any one. And knowing that he had already\ndeceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endure\neverything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him three\nthousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that she\nwas offering him money to deceive her. 'Well, will you take it or not, are\nyou so lost to shame?' was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He\nlooked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (he's admitted here before\nyou that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand\nunconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of his\naffections.\n\n\"What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officer\nsacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing\nreverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule, between\ntwo extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is not\ntrue. The probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble,\nand in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broad\nKaramazov character--that's just what I am leading up to--capable of\ncombining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest\nheights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by\na young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close quarters--Mr.\nRakitin: 'The sense of their own degradation is as essential to those\nreckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.' And\nthat's true, they need continually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at\nthe same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their\nexistence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they\ninclude everything and put up with everything.\n\n\"By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've just touched upon that three\nthousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Can\nyou conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a\nway, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,\ncould have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that\nvery day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the\nfirmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month\nafterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!\nNeither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into the\ncountry, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him\nto remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father,\ndid he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to avoid\nabandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous, he would\nhave been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to\nkeep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would say to him at\nlast 'I am yours,' and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.\n\n\"But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he gives\nfor it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she would\nsay, 'I am yours, take me where you will,' he might have the wherewithal\nto take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner's own words, was of\nlittle weight beside the second. While I have that money on me, he said, I\nam a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed,\nand, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can\nalways say to her, 'You see, I've squandered half your money, and shown I\nam a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel' (I use the\nprisoner's own expressions), 'but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a\nthief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you back this\nhalf of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!' A\nmarvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not resist\nthe temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of\nsuch disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness,\nand carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does that\nfit in at all with the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture to\ntell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such\ncircumstances, if he really had brought himself to put away the money.\n\n\"At the first temptation--for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he\nhad already squandered half the money--he would have unpicked his little\nbag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he have taken\nback precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not\nfourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then that he was not a\nthief, because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time\nhe would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then a\nthird, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he would have\ntaken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundred\nit would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. And\nthen he would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself,\n'It's really not worth while to give back one hundred; let's spend that,\ntoo!' That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would have\nbehaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact\nthan this legend of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable.\nBut we shall return to that later.\"\n\nAfter touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the\nfinancial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that it\nwas utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was in\nthe wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical\nexperts in reference to Mitya's fixed idea about the three thousand owing\nhim.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. An Historical Survey\n\n\n\"The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out\nof his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that he is in his right\nmind, and that if he had not been, he would have behaved more cleverly. As\nfor his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point,\nthat is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I think one might\nfind a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I\nagree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's\nmental faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been\nirritable and exasperated. The object of the prisoner's continual and\nviolent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the\nbottom of it. That motive is jealousy!\"\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's fatal passion\nfor Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went to the\n\"young person's\" lodgings \"to beat her\"--\"I use his own expression,\" the\nprosecutor explained--\"but instead of beating her, he remained there, at\nher feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At the same time the\nprisoner's father was captivated by the same young person--a strange and\nfatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously,\nthough both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them the\nmost violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own\nconfession: 'I was laughing at both of them.' Yes, the sudden desire to\nmake a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.\nThe old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roubles\nas a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he would have\nbeen happy to lay his property and his name at her feet, if only she would\nbecome his lawful wife. We have good evidence of this. As for the\nprisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it is before us. But such\nwas the young person's 'game.' The enchantress gave the unhappy young man\nno hope until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out\nhands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It\nwas in that position that he was arrested. 'Send me to Siberia with him, I\nhave brought him to this, I am most to blame,' the woman herself cried, in\ngenuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.\n\n\"The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin,\ncharacterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: 'She was\ndisillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who\nseduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by her\nrespectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man,\nwhom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was perhaps\nmuch that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early.\nShe became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentful\nagainst society.' After this sketch of her character it may well be\nunderstood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from\nmalice.\n\n\"After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he\nbetrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor, the\nprisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continual\njealousy--and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was that the crazy\nold man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means of\nthat very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his own\nproperty, part of his inheritance from his mother, of which his father was\ncheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man\nto madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was used\nwith such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!\"\n\nThen the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his\nfather had entered the prisoner's head, and illustrated his theory with\nfacts.\n\n\"At first he only talked about it in taverns--he was talking about it all\nthat month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and he\nlikes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical and\ndangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and expects,\nfor some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with perfect\nsympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his part and not\noppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes up\neverything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about Captain\nSnegiryov.] Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he\nmight mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats\ninto actions.\"\n\nHere the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery,\nthe conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence when\nthe prisoner had rushed into his father's house just after dinner.\n\n\"I cannot positively assert,\" the prosecutor continued, \"that the prisoner\nfully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet the idea had\nseveral times presented itself to him, and he had deliberated on it--for\nthat we have facts, witnesses, and his own words. I confess, gentlemen of\nthe jury,\" he added, \"that till to-day I have been uncertain whether to\nattribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convinced\nthat he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured\nit, contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered\nwhen and how he might commit the crime.\n\n\"But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was\npresented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young lady's\nexclamation, 'It is the plan, the program of the murder!' That is how she\ndefined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner. And, in\nfact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was\npremeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now for a\nfact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible\ndesign, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money next day, he\nwould murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes from\nunder his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. 'As soon as Ivan had gone\naway'--you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every\ncircumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it. The\nproof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committed\nfor the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written and\nsigned. The prisoner does not deny his signature.\n\n\"I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not diminish\nthe value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when drunk what he\nhad planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober, he would not\nhave written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did he talk about\nit in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it\nto himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when\nhe had only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less\nabout it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the 'Metropolis' tavern,\ncontrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking. He did\nnot play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He did indeed\nturn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost unconsciously,\nbecause he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance. It is\ntrue that after he had taken the final decision, he must have felt\napprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand, and\nthat this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But there\nwas nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck had\nserved him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his star, you\nknow! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal\ncatastrophe. 'To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,'\nas he writes in his peculiar language, 'and if they won't give it to me,\nthere will be bloodshed.' \"\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya's\nefforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to Samsonov, his\njourney to Lyagavy. \"Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his watch\nto pay for the journey (though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles\non him--a likely story), tortured by jealousy at having left the object of\nhis affections in the town, suspecting that she would go to Fyodor\nPavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last to the town, to find, to\nhis joy, that she had not been near his father. He accompanied her himself\nto her protector. (Strange to say, he doesn't seem to have been jealous of\nSamsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to\nhis ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a\nfit, that the other servant is ill--the coast is clear and he knows the\n'signals'--what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady\nwho has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly\nesteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his\ncareer with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his\ndissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth and\nvigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the gold-\nmines: 'that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your romantic\ncharacter, your thirst for adventure.' \"\n\nAfter describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the\nprisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov's, the sudden\nfrenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion,\nat the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father,\nIppolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of\nchance. \"Had the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her\nformer lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, she\ncould only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did not\nkill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false\nmistress.\n\n\"But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why that?\nWhy not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating his plan\nand preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would snatch up\nanything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized for a month\npast that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly,\nwithout hesitation, recognized that it would serve his purpose. So it was\nby no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up\nthat fatal pestle. And then we find him in his father's garden--the coast\nis clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicion\nthat she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhaps\nlaughing at him at that moment--took his breath away. And it was not mere\nsuspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must be there, in that\nlighted room, she must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man would\nhave us believe that he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in,\nand discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should\nhappen. And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his\ncharacter, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he knew the\nsignals by which he could at once enter the house.\" At this point Ippolit\nKirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of\nSmerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and every\none realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion, he\nthought the subject of great importance.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov\n\n\n\"To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?\" (Ippolit\nKirillovitch began.) \"The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had\ncommitted the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest,\nyet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to\nconfirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is\nconfirmed by three persons only--the two brothers of the prisoner and\nMadame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only\nto-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know\nthat for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of\nhis brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that\nlater. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact\nto support his notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has only been led to that\nconclusion from the prisoner's own words and the expression of his face.\nYes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to-\nday by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. 'What the prisoner\ntells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.' That is all\nthe evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are\nall deeply concerned in the prisoner's fate. And yet the theory of\nSmerdyakov's guilt has been noised about, has been and is still\nmaintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?\"\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality\nof Smerdyakov, \"who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.\" He\ndepicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education,\nwho had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his level\nand certain modern theories of duty, which he learnt in practice from the\nreckless life of his master, who was also perhaps his father--Fyodor\nPavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophical\nconversations with his master's elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily\nindulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse\nhimself at the valet's expense. \"He spoke to me himself of his spiritual\ncondition during the last few days at his father's house,\" Ippolit\nKirillovitch explained; \"but others too have borne witness to it--the\nprisoner himself, his brother, and the servant Grigory--that is, all who\nknew him well.\n\n\"Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy,\nhad not the courage of a chicken. 'He fell at my feet and kissed them,'\nthe prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how damaging such a\nstatement was to himself. 'He is an epileptic chicken,' he declared about\nhim in his characteristic language. And the prisoner chose him for his\nconfidant (we have his own word for it) and he frightened him into\nconsenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that capacity he deceived\nhis master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with\nthe notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into the\nhouse. How could he help telling him, indeed? 'He would have killed me, I\ncould see that he would have killed me,' he said at the inquiry, trembling\nand shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time arrested\nand could do him no harm. 'He suspected me at every instant. In fear and\ntrembling I hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he might\nsee that I had not deceived him and let me off alive.' Those are his own\nwords. I wrote them down and I remember them. 'When he began shouting at\nme, I would fall on my knees.'\n\n\"He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his\nmaster, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So it may\nbe supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having\ndeceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons severely\nafflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, always\nprone to continual and morbid self-reproach. They worry over their\n'wickedness,' they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely\nwithout cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and\ncrimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to\nwrong-doing by terror and intimidation.\n\n\"He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would be\nthe outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes. When\nIvan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe,\nSmerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid to tell him\nplainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints were\nnot understood.\n\n\"It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector,\nwhose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to\npass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's drunken letter, 'I shall\nkill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.' So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence\nseemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house.\n\n\"But he went away, and within an hour of his young master's departure\nSmerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that's perfectly\nintelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror and\ndespair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of the\nfits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might be\ncoming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of\ncourse, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is\nlikely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan\nFyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his\nlonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the\nstairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to\ncome upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,\nbrought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks, and\nhe fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly natural\noccurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was shamming\nan attack _on purpose_. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises at\nonce, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on? What was he aiming\nat? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the\ndoctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the\nreal. That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for\nsuch a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, have\ndesired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just\nbefore?\n\n\"You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were\nfive persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's--Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he did\nnot kill himself, that's evident); then his servant, Grigory, but he was\nalmost killed himself; the third person was Grigory's wife, Marfa\nIgnatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering her\nmaster. Two persons are left--the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are\nto believe the prisoner's statement that he is not the murderer, then\nSmerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else\ncan be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation\nagainst the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday. Had a shadow of\nsuspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I am\npersuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse\nSmerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to charge\nSmerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.\n\n\"Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let us\neven lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts\ntell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or with the\nassistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternative--that he\ndid it alone. If he had killed him it must have been with some object, for\nsome advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the\nprisoner had for the murder--hatred, jealousy, and so on--Smerdyakov could\nonly have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the\nthree thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yet\nhe tells another person--and a person most closely interested, that is, the\nprisoner--everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope\nlay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all,\ntold him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do\nthis simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who\nwould be anxious to get that envelope for himself? 'Yes,' I shall be told,\n'but he betrayed it from fear.' But how do you explain this? A man who\ncould conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells\nfacts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held\nhis tongue, no one would ever have guessed!\n\n\"No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, nothing\nwould have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals,\nfor that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He would have\ninvented something, he would have told some lie if he had been forced to\ngive information, but he would have been silent about that. For, on the\nother hand, if he had said nothing about the money, but had committed the\nmurder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged him\nwith murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the\nmoney, no one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had\nbeen accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had\ncommitted it from some other motive. But since no one had observed any\nsuch motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, that\nhis master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence, he would,\nof course, have been the last to be suspected. People would have suspected\nfirst the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he had such\nmotives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected\nthe son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed\nand robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course,\nhave suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the\nmurder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the\nsignals? Is that logical? Is that clear?\n\n\"When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him\nfalling downstairs in a _feigned_ fit--with what object? In the first place\nthat Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might put it\noff and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house,\nand, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing that there was\nno one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his son, might redouble\nhis vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he,\nSmerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where\nhe always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and out\nas he liked, to Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge, where he was\nalways put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This was\nthe immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted Marfa\nIgnatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying behind the screen, he\nwould most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and so\nkeeping them awake all night (as Grigory and his wife testified). And all\nthis, we are to believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murder\nhis master!\n\n\"But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not\nbe suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals to\ntempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him and had gone\naway with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people,\nSmerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in--what for? To murder his\nmaster a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen?\nGentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,\nbut, incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges. When\nhe had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, he\ntells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his master and stole the\nmoney! I won't press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned\non this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son\nwould simply come to peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and\nbeat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put\nthis question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could\nhave committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can't accuse him.\n\n\"But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,\nheard a shout, and went out. Well--what then? He looked about him and said,\n'Why not go and kill the master?' And how did he know what had happened,\nsince he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But there's a limit\nto these flights of fancy.\n\n\" 'Quite so,' some astute people will tell me, 'but what if they were in\nagreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the money--what\nthen?' A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are\nastounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his\naccomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion\nin every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would be\ninteresting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to\nform such an insane plan.\n\n\"But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov's part,\nbut only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and\nagreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamed\nfor letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help or\nresisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get\nout of the way by shamming a fit--'you may murder him as you like; it's\nnothing to me.' But as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the\nhousehold into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such\na plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, it\nwould still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the\ninstigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an\naccomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror.\n\n\"But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly\nthrows all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being his\naccomplice, but of being himself the murderer. 'He did it alone,' he says.\n'He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.' Strange sort\nof accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of the\nrisk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while his accomplice lay\nin bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented\nit and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he\nmight well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was\nresponsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished,\nit would be far less severely than the real murderer. But in that case he\nwould have been certain to make a confession, yet he has not done so.\nSmerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murderer\npersisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crime\nalone.\n\n\"What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it\nwas _he_ who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the\nsignals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about them. If\nhe had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily have made this\nstatement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to conceal\nit, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was far from distorting\nor minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being\ncharged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit of\nmelancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himself\nyesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language, 'I destroy\nmyself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.'\nWhat would it have cost him to add: 'I am the murderer, not Karamazov'?\nBut that he did not add. Did his conscience lead him to suicide and not to\navowing his guilt?\n\n\"And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the\ncourt just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in the\nenvelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had received\nthem from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the painful\nscene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones\nas might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be\noverlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money\nand hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessed\nhis guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so,\nindeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? And so,\nif he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow the whole\ntruth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the innocent\nprisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?\n\n\"The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came\nto the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan\nFyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousand\neach--that is, ten thousand in all--to the chief town of the province to be\nchanged. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and\nthat it can't be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor\nPavlovitch's envelope.\n\n\"Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such\nimportance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn't he report it\nat once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to\nconjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had\nadmitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was\nsuffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on\nthe eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down\nto-day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at\nonce reflected, 'The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my\nbrother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov\ngave them me before his death.' You will say that was dishonorable: it's\ndishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True,\nbut what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by\nthe sudden news of the valet's death, he imagined it really was so? You\nsaw the recent scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He was\nstanding up and was speaking, but where was his mind?\n\n\"Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two days before\nthe crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why, then, are\nwe looking for any other program? The crime was committed precisely\naccording to this program, and by no other than the writer of it. Yes,\ngentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not run\nrespectfully and timidly away from his father's window, though he was\nfirmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him. No, that\nis absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed\nhim in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated\nrival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass pestle,\nand having convinced himself, after careful search, that she was not\nthere, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the pillow and\ntake out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the table\nbefore us.\n\n\"I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very\ncharacteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and had\nhe committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have left the\ntorn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse? Had it been\nSmerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him, he would have\nsimply carried away the envelope with him, without troubling himself to\nopen it over his victim's corpse, for he would have known for certain that\nthe notes were in the envelope--they had been put in and sealed up in his\npresence--and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have\nknown of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved\nin that way? Would he have left the envelope on the floor?\n\n\"No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not a\nthief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes from\nunder the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizing\nhis own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was the idea\nwhich had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard\nto that money. And pouncing upon the envelope, which he had never seen\nbefore, he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran\naway with the money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had\nleft an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope\non the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he didn't\nthink, he didn't reflect, and how should he? He ran away; he heard behind\nhim the servant cry out; the old man caught him, stopped him and was\nfelled to the ground by the brass pestle.\n\n\"The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you believe\nit, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to see\nwhether he could do anything for him. Was that a moment to show\ncompassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only\nwitness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other feeling, any other\nmotive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped\nhis head with his handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran\nto the house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it he\nnever thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once\ndetected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice\nthat he was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very\npossible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On one point\nthey will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape them\naltogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one thing only--where was\n_she_? He wanted to find out at once where she was, so he ran to her\nlodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news--she had gone\noff to Mokroe to meet her first lover.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor's Speech.\n\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition,\nbeloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on\ntheir own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his speech he went off into a\ndissertation on Grushenka's \"first lover,\" and brought forward several\ninteresting thoughts on this theme.\n\n\"Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, so\nto speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What makes\nit all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this\nformidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote danger, and\nKaramazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded him as a\nfiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been\nconcealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but a\nfiction to her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this\ninstantly, he resigned himself.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in\nthe prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for\njustice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love. And\nall this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with his\nfather's blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had shed was\nalready crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul and\nhis life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instant\nwhat he was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him\nthan his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned\npenitent, with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with honorable\noffers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life. And he, luckless\nman, what could he give her now, what could he offer her?\n\n\"Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by his\ncrime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with life\nbefore him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to one\nfrantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's character, must have appeared\nthe one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way out was\nsuicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friend\nPerhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money,\nfor the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh,\nnow he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would\nshoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a poet and\nhad burnt the candle at both ends all his life. 'To her, to her! and\nthere, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never was\nbefore, that will be remembered and talked of long after! In the midst of\nshouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise\nthe glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness! And\nthen, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and\npunish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see\nhow Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!'\n\n\"Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and\nsentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but\nthere is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out\nin the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto\ndeath--that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment,\nits terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is\nthe only way out! But _beyond_--I don't know whether Karamazov wondered at\nthat moment 'What lies beyond,' and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet,\nwonder 'What lies beyond.' No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their\nHamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!\"\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations,\nthe scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers. He quoted numerous\nwords and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terrible\nimpression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man\nstood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.\n\n\"What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost confessed,\nhinted at it, all but spoke out.\" (Then followed the evidence given by\nwitnesses.) \"He even cried out to the peasant who drove him, 'Do you know,\nyou are driving a murderer!' But it was impossible for him to speak out,\nhe had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his romance. But what was\nawaiting the luckless man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw\nthat his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the\ntoast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be\nacceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the\npreliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was complete and\nhis soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phase\nthrough which his soul has passed or will pass.\n\n\"One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,\" the prosecutor\ncontinued, \"that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own\nvengeance more completely than any earthly justice. What's more, justice\nand punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and\nare, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as its\nsalvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror and moral\nsuffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him, that for his\nsake she had rejected her first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya,\nto a new life, that she was promising him happiness--and when? When\neverything was over for him and nothing was possible!\n\n\"By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the\nlight it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment. This woman, this\nlove of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant of his\narrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him but\nunattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he relinquish\nhis design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just that\npassionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained\nhim. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress, who was\nat the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than\never--he did not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.\n\n\"His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest,\nbut even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for a moment!\nI can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by\nthese influences--first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement,\nof the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her, flushed\nwith wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in\nthe background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till\nnext morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a few\nhours and that's much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many\nthings. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when\nthey are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street\nto pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then there\nwill be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street\nthe dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning of the journey\nthe condemned man, sitting on his shameful cart, must feel that he has\ninfinite life still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves on--oh,\nthat's nothing, it's still far to the turning into the second street and\nhe still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously\ncurious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that he\nis just such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street.\nOh, that's nothing, nothing, there's still a whole street before him, and\nhowever many houses have been passed, he will still think there are many\nleft. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.\n\n\"This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. 'They've not had time\nyet,' he must have thought, 'I may still find some way out, oh, there's\nstill time to make some plan of defense, and now, now--she is so\nfascinating!'\n\n\"His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to put\naside half his money and hide it somewhere--I cannot otherwise explain the\ndisappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken from\nhis father's pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than once before, he had\ncaroused there for two days together already, he knew the old big house\nwith all its passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money\nwas hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice,\nunder some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I\nshall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he\nhadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the time, his head was\nthrobbing and his heart was with _her_, but money--money was indispensable\nin any case! With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at\nsuch a moment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself that\na month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his money\nand sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall\nprove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had\ncontemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry that he had\nput fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed) he may have\ninvented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he had\ntwo hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at Mokroe till\nmorning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself. Two\nextremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate\ntwo extremes and both at once.\n\n\"We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money. It may still\nbe there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner's\nhands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees before her, she\nwas lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to her and he had so\nentirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the men coming to\narrest him. He hadn't time to prepare any line of defense in his mind. He\nwas caught unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his\ndestiny.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our duties\nwhen it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his account, too!\nThe moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees that\nall is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the moments\nwhen every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he\nlooks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face,\nyour thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his distracted\nmind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to\nspeak, afraid of giving himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this\nanimal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the\nhuman soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the\ncriminal even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.\n\n\"At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very\ncompromising phrases. 'Blood! I've deserved it!' But he quickly restrained\nhimself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer he was to\nmake, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. 'I am not guilty of my\nfather's death.' That was his fence for the moment and behind it he hoped\nto throw up a barricade of some sort. His first compromising exclamations\nhe hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death\nof the servant Grigory only. 'Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has\nkilled my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him,\n_if not I_?' Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask him\nthat question! Do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature\nhaste--'if not I'--the animal cunning, the naivete, the Karamazov impatience\nof it? 'I didn't kill him and you mustn't think I did! I wanted to kill\nhim, gentlemen, I wanted to kill him,' he hastens to admit (he was in a\nhurry, in a terrible hurry), 'but still I am not guilty, it is not I\nmurdered him.' He concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though\nto say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe\nall the sooner that I didn't murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is\noften amazingly shallow and credulous.\n\n\"At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally, the\nmost simple question, 'Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed him?' Then, as we\nexpected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught\nhim unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the\nmoment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He\nrushed at once to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to\nassure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of\nit. But don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really\ngive up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him\nforward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but he\nwould do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him.\nHe would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later,\nchoosing an opportunity to cry out to us, 'You know I was more skeptical\nabout Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I am\nconvinced. He killed him, he must have done!' And for the present he falls\nback upon a gloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted\nhim, however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he\nlooked into his father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The\nworst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the\nevidence given by Grigory.\n\n\"We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him, the\nwhole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it. And no\ndoubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bag\nfirst occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of the\nimprobability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more\nlikely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In such\ncases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is to\nprevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly so\nthat he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity,\nimprobability and inconsistency. The criminal can only be made to speak by\nthe sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of\nsome circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had no\nprevious idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in\nreadiness--that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through which\nthe prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about that door and\nhad not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.\n\n\"The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, 'Then\nSmerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!' and so betrayed the basis of\nthe defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbable\nshape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had\nknocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that Grigory saw the\ndoor was open before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the\nscreen as he came out of his bedroom--Karamazov was positively crushed. My\nesteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards\nthat he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improve\nmatters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little\nbag--so be it, you shall hear this romance!\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this\nromance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that\ncould have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for a\nbet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything more\nincredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can\nalways be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real\nlife is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers\nneglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for\nsuch details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a\nwhole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that's\nhow they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, 'Where did you\nget the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?' 'I made it\nmyself.' 'And where did you get the linen?' The prisoner was positively\noffended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial\nquestion, and would you believe it, his resentment was genuine! But they\nare all like that. 'I tore it off my shirt.' 'Then we shall find that\nshirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece torn off.' And only fancy,\ngentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and how\ncould we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that\nwould have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! But\nhe was incapable of that reflection. 'I don't remember, it may not have\nbeen off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.' 'What sort\nof a cap?' 'It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.' 'And do you\nremember that clearly?' 'No, I don't.' And he was angry, very angry, and\nyet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments of man's\nlife, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers just\nsuch trifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed\npast him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross--that he will remember. He\nconcealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must have\nremembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him\nneedle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen\n(there is a screen in his lodgings).\n\n\"But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these\ndetails, trifles?\" cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. \"Just because the\nprisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has not\nexplained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has not added\none actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements; all those\nare trivialities. 'You must believe it on my honor.' Oh, we are glad to\nbelieve it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honor!\nAre we jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in the\nprisoner's favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real\nfact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner's expression by his own\nbrother, or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to\npoint to the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new\nfact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to\nrepudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot\nrepudiate anything.\"\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as though\nhe was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the\nblood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery!\nHe pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts.\n\n\"And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for\nthe defense,\" Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, \"whatever\neloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember\nthat at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you are\nthe champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her\nprinciples, her family, everything that she holds sacred! Yes, you\nrepresent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not\nin this hall only but will reecho throughout the whole of Russia, and all\nRussia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be\nencouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and\nher expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight\nperhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched\nout imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. And\nif other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from\nrespect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. From\nhorror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, but\nmaybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall\nconfronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of\nour lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and\ncivilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they\nalready begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing\nhatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!\"\n\nThough Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech\nwith this rhetorical appeal--and the effect produced by him was\nextraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and,\nas I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room. There\nwas no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. The ladies\nwere not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with his\neloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the\ntrial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. \"He will speak at last and of\ncourse carry all before him.\"\n\nEvery one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the\nprosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and his\nhead bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened,\nespecially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the prosecutor mentioned\nRakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over his\nface and he murmured rather audibly, \"The Bernards!\" When Ippolit\nKirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe,\nMitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At one point he\nseemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only\nshrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end\nof the speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at\nMokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. \"The man could not resist\nboasting of his cleverness,\" they said.\n\nThe court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an\nhour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and\nexclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.\n\n\"A weighty speech,\" a gentleman in one group observed gravely.\n\n\"He brought in too much psychology,\" said another voice.\n\n\"But it was all true, the absolute truth!\"\n\n\"Yes, he is first rate at it.\"\n\n\"He summed it all up.\"\n\n\"Yes, he summed us up, too,\" chimed in another voice. \"Do you remember, at\nthe beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor\nPavlovitch?\"\n\n\"And at the end, too. But that was all rot.\"\n\n\"And obscure too.\"\n\n\"He was a little too much carried away.\"\n\n\"It's unjust, it's unjust.\"\n\n\"No, it was smartly done, anyway. He's had long to wait, but he's had his\nsay, ha ha!\"\n\n\"What will the counsel for the defense say?\"\n\nIn another group I heard:\n\n\"He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that;\n'appealing to your sensibilities'--do you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was awkward of him.\"\n\n\"He was in too great a hurry.\"\n\n\"He is a nervous man.\"\n\n\"We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?\"\n\n\"Yes, what must it be for Mitya?\"\n\nIn a third group:\n\n\"What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the end?\"\n\n\"She is a general's wife, divorced, I know her.\"\n\n\"That's why she has the lorgnette.\"\n\n\"She is not good for much.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.\"\n\n\"Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.\"\n\n\"They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn't they, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was smart enough. We've heard it before, how often he has told the\nstory at people's houses!\"\n\n\"And he couldn't resist doing it now. That's vanity.\"\n\n\"He is a man with a grievance, he he!\"\n\n\"Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, such\nlong sentences.\"\n\n\"Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you remember\nabout the troika? Something about 'They have Hamlets, but we have, so far,\nonly Karamazovs!' That was cleverly said!\"\n\n\"That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?\"\n\n\"Whatever he says, he won't get round our peasants.\"\n\n\"Don't you think so?\"\n\nA fourth group:\n\n\"What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the other\nnations.\"\n\n\"And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speaking\nabout the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to\nintervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of him,\nI know he was. He was talking about that last week.\"\n\n\"Not an easy job.\"\n\n\"Not an easy job? Why not?\"\n\n\"Why, we'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where would\nthey get it?\"\n\n\"In America. They get it from America now.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\nBut the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted the\ntribune.\n\n\n\nChapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways\n\n\nAll was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The eyes\nof the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and directly,\nwith an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit. He made\nno attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a\nman speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice\nwas a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine\nand simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that\nthe speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and \"pierce the heart\nwith untold power.\" His language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit\nKirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with more\nprecision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending forward,\nespecially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but as\nthough he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long spine in\nhalf, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bend\nalmost at right angles.\n\nAt the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, without\nsystem, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end,\nthese facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts,\nthe first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimes\nmalicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly changed his\ntone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed\non the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.\n\nHe went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he\npracticed in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns to\ndefend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least a\npreconceived idea. \"That is what has happened to me in the present case,\"\nhe explained. \"From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck\nby something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner's favor. What\ninterested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but\nrarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present\ncase. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech,\nbut I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to\nwork directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my\nmaterial. That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere.\nWhat I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence\nagainst the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will stand\ncriticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the case more\nclosely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly\nreceived from the prisoner's relatives a request to undertake his defense.\nI at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to\nbreak down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of\nevidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the\ncase.\"\n\nSo Fetyukovitch began.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he suddenly protested, \"I am new to this\ndistrict. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulent\nand unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has insulted perhaps\nhundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people against\nhim beforehand. Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of local\nsociety is justly excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent and\nviolent temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcome\nin the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor.\"\n\n(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,\nquickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the prosecutor\nreceived Mitya against his will, solely because he had somehow interested\nhis wife--a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful,\ncapricious, and fond of opposing her husband, especially in trifles.\nMitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.)\n\n\"Nevertheless I venture to suggest,\" Fetyukovitch continued, \"that in\nspite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may have\nformed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client. Oh, that is so\nnatural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice.\nOutraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless. We\nhave, in the talented prosecutor's speech, heard a stern analysis of the\nprisoner's character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the\ncase was evident. And, what's more, he went into psychological subtleties\ninto which he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and\nmalicious prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are\neven worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious and\nconsciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away by the\nartistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance,\nespecially if God has endowed us with psychological insight. Before I\nstarted on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware,\nthat I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight\nand subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recent\nyears. But profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cuts both ways.\"\n(Laughter among the public.) \"You will, of course, forgive me my\ncomparison; I can't boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example any\npoint in the prosecutor's speech.\n\n\"The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the\nfence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass\npestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over\nthe man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the\nprosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's statement that he ran to old\nGrigory out of pity. 'No,' he says, 'such sensibility is impossible at\nsuch a moment, that's unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only\nwitness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had\ncommitted the murder, since he would not have run back for any other\nreason.'\n\n\"Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to\nthe case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable. The\nmurderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whether\nthe witness was alive or not, yet he had left in his murdered father's\nstudy, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence in\nthe shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had been\nthree thousand roubles in it. 'If he had carried that envelope away with\nhim, no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the\nnotes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.' Those\nare the prosecutor's own words. So on one side you see a complete absence\nof precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright,\nleaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed\nanother man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating\nforesight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological\nsubtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances I\nbecome as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the\nnext I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and\ncruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out\nwhether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutes\nlooking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Why\nsoak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may be\nevidence against me later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why\nnot hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as\nto kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?\n\n\"Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left\nanother witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from the\ntwo women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and\nprove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he had\nforgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he\nhad flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where\nGrigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at having\nkilled a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse,\nas a murderous weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason\ncould he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling\ngrief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent of\nhis father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run to\nanother victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; his\nthoughts would have been centered on self-preservation. He would have had\nnone to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would\nhave broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him.\nThere was room for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience had\nbeen clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have\npurposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you\ncan prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.\nPsychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite\nunconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.\"\n\nSounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were\nagain audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I will\nonly quote some passages from it, some leading points.\n\n\n\nChapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery\n\n\nThere was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's speech. He\nflatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and\nconsequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he began. \"Every new and unprejudiced observer\nmust be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case,\nnamely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of proving\nthat there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money was\nstolen--three thousand roubles--but whether those roubles ever existed,\nnobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seen\nthe notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been put\nin the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the\nprisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe.\nMadame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three\npersons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them.\n\n\"Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that\nSmerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What if\nhis master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his\ncash-box without telling him? Note, that according to Smerdyakov's story\nthe notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner must have pulled them\nout, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded\nin the protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes without\ndisturbing the bed? How could he have helped soiling with his blood-\nstained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been\npurposely made?\n\n\"But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, it's\nworth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprised\njust now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself--of\nhimself, observe--that but for that envelope, but for its being left on the\nfloor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of that\nenvelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisoner's having\nstolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor's own\nadmission, the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, 'otherwise\nno one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.'\nBut is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a\nproof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?\nYet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope.\nBut when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talked\nto Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen the notes two days before\nthe catastrophe. Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked\nup alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his\nadoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and\ntaking out the notes. 'What's the use of the envelope?' he may have asked\nhimself. 'She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show her the\nthirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression,\nyou may be sure, it will make her mouth water.' And so he tears open the\nenvelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor,\nconscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving\nevidence.\n\n\"Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and\nsuch an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the sort\ncould have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; if\nthere was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the floor\nmay be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I not\nmaintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because the\nmoney had been taken from it by its owner?\n\n\"But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch took\nit out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the\nhouse? In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box,\nand secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or the evening\nbefore to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he may have\nchanged his idea, his plan of action completely, without thinking it\nnecessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is\nthe barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so\npositively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and\nof having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on the\ndomain of romance. If it is maintained that something has been stolen, the\nthing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond\ndoubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.\n\n\"Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a\nboy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad\ndaylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and with extraordinary,\ntypical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen\nhundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteen\nroubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him.\nMoreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder,\ninformed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the\nnotes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notes\nand coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and\ngenuine confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call\nevidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch the\nmoney, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present case?\nAnd yet it is a question of life and death.\n\n\"Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering money;\nhe was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles--where did he get the\nmoney? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and the\nother half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that money\nwas not the same, and had never been in any envelope. By strict\ncalculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the\nprisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin's without\ngoing home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in\ncompany and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half\nand hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that has led the\nprosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe.\nWhy not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn't this\nsupposition really too fantastic and too romantic? And observe, if that\nsupposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the\nwinds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen\nhundred roubles? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since it's\nproved the prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man's\nlife with such tales!\n\n\"I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen\nhundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money before\nthat night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear and\nunflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have it\nso, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that\nstatement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner.\nThe prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak will, who\nhad brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by\nhis betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up,\nbut would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two days and\ntaken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this,\nyou will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no\ncontradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What if\nyou've been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man?\nThat's just it, you have invented quite a different man!\n\n\"I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day\nall that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the\ncatastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are\nthese witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court\nalready. Besides, in another man's hand a crust always seems larger, and\nno one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at\nsight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty\nthousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two-\nedged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.\n\n\"A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina\nIvanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. But the question\nis: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting and\ndegrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first statement made by the\nyoung lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In the\nsecond statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of\nlong-concealed hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her first\nevidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her second piece\nof evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare\nnot (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch on it\neither, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and high-\nprincipled person, such as that highly respected young lady unquestionably\nis, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in court to\ncontradict her first statement, with the obvious motive of ruining the\nprisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given not impartially,\nnot coolly. Have not we the right to assume that a revengeful woman might\nhave exaggerated much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in particular,\nthe insult and humiliation of her offering him the money. No, it was\noffered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially for a\nman so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive\nshortly from his father the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was\nowing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just his\nirresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that his\nfather would give him the money, that he would get it, and so could always\ndispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt.\n\n\"But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set\naside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That's not his\ncharacter, he tells us, he couldn't have had such feelings. But yet he\ntalked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two\nextremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such\na two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved\nby the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if\nsomething strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is\nlove--that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he\nneeded money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she\nwere to say to him, 'I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,' then he\nmust have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing.\nCould a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was\nsuffering from--what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and\nconcealing it in case of emergency?\n\n\"But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the\nexpected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant\nto use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. 'If Fyodor\nPavlovitch doesn't give the money,' he thought, 'I shall be put in the\nposition of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.' And then the idea presented\nitself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the\nfifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, 'I am a\nscoundrel, but not a thief.' So here we have already a twofold reason why\nhe should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he\nshouldn't unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why\nshould you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of\nhonor, granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often mistaken, yet it\nexists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.\n\n\"But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments reach\na climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and\nmore: 'If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go off\nwith Grushenka?' If he behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the\ntaverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he was\nwretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions\nbecame so acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his\nyounger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles,\nbut without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating the\nold man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect of\ngetting it from any one; his father would not give it him after that\nbeating.\n\n\"The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper part\nof the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother that he\nhad the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would remain a\nscoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means, that he\nwouldn't have the character, that he wouldn't have the will-power to do\nit. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey\nKaramazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously and\nconvincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe in\nmoney hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?\n\n\"The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wrote\nthat fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proof\nof the prisoner having committed robbery! 'I shall beg from every one, and\nif I don't get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope\nwith the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan has\ngone.' A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he.\n'It has all been done as he wrote,' cries the prosecutor.\n\n\"But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written in\ngreat irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he has\nheard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope himself; and\nthirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he did it? Did the\nprisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he find the money,\ndid that money exist indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ran\noff, if you remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out\nwhere she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry\nout a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act\nof premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous\nfury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered him he\nseized the money, too. But did he murder him after all? The charge of\nrobbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery,\nif it's impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; that's an\naxiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is\nthat proved? Isn't that, too, a romance?\"\n\n\n\nChapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either\n\n\n\"Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man's life is at\nstake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor himself\nadmit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and\nconscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal\ndrunken letter which was produced in court to-day. 'All was done as\nwritten.' But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely\nto find out where she was. That's a fact that can't be disputed. Had she\nbeen at home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at her\nside, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ran\nunexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did not\neven remember his drunken letter. 'He snatched up the pestle,' they say,\nand you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that\npestle--why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it\nup, and so on, and so on. A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this\npoint: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on\nthe shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put\naway in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he\nwould have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he would\ncertainly not have killed any one. How then can I look upon the pestle as\na proof of premeditation?\n\n\"Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two days\nbefore, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was quiet and\nonly quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could not\nhelp quarreling, forsooth! But my answer to that is, that, if he was\nplanning such a murder in accordance with his letter, he certainly would\nnot have quarreled even with a shopman, and probably would not have gone\ninto the tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet\nand retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard,\nand that not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,\nthe psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can use it.\nAs for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month, don't we often\nhear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns shout, 'I'll kill you'?\nbut they don't murder any one. And that fatal letter--isn't that simply\ndrunken irritability, too? Isn't that simply the shout of the brawler\noutside the tavern, 'I'll kill you! I'll kill the lot of you!' Why not,\nwhy could it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter 'fatal'\nrather than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because a\nwitness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his\nhand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything was\ndone as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not 'absurd,' but\n'fatal.'\n\n\"Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: 'since he was in the\ngarden, he must have murdered him.' In those few words: 'since he _was_,\nthen he _must_' lies the whole case for the prosecution. He was there, so\nhe must have. And what if there is no _must_ about it, even if he was\nthere? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence--the coincidences--are really\nsuggestive. But examine all these facts separately, regardless of their\nconnection. Why, for instance, does the prosecution refuse to admit the\ntruth of the prisoner's statement that he ran away from his father's\nwindow? Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the\nexpense of the respectful and 'pious' sentiments which suddenly came over\nthe murderer. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of\nreligious awe, if not of filial respect? 'My mother must have been praying\nfor me at that moment,' were the prisoner's words at the preliminary\ninquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced himself that Madame\nSvyetlov was not in his father's house. 'But he could not convince himself\nby looking through the window,' the prosecutor objects. But why couldn't\nhe? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some word\nmight have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which\nshowed the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume\neverything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A\nthousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest\nimagination.\n\n\" 'Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly was in\nthe house, therefore he killed him.' Now about that door, gentlemen of the\njury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that\ndoor, and he was at the time in such a condition, that-- But supposing the\ndoor was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an\ninstinct of self-defense, natural in his position; supposing he did go\ninto the house--well, what then? How does it follow that because he was\nthere he committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through the\nrooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him; but as\nsoon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he may have run\naway rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed his\nfather. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptation\nto kill his father, because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at\nnot having killed him, that he was capable of a pure feeling, the feeling\nof pity and compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to the\nassistance of Grigory after he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.\n\n\"With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful\nstate of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him\ncalling him to new life, while love was impossible for him because he had\nhis father's bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that\ncorpse--retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him love, which he\nexplained, according to his method, talking about his drunken condition,\nabout a criminal being taken to execution, about it being still far off,\nand so on and so on. But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not\ninvented a new personality? Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to\nbe able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape\npunishment, if his hands were really stained with his father's blood? No,\nno, no! As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called\nhim to her side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he must\nhave felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed\nhimself, if he had his father's murder on his conscience. Oh, no! he would\nnot have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the prisoner: the savage,\nstony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with\nhis character. He would have killed himself, that's certain. He did not\nkill himself just because 'his mother's prayers had saved him,' and he was\ninnocent of his father's blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that\nnight at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man\nwould recover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not\nhave to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?\nWhat trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?\n\n\"But we shall be told at once again, 'There is his father's corpse! If he\nran away without murdering him, who did murder him?' Here, I repeat, you\nhave the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he?\nThere's no one to put in his place.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually true\nthat there is no one else at all? We've heard the prosecutor count on his\nfingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were five\nin number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible--the\nmurdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the\nprisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the\nprisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, that\nhad there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would\nhave abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have\naccused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the\nvery opposite conclusion? There are two persons--the prisoner and\nSmerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because\nyou have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you\nhave determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.\n\n\"It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two\nbrothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him: there\nare vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a\nfeeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of\nfacts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first place\nwe have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the\ngenuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to\nmake a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the\ntrial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the\nelder of the prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has\nto-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the\nmurderer. Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's conviction\nthat Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement may\nreally be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother by\nthrowing the guilt on the dead man. But again Smerdyakov's name is\npronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery. There is something\nunexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we\nwon't go into that now. Of that later.\n\n\"The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might\nmake a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with\nsubtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent I\ncannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him and\ntalked to him, and he made a very different impression on me. He was weak\nin health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the\nweak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of\nthe timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity\nabout him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme\nmistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _naivete_, and an intelligence\nof considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for\nweak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the\nconviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively\nambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he\nresented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when\nhe remembered that he was the son of 'stinking Lizaveta.' He was\ndisrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him\nin his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to\nFrance and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn't the\nmeans to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely\nhigh opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good\nclothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be\nthe illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he\nmight well have resented his position, compared with that of his master's\nlegitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights,\nthey had the inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himself\nthat he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. The\ndestination of that sum--a sum which would have made his career--must have\nbeen hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in new\nrainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.) Oh, beware of\nshowing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once! And it\nwas the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man. The\nsight of the rainbow-colored notes may have made a morbid impression on\nhis imagination, but with no immediate results.\n\n\"The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us all\nthe arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov's guilt, and\nasked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit. But he may\nnot have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite naturally,\nbut it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man may have\nrecovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as\nhappens with epileptics.\n\n\"The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the\nmurder. But it is very easy to point out that moment. He might have waked\nup from deep sleep (for he was only asleep--an epileptic fit is always\nfollowed by a deep sleep) at that moment when the old Grigory shouted at\nthe top of his voice 'Parricide!' That shout in the dark and stillness may\nhave waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment:\nhe might naturally have waked up an hour before.\n\n\"Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite\nmotive towards the sound to see what's the matter. His head is still\nclouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in the\ngarden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from\nhis master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind sets to\nwork at once. He hears all the details from his frightened master, and\ngradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an idea--terrible,\nbut seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take the\nthree thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A terrible\nlust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security\nfrom detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often\nwhen there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers who\nhave had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov may\nhave gone in and carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with any\nstone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the\nthree thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting\nmyself--the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where\nto find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money--the\ntorn envelope on the floor?\n\n\"Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only\nan inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the\nfloor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a piece\nof evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearing\nsomething very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that very\nargument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved,\nprecisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself. What's more, it struck\nme at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about\nhim; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy\nit was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same\nidea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?\n\n\"I shall be asked, 'What about the old woman, Grigory's wife? She heard\nthe sick man moaning close by, all night.' Yes, she heard it, but that\nevidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly\nthat she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the poor\nbeast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And that's\nnatural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at\nbeing waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a\ngroan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two\nhours later--three times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeper\nwakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and\nkeeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of two\nhours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments of\nwaking, so he feels he has been waked up all night.\n\n\"But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his last\nletter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both?\nBut, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not have\nfelt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are two very\ndifferent things. Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable, and the\nsuicide, laying his hands on himself, may well have felt redoubled hatred\nfor those whom he had envied all his life.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is there\nunlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the error in my\nreasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And if there is but a\nshade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my propositions, do\nnot condemn him. And is there only a shade? I swear by all that is sacred,\nI fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward.\nWhat troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts\nheaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a single\none certain and irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by\nthe accumulation of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the\nblood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt, the\ndark night resounding with the shout 'Parricide!' and the old man falling\nwith a broken head. And then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures,\nshouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but,\ngentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds? Remember, you have been\ngiven absolute power to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the\nmore terrible its responsibility.\n\n\"I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but suppose\nfor one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had\nstained his hands with his father's blood. This is only hypothesis, I\nrepeat; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence. But, so be it, I\nassume that my client is guilty of parricide. Even so, hear what I have to\nsay. I have it in my heart to say something more to you, for I feel that\nthere must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive my\nreferring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to\nbe truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!\"\n\nAt this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. The last\nwords, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that every\none felt that he really might have something to say, and that what he was\nabout to say would be of the greatest consequence. But the President,\nhearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if\nsuch an incident were repeated. Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch\nbegan in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used\nhitherto.\n\n\n\nChapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought\n\n\n\"It's not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with\nruin, gentlemen of the jury,\" he began, \"what is really damning for my\nclient is one fact--the dead body of his father. Had it been an ordinary\ncase of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the\ntriviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of the\nevidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, you\nwould have hesitated to ruin a man's life simply from the prejudice\nagainst him which he has, alas! only too well deserved. But it's not an\nordinary case of murder, it's a case of parricide. That impresses men's\nminds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of\nthe evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an\nunprejudiced mind. How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he\ncommitted the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one,\nalmost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.\n\n\"Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood--the father who has\nbegotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over my\nillnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness, and\nhas lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a father--that's\ninconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father--a real father? What\nis the meaning of that great word? What is the great idea in that name? We\nhave just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be.\nIn the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our\nhearts are aching--in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch\nKaramazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we\nhave just referred. That's the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are a\nmisfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we must\nshrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the importance of\nthe decision you have to make. It's our particular duty not to shrink from\nany idea, like children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutor\nhappily expresses it.\n\n\"But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent (and he was\nmy opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several times, 'Oh, I will\nnot yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from\nPetersburg. I accuse, but I defend also!' He exclaimed that several times,\nbut forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three\nyears so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who\nhad been kind to him, as a child in his father's house, might not such a\nman well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his father's\nback-yard, 'without boots on his feet and with his little trousers hanging\nby one button'--to use the expression of the kind-hearted doctor,\nHerzenstube?\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at this\nmisfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my client meet\nwith when he arrived here, at his father's house, and why depict my client\nas a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he is wild and\nunruly--we are trying him now for that--but who is responsible for his life?\nWho is responsible for his having received such an unseemly bringing up,\nin spite of his excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitive\nheart? Did any one train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened by\nstudy? Did any one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client was\nleft to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirsted\nperhaps to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand times\nperhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away the loathsome\nphantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he may\nhave longed to embrace and to forgive his father! And what awaited him? He\nwas met by cynical taunts, suspicions and wrangling about money. He heard\nnothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the\nbrandy, and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with\nhis own money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!\nAnd that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of\nhis son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated him, bought\nup his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly, and\nuncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed,\nexceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't express it. Don't laugh, don't\nlaugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at\nmy client for loving Schiller--loving the sublime and beautiful! I should\nnot have laughed at that in his place. Yes, such natures--oh, let me speak\nin defense of such natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood--these\nnatures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in\ncontrast to themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity--they thirst for\nit unconsciously. Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully\ncapable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated\nlove. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in such\nnatures. But they cannot hide their passions--sometimes very coarse--and\nthat is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Their\npassions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and lofty\ncreature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks to\ncorrect himself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, 'sublime and\nbeautiful,' however much the expression has been ridiculed.\n\n\"I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client's\nengagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just now was not\nevidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and it\nwas not for her--oh, not for her!--to reproach him with treachery, for she\nhas betrayed him! If she had had but a little time for reflection she\nwould not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my client\nis not a monster, as she called him!\n\n\"The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: 'I am the Good\nShepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, so that not\none of them might be lost.' Let not a man's soul be lost through us!\n\n\"I asked just now what does 'father' mean, and exclaimed that it was a\ngreat word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly, gentlemen,\nand I venture to call things by their right names: such a father as old\nKaramazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve to be. Filial\nlove for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an impossibility. Love cannot\nbe created from nothing: only God can create something from nothing.\n\n\" 'Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,' the apostle writes, from\na heart glowing with love. It's not for the sake of my client that I quote\nthese sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has authorized me\nto preach to fathers? No one. But as a man and a citizen I make my\nappeal--_vivos voco!_ We are not long on earth, we do many evil deeds and\nsay many evil words. So let us all catch a favorable moment when we are\nall together to say a good word to each other. That's what I am doing:\nwhile I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for\nnothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority--all Russia hears\nus! I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud to\nall fathers: 'Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.' Yes, let us\nfirst fulfill Christ's injunction ourselves and only then venture to\nexpect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of\nour children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have\nmade them our enemies ourselves. 'What measure ye mete it shall be\nmeasured unto you again'--it's not I who say that, it's the Gospel precept,\nmeasure to others according as they measure to you. How can we blame\nchildren if they measure us according to our measure?\n\n\"Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretly\ngiven birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no one knew\nanything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks. It was\nopened and inside was found the body of a new-born child which she had\nkilled. In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies\nwhich, according to her own confession, she had killed at the moment of\ntheir birth.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave birth\nto them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would any one venture to\ngive her the sacred name of mother? Let us be bold, gentlemen, let us be\naudacious even: it's our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid\nof certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who\nare scared at the sound of certain words. No, let us prove that the\nprogress of the last few years has touched even us, and let us say\nplainly, the father is not merely he who begets the child, but he who\nbegets it and does his duty by it.\n\n\"Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other\ninterpretation of the word 'father,' which insists that any father, even\nthough he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children, still\nremains my father simply because he begot me. But this is, so to say, the\nmystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my intellect, but can only\naccept by faith, or, better to say, _on faith_, like many other things\nwhich I do not understand, but which religion bids me believe. But in that\ncase let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of\nactual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us\ngreat duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be\nhumane--Christian, in fact--we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions\njustified by reason and experience, which have been passed through the\ncrucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though\nin dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill-treat\nand ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, but\nrational and philanthropic....\"\n\nThere was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court,\nbut Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him\nfinish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at once. The\norator went on.\n\n\"Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin to\nreason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not impose\non them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy father\ninvoluntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature,\nespecially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his\ncompanions. The conventional answer to this question is: 'He begot you,\nand you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.'\nThe youth involuntarily reflects: 'But did he love me when he begot me?'\nhe asks, wondering more and more. 'Was it for my sake he begot me? He did\nnot know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,\nperhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensity\nto drunkenness--that's all he's done for me.... Why am I bound to love him\nsimply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my life\nafter?'\n\n\"Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do not\nexpect an impossible restraint from a young mind. 'Drive nature out of the\ndoor and it will fly in at the window,' and, above all, let us not be\nafraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates of\nreason and humanity and not of mystic ideas. How shall it be decided? Why,\nlike this. Let the son stand before his father and ask him, 'Father, tell\nme, why must I love you? Father, show me that I must love you,' and if\nthat father is able to answer him and show him good reason, we have a\nreal, normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on\na rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he does\nnot, there's an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him, and the\nson has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even an enemy. Our\ntribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a school of true and sound\nideas.\"\n\n(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic\napplause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of it\napplauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded. Shrieks and\nexclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were sitting.\nHandkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his bell with all\nhis might. He was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience, but\ndid not venture to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons of\nhigh position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially\nreserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their\nhandkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down, the President confined\nhimself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and\nFetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much has\nbeen said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to face\nwith the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist most\nemphatically it was not for money he ran to his father's house: the charge\nof robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not to murder\nhim he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that design he would,\nat least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The\nbrass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it.\nGranted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that\nhe made his way in--I've said already that I do not for a moment believe\nthat legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment. Gentlemen,\nI swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been his father, but an\nordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfying\nhimself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, without\ndoing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him away\nperhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare for\nthat. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, his\nfather! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood,\nhad been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was\nenough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly,\nclouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of\nmadness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and\nunconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its\neternal laws.\n\n\"But the prisoner even then did not murder him--I maintain that, I cry that\naloud!--no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust,\nnot meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he not\nhad this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his father\ndown perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did not\nknow whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder.\nSuch a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot\nbe called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by\nprejudice.\n\n\"But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this\nmurder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and\npunish him, he will say to himself: 'These people have done nothing for my\nbringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make\nme better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat\nand to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they\nhave sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and\nowe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They\nare cruel and I will be cruel.' That is what he will say, gentlemen of the\njury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for\nhim: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and\nwill not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him the\npossibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickedness\nand blindness all his life.\n\n\"But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful\npunishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and\nregenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see,\nyou will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck. 'How can I endure\nthis mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?' That's what\nhe will exclaim.\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen of\nthe jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and loving\naction, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in their\nlimitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with mercy, show\nit love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses in\nit. Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are\ngood and just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse\nand the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say\nthen, 'I am quits,' but will say, 'I am guilty in the sight of all men and\nam more unworthy than all.' With tears of penitence and poignant, tender\nanguish, he will exclaim: 'Others are better than I, they wanted to save\nme, not to ruin me!' Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the\nabsence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to\npronounce: 'Yes, he is guilty.'\n\n\"Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear,\ndo you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious\nhistory? It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that\nthe Russian court does not exist for the punishment only, but also for the\nsalvation of the criminal! Let other nations think of retribution and the\nletter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaning--the\nsalvation and the reformation of the lost. If this is true, if Russia and\nher justice are such, she may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to\nscare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside\nin disgust. Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will\nmove calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my\nclient, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend it,\nyou will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch over it, that\nit is in good hands!\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIV. The Peasants Stand Firm\n\n\nThis was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of the\naudience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the question to\nstop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important\npersonages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringing\nhis bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression\nof something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself\nwas genuinely touched.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain\nobjections. People looked at him with hatred. \"What? What's the meaning of\nit? He positively dares to make objections,\" the ladies babbled. But if\nthe whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could not\nhave been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking with\nemotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,\ncould hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered\nhimself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.\n\n\"... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defense\nif not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.\nFyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelope\nand throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged in\nthis strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we\nthat he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded\nidiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for\nhis illegitimate birth--isn't this a romance in the Byronic style? And the\nson who breaks into his father's house and murders him without murdering\nhim is not even a romance--this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he\ncannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and what's the\nmeaning of his murdering him without having murdered him--who can make head\nor tail of this?\n\n\"Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound\nideas and from this tribune of 'sound ideas' is heard a solemn declaration\nthat to call the murder of a father 'parricide' is nothing but a\nprejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask\nhis father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will become\nof the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,\nit appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants' wives. The most precious,\nthe most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice\nare presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an\nobject--to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.\n'Oh, crush him by mercy,' cries the counsel for the defense; but that's\nall the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is\ncrushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only\nfor the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of\nthe parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?\nReligion and the Gospel are corrected--that's all mysticism, we are told,\nand ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the\nanalysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false\nsemblance of Christ! 'What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you\nagain,' cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that\nChrist teaches us to measure as it is measured to us--and this from the\ntribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve\nof making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance\nwith what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use\nto produce a certain effect--all to serve the purpose! But what Christ\ncommands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,\nbecause the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn\nthe other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to\nus. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to\nmurder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of\ntruth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for\nthe defense deigns to call only 'the crucified lover of humanity,' in\nopposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, 'For Thou art our\nGod!' \"\n\nAt this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,\nbegging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as\npresidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. The\npublic was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.\nFetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to lay\nhis hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full\nof dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on \"romancing\"\nand \"psychology,\" and in an appropriate place quoted, \"Jupiter, you are\nangry, therefore you are wrong,\" which provoked a burst of approving\nlaughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like\nJupiter. Then, _a propos_ of the accusation that he was teaching the young\ngeneration to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with great\ndignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor's charge of\nuttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal\ninsinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from\naccusations \"damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.\"\nBut at these words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch\nconcluded his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.\nAnd Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, \"crushed for\ngood.\"\n\nThen the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said very\nlittle. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look of\nstrength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had\nalmost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through an\nexperience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life\nsomething very important he had not understood till then. His voice was\nweak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of\nhumility, defeat and submission.\n\n\"What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come\nfor me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring man!\nBut, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father's blood! For\nthe last time I repeat, it wasn't I killed him! I was erring, but I loved\nwhat is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild\nbeast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I\ndid not know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is\nmistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but it's not\ntrue that I killed my father, and he needn't have supposed it. And don't\nbelieve the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you\nspare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. I\ngive you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I'll break\nmy sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob\nme of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen\n... spare me!\"\n\nHe almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly\narticulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions\nand began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.\n\nBut I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for\nconsultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the\njury was rather feeble. \"Be impartial, don't be influenced by the\neloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there\nis a great responsibility laid upon you,\" and so on and so on.\n\nThe jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move\nabout, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the\nbuffet. It was very late, almost one o'clock in the night, but nobody went\naway: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All\nwaited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for\nthe ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts\nwere untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all\nprepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must\nown there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an\nacquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while some\nwere simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch\nhimself was confident of his success. He was surrounded by people\ncongratulating him and fawning upon him.\n\n\"There are,\" he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, \"there are\ninvisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury. One\nfeels during one's speech if they are being formed. I was aware of them.\nThey exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.\"\n\n\"What will our peasants say now?\" said one stout, cross-looking, pock-\nmarked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a group of\ngentlemen engaged in conversation.\n\n\"But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks among\nthem.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are clerks,\" said a member of the district council, joining\nthe group.\n\n\"And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?\"\n\n\"What of him?\"\n\n\"He is a man with brains.\"\n\n\"But he never speaks.\"\n\n\"He is no great talker, but so much the better. There's no need for the\nPetersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself. He's\nthe father of twelve children. Think of that!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, you don't suppose they won't acquit him?\" one of our young\nofficials exclaimed in another group.\n\n\"They'll acquit him for certain,\" said a resolute voice.\n\n\"It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!\" cried the\nofficial. \"Suppose he did murder him--there are fathers and fathers! And,\nbesides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done nothing but\nswing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down. But it was a\npity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! If I'd\nbeen in Fetyukovitch's place, I should simply have said straight out: 'He\nmurdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it all!' \"\n\n\"That's what he did, only without saying, 'Hang it all!' \"\n\n\"No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,\" put in a third voice.\n\n\"Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut\nthe throat of her lover's lawful wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference. She began cutting it.\"\n\n\"What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Splendid!\"\n\n\"And about mysticism, too!\"\n\n\"Oh, drop mysticism, do!\" cried some one else; \"think of Ippolit and his\nfate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow for\nMitya's sake.\"\n\n\"Is she here?\"\n\n\"What an idea! If she'd been here she'd have scratched them out in court.\nShe is at home with toothache. He he he!\"\n\n\"He he he!\"\n\nIn a third group:\n\n\"I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised if he turns the 'Metropolis' upside down to-\nmorrow. He will be drinking for ten days!\"\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\"\n\n\"The devil's bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not here?\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it's not the thing to\nbreak your father's head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?\"\n\n\"The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?\"\n\n\"Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!\"\n\n\"And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his\npurpose.\"\n\n\"What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had in\nRussia?\"\n\nBut the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither more\nnor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public\nhad taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.\nAt last! I won't repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I have\nforgotten them. I remember only the answer to the President's first and\nchief question: \"Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of\nrobbery and with premeditation?\" (I don't remember the exact words.) There\nwas a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,\npronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of the\ncourt:\n\n\"Yes, guilty!\"\n\nAnd the same answer was repeated to every question: \"Yes, guilty!\" and\nwithout the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;\nalmost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.\nThe deathlike silence in the court was not broken--all seemed petrified:\nthose who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager for\nhis acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was\nfollowed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were\npleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their\njoy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their\nshoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But how\nshall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they would create\na riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly the\nwhole court rang with exclamations: \"What's the meaning of it? What next?\"\nThey leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at\nonce reconsidered and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up\nand cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before him:\n\n\"I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of my\nfather's blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on the\nother woman!\"\n\nHe could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard\nall over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own. From the\nfarthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek--it was\nGrushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again\nbefore the beginning of the lawyers' speeches. Mitya was taken away. The\npassing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was in\na hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I\nheard on the steps as I went out.\n\n\"He'll have a twenty years' trip to the mines!\"\n\n\"Not less.\"\n\n\"Well, our peasants have stood firm.\"\n\n\"And have done for our Mitya.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\nChapter I. Plans For Mitya's Escape\n\n\nVery early, at nine o'clock in the morning, five days after the trial,\nAlyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna's to talk over a matter of great\nimportance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked\nto him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the\nnext room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina\nIvanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and\nunconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable\ngossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who\nlived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in\ncourt, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna\nwould have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the\nsick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were\nattending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give\nan opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors\nencouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could\nnot yet give them positive hopes of recovery.\n\nAlyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time he had\nspecially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to\napproach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement\nthat could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of\nhaste.\n\nThey had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale\nand terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical\nexcitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to\nher.\n\n\"Don't worry about his decision,\" she said, with confident emphasis to\nAlyosha. \"One way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape.\nThat unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle--not he, not Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has\nsacrificed himself for his brother,\" Katya added, with flashing eyes--\"told\nme the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into\nnegotiations.... I've told you something already.... You see, it will\nprobably come off at the third _etape_ from here, when the party of\nprisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it's a long way off yet. Ivan\nFyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _etape_.\nBut we don't know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it's\nimpossible to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I will\nshow you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the\neve of the trial in case of need.... That was when--do you remember?--you\nfound us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs, but seeing you I made\nhim come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling about\nthen?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had\ntold me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it\nat once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told\nme that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with\nthat creature, I felt furious at once--I can't tell you why, I don't know\nmyself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and\nthat she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\" Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed\nsuddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \"As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw\nthat I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous\nof Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel\nbegan. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I\ncould not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving\nthat ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love\nDmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that\ncreature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you\ncame, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if\nanything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the\nenvelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or was\ntaken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then he left me money,\nnearly ten thousand--those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his\nspeech, having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be changed. I\nwas tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up\nhis idea of saving his brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to\nme, though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved\nMitya. Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness\nof such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his feet\nin reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only for my joy\nat the thought of Mitya's being saved (and he certainly would have\nimagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere possibility of such\nan unjust thought on his part that I lost my temper again, and instead of\nkissing his feet, flew into a fury again! Oh, I am unhappy! It's my\ncharacter, my awful, unhappy character! Oh, you will see, I shall end by\ndriving him, too, to abandon me for another with whom he can get on\nbetter, like Dmitri. But ... no, I could not bear it, I should kill\nmyself. And when you came in then, and when I called to you and told him\nto come back, I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he\nturned on me that--do you remember?--I cried out to you that it was he, he\nalone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I said\nthat malicious thing on purpose to wound him again. He had never, never\npersuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I\nwho persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved\nthe way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he\nwas an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not\nruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the\ncause of it all, I alone am to blame!\"\n\nKatya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that\nshe was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest\nheart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh,\nAlyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had\ncarefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it\nwould have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought\nso low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her\n\"treachery\" at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was\nimpelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries\nand hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and\nlonged to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more\ndifficult. He spoke of Mitya again.\n\n\"It's all right, it's all right, don't be anxious about him!\" she began\nagain, sharply and stubbornly. \"All that is only momentary, I know him, I\nknow his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to escape.\nIt's not as though it would be immediately; he will have time to make up\nhis mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and will\nmanage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it. Don't\nbe anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed already: do you\nsuppose he would give up that creature? And they won't let her go to him,\nso he is bound to escape. It's you he's most afraid of, he is afraid you\nwon't approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously\n_allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,\" Katya added viciously. She\npaused and smiled.\n\n\"He talks about some hymn,\" she went on again, \"some cross he has to bear,\nsome duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal about it, and\nif you knew how he talked!\" Katya cried suddenly, with feeling she could\nnot repress, \"if you knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment he\ntold me, and how he hated him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heard\nhis story and his tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I\nam responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable of\nsuffering,\" Katya concluded irritably. \"Can such a man suffer? Men like\nhim never suffer!\"\n\nThere was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words. And\nyet it was she who had betrayed him. \"Perhaps because she feels how she's\nwronged him she hates him at moments,\" Alyosha thought to himself. He\nhoped that it was only \"at moments.\" In Katya's last words he detected a\nchallenging note, but he did not take it up.\n\n\"I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself.\nOr do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable, cowardly,\nor something ... unchristian, perhaps?\" Katya added, even more defiantly.\n\n\"Oh, no. I'll tell him everything,\" muttered Alyosha. \"He asks you to come\nand see him to-day,\" he blurted out suddenly, looking her steadily in the\nface. She started, and drew back a little from him on the sofa.\n\n\"Me? Can that be?\" she faltered, turning pale.\n\n\"It can and ought to be!\" Alyosha began emphatically, growing more\nanimated. \"He needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened the\nsubject and worried you, if it were not necessary. He is ill, he is beside\nhimself, he keeps asking for you. It is not to be reconciled with you that\nhe wants you, but only that you would go and show yourself at his door. So\nmuch has happened to him since that day. He realizes that he has injured\nyou beyond all reckoning. He does not ask your forgiveness--'It's\nimpossible to forgive me,' he says himself--but only that you would show\nyourself in his doorway.\"\n\n\"It's so sudden....\" faltered Katya. \"I've had a presentiment all these\ndays that you would come with that message. I knew he would ask me to\ncome. It's impossible!\"\n\n\"Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the first\ntime how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never\ngrasped it before so fully. He said, 'If she refuses to come I shall be\nunhappy all my life.' Do you hear? though he is condemned to penal\nservitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy--is not that\npiteous? Think--you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,\"\nbroke like a challenge from Alyosha. \"His hands are clean, there is no\nblood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit\nhim now. Go, greet him on his way into the darkness--stand at his door,\nthat is all.... You ought to do it, you ought to!\" Alyosha concluded,\nlaying immense stress on the word \"ought.\"\n\n\"I ought to ... but I cannot....\" Katya moaned. \"He will look at me.... I\ncan't.\"\n\n\"Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you don't\nmake up your mind to do it now?\"\n\n\"Better suffer all my life.\"\n\n\"You ought to go, you ought to go,\" Alyosha repeated with merciless\nemphasis.\n\n\"But why to-day, why at once?... I can't leave our patient--\"\n\n\"You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don't come, he\nwill be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity on\nhim!\"\n\n\"Have pity on _me!_\" Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst into\ntears.\n\n\"Then you will come,\" said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. \"I'll go and\ntell him you will come directly.\"\n\n\"No, don't tell him so on any account,\" cried Katya in alarm. \"I will\ncome, but don't tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not go\nin.... I don't know yet--\"\n\nHer voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go.\n\n\"And what if I meet any one?\" she said suddenly, in a low voice, turning\nwhite again.\n\n\"That's just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one. There will be\nno one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,\" he\nconcluded emphatically, and went out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes Truth\n\n\nHe hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day after his\nfate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was sent\nto the prison division of the town hospital. But at the request of several\npersons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had put\nMitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one\nwhere Smerdyakov had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at the\nother end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so\nthat Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown, which\nwas not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and compassionate\nyoung man. He knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass at\nonce so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers, and that he\nmust get used to it by degrees. The visits of relations and friends were\ninformally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer, and even by the police\ncaptain. But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had\ntried to force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky\nnot to admit him.\n\nAlyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing-gown, rather\nfeverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his head. He\nlooked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression, but there\nwas a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had become\nterribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be silent for\nhalf an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily and\npainfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused himself from\nhis brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness\nand never of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face\nof suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka\nthan with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but as\nsoon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy.\n\nAlyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was\nwaiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a question.\nHe felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at the\nsame time he felt that if she did not come, something inconceivable would\nhappen. Alyosha understood his feelings.\n\n\"Trifon Borissovitch,\" Mitya began nervously, \"has pulled his whole inn to\npieces, I am told. He's taken up the flooring, pulled apart the planks,\nsplit up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking treasure all the\ntime--the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said I'd hidden\nthere. He began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he got home.\nServe him right, the swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he comes\nfrom there.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" began Alyosha. \"She will come, but I don't know when. Perhaps\nto-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can't tell. But she will come, she\nwill, that's certain.\"\n\nMitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The news had a\ntremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would have liked terribly\nto know what had been said, but he was again afraid to ask. Something\ncruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him like a knife at that\nmoment.\n\n\"This was what she said among other things; that I must be sure to set\nyour conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well by then she\nwill see to it all herself.\"\n\n\"You've spoken of that already,\" Mitya observed musingly.\n\n\"And you have repeated it to Grusha,\" observed Alyosha.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mitya admitted. \"She won't come this morning.\" He looked timidly at\nhis brother. \"She won't come till the evening. When I told her yesterday\nthat Katya was taking measures, she was silent, but she set her mouth. She\nonly whispered, 'Let her!' She understood that it was important. I did not\ndare to try her further. She understands now, I think, that Katya no\nlonger cares for me, but loves Ivan.\"\n\n\"Does she?\" broke from Alyosha.\n\n\"Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,\" Mitya\nhastened to explain again; \"I asked her to do something for me. You know,\nIvan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not us. He will recover.\"\n\n\"Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she scarcely\ndoubts of his recovery,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"That means that she is convinced he will die. It's because she is\nfrightened she's so sure he will get well.\"\n\n\"Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there's every hope\nthat he will get well,\" Alyosha observed anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die. She has a\ngreat deal of sorrow to bear...\" A silence followed. A grave anxiety was\nfretting Mitya.\n\n\"Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,\" he said suddenly in a shaking voice,\nfull of tears.\n\n\"They won't let her go out there to you,\" Alyosha put in at once.\n\n\"And there is something else I wanted to tell you,\" Mitya went on, with a\nsudden ring in his voice. \"If they beat me on the way or out there, I\nwon't submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it. And\nthis will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as it is.\nI've been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself. I am not\nready! I am not able to resign myself. I wanted to sing a 'hymn'; but if a\nguard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it. For Grusha\nI would bear anything ... anything except blows.... But she won't be\nallowed to come there.\"\n\nAlyosha smiled gently.\n\n\"Listen, brother, once for all,\" he said. \"This is what I think about it.\nAnd you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not ready,\nand such a cross is not for you. What's more, you don't need such a\nmartyr's cross when you are not ready for it. If you had murdered our\nfather, it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment. But you\nare innocent, and such a cross is too much for you. You wanted to make\nyourself another man by suffering. I say, only remember that other man\nalways, all your life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for\nyou. Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all\nyour life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more to\nmake you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For there you would\nnot endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would say: 'I am\nquits.' The lawyer was right about that. Such heavy burdens are not for\nall men. For some they are impossible. These are my thoughts about it, if\nyou want them so much. If other men would have to answer for your escape,\nofficers or soldiers, then I would not have 'allowed' you,\" smiled\nAlyosha. \"But they declare--the superintendent of that _etape_ told Ivan\nhimself--that if it's well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that\nthey can get off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a\ncase, but I can't undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya\ncommissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes. I must\ntell you the truth. And so I can't judge of your own action. But let me\nassure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would be a strange thing\nif I could judge you in this. Now I think I've gone into everything.\"\n\n\"But I do condemn myself!\" cried Mitya. \"I shall escape, that was settled\napart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away? But I\nshall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That's how the\nJesuits talk, isn't it? Just as we are doing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Alyosha smiled gently.\n\n\"I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything,\"\ncried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. \"So I've caught my Alyosha being\nJesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest; I'll open\nthe other side of my heart to you. This is what I planned and decided. If\nI run away, even with money and a passport, and even to America, I should\nbe cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, not\nfor happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is as\nbad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already. Even though\nGrusha will be with me. Just look at her; is she an American? She is\nRussian, Russian to the marrow of her bones; she will be homesick for the\nmother country, and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for my\nsake, that she has taken up that cross for me. And what harm has she done?\nAnd how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out there, though they may be\nbetter than I, every one of them? I hate that America already! And though\nthey may be wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are\nnot of my soul. I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I\nam a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there!\" he exclaimed, his eyes\nsuddenly flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. \"So this is what\nI've decided, Alyosha, listen,\" he began again, mastering his emotion. \"As\nsoon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on the\nland, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears. There must be\nsome remote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there,\nsomewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to the country of the _Last of\nthe Mohicans_, and there we'll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I.\nWork and grammar--that's how we'll spend three years. And by that time we\nshall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we've learnt\nit--good-by to America! We'll run here to Russia as American citizens.\nDon't be uneasy--we would not come to this little town. We'd hide\nsomewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall be\nchanged by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors shall\nmake me some sort of wart on my face--what's the use of their being so\nmechanical!--or else I'll put out one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and I\nshall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say they won't recognize us.\nAnd if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I don't care. It will show\nit's our fate. We'll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds,\nand I'll make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our own\nsoil. That's my plan, and it shan't be altered. Do you approve?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for a\nminute and said suddenly:\n\n\"And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn't they work it up!\"\n\n\"If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,\" said\nAlyosha, with a sigh.\n\n\"Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it's hard,\" Mitya\nmoaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.\n\n\"Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!\" he exclaimed suddenly. \"Tell\nme, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she say\nit?\"\n\n\"She said she would come, but I don't know whether she will come to-day.\nIt's hard for her, you know,\" Alyosha looked timidly at his brother.\n\n\"I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of my\nmind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my heart:\nwhat is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It's the\nheadstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a\nscoundrel, that's all one can say.\"\n\n\"Here she is!\" cried Alyosha.\n\nAt that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood\nstill, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt impulsively to\nhis feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale, but a\ntimid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with an\nirresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it, she flew\nimpetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and almost by force made\nhim sit down on the bed. She sat down beside him, and still keeping his\nhands pressed them violently. Several times they both strove to speak, but\nstopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes\nfastened on one another. So passed two minutes.\n\n\"Have you forgiven me?\" Mitya faltered at last, and at the same moment\nturning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried, \"Do you hear what\nI am asking, do you hear?\"\n\n\"That's what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!\" broke from\nKatya. \"My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether you\nforgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and I in\nyours--so it must be....\" She stopped to take breath. \"What have I come\nfor?\" she began again with nervous haste: \"to embrace your feet, to press\nyour hands like this, till it hurts--you remember how in Moscow I used to\nsqueeze them--to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you\nthat I love you madly,\" she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his\nhand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha stood\nspeechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was seeing.\n\n\"Love is over, Mitya!\" Katya began again, \"but the past is painfully dear\nto me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have been\ncome true for one minute,\" she faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into\nhis face joyfully again. \"You love another woman, and I love another man,\nand yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that?\nDo you hear? Love me, love me all your life!\" she cried, with a quiver\nalmost of menace in her voice.\n\n\"I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,\" Mitya began, drawing a\ndeep breath at each word, \"do you know, five days ago, that same evening,\nI loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life!\nSo it will be, so it will always be--\"\n\nSo they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhaps\nnot even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believed\nwhat they said implicitly.\n\n\"Katya,\" cried Mitya suddenly, \"do you believe I murdered him? I know you\ndon't believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence.... Surely,\nsurely you did not believe it!\"\n\n\"I did not believe it even then. I've never believed it. I hated you, and\nfor a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuaded\nmyself and believed it, but when I'd finished speaking I left off\nbelieving it at once. Don't doubt that! I have forgotten that I came here\nto punish myself,\" she said, with a new expression in her voice, quite\nunlike the loving tones of a moment before.\n\n\"Woman, yours is a heavy burden,\" broke, as it were, involuntarily from\nMitya.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she whispered. \"I'll come again. It's more than I can bear\nnow.\"\n\nShe was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and\nstaggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room.\nNo one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she\nreached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and\nmoaned softly, almost in a whisper:\n\n\"Forgive me!\"\n\nGrushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,\nvenomous voice, answered:\n\n\"We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As\nthough we could forgive one another! Save him, and I'll worship you all my\nlife.\"\n\n\"You won't forgive her!\" cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.\n\n\"Don't be anxious, I'll save him for you!\" Katya whispered rapidly, and\nshe ran out of the room.\n\n\"And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness\nherself?\" Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.\n\n\"Mitya, don't dare to blame her; you have no right to!\" Alyosha cried\nhotly.\n\n\"Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,\" Grushenka brought out in a tone of\ndisgust. \"If she saves you I'll forgive her everything--\"\n\nShe stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yet\nrecover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally,\nwith no suspicion of what she would meet.\n\n\"Alyosha, run after her!\" Mitya cried to his brother; \"tell her ... I\ndon't know ... don't let her go away like this!\"\n\n\"I'll come to you again at nightfall,\" said Alyosha, and he ran after\nKatya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast,\nbut as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly:\n\n\"No, before that woman I can't punish myself! I asked her forgiveness\nbecause I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive\nme.... I like her for that!\" she added, in an unnatural voice, and her\neyes flashed with fierce resentment.\n\n\"My brother did not expect this in the least,\" muttered Alyosha. \"He was\nsure she would not come--\"\n\n\"No doubt. Let us leave that,\" she snapped. \"Listen: I can't go with you\nto the funeral now. I've sent them flowers. I think they still have money.\nIf necessary, tell them I'll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave\nme, please. You are late as it is--the bells are ringing for the\nservice.... Leave me, please!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter III. Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech At The Stone\n\n\nHe really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to\nbear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him. It\nwas the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was\nsentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the\nboys, Ilusha's schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him\nand were glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,\nthey all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. \"Father\nwill cry, be with father,\" Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the\nboys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.\n\n\"How glad I am you've come, Karamazov!\" he cried, holding out his hand to\nAlyosha. \"It's awful here. It's really horrible to see it. Snegiryov is\nnot drunk, we know for a fact he's had nothing to drink to-day, but he\nseems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful.\nKaramazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?\"\n\n\"What is it, Kolya?\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or was\nit the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven't slept for the last four\nnights for thinking of it.\"\n\n\"The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,\" answered Alyosha.\n\n\"That's what I said,\" cried Smurov.\n\n\"So he will perish an innocent victim!\" exclaimed Kolya; \"though he is\nruined he is happy! I could envy him!\"\n\n\"What do you mean? How can you? Why?\" cried Alyosha surprised.\n\n\"Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!\" said Kolya\nwith enthusiasm.\n\n\"But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!\" said\nAlyosha.\n\n\"Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for disgrace,\nI don't care about that--our names may perish. I respect your brother!\"\n\n\"And so do I!\" the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had founded\nTroy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his ears like\na peony as he had done on that occasion.\n\nAlyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and his eyes\nclosed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His thin face was\nhardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of decay from\nthe corpse. The expression of his face was serious and, as it were,\nthoughtful. His hands, crossed over his breast, looked particularly\nbeautiful, as though chiseled in marble. There were flowers in his hands\nand the coffin, inside and out, was decked with flowers, which had been\nsent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too\nfrom Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had\na bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear\nboy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not look\nat any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, \"mamma,\" who kept trying to\nstand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had\nbeen pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat with\nher head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly weeping.\nSnegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There was\nsomething crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him. \"Old\nman, dear old man!\" he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was\nhis habit to call Ilusha \"old man,\" as a term of affection when he was\nalive.\n\n\"Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his hand and\ngive it me,\" the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either because the\nlittle white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her fancy or that she wanted\none from his hand to keep in memory of him, she moved restlessly,\nstretching out her hands for the flower.\n\n\"I won't give it to any one, I won't give you anything,\" Snegiryov cried\ncallously. \"They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is his, nothing is\nyours!\"\n\n\"Father, give mother a flower!\" said Nina, lifting her face wet with\ntears.\n\n\"I won't give away anything and to her less than any one! She didn't love\nIlusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it to her,\" the\ncaptain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given up his\ncannon to his mother. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in noiseless\ntears, hiding her face in her hands.\n\nThe boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that it\nwas time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began to\nlift it up.\n\n\"I don't want him to be buried in the churchyard,\" Snegiryov wailed\nsuddenly; \"I'll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha told me to. I\nwon't let him be carried out!\"\n\nHe had been saying for the last three days that he would bury him by the\nstone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all the boys\ninterfered.\n\n\"What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had hanged\nhimself!\" the old landlady said sternly. \"There in the churchyard the\nground has been crossed. He'll be prayed for there. One can hear the\nsinging in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it\nwill reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave.\"\n\nAt last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, \"Take him\nwhere you will.\" The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed the\nmother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might say good-\nby to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little face, which for the last\nthree days she had only looked at from a distance, she trembled all over\nand her gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin.\n\n\"Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your blessing, kiss\nhim,\" Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched like an automaton and\nwith a face contorted with bitter grief she began, without a word, beating\nher breast with her fist. They carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed\nher lips to her brother's for the last time as they bore the coffin by\nher. As Alyosha went out of the house he begged the landlady to look after\nthose who were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had\nfinished.\n\n\"To be sure, I'll stay with them, we are Christians, too.\" The old woman\nwept as she said it.\n\nThey had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than three\nhundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost. The church\nbells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the\ncoffin, in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare and his soft,\nold, wide-brimmed hat in his hand. He seemed in a state of bewildered\nanxiety. At one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head of\nthe coffin and only hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and\ntried to find a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he\nrushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the\nloss of that flower.\n\n\"And the crust of bread, we've forgotten the crust!\" he cried suddenly in\ndismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust of\nbread already and that it was in his pocket. He instantly pulled it out\nand was reassured.\n\n\"Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,\" he explained at once to Alyosha. \"I was\nsitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: 'Father, when my grave\nis filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly\ndown, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone.' \"\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" said Alyosha, \"we must often take some.\"\n\n\"Every day, every day!\" said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at the\nthought.\n\nThey reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it.\nThe boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all through\nthe service. It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons were\nwithout settings; but such churches are the best for praying in. During\nthe mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had\noutbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At\none moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the\nwreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it\nand was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood\nquietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity.\nAfter the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing\nbeside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not\nexplain what he meant. During the prayer, \"Like the Cherubim,\" he joined\nin the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he\npressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.\n\nAt last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The\ndistracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and\nimpressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly\nto shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at\nfirst to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking\nleave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as\nthough he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and\npersistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in\npersuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively\nstretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He\nlooked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he\napparently forgot his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink into\nbrooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to\nthe grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church,\nKaterina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary rites the grave-\ndiggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his flowers in his hands bent\ndown so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coat in\nalarm and pulled him back. He did not seem to understand fully what was\nhappening. When they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed\nanxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no\none could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he was\nreminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited,\nsnatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the\nmorsels on the grave.\n\n\"Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!\" he muttered anxiously.\n\nOne of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the bread\nwith the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to some\none to hold for a time. But he would not do this and seemed indeed\nsuddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they wanted to take them from\nhim altogether. And after looking at the grave, and as it were, satisfying\nhimself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled, he\nsuddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and\nmade his way homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he\nalmost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.\n\n\"The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind to\nmamma,\" he began exclaiming suddenly.\n\nSome one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he flung the\nhat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating, \"I won't have\nthe hat, I won't have the hat.\" Smurov picked it up and carried it after\nhim. All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy who discovered about\nTroy most of all. Though Smurov, with the captain's hat in his hand, was\ncrying bitterly too, he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red\nbrick that lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of\nsparrows that was flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying\nas he ran. Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a\nminute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the\nchurch, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly overtook\nhim and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell helpless on the snow\nas though he had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing,\nhe began crying out, \"Ilusha, old man, dear old man!\" Alyosha and Kolya\ntried to make him get up, soothing and persuading him.\n\n\"Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,\" muttered Kolya.\n\n\"You'll spoil the flowers,\" said Alyosha, \"and mamma is expecting them,\nshe is sitting crying because you would not give her any before. Ilusha's\nlittle bed is still there--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, mamma!\" Snegiryov suddenly recollected, \"they'll take away the\nbed, they'll take it away,\" he added as though alarmed that they really\nwould. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far off and\nthey all arrived together. Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called\nto his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just before:\n\n\"Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,\" he\ncried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen\nand broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that instant he saw\nin the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha's little boots, which the\nlandlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old, patched, rusty-\nlooking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them, fell on his\nknees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his lips to it, began kissing it\ngreedily, crying, \"Ilusha, old man, dear old man, where are your little\nfeet?\"\n\n\"Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?\" the lunatic\ncried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran out\nof the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out.\n\n\"Let them weep,\" he said to Kolya, \"it's no use trying to comfort them\njust now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.\"\n\n\"No, it's no use, it's awful,\" Kolya assented. \"Do you know, Karamazov,\"\nhe dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, \"I feel dreadfully\nsad, and if it were only possible to bring him back, I'd give anything in\nthe world to do it.\"\n\n\"Ah, so would I,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to-night?\nHe'll be drunk, you know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to\nspend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come together\nwe shall remind them of everything again,\" Alyosha suggested.\n\n\"The landlady is laying the table for them now--there'll be a funeral\ndinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it,\nKaramazov?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Alyosha.\n\n\"It's all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it,\nit all seems so unnatural in our religion.\"\n\n\"They are going to have salmon, too,\" the boy who had discovered about\nTroy observed in a loud voice.\n\n\"I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your\nidiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn't\ncare to know whether you exist or not!\" Kolya snapped out irritably. The\nboy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.\n\nMeantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov\nexclaimed:\n\n\"There's Ilusha's stone, under which they wanted to bury him.\"\n\nThey all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the whole\npicture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha,\nweeping and hugging his father, had cried, \"Father, father, how he\ninsulted you,\" rose at once before his imagination.\n\nA sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and earnest\nexpression he looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant faces of\nIlusha's schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:\n\n\"Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.\"\n\nThe boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes\nupon him.\n\n\"Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two brothers,\nof whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death's door.\nBut soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long time, so we shall\npart. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha's stone, that we will never\nforget Ilusha and one another. And whatever happens to us later in life,\nif we don't meet for twenty years afterwards, let us always remember how\nwe buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, by\nthe bridge? and afterwards we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine boy,\na kind-hearted, brave boy, he felt for his father's honor and resented the\ncruel insult to him and stood up for him. And so in the first place, we\nwill remember him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied with\nmost important things, if we attain to honor or fall into great\nmisfortune--still let us remember how good it was once here, when we were\nall together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for the\ntime we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we are. My little\ndoves--let me call you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blue\nbirds, at this minute as I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,\nperhaps you won't understand what I am saying to you, because I often\nspeak very unintelligibly, but you'll remember it all the same and will\nagree with my words some time. You must know that there is nothing higher\nand stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some\ngood memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you\na great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved\nfrom childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such\nmemories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one\nhas only one good memory left in one's heart, even that may sometime be\nthe means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may be\nunable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men's tears and at those\npeople who say as Kolya did just now, 'I want to suffer for all men,' and\nmay even jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we may\nbecome--which God forbid--yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how we\nloved him in his last days, and how we have been talking like friends all\ntogether, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us--if we do\nbecome so--will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at\nthis moment! What's more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from great\nevil and he will reflect and say, 'Yes, I was good and brave and honest\nthen!' Let him laugh to himself, that's no matter, a man often laughs at\nwhat's good and kind. That's only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you,\nboys, that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, 'No, I do wrong\nto laugh, for that's not a thing to laugh at.' \"\n\n\"That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!\" cried Kolya, with flashing\neyes.\n\nThe boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but they\nrestrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker.\n\n\"I say this in case we become bad,\" Alyosha went on, \"but there's no\nreason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be, first and\nabove all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other! I\nsay that again. I give you my word for my part that I'll never forget one\nof you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty\nyears. Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know\nwhether he exists or not. But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and\nthat he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of\nTroy, but is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys,\nmy dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave\nand generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when he\nis grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as\nKartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all dear to me,\nboys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart for you all, and I\nbeg you to keep a place in your hearts for me! Well, and who has united us\nin this kind, good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember\nall our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to\nus for ever! Let us never forget him. May his memory live for ever in our\nhearts from this time forth!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!\" the boys cried in their ringing voices,\nwith softened faces.\n\n\"Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots, his\ncoffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he stood up for him\nalone against the whole school.\"\n\n\"We will remember, we will remember,\" cried the boys. \"He was brave, he\nwas good!\"\n\n\"Ah, how I loved him!\" exclaimed Kolya.\n\n\"Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life! How good life is\nwhen one does something good and just!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the boys repeated enthusiastically.\n\n\"Karamazov, we love you!\" a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried\nimpulsively.\n\n\"We love you, we love you!\" they all caught it up. There were tears in the\neyes of many of them.\n\n\"Hurrah for Karamazov!\" Kolya shouted ecstatically.\n\n\"And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!\" Alyosha added again with\nfeeling.\n\n\"For ever!\" the boys chimed in again.\n\n\"Karamazov,\" cried Kolya, \"can it be true what's taught us in religion,\nthat we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each\nother again, all, Ilusha too?\"\n\n\"Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other and\nshall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!\"\nAlyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.\n\n\"Ah, how splendid it will be!\" broke from Kolya.\n\n\"Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner. Don't be\nput out at our eating pancakes--it's a very old custom and there's\nsomething nice in that!\" laughed Alyosha. \"Well, let us go! And now we go\nhand in hand.\"\n\n\"And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!\" Kolya\ncried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up his\nexclamation: \"Hurrah for Karamazov!\"\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n    1 In Russian, \"silen.\"\n\n    2 A proverbial expression in Russia.\n\n    3 Grushenka.\n\n    4 i.e. setter dog.\n\n    5 Probably the public event was the Decabrist plot against the Tsar,\n      of December 1825, in which the most distinguished men in Russia were\n      concerned.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\n\n    6 When a monk's body is carried out from the cell to the church and\n      from the church to the graveyard, the canticle \"What earthly joy...\"\n      is sung.
