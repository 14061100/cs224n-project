{"summary": "As the story opens, the banker recalls the occasion of the bet fifteen years before. Guests at the party that he was hosting that day fell into a discussion of capital punishment; the banker argued that capital punishment is more humane than life imprisonment, while the young lawyer disagreed, insisting that he would choose life in prison rather than death. They agree to a bet of two million rubles that the lawyer cannot spend fifteen years in solitary confinement. The bet was on, and the lawyer cast himself into isolation for fifteen years.\nThe man spends his time in confinement reading books, writing, playing piano, studying, drinking wine, and educating himself. We find him continuously growing throughout the story. We see various phases in his term of imprisonment over the years. At first, the lawyer suffered from severe loneliness and depression. But soon began studying vigorously. He begins with languages and other related subjects. Then, a mix of science, literature, philosophy and other seemingly random subjects. He ends up reading some six hundred volumes in the course of four years. Then, the Gospel followed by theology and histories of religion. In the final two years, the imprisoned lawyer read immensely on chemistry, medicine and philosophy, and sometimes works of Byron or Shakespeare.\nIn the meantime, the banker's fortune declines and he realizes that if he loses, paying off the bet will leave him bankrupt.\nThe day before the fifteen-year period concludes, the banker resolves to kill the lawyer so as to not owe him the money. On his way to do so, however, the banker finds a note written by the lawyer. The note declares that in his time in confinement he has learned to despise material goods as fleeting things and he believes that knowledge is worth more than money. To this end he elects to renounce the reward of the bet. The banker was moved and shocked to his bones after reading the note, kisses the strange man on the head and leaves the lodge weeping, relieved not to have to kill anyone. The prison warden later reports that the lawyer has left the guest house, thus losing the bet and unwittingly saving his own life.\n\n", "full_text": "Online Distributed Proofreaders Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: ANTON P.

It is some such joy\nthat the man who truly loves the noblest in letters feels when tasting\nfor the first time the simple delights of Russian literature. French\nand English and German authors, too, occasionally, offer works of\nlofty, simple naturalness; but the very keynote to the whole of\nRussian literature is simplicity, naturalness, veraciousness.\n\nAnother essentially Russian trait is the quite unaffected conception\nthat the lowly are on a plane of equality with the so-called upper\nclasses. When the Englishman Dickens wrote with his profound pity and\nunderstanding of the poor, there was yet a bit; of remoteness,\nperhaps, even, a bit of caricature, in his treatment of them. He\nshowed their sufferings to the rest of the world with a \"Behold how\nthe other half lives!\" The Russian writes of the poor, as it were,\nfrom within, as one of them, with no eye to theatrical effect upon the\nwell-to-do. There is no insistence upon peculiar virtues or vices. The\npoor are portrayed just as they are, as human beings like the rest of\nus. A democratic spirit is reflected, breathing a broad humanity, a\ntrue universality, an unstudied generosity that proceed not from the\nintellectual conviction that to understand all is to forgive all, but\nfrom an instinctive feeling that no man has the right to set himself\nup as a judge over another, that one can only observe and record.\n\nIn 1834 two short stories appeared, _The Queen of Spades_, by Pushkin,\nand _The Cloak_, by Gogol. The first was a finishing-off of the old,\noutgoing style of romanticism, the other was the beginning of the new,\nthe characteristically Russian style. We read Pushkin's _Queen of\nSpades_, the first story in the volume, and the likelihood is we shall\nenjoy it greatly. \"But why is it Russian?\" we ask. The answer is, \"It\nis not Russian.\" It might have been printed in an American magazine\nover the name of John Brown. But, now, take the very next story in the\nvolume, _The Cloak_. \"Ah,\" you exclaim, \"a genuine Russian story,\nSurely. You cannot palm it off on me over the name of Jones or Smith.\"\nWhy? Because _The Cloak_ for the first time strikes that truly Russian\nnote of deep sympathy with the disinherited. It is not yet wholly free\nfrom artificiality, and so is not yet typical of the purely realistic\nfiction that reached its perfected development in Turgenev and\nTolstoy.\n\nThough Pushkin heads the list of those writers who made the literature\nof their country world-famous, he was still a romanticist, in the\nuniversal literary fashion of his day. However, he already gave strong\nindication of the peculiarly Russian genius for naturalness or\nrealism, and was a true Russian in his simplicity of style. In no\nsense an innovator, but taking the cue for his poetry from Byron and\nfor his prose from the romanticism current at that period, he was not\nin advance of his age. He had a revolutionary streak in his nature, as\nhis _Ode to Liberty_ and other bits of verse and his intimacy with the\nDecembrist rebels show. But his youthful fire soon died down, and he\nfound it possible to accommodate himself to the life of a Russian high\nfunctionary and courtier under the severe despot Nicholas I, though,\nto be sure, he always hated that life. For all his flirting with\nrevolutionarism, he never displayed great originality or depth of\nthought. He was simply an extraordinarily gifted author, a perfect\nversifier, a wondrous lyrist, and a delicious raconteur, endowed with\na grace, ease and power of expression that delighted even the exacting\nartistic sense of Turgenev. To him aptly applies the dictum of\nSocrates: \"Not by wisdom do the poets write poetry, but by a sort of\ngenius and inspiration.\" I do not mean to convey that as a thinker\nPushkin is to be despised. Nevertheless, it is true that he would\noccupy a lower position in literature did his reputation depend upon\nhis contributions to thought and not upon his value as an artist.\n\n\"We are all descended from Gogol's _Cloak_,\" said a Russian writer.\nAnd Dostoyevsky's novel, _Poor People_, which appeared ten years\nlater, is, in a way, merely an extension of Gogol's shorter tale. In\nDostoyevsky, indeed, the passion for the common people and the\nall-embracing, all-penetrating pity for suffering humanity reach their\nclimax. He was a profound psychologist and delved deeply into the\nhuman soul, especially in its abnormal and diseased aspects. Between\nscenes of heart-rending, abject poverty, injustice, and wrong, and the\ntorments of mental pathology, he managed almost to exhaust the whole\nrange of human woe. And he analysed this misery with an intensity of\nfeeling and a painstaking regard for the most harrowing details that\nare quite upsetting to normally constituted nerves. Yet all the\nhorrors must be forgiven him because of the motive inspiring them--an\noverpowering love and the desire to induce an equal love in others. It\nis not horror for horror's sake, not a literary _tour de force_, as in\nPoe, but horror for a high purpose, for purification through\nsuffering, which was one of the articles of Dostoyevsky's faith.\n\nFollowing as a corollary from the love and pity for mankind that make\na leading element in Russian literature, is a passionate search for\nthe means of improving the lot of humanity, a fervent attachment to\nsocial ideas and ideals. A Russian author is more ardently devoted to\na cause than an American short-story writer to a plot. This, in turn,\nis but a reflection of the spirit of the Russian people, especially of\nthe intellectuals. The Russians take literature perhaps more seriously\nthan any other nation. To them books are not a mere diversion. They\ndemand that fiction and poetry be a true mirror of life and be of\nservice to life. A Russian author, to achieve the highest recognition,\nmust be a thinker also. He need not necessarily be a finished artist.\nEverything is subordinated to two main requirements--humanitarian\nideals and fidelity to life. This is the secret of the marvellous\nsimplicity of Russian-literary art. Before the supreme function of\nliterature, the Russian writer stands awed and humbled. He knows he\ncannot cover up poverty of thought, poverty of spirit and lack of\nsincerity by rhetorical tricks or verbal cleverness. And if he\npossesses the two essential requirements, the simplest language will\nsuffice.\n\nThese qualities are exemplified at their best by Turgenev and Tolstoy.\nThey both had a strong social consciousness; they both grappled with\nthe problems of human welfare; they were both artists in the larger\nsense, that is, in their truthful representation of life, Turgenev was\nan artist also in the narrower sense--in a keen appreciation Of form.\nThoroughly Occidental in his tastes, he sought the regeneration of\nRussia in radical progress along the lines of European democracy.\nTolstoy, on the other hand, sought the salvation of mankind in a\nreturn to the primitive life and primitive Christian religion.\n\nThe very first work of importance by Turgenev, _A Sportsman's\nSketches_, dealt with the question of serfdom, and it wielded\ntremendous influence in bringing about its abolition. Almost every\nsucceeding book of his, from _Rudin_ through _Fathers and Sons_ to\n_Virgin Soil_, presented vivid pictures of contemporary Russian\nsociety, with its problems, the clash of ideas between the old and the\nnew generations, and the struggles, the aspirations and the thoughts\nthat engrossed the advanced youth of Russia; so that his collected\nworks form a remarkable literary record of the successive movements of\nRussian society in a period of preparation, fraught with epochal\nsignificance, which culminated in the overthrow of Czarism and the\ninauguration of a new and true democracy, marking the beginning,\nperhaps, of a radical transformation the world over.\n\n\"The greatest writer of Russia.\" That is Turgenev's estimate of\nTolstoy. \"A second Shakespeare!\" was Flaubert's enthusiastic outburst.\nThe Frenchman's comparison is not wholly illuminating. The one point\nof resemblance between the two authors is simply in the tremendous\nmagnitude of their genius. Each is a Colossus. Each creates a whole\nworld of characters, from kings and princes and ladies to servants and\nmaids and peasants. But how vastly divergent the angle of approach!\nAnna Karenina may have all the subtle womanly charm of an Olivia or a\nPortia, but how different her trials. Shakespeare could not have\ntreated Anna's problems at all. Anna could not have appeared in his\npages except as a sinning Gertrude, the mother of Hamlet. Shakespeare\nhad all the prejudices of his age. He accepted the world as it is with\nits absurd moralities, its conventions and institutions and social\nclasses. A gravedigger is naturally inferior to a lord, and if he is\nto be presented at all, he must come on as a clown. The people are\nalways a mob, the rabble. Tolstoy, is the revolutionist, the\niconoclast. He has the completest independence of mind. He utterly\nrefuses to accept established opinions just because they are\nestablished. He probes into the right and wrong of things. His is a\nbroad, generous universal democracy, his is a comprehensive sympathy,\nhis an absolute incapacity to evaluate human beings according to\nstation, rank or profession, or any standard but that of spiritual\nworth. In all this he was a complete contrast to Shakespeare. Each of\nthe two men was like a creature of a higher world, possessed of\nsupernatural endowments. Their omniscience of all things human, their\ninsight into the hiddenmost springs of men's actions appear\nmiraculous. But Shakespeare makes the impression of detachment from\nhis works. The works do not reveal the man; while in Tolstoy the\ngreatness of the man blends with the greatness of the genius. Tolstoy\nwas no mere oracle uttering profundities he wot not of. As the social,\nreligious and moral tracts that he wrote in the latter period of his\nlife are instinct with a literary beauty of which he never could\ndivest himself, and which gave an artistic value even to his sermons,\nso his earlier novels show a profound concern for the welfare of\nsociety, a broad, humanitarian spirit, a bigness of soul that included\nprince and pauper alike.\n\nIs this extravagant praise? Then let me echo William Dean Howells: \"I\nknow very well that I do not speak of Tolstoy's books in measured\nterms; I cannot.\"\n\nThe Russian writers so far considered have made valuable contributions\nto the short story; but, with the exception of Pushkin, whose\nreputation rests chiefly upon his poetry, their best work, generally,\nwas in the field of the long novel. It was the novel that gave Russian\nliterature its pre-eminence. It could not have been otherwise, since\nRussia is young as a literary nation, and did not come of age until\nthe period at which the novel was almost the only form of literature\nthat counted. If, therefore, Russia was to gain distinction in the\nworld of letters, it could be only through the novel. Of the measure\nof her success there is perhaps no better testimony than the words of\nMatthew Arnold, a critic certainly not given to overstatement. \"The\nRussian novel,\" he wrote in 1887, \"has now the vogue, and deserves to\nhave it... The Russian novelist is master of a spell to which the\nsecret of human nature--both what is external and internal, gesture\nand manner no less than thought and feeling--willingly make themselves\nknown... In that form of imaginative literature, which in our day is\nthe most popular and the most possible, the Russians at the present\nmoment seem to me to hold the field.\"\n\nWith the strict censorship imposed on Russian writers, many of them\nwho might perhaps have contented themselves with expressing their\nopinions in essays, were driven to conceal their meaning under the\nguise of satire or allegory; which gave rise to a peculiar genre of\nliterature, a sort of editorial or essay done into fiction, in which\nthe satirist Saltykov, a contemporary of Turgenev and Dostoyevsky, who\nwrote under the pseudonym of Shchedrin, achieved the greatest success\nand popularity.\n\nIt was not however, until the concluding quarter of the last century\nthat writers like Korolenko and Garshin arose, who devoted themselves\nchiefly to the cultivation of the short story. With Anton Chekhov the\nshort story assumed a position of importance alongside the larger\nworks of the great Russian masters. Gorky and Andreyev made the short\nstory do the same service for the active revolutionary period in the\nlast decade of the nineteenth century down to its temporary defeat in\n1906 that Turgenev rendered in his series of larger novels for the\nperiod of preparation. But very different was the voice of Gorky, the\nman sprung from the people, the embodiment of all the accumulated\nwrath and indignation of centuries of social wrong and oppression,\nfrom the gentlemanly tones of the cultured artist Turgenev. Like a\nmighty hammer his blows fell upon the decaying fabric of the old\nsociety. His was no longer a feeble, despairing protest. With the\nstrength and confidence of victory he made onslaught upon onslaught on\nthe old institutions until they shook and almost tumbled. And when\nreaction celebrated its short-lived triumph and gloom settled again\nupon his country and most of his co-fighters withdrew from the battle\nin despair, some returning to the old-time Russian mood of\nhopelessness, passivity and apathy, and some even backsliding into\nwild orgies of literary debauchery, Gorky never wavered, never lost\nhis faith and hope, never for a moment was untrue to his principles.\nNow, with the revolution victorious, he has come into his right, one\nof the most respected, beloved and picturesque figures in the Russian\ndemocracy.\n\nKuprin, the most facile and talented short-story writer next to\nChekhov, has, on the whole, kept well to the best literary traditions\nof Russia, though he has frequently wandered off to extravagant sex\nthemes, for which he seems to display as great a fondness as\nArtzybashev. Semyonov is a unique character in Russian literature, a\npeasant who had scarcely mastered the most elementary mechanics of\nwriting when he penned his first story. But that story pleased\nTolstoy, who befriended and encouraged him. His tales deal altogether\nwith peasant life in country and city, and have a lifelikeness, an\nartlessness, a simplicity striking even in a Russian author.\n\nThere is a small group of writers detached from the main current of\nRussian literature who worship at the shrine of beauty and mysticism.\nOf these Sologub has attained the highest reputation.\n\nRich as Russia has become in the short story, Anton Chekhov still\nstands out as the supreme master, one of the greatest short-story\nwriters of the world. He was born in Taganarok, in the Ukraine, in\n1860, the son of a peasant serf who succeeded in buying his freedom.\nAnton Chekhov studied medicine, but devoted himself largely to\nwriting, in which, he acknowledged, his scientific training was of\ngreat service. Though he lived only forty-four years, dying of\ntuberculosis in 1904, his collected works consist of sixteen\nfair-sized volumes of short stories, and several dramas besides. A few\nvolumes of his works have already appeared in English translation.\n\nCritics, among them Tolstoy, have often compared Chekhov to\nMaupassant. I find it hard to discover the resemblance. Maupassant\nholds a supreme position as a short-story writer; so does Chekhov. But\nthere, it seems to me, the likeness ends.\n\nThe chill wind that blows from the atmosphere created by the\nFrenchman's objective artistry is by the Russian commingled with the\nwarm breath of a great human sympathy. Maupassant never tells where\nhis sympathies lie, and you don't know; you only guess. Chekhov does\nnot tell you where his sympathies lie, either, but you know all the\nsame; you don't have to guess. And yet Chekhov is as objective as\nMaupassant. In the chronicling of facts, conditions, and situations,\nin the reproduction of characters, he is scrupulously true, hard, and\ninexorable. But without obtruding his personality, he somehow manages\nto let you know that he is always present, always at hand. If you\nlaugh, he is there to laugh with you; if you cry, he is there to shed\na tear with you; if you are horrified, he is horrified, too. It is a\nsubtle art by which he contrives to make one feel the nearness of\nhimself for all his objectiveness, so subtle that it defies analysis.\nAnd yet it constitutes one of the great charms of his tales.\n\nChekhov's works show an astounding resourcefulness and versatility.\nThere is no monotony, no repetition. Neither in incident nor in\ncharacter are any two stories alike. The range of Chekhov's knowledge\nof men and things seems to be unlimited, and he is extravagant in the\nuse of it. Some great idea which many a writer would consider\nsufficient to expand into a whole novel he disposes of in a story of a\nfew pages. Take, for example, _Vanka_, apparently but a mere episode\nin the childhood of a nine-year-old boy; while it is really the\ntragedy of a whole life in its tempting glimpses into a past\nenvironment and ominous forebodings of the future--all contracted into\nthe space of four or five pages. Chekhov is lavish with his\ninventiveness. Apparently, it cost him no effort to invent.\n\nI have used the word inventiveness for lack of a better name. It\nexpresses but lamely the peculiar faculty that distinguishes Chekhov.\nChekhov does not really invent. He reveals. He reveals things that no\nauthor before him has revealed. It is as though he possessed a special\norgan which enabled him to see, hear and feel things of which we other\nmortals did not even dream the existence. Yet when he lays them bare\nwe know that they are not fictitious, not invented, but as real as the\nordinary familiar facts of life. This faculty of his playing on all\nconceivable objects, all conceivable emotions, no matter how\nmicroscopic, endows them with life and a soul. By virtue of this power\n_The Steppe_, an uneventful record of peasants travelling day after\nday through flat, monotonous fields, becomes instinct with dramatic\ninterest, and its 125 pages seem all too short. And by virtue of the\nsame attribute we follow with breathless suspense the minute\ndescription of the declining days of a great scientist, who feels his\nphysical and mental faculties gradually ebbing away. _A Tiresome\nStory_, Chekhov calls it; and so it would be without the vitality\nconjured into it by the magic touch of this strange genius.\n\nDivination is perhaps a better term than invention. Chekhov divines\nthe most secret impulses of the soul, scents out what is buried in the\nsubconscious, and brings it up to the surface. Most writers are\nspecialists. They know certain strata of society, and when they\nventure beyond, their step becomes uncertain. Chekhov's material is\nonly delimited by humanity. He is equally at home everywhere. The\npeasant, the labourer, the merchant, the priest, the professional man,\nthe scholar, the military officer, and the government functionary,\nGentile or Jew, man, woman, or child--Chekhov is intimate with all of\nthem. His characters are sharply defined individuals, not types. In\nalmost all his stories, however short, the men and women and children\nwho play a part in them come out as clear, distinct personalities.\nAriadne is as vivid a character as Lilly, the heroine of Sudermann's\n_Song of Songs_; yet _Ariadne_ is but a single story in a volume of\nstories. Who that has read _The Darling_ can ever forget her--the\nwoman who had no separate existence of her own, but thought the\nthoughts, felt the feelings, and spoke the words of the men she loved?\nAnd when there was no man to love any more, she was utterly crushed\nuntil she found a child to take care of and to love; and then she sank\nher personality in the boy as she had sunk it before in her husbands\nand lover, became a mere reflection of him, and was happy again.\n\nIn the compilation of this volume I have been guided by the desire to\ngive the largest possible representation to the prominent authors of\nthe Russian short story, and to present specimens characteristic of\neach. At the same time the element of interest has been kept in mind;\nand in a few instances, as in the case of Korolenko, the selection of\nthe story was made with a view to its intrinsic merit and striking\nqualities rather than as typifying the writer's art. It was, of\ncourse, impossible in the space of one book to exhaust all that is\nbest. But to my knowledge, the present volume is the most\ncomprehensive anthology of the Russian short story in the English\nlanguage, and gives a fair notion of the achievement in that field.\nAll who enjoy good reading, I have no reason to doubt, will get\npleasure from it, and if, in addition, it will prove of assistance to\nAmerican students of Russian literature, I shall feel that the task\nhas been doubly worth the while.\n\nKorolenko's _Shades_ and Andreyev's _Lazarus_ first appeared in\n_Current Opinion_, and Artzybashev's _The Revolutionist_ in the\n_Metropolitan Magazine_. I take pleasure in thanking Mr. Edward J.\nWheeler, editor of _Current Opinion_, and Mr. Carl Hovey, editor of\nthe _Metropolitan Magazine_, for permission to reprint them.\n\n[Signature: Thomas Seltzer]\n\n\n\n\"Everything is subordinated to two main requirements--humanitarian\nideals and fidelity to life.

PUSHKIN\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThere was a card party at the rooms of Narumov of the Horse Guards.\nThe long winter night passed away imperceptibly, and it was five\no'clock in the morning before the company sat down to supper. Those\nwho had won, ate with a good appetite; the others sat staring absently\nat their empty plates. When the champagne appeared, however, the\nconversation became more animated, and all took a part in it.\n\n\"And how did you fare, Surin?\" asked the host.\n\n\"Oh, I lost, as usual. I must confess that I am unlucky: I play\nmirandole, I always keep cool, I never allow anything to put me out,\nand yet I always lose!\"\n\n\"And you did not once allow yourself to be tempted to back the red?...\nYour firmness astonishes me.\"\n\n\"But what do you think of Hermann?\" said one of the guests, pointing\nto a young Engineer: \"he has never had a card in his hand in his life,\nhe has never in his life laid a wager, and yet he sits here till five\no'clock in the morning watching our play.\"\n\n\"Play interests me very much,\" said Hermann: \"but I am not in the\nposition to sacrifice the necessary in the hope of winning the\nsuperfluous.\"\n\n\"Hermann is a German: he is economical--that is all!\" observed Tomsky.\n\"But if there is one person that I cannot understand, it is my\ngrandmother, the Countess Anna Fedotovna.\"\n\n\"How so?\" inquired the guests.\n\n\"I cannot understand,\" continued Tomsky, \"how it is that my\ngrandmother does not punt.\"\n\n\"What is there remarkable about an old lady of eighty not punting?\"\nsaid Narumov.\n\n\"Then you do not know the reason why?\"\n\n\"No, really; haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\"Oh! then listen. About sixty years ago, my grandmother went to Paris,\nwhere she created quite a sensation. People used to run after her to\ncatch a glimpse of the 'Muscovite Venus.' Richelieu made love to her,\nand my grandmother maintains that he almost blew out his brains in\nconsequence of her cruelty. At that time ladies used to play at faro.\nOn one occasion at the Court, she lost a very considerable sum to the\nDuke of Orleans. On returning home, my grandmother removed the patches\nfrom her face, took off her hoops, informed my grandfather of her loss\nat the gaming-table, and ordered him to pay the money. My deceased\ngrandfather, as far as I remember, was a sort of house-steward to my\ngrandmother. He dreaded her like fire; but, on hearing of such a heavy\nloss, he almost went out of his mind; he calculated the various sums\nshe had lost, and pointed out to her that in six months she had spent\nhalf a million francs, that neither their Moscow nor Saratov estates\nwere in Paris, and finally refused point blank to pay the debt. My\ngrandmother gave him a box on the ear and slept by herself as a sign\nof her displeasure. The next day she sent for her husband, hoping that\nthis domestic punishment had produced an effect upon him, but she\nfound him inflexible. For the first time in her life, she entered into\nreasonings and explanations with him, thinking to be able to convince\nhim by pointing out to him that there are debts and debts, and that\nthere is a great difference between a Prince and a coachmaker. But it\nwas all in vain, my grandfather still remained obdurate. But the\nmatter did not rest there. My grandmother did not know what to do. She\nhad shortly before become acquainted with a very remarkable man. You\nhave heard of Count St. Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories\nare told. You know that he represented himself as the Wandering Jew,\nas the discoverer of the elixir of life, of the philosopher's stone,\nand so forth. Some laughed at him as a charlatan; but Casanova, in his\nmemoirs, says that he was a spy. But be that as it may, St. Germain,\nin spite of the mystery surrounding him, was a very fascinating\nperson, and was much sought after in the best circles of society. Even\nto this day my grandmother retains an affectionate recollection of\nhim, and becomes quite angry if any one speaks disrespectfully of him.\nMy grandmother knew that St. Germain had large sums of money at his\ndisposal. She resolved to have recourse to him, and she wrote a letter\nto him asking him to come to her without delay. The queer old man\nimmediately waited upon her and found her overwhelmed with grief. She\ndescribed to him in the blackest colours the barbarity of her husband,\nand ended by declaring that her whole hope depended upon his\nfriendship and amiability.\n\n\"St. Germain reflected.\n\n\"'I could advance you the sum you want,' said he; 'but I know that you\nwould not rest easy until you had paid me back, and I should not like\nto bring fresh troubles upon you. But there is another way of getting\nout of your difficulty: you can win back your money.'\n\n\"'But, my dear Count,' replied my grandmother, 'I tell you that I\nhaven't any money left.'\n\n\"'Money is not necessary,' replied St. Germain: 'be pleased to listen\nto me.'\n\n\"Then he revealed to her a secret, for which each of us would give a\ngood deal...\"\n\nThe young officers listened with increased attention. Tomsky lit his\npipe, puffed away for a moment and then continued:\n\n\"That same evening my grandmother went to Versailles to the _jeu de la\nreine_. The Duke of Orleans kept the bank; my grandmother excused\nherself in an off-hand manner for not having yet paid her debt, by\ninventing some little story, and then began to play against him. She\nchose three cards and played them one after the other: all three won\n_sonika_, [Said of a card when it wins or loses in the quickest\npossible time.] and my grandmother recovered every farthing that she\nhad lost.\"\n\n\"Mere chance!\" said one of the guests.\n\n\"A tale!\" observed Hermann.\n\n\"Perhaps they were marked cards!\" said a third.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" replied Tomsky gravely.\n\n\"What!\" said Narumov, \"you have a grandmother who knows how to hit\nupon three lucky cards in succession, and you have never yet succeeded\nin getting the secret of it out of her?\"\n\n\"That's the deuce of it!\" replied Tomsky: \"she had four sons, one of\nwhom was my father; all four were determined gamblers, and yet not to\none of them did she ever reveal her secret, although it would not have\nbeen a bad thing either for them or for me. But this is what I heard\nfrom my uncle, Count Ivan Ilyich, and he assured me, on his honour,\nthat it was true. The late Chaplitzky--the same who died in poverty\nafter having squandered millions--once lost, in his youth, about three\nhundred thousand roubles--to Zorich, if I remember rightly. He was in\ndespair. My grandmother, who was always very severe upon the\nextravagance of young men, took pity, however, upon Chaplitzky. She\ngave him three cards, telling him to play them one after the other, at\nthe same time exacting from him a solemn promise that he would never\nplay at cards again as long as he lived. Chaplitzky then went to his\nvictorious opponent, and they began a fresh game. On the first card he\nstaked fifty thousand rubles and won _sonika_; he doubled the stake\nand won again, till at last, by pursuing the same tactics, he won back\nmore than he had lost ...\n\n\"But it is time to go to bed: it is a quarter to six already.\"\n\nAnd indeed it was already beginning to dawn: the young men emptied\ntheir glasses and then took leave of each other.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe old Countess A---- was seated in her dressing-room in front of her\nlooking--glass. Three waiting maids stood around her. One held a small\npot of rouge, another a box of hair-pins, and the third a tall can\nwith bright red ribbons. The Countess had no longer the slightest\npretensions to beauty, but she still preserved the habits of her\nyouth, dressed in strict accordance with the fashion of seventy years\nbefore, and made as long and as careful a toilette as she would have\ndone sixty years previously. Near the window, at an embroidery frame,\nsat a young lady, her ward.\n\n\"Good morning, grandmamma,\" said a young officer, entering the room.\n\"_Bonjour, Mademoiselle Lise_. Grandmamma, I want to ask you\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What is it, Paul?\"\n\n\"I want you to let me introduce one of my friends to you, and to allow\nme to bring him to the ball on Friday.\"\n\n\"Bring him direct to the ball and introduce him to me there. Were you\nat B----'s yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes; everything went off very pleasantly, and dancing was kept up\nuntil five o'clock. How charming Yeletzkaya was!\"\n\n\"But, my dear, what is there charming about her? Isn't she like her\ngrandmother, the Princess Daria Petrovna? By the way, she must be very\nold, the Princess Daria Petrovna.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, old?\" cried Tomsky thoughtlessly; \"she died seven\nyears ago.\"\n\nThe young lady raised her head and made a sign to the young officer.\nHe then remembered that the old Countess was never to be informed of\nthe death of any of her contemporaries, and he bit his lips. But the\nold Countess heard the news with the greatest indifference.\n\n\"Dead!\" said she; \"and I did not know it. We were appointed maids of\nhonour at the same time, and when we were presented to the Empress...\"\n\nAnd the Countess for the hundredth time related to her grandson one of\nher anecdotes.\n\n\"Come, Paul,\" said she, when she had finished her story, \"help me to\nget up. Lizanka, where is my snuff-box?\"\n\nAnd the Countess with her three maids went behind a screen to finish\nher toilette. Tomsky was left alone with the young lady.\n\n\"Who is the gentleman you wish to introduce to the Countess?\" asked\nLizaveta Ivanovna in a whisper.\n\n\"Narumov. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"No. Is he a soldier or a civilian?\"\n\n\"A soldier.\"\n\n\"Is he in the Engineers?\"\n\n\"No, in the Cavalry. What made you think that he was in the\nEngineers?\"\n\nThe young lady smiled, but made no reply.\n\n\"Paul,\" cried the Countess from behind the screen, \"send me some new\nnovel, only pray don't let it be one of the present day style.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, grandmother?\"\n\n\"That is, a novel, in which the hero strangles neither his father nor\nhis mother, and in which there are no drowned bodies. I have a great\nhorror of drowned persons.\"\n\n\"There are no such novels nowadays. Would you like a Russian one?\"\n\n\"Are there any Russian novels? Send me one, my dear, pray send me\none!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, grandmother: I am in a hurry... Good-bye, Lizaveta\nIvanovna. What made you think that Narumov was in the Engineers?\"\n\nAnd Tomsky left the boudoir.\n\nLizaveta Ivanovna was left alone: she laid aside her work and began to\nlook out of the window. A few moments afterwards, at a corner house on\nthe other side of the street, a young officer appeared. A deep blush\ncovered her cheeks; she took up her work again and bent her head down\nover the frame. At the same moment the Countess returned completely\ndressed.\n\n\"Order the carriage, Lizaveta,\" said she; \"we will go out for a\ndrive.\"\n\nLizaveta arose from the frame and began to arrange her work.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my child, are you deaf?\" cried the\nCountess. \"Order the carriage to be got ready at once.\"\n\n\"I will do so this moment,\" replied the young lady, hastening into the\nante-room.\n\nA servant entered and gave the Countess some books from Prince Paul\nAleksandrovich.\n\n\"Tell him that I am much obliged to him,\" said the Countess.\n\"Lizaveta! Lizaveta! Where are you running to?\"\n\n\"I am going to dress.\"\n\n\"There is plenty of time, my dear. Sit down here. Open the first\nvolume and read to me aloud.\"\n\nHer companion took the book and read a few lines.\n\n\"Louder,\" said the Countess. \"What is the matter with you, my child?\nHave you lost your voice? Wait--give me that footstool--a little\nnearer--that will do.\"\n\nLizaveta read two more pages. The Countess yawned.\n\n\"Put the book down,\" said she: \"what a lot of nonsense! Send it back\nto Prince Paul with my thanks... But where is the carriage?\"\n\n\"The carriage is ready,\" said Lizaveta, looking out into the street.\n\n\"How is it that you are not dressed?\" said the Countess: \"I must\nalways wait for you. It is intolerable, my dear!\"\n\nLiza hastened to her room. She had not been there two minutes, before\nthe Countess began to ring with all her might. The three waiting-maids\ncame running in at one door and the valet at another.\n\n\"How is it that you cannot hear me when I ring for you?\" said the\nCountess. \"Tell Lizaveta Ivanovna that I am waiting for her.\"\n\nLizaveta returned with her hat and cloak on.\n\n\"At last you are here!\" said the Countess. \"But why such an elaborate\ntoilette? Whom do you intend to captivate? What sort of weather is it?\nIt seems rather windy.\"\n\n\"No, your Ladyship, it is very calm,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"You never think of what you are talking about. Open the window. So it\nis: windy and bitterly cold. Unharness the horses. Lizaveta, we won't\ngo out--there was no need for you to deck yourself like that.\"\n\n\"What a life is mine!\" thought Lizaveta Ivanovna.\n\nAnd, in truth, Lizaveta Ivanovna was a very unfortunate creature. \"The\nbread of the stranger is bitter,\" says Dante, \"and his staircase hard\nto climb.\" But who can know what the bitterness of dependence is so\nwell as the poor companion of an old lady of quality? The Countess\nA---- had by no means a bad heart, but she was capricious, like a\nwoman who had been spoilt by the world, as well as being avaricious\nand egotistical, like all old people who have seen their best days,\nand whose thoughts are with the past and not the present. She\nparticipated in all the vanities of the great world, went to balls,\nwhere she sat in a corner, painted and dressed in old-fashioned style,\nlike a deformed but indispensable ornament of the ball-room; all the\nguests on entering approached her and made a profound bow, as if in\naccordance with a set ceremony, but after that nobody took any further\nnotice of her. She received the whole town at her house, and observed\nthe strictest etiquette, although she could no longer recognise the\nfaces of people. Her numerous domestics, growing fat and old in her\nante-chamber and servants' hall, did just as they liked, and vied with\neach other in robbing the aged Countess in the most bare-faced manner.\nLizaveta Ivanovna was the martyr of the household. She made tea, and\nwas reproached with using too much sugar; she read novels aloud to the\nCountess, and the faults of the author were visited upon her head; she\naccompanied the Countess in her walks, and was held answerable for the\nweather or the state of the pavement. A salary was attached to the\npost, but she very rarely received it, although she was expected to\ndress like everybody else, that is to say, like very few indeed. In\nsociety she played the most pitiable role. Everybody knew her, and\nnobody paid her any attention. At balls she danced only when a partner\nwas wanted, and ladies would only take hold of her arm when it was\nnecessary to lead her out of the room to attend to their dresses. She\nwas very self-conscious, and felt her position keenly, and she looked\nabout her with impatience for a deliverer to come to her rescue; but\nthe young men, calculating in their giddiness, honoured her with but\nvery little attention, although Lizaveta Ivanovna was a hundred times\nprettier than the bare-faced and cold-hearted marriageable girls\naround whom they hovered. Many a time did she quietly slink away from\nthe glittering but wearisome drawing-room, to go and cry in her own\npoor little room, in which stood a screen, a chest of drawers, a\nlooking-glass and a painted bedstead, and where a tallow candle burnt\nfeebly in a copper candle-stick.\n\nOne morning--this was about two days after the evening party described\nat the beginning of this story, and a week previous to the scene at\nwhich we have just assisted--Lizaveta Ivanovna was seated near the\nwindow at her embroidery frame, when, happening to look out into the\nstreet, she caught sight of a young Engineer officer, standing\nmotionless with his eyes fixed upon her window. She lowered her head\nand went on again with her work. About five minutes afterwards she\nlooked out again--the young officer was still standing in the same\nplace. Not being in the habit of coquetting with passing officers, she\ndid not continue to gaze out into the street, but went on sewing for a\ncouple of hours, without raising her head. Dinner was announced. She\nrose up and began to put her embroidery away, but glancing casually\nout of the window, she perceived the officer again. This seemed to her\nvery strange. After dinner she went to the window with a certain\nfeeling of uneasiness, but the officer was no longer there--and she\nthought no more about him.\n\nA couple of days afterwards, just as she was stepping into the\ncarriage with the Countess, she saw him again. He was standing close\nbehind the door, with his face half-concealed by his fur collar, but\nhis dark eyes sparkled beneath his cap. Lizaveta felt alarmed, though\nshe knew not why, and she trembled as she seated herself in the\ncarriage.\n\nOn returning home, she hastened to the window--the officer was\nstanding in his accustomed place, with his eyes fixed upon her. She\ndrew back, a prey to curiosity and agitated by a feeling which was\nquite new to her.\n\nFrom that time forward not a day passed without the young officer\nmaking his appearance under the window at the customary hour, and\nbetween him and her there was established a sort of mute acquaintance.\nSitting in her place at work, she used to feel his approach; and\nraising her head, she would look at him longer and longer each day.\nThe young man seemed to be very grateful to her: she saw with the\nsharp eye of youth, how a sudden flush covered his pale cheeks each\ntime that their glances met. After about a week she commenced to smile\nat him...\n\nWhen Tomsky asked permission of his grandmother the Countess to\npresent one of his friends to her, the young girl's heart beat\nviolently. But hearing that Narumov was not an Engineer, she regretted\nthat by her thoughtless question, she had betrayed her secret to the\nvolatile Tomsky.\n\nHermann was the son of a German who had become a naturalised Russian,\nand from whom he had inherited a small capital. Being firmly convinced\nof the necessity of preserving his independence, Hermann did not touch\nhis private income, but lived on his pay, without allowing himself the\nslightest luxury. Moreover, he was reserved and ambitious, and his\ncompanions rarely had an opportunity of making merry at the expense of\nhis extreme parsimony. He had strong passions and an ardent\nimagination, but his firmness of disposition preserved him from the\nordinary errors of young men. Thus, though a gamester at heart, he\nnever touched a card, for he considered his position did not allow\nhim--as he said--\"to risk the necessary in the hope of winning the\nsuperfluous,\" yet he would sit for nights together at the card table\nand follow with feverish anxiety the different turns of the game.\n\nThe story of the three cards had produced a powerful impression upon\nhis imagination, and all night long he could think of nothing else.\n\"If,\" he thought to himself the following evening, as he walked along\nthe streets of St. Petersburg, \"if the old Countess would but reveal\nher secret to me! if she would only tell me the names of the three\nwinning cards. Why should I not try my fortune? I must get introduced\nto her and win her favour--become her lover... But all that will take\ntime, and she is eighty-seven years old: she might be dead in a week,\nin a couple of days even!... But the story itself: can it really be\ntrue?... No! Economy, temperance and industry: those are my three\nwinning cards; by means of them I shall be able to double my\ncapital--increase it sevenfold, and procure for myself ease and\nindependence.\"\n\nMusing in this manner, he walked on until he found himself in one of\nthe principal streets of St. Petersburg, in front of a house of\nantiquated architecture. The street was blocked with equipages;\ncarriages one after the other drew up in front of the brilliantly\nilluminated doorway. At one moment there stepped out on to the\npavement the well-shaped little foot of some young beauty, at another\nthe heavy boot of a cavalry officer, and then the silk stockings and\nshoes of a member of the diplomatic world. Furs and cloaks passed in\nrapid succession before the gigantic porter at the entrance.\n\nHermann stopped. \"Whose house is this?\" he asked of the watchman at\nthe corner.\n\n\"The Countess A----'s,\" replied the watchman.\n\nHermann started. The strange story of the three cards again presented\nitself to his imagination. He began walking up and down before the\nhouse, thinking of its owner and her strange secret. Returning late to\nhis modest lodging, he could not go to sleep for a long time, and when\nat last he did doze off, he could dream of nothing but cards, green\ntables, piles of banknotes and heaps of ducats. He played one card\nafter the other, winning uninterruptedly, and then he gathered up the\ngold and filled his pockets with the notes. When he woke up late the\nnext morning, he sighed over the loss of his imaginary wealth, and\nthen sallying out into the town, he found himself once more in front\nof the Countess's residence. Some unknown power seemed to have\nattracted him thither. He stopped and looked up at the windows. At one\nof these he saw a head with luxuriant black hair, which was bent down\nprobably over some book or an embroidery frame. The head was raised.\nHermann saw a fresh complexion and a pair of dark eyes. That moment\ndecided his fate.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nLizaveta Ivanovna had scarcely taken off her hat and cloak, when the\nCountess sent for her and again ordered her to get the carriage ready.\nThe vehicle drew up before the door, and they prepared to take their\nseats. Just at the moment when two footmen were assisting the old lady\nto enter the carriage, Lizaveta saw her Engineer standing close beside\nthe wheel; he grasped her hand; alarm caused her to lose her presence\nof mind, and the young man disappeared--but not before he had left a\nletter between her fingers. She concealed it in her glove, and during\nthe whole of the drive she neither saw nor heard anything. It was the\ncustom of the Countess, when out for an airing in her carriage, to be\nconstantly asking such questions as: \"Who was that person that met us\njust now? What is the name of this bridge? What is written on that\nsignboard?\" On this occasion, however, Lizaveta returned such vague\nand absurd answers, that the Countess became angry with her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my dear?\" she exclaimed. \"Have you taken\nleave of your senses, or what is it? Do you not hear me or understand\nwhat I say?... Heaven be thanked, I am still in my right mind and\nspeak plainly enough!\"\n\nLizaveta Ivanovna did not hear her. On returning home she ran to her\nroom, and drew the letter out of her glove: it was not sealed.\nLizaveta read it. The letter contained a declaration of love; it was\ntender, respectful, and copied word for word from a German novel. But\nLizaveta did not know anything of the German language, and she was\nquite delighted.\n\nFor all that, the letter caused her to feel exceedingly uneasy. For\nthe first time in her life she was entering into secret and\nconfidential relations with a young man. His boldness alarmed her. She\nreproached herself for her imprudent behaviour, and knew not what to\ndo. Should she cease to sit at the window and, by assuming an\nappearance of indifference towards him, put a check upon the young\nofficer's desire for further acquaintance with her? Should she send\nhis letter back to him, or should she answer him in a cold and decided\nmanner? There was nobody to whom she could turn in her perplexity, for\nshe had neither female friend nor adviser... At length she resolved to\nreply to him.\n\nShe sat down at her little writing-table, took pen and paper, and\nbegan to think. Several times she began her letter, and then tore it\nup: the way she had expressed herself seemed to her either too\ninviting or too cold and decisive. At last she succeeded in writing a\nfew lines with which she felt satisfied.\n\n\"I am convinced,\" she wrote, \"that your intentions are honourable, and\nthat you do not wish to offend me by any imprudent behaviour, but our\nacquaintance must not begin in such a manner. I return you your\nletter, and I hope that I shall never have any cause to complain of\nthis undeserved slight.\"\n\nThe next day, as soon as Hermann made his appearance, Lizaveta rose\nfrom her embroidery, went into the drawing-room, opened the ventilator\nand threw the letter into the street, trusting that the young officer\nwould have the perception to pick it up.\n\nHermann hastened forward, picked it up and then repaired to a\nconfectioner's shop. Breaking the seal of the envelope, he found\ninside it his own letter and Lizaveta's reply. He had expected this,\nand he returned home, his mind deeply occupied with his intrigue.\n\nThree days afterwards, a bright-eyed young girl from a milliner's\nestablishment brought Lizaveta a letter. Lizaveta opened it with great\nuneasiness, fearing that it was a demand for money, when suddenly she\nrecognised Hermann's hand-writing.\n\n\"You have made a mistake, my dear,\" said she: \"this letter is not for\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is for you,\" replied the girl, smiling very knowingly.\n\"Have the goodness to read it.\"\n\nLizaveta glanced at the letter. Hermann requested an interview.\n\n\"It cannot be,\" she cried, alarmed at the audacious request, and the\nmanner in which it was made. \"This letter is certainly not for me.\"\n\nAnd she tore it into fragments.\n\n\"If the letter was not for you, why have you torn it up?\" said the\ngirl. \"I should have given it back to the person who sent it.\"\n\n\"Be good enough, my dear,\" said Lizaveta, disconcerted by this remark,\n\"not to bring me any more letters for the future, and tell the person\nwho sent you that he ought to be ashamed...\"\n\nBut Hermann was not the man to be thus put off. Every day Lizaveta\nreceived from him a letter, sent now in this way, now in that. They\nwere no longer translated from the German. Hermann wrote them under\nthe inspiration of passion, and spoke in his own language, and they\nbore full testimony to the inflexibility of his desire and the\ndisordered condition of his uncontrollable imagination. Lizaveta no\nlonger thought of sending them back to him: she became intoxicated\nwith them and began to reply to them, and little by little her answers\nbecame longer and more affectionate. At last she threw out of the\nwindow to him the following letter:\n\n\"This evening there is going to be a ball at the Embassy. The Countess\nwill be there. We shall remain until two o'clock. You have now an\nopportunity of seeing me alone. As soon as the Countess is gone, the\nservants will very probably go out, and there will be nobody left but\nthe Swiss, but he usually goes to sleep in his lodge. Come about\nhalf-past eleven. Walk straight upstairs. If you meet anybody in the\nante-room, ask if the Countess is at home. You will be told 'No,' in\nwhich case there will be nothing left for you to do but to go away\nagain. But it is most probable that you will meet nobody. The\nmaidservants will all be together in one room. On leaving the\nante-room, turn to the left, and walk straight on until you reach the\nCountess's bedroom. In the bedroom, behind a screen, you will find two\ndoors: the one on the right leads to a cabinet, which the Countess\nnever enters; the one on the left leads to a corridor, at the end of\nwhich is a little winding staircase; this leads to my room.\"\n\nHermann trembled like a tiger, as he waited for the appointed time to\narrive. At ten o'clock in the evening he was already in front of the\nCountess's house. The weather was terrible; the wind blew with great\nviolence; the sleety snow fell in large flakes; the lamps emitted a\nfeeble light, the streets were deserted; from time to time a sledge,\ndrawn by a sorry-looking hack, passed by, on the look-out for a\nbelated passenger. Hermann was enveloped in a thick overcoat, and felt\nneither wind nor snow.\n\nAt last the Countess's carriage drew up. Hermann saw two footmen carry\nout in their arms the bent form of the old lady, wrapped in sable fur,\nand immediately behind her, clad in a warm mantle, and with her head\nornamented with a wreath of fresh flowers, followed Lizaveta. The door\nwas closed. The carriage rolled away heavily through the yielding\nsnow. The porter shut the street-door; the windows became dark.\n\nHermann began walking up and down near the deserted house; at length\nhe stopped under a lamp, and glanced at his watch: it was twenty\nminutes past eleven. He remained standing under the lamp, his eyes\nfixed upon the watch, impatiently waiting for the remaining minutes to\npass. At half-past eleven precisely, Hermann ascended the steps of the\nhouse, and made his way into the brightly-illuminated vestibule. The\nporter was not there. Hermann hastily ascended the staircase, opened\nthe door of the ante-room and saw a footman sitting asleep in an\nantique chair by the side of a lamp. With a light firm step Hermann\npassed by him. The drawing-room and dining-room were in darkness, but\na feeble reflection penetrated thither from the lamp in the ante-room.\n\nHermann reached the Countess's bedroom. Before a shrine, which was\nfull of old images, a golden lamp was burning. Faded stuffed chairs\nand divans with soft cushions stood in melancholy symmetry around the\nroom, the walls of which were hung with China silk. On one side of the\nroom hung two portraits painted in Paris by Madame Lebrun. One of\nthese represented a stout, red-faced man of about forty years of age\nin a bright-green uniform and with a star upon his breast; the\nother--a beautiful young woman, with an aquiline nose, forehead curls\nand a rose in her powdered hair. In the corners stood porcelain\nshepherds and shepherdesses, dining-room clocks from the workshop of\nthe celebrated Lefroy, bandboxes, roulettes, fans and the various\nplaythings for the amusement of ladies that were in vogue at the end\nof the last century, when Montgolfier's balloons and Mesmer's\nmagnetism were the rage. Hermann stepped behind the screen. At the\nback of it stood a little iron bedstead; on the right was the door\nwhich led to the cabinet; on the left--the other which led to the\ncorridor. He opened the latter, and saw the little winding staircase\nwhich led to the room of the poor companion... But he retraced his\nsteps and entered the dark cabinet.\n\nThe time passed slowly. All was still. The clock in the drawing-room\nstruck twelve; the strokes echoed through the room one after the\nother, and everything was quiet again. Hermann stood leaning against\nthe cold stove. He was calm; his heart beat regularly, like that of a\nman resolved upon a dangerous but inevitable undertaking. One o'clock\nin the morning struck; then two; and he heard the distant noise of\ncarriage-wheels. An involuntary agitation took possession of him. The\ncarriage drew near and stopped. He heard the sound of the\ncarriage-steps being let down. All was bustle within the house. The\nservants were running hither and thither, there was a confusion of\nvoices, and the rooms were lit up. Three antiquated chamber-maids\nentered the bedroom, and they were shortly afterwards followed by the\nCountess who, more dead than alive, sank into a Voltaire armchair.\nHermann peeped through a chink. Lizaveta Ivanovna passed close by him,\nand he heard her hurried steps as she hastened up the little spiral\nstaircase. For a moment his heart was assailed by something like a\npricking of conscience, but the emotion was only transitory, and his\nheart became petrified as before.\n\nThe Countess began to undress before her looking-glass. Her\nrose-bedecked cap was taken off, and then her powdered wig was removed\nfrom off her white and closely-cut hair. Hairpins fell in showers\naround her. Her yellow satin dress, brocaded with silver, fell down at\nher swollen feet.\n\nHermann was a witness of the repugnant mysteries of her toilette; at\nlast the Countess was in her night-cap and dressing-gown, and in this\ncostume, more suitable to her age, she appeared less hideous and\ndeformed.\n\nLike all old people in general, the Countess suffered from\nsleeplessness. Having undressed, she seated herself at the window in a\nVoltaire armchair and dismissed her maids. The candles were taken\naway, and once more the room was left with only one lamp burning in\nit. The Countess sat there looking quite yellow, mumbling with her\nflaccid lips and swaying to and fro. Her dull eyes expressed complete\nvacancy of mind, and, looking at her, one would have thought that the\nrocking of her body was not a voluntary action of her own, but was\nproduced by the action of some concealed galvanic mechanism.\n\nSuddenly the death-like face assumed an inexplicable expression. The\nlips ceased to tremble, the eyes became animated: before the Countess\nstood an unknown man.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, for Heaven's sake, do not be alarmed!\" said he in\na low but distinct voice. \"I have no intention of doing you any harm,\nI have only come to ask a favour of you.\"\n\nThe old woman looked at him in silence, as if she had not heard what\nhe had said. Hermann thought that she was deaf, and bending down\ntowards her ear, he repeated what he had said. The aged Countess\nremained silent as before.\n\n\"You can insure the happiness of my life,\" continued Hermann, \"and it\nwill cost you nothing. I know that you can name three cards in\norder--\"\n\nHermann stopped. The Countess appeared now to understand what he\nwanted; she seemed as if seeking for words to reply.\n\n\"It was a joke,\" she replied at last: \"I assure you it was only a\njoke.\"\n\n\"There is no joking about the matter,\" replied Hermann angrily.\n\"Remember Chaplitzky, whom you helped to win.\"\n\nThe Countess became visibly uneasy. Her features expressed strong\nemotion, but they quickly resumed their former immobility.\n\n\"Can you not name me these three winning cards?\" continued Hermann.\n\nThe Countess remained silent; Hermann continued:\n\n\"For whom are you preserving your secret? For your grandsons? They are\nrich enough without it; they do not know the worth of money. Your\ncards would be of no use to a spendthrift. He who cannot preserve his\npaternal inheritance, will die in want, even though he had a demon at\nhis service. I am not a man of that sort; I know the value of money.\nYour three cards will not be thrown away upon me. Come!\"...\n\nHe paused and tremblingly awaited her reply. The Countess remained\nsilent; Hermann fell upon his knees.\n\n\"If your heart has ever known the feeling of love,\" said he, \"if you\nremember its rapture, if you have ever smiled at the cry of your\nnew-born child, if any human feeling has ever entered into your\nbreast, I entreat you by the feelings of a wife, a lover, a mother, by\nall that is most sacred in life, not to reject my prayer. Reveal to me\nyour secret. Of what use is it to you?... May be it is connected with\nsome terrible sin with the loss of eternal salvation, with some\nbargain with the devil... Reflect,--you are old; you have not long to\nlive--I am ready to take your sins upon my soul. Only reveal to me\nyour secret. Remember that the happiness of a man is in your hands,\nthat not only I, but my children, and grandchildren will bless your\nmemory and reverence you as a saint...\"\n\nThe old Countess answered not a word.\n\nHermann rose to his feet.\n\n\"You old hag!\" he exclaimed, grinding his teeth, \"then I will make you\nanswer!\"\n\nWith these words he drew a pistol from his pocket.\n\nAt the sight of the pistol, the Countess for the second time exhibited\nstrong emotion. She shook her head and raised her hands as if to\nprotect herself from the shot... then she fell backwards and remained\nmotionless.\n\n\"Come, an end to this childish nonsense!\" said Hermann, taking hold of\nher hand. \"I ask you for the last time: will you tell me the names of\nyour three cards, or will you not?\"\n\nThe Countess made no reply. Hermann perceived that she was dead!\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nLizaveta Ivanovna was sitting in her room, still in her ball dress,\nlost in deep thought. On returning home, she had hastily dismissed the\nchambermaid who very reluctantly came forward to assist her, saying\nthat she would undress herself, and with a trembling heart had gone up\nto her own room, expecting to find Hermann there, but yet hoping not\nto find him. At the first glance she convinced herself that he was not\nthere, and she thanked her fate for having prevented him keeping the\nappointment. She sat down without undressing, and began to recall to\nmind all the circumstances which in so short a time had carried her so\nfar. It was not three weeks since the time when she first saw the\nyoung officer from the window--and yet she was already in\ncorrespondence with him, and he had succeeded in inducing her to grant\nhim a nocturnal interview! She knew his name only through his having\nwritten it at the bottom of some of his letters; she had never spoken\nto him, had never heard his voice, and had never heard him spoken of\nuntil that evening. But, strange to say, that very evening at the\nball, Tomsky, being piqued with the young Princess Pauline N----, who,\ncontrary to her usual custom, did not flirt with him, wished to\nrevenge himself by assuming an air of indifference: he therefore\nengaged Lizaveta Ivanovna and danced an endless mazurka with her.\nDuring the whole of the time he kept teasing her about her partiality\nfor Engineer officers; he assured her that he knew far more than she\nimagined, and some of his jests were so happily aimed, that Lizaveta\nthought several times that her secret was known to him.\n\n\"From whom have you learnt all this?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"From a friend of a person very well known to you,\" replied Tomsky,\n\"from a very distinguished man.\"\n\n\"And who is this distinguished man?\"\n\n\"His name is Hermann.\"\n\nLizaveta made no reply; but her hands and feet lost all sense of\nfeeling.\n\n\"This Hermann,\" continued Tomsky, \"is a man of romantic personality.\nHe has the profile of a Napoleon, and the soul of a Mephistopheles. I\nbelieve that he has at least three crimes upon his conscience... How\npale you have become!\"\n\n\"I have a headache... But what did this Hermann--or whatever his name\nis--tell you?\"\n\n\"Hermann is very much dissatisfied with his friend: he says that in\nhis place he would act very differently... I even think that Hermann\nhimself has designs upon you; at least, he listens very attentively to\nall that his friend has to say about you.\"\n\n\"And where has he seen me?\"\n\n\"In church, perhaps; or on the parade--God alone knows where. It may\nhave been in your room, while you were asleep, for there is nothing\nthat he--\"\n\nThree ladies approaching him with the question: \"_oubli ou regret_?\"\ninterrupted the conversation, which had become so tantalisingly\ninteresting to Lizaveta.\n\nThe lady chosen by Tomsky was the Princess Pauline herself. She\nsucceeded in effecting a reconciliation with him during the numerous\nturns of the dance, after which he conducted her to her chair. On\nreturning to his place, Tomsky thought no more either of Hermann or\nLizaveta. She longed to renew the interrupted conversation, but the\nmazurka came to an end, and shortly afterwards the old Countess took\nher departure.\n\nTomsky's words were nothing more than the customary small talk of the\ndance, but they sank deep into the soul of the young dreamer. The\nportrait, sketched by Tomsky, coincided with the picture she had\nformed within her own mind, and thanks to the latest romances, the\nordinary countenance of her admirer became invested with attributes\ncapable of alarming her and fascinating her imagination at the same\ntime. She was now sitting with her bare arms crossed and with her\nhead, still adorned with flowers, sunk upon her uncovered bosom.\nSuddenly the door opened and Hermann entered. She shuddered.\n\n\"Where were you?\" she asked in a terrified whisper.\n\n\"In the old Countess's bedroom,\" replied Hermann: \"I have just left\nher. The Countess is dead.\"\n\n\"My God! What do you say?\"\n\n\"And I am afraid,\" added Hermann, \"that I am the cause of her death.\"\n\nLizaveta looked at him, and Tomsky's words found an echo in her soul:\n\"This man has at least three crimes upon his conscience!\" Hermann sat\ndown by the window near her, and related all that had happened.\n\nLizaveta listened to him in terror. So all those passionate letters,\nthose ardent desires, this bold obstinate pursuit--all this was not\nlove! Money--that was what his soul yearned for! She could not satisfy\nhis desire and make him happy! The poor girl had been nothing but\nthe blind tool of a robber, of the murderer of her aged\nbenefactress!... She wept bitter tears of agonised repentance. Hermann\ngazed at her in silence: his heart, too, was a prey to violent\nemotion, but neither the tears of the poor girl, nor the wonderful\ncharm of her beauty, enhanced by her grief, could produce any\nimpression upon his hardened soul. He felt no pricking of conscience\nat the thought of the dead old woman. One thing only grieved him: the\nirreparable loss of the secret from which he had expected to obtain\ngreat wealth.\n\n\"You are a monster!\" said Lizaveta at last.\n\n\"I did not wish for her death,\" replied Hermann: \"my pistol was not\nloaded.\"\n\nBoth remained silent.\n\nThe day began to dawn. Lizaveta extinguished her candle: a pale light\nillumined her room. She wiped her tear-stained eyes and raised them\ntowards Hermann: he was sitting near the window, with his arms crossed\nand with a fierce frown upon his forehead. In this attitude he bore a\nstriking resemblance to the portrait of Napoleon. This resemblance\nstruck Lizaveta even.\n\n\"How shall I get you out of the house?\" said she at last. \"I thought\nof conducting you down the secret staircase, but in that case it would\nbe necessary to go through the Countess's bedroom, and I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Tell me how to find this secret staircase--I will go alone.\"\n\nLizaveta arose, took from her drawer a key, handed it to Hermann and\ngave him the necessary instructions. Hermann pressed her cold, limp\nhand, kissed her bowed head, and left the room.\n\nHe descended the winding staircase, and once more entered the\nCountess's bedroom. The dead old lady sat as if petrified; her face\nexpressed profound tranquillity. Hermann stopped before her, and gazed\nlong and earnestly at her, as if he wished to convince himself of the\nterrible reality; at last he entered the cabinet, felt behind the\ntapestry for the door, and then began to descend the dark staircase,\nfilled with strange emotions. \"Down this very staircase,\" thought he,\n\"perhaps coming from the very same room, and at this very same hour\nsixty years ago, there may have glided, in an embroidered coat, with\nhis hair dressed _� l'oiseau royal_ and pressing to his heart his\nthree-cornered hat, some young gallant, who has long been mouldering\nin the grave, but the heart of his aged mistress has only to-day\nceased to beat...\"\n\nAt the bottom of the staircase Hermann found a door, which he opened\nwith a key, and then traversed a corridor which conducted him into the\nstreet.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThree days after the fatal night, at nine o'clock in the morning,\nHermann repaired to the Convent of ----, where the last honours were\nto be paid to the mortal remains of the old Countess. Although feeling\nno remorse, he could not altogether stifle the voice of conscience,\nwhich said to him: \"You are the murderer of the old woman!\" In spite\nof his entertaining very little religious belief, he was exceedingly\nsuperstitious; and believing that the dead Countess might exercise an\nevil influence on his life, he resolved to be present at her obsequies\nin order to implore her pardon.\n\nThe church was full. It was with difficulty that Hermann made his way\nthrough the crowd of people. The coffin was placed upon a rich\ncatafalque beneath a velvet baldachin. The deceased Countess lay\nwithin it, with her hands crossed upon her breast, with a lace cap\nupon her head and dressed in a white satin robe. Around the catafalque\nstood the members of her household: the servants in black _caftans_,\nwith armorial ribbons upon their shoulders, and candles in their\nhands; the relatives--children, grandchildren, and\ngreat-grandchildren--in deep mourning.\n\nNobody wept; tears would have been _une affectation_. The Countess was\nso old, that her death could have surprised nobody, and her relatives\nhad long looked upon her as being out of the world. A famous preacher\npronounced the funeral sermon. In simple and touching words he\ndescribed the peaceful passing away of the righteous, who had passed\nlong years in calm preparation for a Christian end. \"The angel of\ndeath found her,\" said the orator, \"engaged in pious meditation and\nwaiting for the midnight bridegroom.\"\n\nThe service concluded amidst profound silence. The relatives went\nforward first to take farewell of the corpse. Then followed the\nnumerous guests, who had come to render the last homage to her who for\nso many years had been a participator in their frivolous amusements.\nAfter these followed the members of the Countess's household. The last\nof these was an old woman of the same age as the deceased. Two young\nwomen led her forward by the hand. She had not strength enough to bow\ndown to the ground--she merely shed a few tears and kissed the cold\nhand of her mistress.\n\nHermann now resolved to approach the coffin. He knelt down upon the\ncold stones and remained in that position for some minutes; at last he\narose, as pale as the deceased Countess herself; he ascended the steps\nof the catafalque and bent over the corpse... At that moment it seemed\nto him that the dead woman darted a mocking look at him and winked\nwith one eye. Hermann started back, took a false step and fell to the\nground. Several persons hurried forward and raised him up. At the same\nmoment Lizaveta Ivanovna was borne fainting into the porch of the\nchurch. This episode disturbed for some minutes the solemnity of the\ngloomy ceremony. Among the congregation arose a deep murmur, and a\ntall thin chamberlain, a near relative of the deceased, whispered in\nthe ear of an Englishman who was standing near him, that the young\nofficer was a natural son of the Countess, to which the Englishman\ncoldly replied: \"Oh!\"\n\nDuring the whole of that day, Hermann was strangely excited. Repairing\nto an out-of-the-way restaurant to dine, he drank a great deal of\nwine, contrary to his usual custom, in the hope of deadening his\ninward agitation. But the wine only served to excite his imagination\nstill more. On returning home, he threw himself upon his bed without\nundressing, and fell into a deep sleep.\n\nWhen he woke up it was already night, and the moon was shining into\nthe room. He looked at his watch: it was a quarter to three. Sleep had\nleft him; he sat down upon his bed and thought of the funeral of the\nold Countess.\n\nAt that moment somebody in the street looked in at his window, and\nimmediately passed on again. Hermann paid no attention to this\nincident. A few moments afterwards he heard the door of his ante-room\nopen. Hermann thought that it was his orderly, drunk as usual,\nreturning from some nocturnal expedition, but presently he heard\nfootsteps that were unknown to him: somebody was walking softly over\nthe floor in slippers. The door opened, and a woman dressed in white,\nentered the room. Hermann mistook her for his old nurse, and wondered\nwhat could bring her there at that hour of the night. But the white\nwoman glided rapidly across the room and stood before him--and Hermann\nrecognised the Countess!\n\n\"I have come to you against my wish,\" she said in a firm voice: \"but I\nhave been ordered to grant your request. Three, seven, ace, will win\nfor you if played in succession, but only on these conditions: that\nyou do not play more than one card in twenty-four hours, and that you\nnever play again during the rest of your life. I forgive you my death,\non condition that you marry my companion, Lizaveta Ivanovna.\"\n\nWith these words she turned round very quietly, walked with a\nshuffling gait towards the door and disappeared. Hermann heard the\nstreet-door open and shut, and again he saw some one look in at him\nthrough the window.\n\nFor a long time Hermann could not recover himself. He then rose up and\nentered the next room. His orderly was lying asleep upon the floor,\nand he had much difficulty in waking him. The orderly was drunk as\nusual, and no information could be obtained from him. The street-door\nwas locked. Hermann returned to his room, lit his candle, and wrote\ndown all the details of his vision.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two\nbodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\n\"Three, seven, ace,\" soon drove out of Hermann's mind the thought of\nthe dead Countess. \"Three, seven, ace,\" were perpetually running\nthrough his head and continually being repeated by his lips. If he saw\na young girl, he would say: \"How slender she is! quite like the three\nof hearts.\" If anybody asked: \"What is the time?\" he would reply:\n\"Five minutes to seven.\" Every stout man that he saw reminded him of\nthe ace. \"Three, seven, ace\" haunted him in his sleep, and assumed all\npossible shapes. The threes bloomed before him in the forms of\nmagnificent flowers, the sevens were represented by Gothic portals,\nand the aces became transformed into gigantic spiders. One thought\nalone occupied his whole mind--to make a profitable use of the secret\nwhich he had purchased so dearly. He thought of applying for a\nfurlough so as to travel abroad. He wanted to go to Paris and tempt\nfortune in some of the public gambling-houses that abounded there.\nChance spared him all this trouble.\n\nThere was in Moscow a society of rich gamesters, presided over by the\ncelebrated Chekalinsky, who had passed all his life at the card-table\nand had amassed millions, accepting bills of exchange for his winnings\nand paying his losses in ready money. His long experience secured for\nhim the confidence of his companions, and his open house, his famous\ncook, and his agreeable and fascinating manners gained for him the\nrespect of the public. He came to St. Petersburg. The young men of the\ncapital flocked to his rooms, forgetting balls for cards, and\npreferring the emotions of faro to the seductions of flirting. Narumov\nconducted Hermann to Chekalinsky's residence.\n\nThey passed through a suite of magnificent rooms, filled with\nattentive domestics. The place was crowded. Generals and Privy\nCounsellors were playing at whist; young men were lolling carelessly\nupon the velvet-covered sofas, eating ices and smoking pipes. In the\ndrawing-room, at the head of a long table, around which were assembled\nabout a score of players, sat the master of the house keeping the\nbank. He was a man of about sixty years of age, of a very dignified\nappearance; his head was covered with silvery-white hair; his full,\nflorid countenance expressed good-nature, and his eyes twinkled with a\nperpetual smile. Narumov introduced Hermann to him. Chekalinsky shook\nhim by the hand in a friendly manner, requested him not to stand on\nceremony, and then went on dealing.\n\nThe game occupied some time. On the table lay more than thirty cards.\nChekalinsky paused after each throw, in order to give the players time\nto arrange their cards and note down their losses, listened politely\nto their requests, and more politely still, put straight the corners\nof cards that some player's hand had chanced to bend. At last the game\nwas finished. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards and prepared to deal\nagain.\n\n\"Will you allow me to take a card?\" said Hermann, stretching out his\nhand from behind a stout gentleman who was punting.\n\nChekalinsky smiled and bowed silently, as a sign of acquiescence.\nNarumov laughingly congratulated Hermann on his abjuration of that\nabstention from cards which he had practised for so long a period, and\nwished him a lucky beginning.\n\n\"Stake!\" said Hermann, writing some figures with chalk on the back of\nhis card.\n\n\"How much?\" asked the banker, contracting the muscles of his eyes;\n\"excuse me, I cannot see quite clearly.\"\n\n\"Forty-seven thousand rubles,\" replied Hermann.\n\nAt these words every head in the room turned suddenly round, and all\neyes were fixed upon Hermann.\n\n\"He has taken leave of his senses!\" thought Narumov.\n\n\"Allow me to inform you,\" said Chekalinsky, with his eternal smile,\n\"that you are playing very high; nobody here has ever staked more than\ntwo hundred and seventy-five rubles at once.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Hermann; \"but do you accept my card or not?\"\n\nChekalinsky bowed in token of consent.\n\n\"I only wish to observe,\" said he, \"that although I have the greatest\nconfidence in my friends, I can only play against ready money. For my\nown part, I am quite convinced that your word is sufficient, but for\nthe sake of the order of the game, and to facilitate the reckoning up,\nI must ask you to put the money on your card.\"\n\nHermann drew from his pocket a bank-note and handed it to Chekalinsky,\nwho, after examining it in a cursory manner, placed it on Hermann's\ncard.\n\nHe began to deal. On the right a nine turned up, and on the left a\nthree.\n\n\"I have won!\" said Hermann, showing his card.\n\nA murmur of astonishment arose among the players. Chekalinsky frowned,\nbut the smile quickly returned to his face.\n\n\"Do you wish me to settle with you?\" he said to Hermann.\n\n\"If you please,\" replied the latter.\n\nChekalinsky drew from his pocket a number of banknotes and paid at\nonce. Hermann took up his money and left the table. Narumov could not\nrecover from his astonishment. Hermann drank a glass of lemonade and\nreturned home.\n\nThe next evening he again repaired to Chekalinsky's. The host was\ndealing. Hermann walked up to the table; the punters immediately made\nroom for him. Chekalinsky greeted him with a gracious bow.\n\nHermann waited for the next deal, took a card and placed upon it his\nforty-seven thousand roubles, together with his winnings of the\nprevious evening.\n\nChekalinsky began to deal. A knave turned up on the right, a seven on\nthe left.\n\nHermann showed his seven.\n\nThere was a general exclamation. Chekalinsky was evidently ill at\nease, but he counted out the ninety-four thousand rubles and handed\nthem over to Hermann, who pocketed them in the coolest manner possible\nand immediately left the house.\n\nThe next evening Hermann appeared again at the table. Every one was\nexpecting him. The generals and Privy Counsellors left their whist in\norder to watch such extraordinary play. The young officers quitted\ntheir sofas, and even the servants crowded into the room. All pressed\nround Hermann. The other players left off punting, impatient to see\nhow it would end. Hermann stood at the table and prepared to play\nalone against the pale, but still smiling Chekalinsky. Each opened a\npack of cards. Chekalinsky shuffled. Hermann took a card and covered\nit with a pile of bank-notes. It was like a duel. Deep silence reigned\naround.\n\nChekalinsky began to deal; his hands trembled. On the right a queen\nturned up, and on the left an ace.\n\n\"Ace has won!\" cried Hermann, showing his card.\n\n\"Your queen has lost,\" said Chekalinsky, politely.\n\nHermann started; instead of an ace, there lay before him the queen of\nspades! He could not believe his eyes, nor could he understand how he\nhad made such a mistake.\n\nAt that moment it seemed to him that the queen of spades smiled\nironically and winked her eye at him. He was struck by her remarkable\nresemblance...\n\n\"The old Countess!\" he exclaimed, seized with terror.\n\nChekalinsky gathered up his winnings. For some time, Hermann remained\nperfectly motionless. When at last he left the table, there was a\ngeneral commotion in the room.\n\n\"Splendidly punted!\" said the players. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards\nafresh, and the game went on as usual.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHermann went out of his mind, and is now confined in room Number 17 of\nthe Obukhov Hospital. He never answers any questions, but he\nconstantly mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace!\" \"Three,\nseven, queen!\"\n\nLizaveta Ivanovna has married a very amiable young man, a son of the\nformer steward of the old Countess. He is in the service of the State\nsomewhere, and is in receipt of a good income. Lizaveta is also\nsupporting a poor relative.\n\nTomsky has been promoted to the rank of captain, and has become the\nhusband of the Princess Pauline.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOAK\n\n\n\nBY NIKOLAY V. GOGOL\n\n\nIn the department of----, but it is better not to mention the\ndepartment. The touchiest things in the world are departments,\nregiments, courts of justice, in a word, all branches of public\nservice. Each individual nowadays thinks all society insulted in his\nperson. Quite recently, a complaint was received from a district chief\nof police in which he plainly demonstrated that all the imperial\ninstitutions were going to the dogs, and that the Czar's sacred name\nwas being taken in vain; and in proof he appended to the complaint a\nromance, in which the district chief of police is made to appear about\nonce in every ten pages, and sometimes in a downright drunken\ncondition. Therefore, in order to avoid all unpleasantness, it will be\nbetter to designate the department in question, as a certain\ndepartment.\n\nSo, in a certain department there was a certain official--not a very\nnotable one, it must be allowed--short of stature, somewhat\npock-marked, red-haired, and mole-eyed, with a bald forehead, wrinkled\ncheeks, and a complexion of the kind known as sanguine. The St.\nPetersburg climate was responsible for this. As for his official\nrank--with us Russians the rank comes first--he was what is called a\nperpetual titular councillor, over which, as is well known, some\nwriters make merry and crack their jokes, obeying the praiseworthy\ncustom of attacking those who cannot bite back.\n\nHis family name was Bashmachkin. This name is evidently derived from\nbashmak (shoe); but, when, at what time, and in what manner, is not\nknown. His father and grandfather, and all the Bashmachkins, always\nwore boots, which were resoled two or three times a year. His name was\nAkaky Akakiyevich. It may strike the reader as rather singular and\nfar-fetched; but he may rest assured that it was by no means\nfar-fetched, and that the circumstances were such that it would have\nbeen impossible to give him any other.\n\nThis was how it came about.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich was born, if my memory fails me not, in the evening\non the 23rd of March. His mother, the wife of a Government official,\nand a very fine woman, made all due arrangements for having the child\nbaptised. She was lying on the bed opposite the door; on her right\nstood the godfather, Ivan Ivanovich Eroshkin, a most estimable man,\nwho served as the head clerk of the senate; and the godmother, Arina\nSemyonovna Bielobrinshkova, the wife of an officer of the quarter, and\na woman of rare virtues. They offered the mother her choice of three\nnames, Mokiya, Sossiya, or that the child should be called after the\nmartyr Khozdazat. \"No,\" said the good woman, \"all those names are\npoor.\" In order to please her, they opened the calendar at another\nplace; three more names appeared, Triphily, Dula, and Varakhasy. \"This\nis awful,\" said the old woman. \"What names! I truly never heard the\nlike. I might have put up with Varadat or Varukh, but not Triphily and\nVarakhasy!\" They turned to another page and found Pavsikakhy and\nVakhtisy. \"Now I see,\" said the old woman, \"that it is plainly fate.\nAnd since such is the case, it will be better to name him after his\nfather. His father's name was Akaky, so let his son's name be Akaky\ntoo.\" In this manner he became Akaky Akakiyevich. They christened the\nchild, whereat he wept, and made a grimace, as though he foresaw that\nhe was to be a titular councillor.\n\nIn this manner did it all come about. We have mentioned it in order\nthat the reader might see for himself that it was a case of necessity,\nand that it was utterly impossible to give him any other name.\n\nWhen and how he entered the department, and who appointed him, no one\ncould remember. However much the directors and chiefs of all kinds\nwere changed, he was always to be seen in the same place, the same\nattitude, the same occupation--always the letter-copying clerk--so\nthat it was afterwards affirmed that he had been born in uniform with\na bald head. No respect was shown him in the department. The porter\nnot only did not rise from his seat when he passed, but never even\nglanced at him, any more than if a fly had flown through the\nreception-room. His superiors treated him in coolly despotic fashion.\nSome insignificant assistant to the head clerk would thrust a paper\nunder his nose without so much as saying, \"Copy,\" or, \"Here's an\ninteresting little case,\" or anything else agreeable, as is customary\namongst well-bred officials. And he took it, looking only at the\npaper, and not observing who handed it to him, or whether he had the\nright to do so; simply took it, and set about copying it.\n\nThe young officials laughed at and made fun of him, so far as their\nofficial wit permitted; told in his presence various stories concocted\nabout him, and about his landlady, an old woman of seventy; declared\nthat she beat him; asked when the wedding was to be; and strewed bits\nof paper over his head, calling them snow. But Akaky Akakiyevich\nanswered not a word, any more than if there had been no one there\nbesides himself. It even had no effect upon his work. Amid all these\nannoyances he never made a single mistake in a letter. But if the\njoking became wholly unbearable, as when they jogged his head, and\nprevented his attending to his work, he would exclaim:\n\n\"Leave me alone! Why do you insult me?\"\n\nAnd there was something strange in the words and the voice in which\nthey were uttered. There was in it something which moved to pity; so\nmuch so that one young man, a newcomer, who, taking pattern by the\nothers, had permitted himself to make sport of Akaky, suddenly stopped\nshort, as though all about him had undergone a transformation, and\npresented itself in a different aspect. Some unseen force repelled him\nfrom the comrades whose acquaintance he had made, on the supposition\nthat they were decent, well-bred men. Long afterwards, in his gayest\nmoments, there recurred to his mind the little official with the bald\nforehead, with his heart-rending words, \"Leave me alone! Why do you\ninsult me?\" In these moving words, other words resounded--\"I am thy\nbrother.\" And the young man covered his face with his hand; and many a\ntime afterwards, in the course of his life, shuddered at seeing how\nmuch inhumanity there is in man, how much savage coarseness is\nconcealed beneath refined, cultured, worldly refinement, and even, O\nGod! in that man whom the world acknowledges as honourable and\nupright.\n\nIt would be difficult to find another man who lived so entirely for\nhis duties. It is not enough to say that Akaky laboured with zeal; no,\nhe laboured with love. In his copying, he found a varied and agreeable\nemployment. Enjoyment was written on his face; some letters were even\nfavourites with him; and when he encountered these, he smiled, winked,\nand worked with his lips, till it seemed as though each letter might\nbe read in his face, as his pen traced it. If his pay had been in\nproportion to his zeal, he would, perhaps, to his great surprise, have\nbeen made even a councillor of state. But he worked, as his\ncompanions, the wits, put it, like a horse in a mill.\n\nHowever, it would be untrue to say that no attention was paid to him.\nOne director being a kindly man, and desirous of rewarding him for his\nlong service, ordered him to be given something more important than\nmere copying. So he was ordered to make a report of an already\nconcluded affair, to another department; the duty consisting simply in\nchanging the heading and altering a few words from the first to the\nthird person. This caused him so much toil, that he broke into a\nperspiration, rubbed his forehead, and finally said, \"No, give me\nrather something to copy.\" After that they let him copy on forever.\n\nOutside this copying, it appeared that nothing existed for him. He\ngave no thought to his clothes. His uniform was not green, but a sort\nof rusty-meal colour. The collar was low, so that his neck, in spite\nof the fact that it was not long, seemed inordinately so as it emerged\nfrom it, like the necks of the plaster cats which pedlars carry about\non their heads. And something was always sticking to his uniform,\neither a bit of hay or some trifle. Moreover, he had a peculiar knack,\nas he walked along the street, of arriving beneath a window just as\nall sorts of rubbish was being flung out of it; hence he always bore\nabout on his hat scraps of melon rinds, and other such articles. Never\nonce in his life did he give heed to what was going on every day to\nthe street; while it is well known that his young brother officials\ntrained the range of their glances till they could see when any one's\ntrouser-straps came undone upon the opposite sidewalk, which always\nbrought a malicious smile to their faces. But Akaky Akakiyevich saw in\nall things the clean, even strokes of his written lines; and only when\na horse thrust his nose, from some unknown quarter, over his shoulder,\nand sent a whole gust of wind down his neck from his nostrils, did he\nobserve that he was not in the middle of a line, but in the middle of\nthe street.\n\nOn reaching home, he sat down at once at the table, sipped his\ncabbage-soup up quickly, and swallowed a bit of beef with onions,\nnever noticing their taste, and gulping down everything with flies and\nanything else which the Lord happened to send at the moment. When he\nsaw that his stomach was beginning to swell, he rose from the table,\nand copied papers which he had brought home. If there happened to be\nnone, he took copies for himself, for his own gratification,\nespecially if the document was noteworthy, not on account of its\nstyle, but of its being addressed to some distinguished person.\n\nEven at the hour when the grey St. Petersburg sky had quite\ndisappeared, and all the official world had eaten or dined, each as he\ncould, in accordance with the salary he received and his own fancy;\nwhen, all were resting from the department jar of pens, running to and\nfro, for their own and other people's indispensable occupations', and\nfrom all the work that an uneasy man makes willingly for himself,\nrather than what is necessary; when, officials hasten to dedicate to\npleasure the time which is left to them, one bolder than the rest,\ngoing to the theatre; another; into the street looking under the\nbonnets; another, wasting his evening in compliments to some pretty\ngirl, the star of a small official circle; another--and this is the\ncommon case of all--visiting his comrades on the third or fourth\nfloor, in two small rooms with an ante-room or kitchen, and some\npretensions to fashion, such as a lamp or some other trifle which has\ncost many a sacrifice of dinner or pleasure trip; in a word, at the\nhour when all officials disperse among the contracted quarters of\ntheir friends, to play whist, as they sip their tea from glasses with\na kopek's worth of sugar, smoke long pipes, relate at time some bits\nof gossip which a Russian man can never, under any circumstances,\nrefrain from, and when there is nothing else to talk of, repeat\neternal anecdotes about the commandant to whom they had sent word that\nthe tails of the horses on the Falconet Monument had been cut off;\nwhen all strive to divert themselves, Akaky Akakiyevich indulged in no\nkind of diversion. No one could even say that he had seen him at any\nkind of evening party. Having written to his heart's content, he lay\ndown to sleep, smiling at the thought of the coming day--of what God\nmight send him to copy on the morrow.\n\nThus flowed on the peaceful life of the man, who, with a salary of\nfour hundred rubles, understood how to be content with his lot; and\nthus it would have continued to flow on, perhaps, to extreme old age,\nwere it not that there are various ills strewn along the path of life\nfor titular councillors as well as for private, actual, court, and\nevery other species of councillor, even to those who never give any\nadvice or take any themselves.\n\nThere exists in St. Petersburg a powerful foe of all who receive a\nsalary of four hundred rubles a year, or there-abouts. This foe is no\nother than the Northern cold, although it is said to be very healthy.\nAt nine o'clock in the morning, at the very hour when the streets are\nfilled with men bound for the various official departments, it begins\nto bestow such powerful and piercing nips on all noses impartially,\nthat the poor officials really do not know what to do with them. At an\nhour, when the foreheads of even those who occupy exalted positions\nache with the cold, and tears start to their eyes, the poor titular\ncouncillors are sometimes quite unprotected. Their only salvation lies\nin traversing as quickly as possible, in their thin little cloaks,\nfive or six streets, and then warming their feet in the porter's room,\nand so thawing all their talents and qualifications for official\nservice, which had become frozen on the way.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich had felt for some time that his back and shoulders\nwere paining with peculiar poignancy, in spite of the fact that he\ntried to traverse the distance with all possible speed. He began\nfinally to wonder whether the fault did not lie in his cloak. He\nexamined it thoroughly at home, and discovered that in two places,\nnamely, on the back and shoulders, it had become thin as gauze. The\ncloth was worn to such a degree that he could see through it, and the\nlining had fallen into pieces. You must know that Akaky Akakiyevich's\ncloak served as an object of ridicule to the officials. They even\nrefused it the noble name of cloak, and called it a cape. In fact, it\nwas of singular make, its collar diminishing year by year to serve to\npatch its other parts. The patching did not exhibit great skill on the\npart of the tailor, and was, in fact, baggy and ugly. Seeing how the\nmatter stood, Akaky Akakiyevich decided that it would be necessary to\ntake the cloak to Petrovich, the tailor, who lived somewhere on the\nfourth floor up a dark staircase, and who, in spite of his having but\none eye and pock-marks all over his face, busied himself with\nconsiderable success in repairing the trousers and coats of officials\nand others; that is to say, when he was sober and not nursing some\nother scheme in his head.\n\nIt is not necessary to say much about this tailor, but as it is the\ncustom to have the character of each personage in a novel clearly\ndefined there is no help for it, so here is Petrovich the tailor. At\nfirst he was called only Grigory, and was some gentleman's serf. He\ncommenced calling himself Petrovich from the time when he received his\nfree papers, and further began to drink heavily on all holidays, at\nfirst on the great ones, and then on all church festivals without\ndiscrimination, wherever a cross stood in the calendar. On this point\nhe was faithful to ancestral custom; and when quarrelling with his\nwife, he called her a low female and a German. As we have mentioned\nhis wife, it will be necessary to say a word or two about her.\nUnfortunately, little is known of her beyond the fact that Petrovich\nhad a wife, who wore a cap and a dress, but could not lay claim to\nbeauty, at least, no one but the soldiers of the guard even looked\nunder her cap when they met her.\n\nAscending the staircase which led to Petrovich's room--which staircase\nwas all soaked with dish-water and reeked with the smell of spirits\nwhich affects the eyes, and is an inevitable adjunct to all dark\nstairways in St. Petersburg houses--ascending the stairs, Akaky\nAkakiyevich pondered how much Petrovich would ask, and mentally\nresolved not to give more than two rubles. The door was open, for the\nmistress, in cooking some fish, had raised such a smoke in the kitchen\nthat not even the beetles were visible. Akaky Akakiyevich passed\nthrough the kitchen unperceived, even by the housewife, and at length\nreached a room where he beheld Petrovich seated on a large unpainted\ntable, with his legs tucked under him like a Turkish pasha. His feet\nwere bare, after the fashion of tailors as they sit at work; and the\nfirst thing which caught the eye was his thumb, with a deformed nail\nthick and strong as a turtle's shell. About Petrovich's neck hung a\nskein of silk and thread, and upon his knees lay some old garment. He\nhad been trying unsuccessfully for three minutes to thread his needle,\nand was enraged at the darkness and even at the thread, growling in a\nlow voice, \"It won't go through, the barbarian! you pricked me, you\nrascal!\"\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich was vexed at arriving at the precise moment when\nPetrovich was angry. He liked to order something of Petrovich when he\nwas a little downhearted, or, as his wife expressed it, \"when he had\nsettled himself with brandy, the one-eyed devil!\" Under such\ncircumstances Petrovich generally came down in his price very readily,\nand even bowed and returned thanks. Afterwards, to be sure, his wife\nwould come, complaining that her husband had been drunk, and so had\nfixed the price too low; but, if only a ten-kopek piece were added\nthen the matter would be settled. But now it appeared that Petrovich\nwas in a sober condition, and therefore rough, taciturn, and inclined\nto demand, Satan only knows what price. Akaky Akakiyevich felt this,\nand would gladly have beat a retreat, but he was in for it. Petrovich\nscrewed up his one eye very intently at him, and Akaky Akakiyevich\ninvoluntarily said, \"How do you do, Petrovich?\"\n\n\"I wish you a good morning, sir,\" said Petrovich squinting at Akaky\nAkakiyevich's hands, to see what sort of booty he had brought.\n\n\"Ah! I--to you, Petrovich, this--\" It must be known that Akaky\nAkakiyevich expressed himself chiefly by prepositions, adverbs, and\nscraps of phrases which had no meaning whatever. If the matter was a\nvery difficult one, he had a habit of never completing his sentences,\nso that frequently, having begun a phrase with the words, \"This, in\nfact, is quite--\" he forgot to go on, thinking he had already finished\nit.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Petrovich, and with his one eye scanned Akaky\nAkakiyevich's whole uniform from the collar down to the cuffs, the\nback, the tails and the button-holes, all of which were well known to\nhim, since they were his own handiwork. Such is the habit of tailors;\nit is the first thing they do on meeting one.\n\n\"But I, here, this--Petrovich--a cloak, cloth--here you see,\neverywhere, in different places, it is quite strong--it is a little\ndusty and looks old, but it is new, only here in one place it is a\nlittle--on the back, and here on one of the shoulders, it is a little\nworn, yes, here on this shoulder it is a little--do you see? That is\nall. And a little work--\"\n\nPetrovich took the cloak, spread it out, to begin with, on the table,\nlooked at it hard, shook his head, reached out his hand to the\nwindow-sill for his snuff-box, adorned with the portrait of some\ngeneral, though what general is unknown, for the place where the face\nshould have been had been rubbed through by the finger and a square\nbit of paper had been pasted over it. Having taken a pinch of snuff,\nPetrovich held up the cloak, and inspected it against the light, and\nagain shook his head. Then he turned it, lining upwards, and shook his\nhead once more. After which he again lifted the general-adorned lid\nwith its bit of pasted paper, and having stuffed his nose with snuff,\ndosed and put away the snuff-box, and said finally, \"No, it is\nimpossible to mend it. It is a wretched garment!\"\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich's heart sank at these words.\n\n\"Why is it impossible, Petrovich?\" he said, almost in the pleading\nvoice of a child. \"All that ails it is, that it is worn on the\nshoulders. You must have some pieces--\"\n\n\"Yes, patches could be found, patches are easily found,\" said\nPetrovich, \"but there's nothing to sew them to. The thing is\ncompletely rotten. If you put a needle to it--see, it will give way.\"\n\n\"Let it give way, and you can put on another patch at once.\"\n\n\"But there is nothing to put the patches on to. There's no use in\nstrengthening it. It is too far gone. It's lucky that it's cloth, for,\nif the wind were to blow, it would fly away.\"\n\n\"Well, strengthen it again. How this, in fact--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Petrovich decisively, \"there is nothing to be done with it.\nIt's a thoroughly bad job. You'd better, when the cold winter weather\ncomes on, make yourself some gaiters out of it, because stockings are\nnot warm. The Germans invented them in order to make more money.\"\nPetrovich loved on all occasions to have a fling at the Germans. \"But\nit is plain you must have a new cloak.\"\n\nAt the word \"new\" all grew dark before Akaky Akakiyevich's eyes, and\neverything in the room began to whirl round. The only thing he saw\nclearly was the general with the paper face on the lid of Petrovich's\nsnuff-box. \"A new one?\" said he, as if still in a dream. \"Why, I have\nno money for that.\"\n\n\"Yes, a new one,\" said Petrovich, with barbarous composure.\n\n\"Well, if it came to a new one, how--it--\"\n\n\"You mean how much would it cost?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you would have to lay out a hundred and fifty or more,\" said\nPetrovich, and pursed up his lips significantly. He liked to produce\npowerful effects, liked to stun utterly and suddenly, and then to\nglance sideways to see what face the stunned person would put on the\nmatter.\n\n\"A hundred and fifty rubles for a cloak!\" shrieked poor Akaky\nAkakiyevich, perhaps for the first time in his life, for his voice had\nalways been distinguished for softness.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Petrovich, \"for any kind of cloak. If you have a\nmarten fur on the collar, or a silk-lined hood, it will mount up to\ntwo hundred.\"\n\n\"Petrovich, please,\" said Akaky Akakiyevich in a beseeching tone, not\nhearing, and not trying to hear, Petrovich's words, and disregarding\nall his \"effects,\" \"some repairs, in order that it may wear yet a\nlittle longer.\"\n\n\"No, it would only be a waste of time and money,\" said Petrovich. And\nAkaky Akakiyevich went away after these words, utterly discouraged.\nBut Petrovich stood for some time after his departure, with\nsignificantly compressed lips, and without betaking himself to his\nwork, satisfied that he would not be dropped, and an artistic tailor\nemployed.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich went out into the street as if in a dream. \"Such an\naffair!\" he said to himself. \"I did not think it had come to--\" and\nthen after a pause, he added, \"Well, so it is! see what it has come to\nat last! and I never imagined that it was so!\" Then followed a long\nsilence, after which he exclaimed, \"Well, so it is! see what\nalready--nothing unexpected that--it would be nothing--what a strange\ncircumstance!\" So saying, instead of going home, he went in exactly\nthe opposite direction without suspecting it. On the way, a\nchimney-sweep bumped up against him, and blackened his shoulder, and a\nwhole hatful of rubbish landed on him from the top of a house which\nwas building. He did not notice it, and only when he ran against a\nwatchman, who, having planted his halberd beside him, was shaking some\nsnuff from his box into his horny hand, did he recover himself a\nlittle, and that because the watchman said, \"Why are you poking\nyourself into a man's very face? Haven't you the pavement?\" This\ncaused him to look about him, and turn towards home.\n\nThere only, he finally began to collect his thoughts, and to survey\nhis position in its clear and actual light, and to argue with himself,\nsensibly and frankly, as with a reasonable friend, with whom one can\ndiscuss private and personal matters. \"No,\" said Akaky Akakiyevich,\n\"it is impossible to reason with Petrovich now. He is that--evidently,\nhis wife has been beating him. I'd better go to him on Sunday morning.\nAfter Saturday night he will be a little cross-eyed and sleepy, for he\nwill want to get drunk, and his wife won't give him any money, and at\nsuch a time, a ten-kopek piece in his hand will--he will become more\nfit to reason with, and then the cloak and that--\" Thus argued Akaky\nAkakiyevich with himself regained his courage, and waited until the\nfirst Sunday, when, seeing from afar that Petrovich's wife had left\nthe house, he went straight to him.\n\nPetrovich's eye was indeed very much askew after Saturday. His head\ndrooped, and he was very sleepy; but for all that, as soon as he knew\nwhat it was a question of, it seemed as though Satan jogged his\nmemory. \"Impossible,\" said he. \"Please to order a new one.\" Thereupon\nAkaky Akakiyevich handed over the ten-kopek piece. \"Thank you, sir. I\nwill drink your good health,\" said Petrovich. \"But as for the cloak,\ndon't trouble yourself about it; it is good for nothing. I will make\nyou a capital new one, so let us settle about it now.\"\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich was still for mending it, but Petrovich would not\nhear of it, and said, \"I shall certainly have to make you a new one,\nand you may depend upon it that I shall do my best. It may even be, as\nthe fashion goes, that the collar can be fastened by silver hooks\nunder a flap.\"\n\nThen Akaky Akakiyevich saw that it was impossible to get along without\na new cloak, and his spirit sank utterly. How, in fact, was it to be\ndone? Where was the money to come from? He must have some new\ntrousers, and pay a debt of long standing to the shoemaker for putting\nnew tops to his old boots, and he must order three shirts from the\nseamstress, and a couple of pieces of linen. In short, all his money\nmust be spent. And even if the director should be so kind as to order\nhim to receive forty-five or even fifty rubles instead of forty, it\nwould be a mere nothing, a mere drop in the ocean towards the funds\nnecessary for a cloak, although he knew that Petrovich was often\nwrong-headed enough to blurt out some outrageous price, so that even\nhis own wife could not refrain from exclaiming, \"Have you lost your\nsenses, you fool?\" At one time he would not work at any price, and now\nit was quite likely that he had named a higher sum than the cloak\nwould cost.\n\nBut although he knew that Petrovich would undertake to make a cloak\nfor eighty rubles, still, where was he to get the eighty rubles from?\nHe might possibly manage half. Yes, half might be procured, but where\nwas the other half to come from? But the reader must first be told\nwhere the first half came from.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich had a habit of putting, for every ruble he spent, a\ngroschen into a small box, fastened with lock and key, and with a slit\nin the top for the reception of money. At the end of every half-year\nhe counted over the heap of coppers, and changed it for silver. This\nhe had done for a long time, and in the course of years, the sum had\nmounted up to over forty rubles. Thus he had one half on hand. But\nwhere was he to find the other half? Where was he to get another forty\nrubles from? Akaky Akakiyevich thought and thought, and decided that\nit would be necessary to curtail his ordinary expenses, for the space\nof one year at least, to dispense with tea in the evening, to burn no\ncandles, and, if there was anything which he must do, to go into his\nlandlady's room, and work by her light. When he went into the street,\nhe must walk as lightly as he could, and as cautiously, upon the\nstones, almost upon tiptoe, in order not to wear his heels down in too\nshort a time. He must give the laundress as little to wash as\npossible; and, in order not to wear out his clothes, he must take them\noff as soon as he got home, and wear only his cotton dressing-gown,\nwhich had been long and carefully saved.\n\nTo tell the truth, it was a little hard for him at first to accustom\nhimself to these deprivations. But he got used to them at length,\nafter a fashion, and all went smoothly. He even got used to being\nhungry in the evening, but he made up for it by treating himself, so\nto say, in spirit, by bearing ever in mind the idea of his future\ncloak. From that time forth, his existence seemed to become, in some\nway, fuller, as if he were married, or as if some other man lived in\nhim, as if, in fact, he were not alone, and some pleasant friend had\nconsented to travel along life's path with him, the friend being no\nother than the cloak, with thick wadding and a strong lining incapable\nof wearing out. He became more lively, and even his character grew\nfirmer, like that of a man who has made up his mind, and set himself a\ngoal. From his face and gait, doubt and indecision, all hesitating and\nwavering disappeared of themselves. Fire gleamed in his eyes, and\noccasionally the boldest and most daring ideas flitted through his\nmind. Why not, for instance, have marten fur on the collar? The\nthought of this almost made him absent-minded. Once, in copying a\nletter, he nearly made a mistake, so that he exclaimed almost aloud,\n\"Ugh!\" and crossed himself. Once, in the course of every month, he had\na conference with Petrovich on the subject of the cloak, where it\nwould be better to buy the cloth, and the colour, and the price. He\nalways returned home satisfied, though troubled, reflecting that the\ntime would come at last when it could all be bought, and then the\ncloak made.\n\nThe affair progressed more briskly than he had expected. For beyond\nall his hopes, the director awarded neither forty nor forty-five\nrubles for Akaky Akakiyevich's share, but sixty. Whether he suspected\nthat Akaky Akakiyevich needed a cloak, or whether it was merely\nchance, at all events, twenty extra rubles were by this means\nprovided. This circumstance hastened matters. Two or three months more\nof hunger and Akaky Akakiyevich had accumulated about eighty rubles.\nHis heart, generally so quiet, began to throb. On the first possible\nday, he went shopping in company with Petrovich. They bought some very\ngood cloth, and at a reasonable rate too, for they had been\nconsidering the matter for six months, and rarely let a month pass\nwithout their visiting the shops to enquire prices. Petrovich himself\nsaid that no better cloth could be had. For lining, they selected a\ncotton stuff, but so firm and thick, that Petrovich declared it to be\nbetter than silk, and even prettier and more glossy. They did not buy\nthe marten fur, because it was, in fact, dear, but in its stead, they\npicked out the very best of cat-skin which could be found in the shop,\nand which might, indeed, be taken for marten at a distance.\n\nPetrovich worked at the cloak two whole weeks, for there was a great\ndeal of quilting; otherwise it would have been finished sooner. He\ncharged twelve rubles for the job, it could not possibly have been\ndone for less. It was all sewed with silk, in small, double seams, and\nPetrovich went over each seam afterwards with his own teeth, stamping\nin various patterns.\n\nIt was--it is difficult to say precisely on what day, but probably the\nmost glorious one in Akaky Akakiyevich's life, when Petrovich at\nlength brought home the cloak. He brought it in the morning, before\nthe hour when it was necessary to start for the department. Never did\na cloak arrive so exactly in the nick of time, for the severe cold had\nset in, and it seemed to threaten to increase. Petrovich brought the\ncloak himself as befits a good tailor. On his countenance was a\nsignificant expression, such as Akaky Akakiyevich had never beheld\nthere. He seemed fully sensible that he had done no small deed, and\ncrossed a gulf separating tailors who put in linings, and execute\nrepairs, from those who make new things. He took the cloak out of the\npocket-handkerchief in which he had brought it. The handkerchief was\nfresh from the laundress, and he put it in his pocket for use. Taking\nout the cloak, he gazed proudly at it, held it up with both hands, and\nflung it skilfully over the shoulders of Akaky Akakiyevich. Then he\npulled it and fitted it down behind with his hand, and he draped it\naround Akaky Akakiyevich without buttoning it. Akaky Akakiyevich, like\nan experienced man, wished to try the sleeves. Petrovich helped him on\nwith them, and it turned out that the sleeves were satisfactory also.\nIn short, the cloak appeared to be perfect, and most seasonable.\nPetrovich did not neglect to observe that it was only because he lived\nin a narrow street, and had no signboard, and had known Akaky\nAkakiyevich so long, that he had made it so cheaply; but that if he\nhad been in business on the Nevsky Prospect, he would have charged\nseventy-five rubles for the making alone. Akaky Akakiyevich did not\ncare to argue this point with Petrovich. He paid him, thanked him, and\nset out at once in his new cloak for the department. Petrovich\nfollowed him, and pausing in the street, gazed long at the cloak in\nthe distance, after which he went to one side expressly to run through\na crooked alley, and emerge again into the street beyond to gaze once\nmore upon the cloak from another point, namely, directly in front.\n\nMeantime Akaky Akakiyevich went on in holiday mood. He was conscious\nevery second of the time that he had a new cloak on his shoulders, and\nseveral times he laughed with internal satisfaction. In fact, there\nwere two advantages, one was its warmth, the other its beauty. He saw\nnothing of the road, but suddenly found himself at the department. He\ntook off his cloak in the ante-room, looked it over carefully, and\nconfided it to the special care of the attendant. It is impossible to\nsay precisely how it was that every one in the department knew at once\nthat Akaky Akakiyevich had a new cloak, and that the \"cape\" no longer\nexisted. All rushed at the same moment into the ante-room to inspect\nit. They congratulated him, and said pleasant things to him, so that\nhe began at first to smile, and then to grow ashamed. When all\nsurrounded him, and said that the new cloak must be \"christened,\" and\nthat he must at least give them all a party, Akaky Akakiyevich lost\nhis head completely, and did not know where he stood, what to answer,\nor how to get out of it. He stood blushing all over for several\nminutes, trying to assure them with great simplicity that it was not a\nnew cloak, that it was in fact the old \"cape.\"\n\nAt length one of the officials, assistant to the head clerk, in order\nto show that he was not at all proud, and on good terms with his\ninferiors, said:\n\n\"So be it, only I will give the party instead of Akaky Akakiyevich; I\ninvite you all to tea with me to-night. It just happens to be my\nname-day too.\"\n\nThe officials naturally at once offered the assistant clerk their\ncongratulations, and accepted the invitation with pleasure. Akaky\nAkakiyevich would have declined; but all declared that it was\ndiscourteous, that it was simply a sin and a shame, and that he could\nnot possibly refuse. Besides, the notion became pleasant to him when\nhe recollected that he should thereby have a chance of wearing his new\ncloak in the evening also.\n\nThat whole day was truly a most triumphant festival for Akaky\nAkakiyevich. He returned home in the most happy frame of mind, took\noff his cloak, and hung it carefully on the wall, admiring afresh the\ncloth and the lining. Then he brought out his old, worn-out cloak, for\ncomparison. He looked at it, and laughed, so vast was the difference.\nAnd long after dinner he laughed again when the condition of the\n\"cape\" recurred to his mind. He dined cheerfully, and after dinner\nwrote nothing, but took his ease for a while on the bed, until it got\ndark. Then he dressed himself leisurely, put on his cloak, and stepped\nout into the street.\n\nWhere the host lived, unfortunately we cannot say. Our memory begins\nto fail us badly. The houses and streets in St. Petersburg have become\nso mixed up in our head that it is very difficult to get anything out\nof it again in proper form. This much is certain, that the official\nlived in the best part of the city; and therefore it must have been\nanything but near to Akaky Akakiyevich's residence. Akaky Akakiyevich\nwas first obliged to traverse a kind of wilderness of deserted,\ndimly-lighted streets. But in proportion as he approached the\nofficial's quarter of the city, the streets became more lively, more\npopulous, and more brilliantly illuminated. Pedestrians began to\nappear; handsomely dressed ladies were more frequently encountered;\nthe men had otter skin collars to their coats; shabby sleigh-men with\ntheir wooden, railed sledges stuck over with brass-headed nails,\nbecame rarer; whilst on the other hand, more and more drivers in red\nvelvet caps, lacquered sledges and bear-skin coats began to appear,\nand carriages with rich hammer-cloths flew swiftly through the\nstreets, their wheels scrunching the snow.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich gazed upon all this as upon a novel sight. He had\nnot been in the streets during the evening for years. He halted out of\ncuriosity before a shop-window, to look at a picture representing a\nhandsome woman, who had thrown off her shoe, thereby baring her whole\nfoot in a very pretty way; whilst behind her the head of a man with\nwhiskers and a handsome moustache peeped through the doorway of\nanother room. Akaky Akakiyevich shook his head, and laughed, and then\nwent on his way. Why did he laugh? Either because he had met with a\nthing utterly unknown, but for which every one cherishes,\nnevertheless, some sort of feeling, or else he thought, like many\nofficials, \"Well, those French! What is to be said? If they do go in\nfor anything of that sort, why--\" But possibly he did not think at\nall.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich at length reached the house in which the head\nclerk's assistant lodged. He lived in fine style. The staircase was\nlit by a lamp, his apartment being on the second floor. On entering\nthe vestibule, Akaky Akakiyevich beheld a whole row of goloshes on the\nfloor. Among them, in the centre of the room, stood a samovar, humming\nand emitting clouds of steam. On the walls hung all sorts of coats and\ncloaks, among which there were even some with beaver collars, or\nvelvet facings. Beyond, the buzz of conversation was audible, and\nbecame clear and loud, when the servant came out with a trayful of\nempty glasses, cream-jugs and sugar-bowls. It was evident that the\nofficials had arrived long before, and had already finished their\nfirst glass of tea.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich, having hung up his own cloak, entered the inner\nroom. Before him all at once appeared lights, officials, pipes, and\ncard-tables, and he was bewildered by a sound of rapid conversation\nrising from all the tables, and the noise of moving chairs. He halted\nvery awkwardly in the middle of the room, wondering what he ought to\ndo. But they had seen him. They received him with a shout, and all\nthronged at once into the ante-room, and there took another look at\nhis cloak. Akaky Akakiyevich, although somewhat confused, was\nfrank-hearted, and could not refrain from rejoicing when he saw how\nthey praised his cloak. Then, of course, they all dropped him and his\ncloak, and returned, as was proper, to the tables set out for whist.\n\nAll this, the noise, the talk, and the throng of people, was rather\noverwhelming to Akaky Akakiyevich. He simply did not know where he\nstood, or where to put his hands, his feet, and his whole body.\nFinally he sat down by the players, looked at the cards, gazed at the\nface of one and another, and after a while began to gape, and to feel\nthat it was wearisome, the more so, as the hour was already long past\nwhen he usually went to bed. He wanted to take leave of the host, but\nthey would not let him go, saying that he must not fail to drink a\nglass of champagne, in honour of his new garment. In the course of an\nhour, supper, consisting of vegetable salad, cold veal, pastry,\nconfectioner's pies, and champagne, was served. They made Akaky\nAkakiyevich drink two glasses of champagne, after which he felt things\ngrow livelier.\n\nStill, he could not forget that it was twelve o'clock, and that he\nshould have been at home long ago. In order that the host might not\nthink of some excuse for detaining him, he stole out of the room\nquickly, sought out, in the ante-room, his cloak, which, to his\nsorrow, he found lying on the floor, brushed it, picked off every\nspeck upon it, put it on his shoulders, and descended the stairs to\nthe street.\n\nIn the street all was still bright. Some petty shops, those permanent\nclubs of servants and all sorts of folks, were open. Others were shut,\nbut, nevertheless, showed a streak of light the whole length of the\ndoor-crack, indicating that they were not yet free of company, and\nthat probably some domestics, male and female, were finishing their\nstories and conversations, whilst leaving their masters in complete\nignorance as to their whereabouts. Akaky Akakiyevich went on in a\nhappy frame of mind. He even started to run, without knowing why,\nafter some lady, who flew past like a flash of lightning. But he\nstopped short, and went on very quietly as before, wondering why he\nhad quickened his pace. Soon there spread before him these deserted\nstreets which are not cheerful in the daytime, to say no thing of the\nevening. Now they were even more dim and lonely. The lanterns began to\ngrow rarer, oil, evidently, had been less liberally supplied. Then\ncame wooden houses and fences. Not a soul anywhere; only the snow\nsparkled in the streets, and mournfully veiled the low-roofed cabins\nwith their closed shutters. He approached the spot where the street\ncrossed a vast square with houses barely visible on its farther side,\na square which seemed a fearful desert.\n\nAfar, a tiny spark glimmered from some watchman's-box, which seemed to\nstand on the edge of the world. Akaky Akakiyevich's cheerfulness\ndiminished at this point in a marked degree. He entered the square,\nnot without an involuntary sensation of fear, as though his heart\nwarned him of some evil. He glanced back, and on both sides it was\nlike a sea about him. \"No, it is better not to look,\" he thought, and\nwent on, closing his eyes. When he opened them, to see whether he was\nnear the end of the square, he suddenly beheld, standing just before\nhis very nose, some bearded individuals of precisely what sort, he\ncould not make out. All grew dark before his eyes, and his heart\nthrobbed.\n\n\"Of course, the cloak is mine!\" said one of them in a loud voice,\nseizing hold of his collar. Akaky Akakiyevich was about to shout\n\"Help!\" when the second man thrust a fist, about the size of an\nofficial's head, at his very mouth, muttering, \"Just you dare to\nscream!\"\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich felt them strip off his cloak, and give him a kick.\nHe fell headlong upon the snow, and felt no more.\n\nIn a few minutes he recovered consciousness, and rose to his feet, but\nno one was there. He felt that it was cold in the square, and that his\ncloak was gone. He began to shout, but his voice did not appear to\nreach the outskirts of the square. In despair, but without ceasing to\nshout, he started at a run across the square, straight towards the\nwatch-box, beside which stood the watchman, leaning on his halberd,\nand apparently curious to know what kind of a customer was running\ntowards him shouting. Akaky Akakiyevich ran up to him, and began in a\nsobbing voice to shout that he was asleep, and attended to nothing,\nand did not see when a man was robbed. The watchman replied that he\nhad seen two men stop him in the middle of the square, but supposed\nthat they were friends of his, and that, instead of scolding vainly,\nhe had better go to the police on the morrow, so that they might make\na search for whoever had stolen the cloak.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich ran home and arrived in a state of complete\ndisorder, his hair which grew very thinly upon his temples and the\nback of his head all tousled, his body, arms and legs, covered with\nsnow. The old woman, who was mistress of his lodgings, on hearing a\nterrible knocking, sprang hastily from her bed, and, with only one\nshoe on, ran to open the door, pressing the sleeve of her chemise to\nher bosom out of modesty. But when she had opened it, she fell back on\nbeholding Akaky Akakiyevich in such a condition. When he told her\nabout the affair, she clasped her hands, and said that he must go\nstraight to the district chief of police, for his subordinate would\nturn up his nose, promise well, and drop the matter there. The very\nbest thing to do, therefore, would be to go to the district chief,\nwhom she knew, because Finnish Anna, her former cook, was now nurse at\nhis house. She often saw him passing the house, and he was at church\nevery Sunday, praying, but at the same time gazing cheerfully at\neverybody; so that he must be a good man, judging from all\nappearances. Having listened to this opinion, Akaky Akakiyevich betook\nhimself sadly to his room. And how he spent the night there, any one\nwho can put himself in another's place may readily imagine.\n\nEarly in the morning, he presented himself at the district chief's,\nbut was told the official was asleep. He went again at ten and was\nagain informed that he was asleep. At eleven, and they said, \"The\nsuperintendent is not at home.\" At dinner time, and the clerks in the\nante-room would not admit him on any terms, and insisted upon knowing\nhis business. So that at last, for once in his life, Akaky Akakiyevich\nfelt an inclination to show some spirit, and said curtly that he must\nsee the chief in person, that they ought not to presume to refuse him\nentrance, that he came from the department of justice, and that when\nhe complained of them, they would see.\n\nThe clerks dared make no reply to this, and one of them went to call\nthe chief, who listened to the strange story of the theft of the coat.\nInstead of directing his attention to the principal points of the\nmatter, he began to question Akaky Akakiyevich. Why was he going home\nso late? Was he in the habit of doing so, or had he been to some\ndisorderly house? So that Akaky Akakiyevich got thoroughly confused,\nand left him, without knowing whether the affair of his cloak was in\nproper train or not.\n\nAll that day, for the first time in his life, he never went near the\ndepartment. The next day he made his appearance, very pale, and in his\nold cape, which had become even more shabby. The news of the robbery\nof the cloak touched many, although there were some officials present\nwho never lost an opportunity, even such a one as the present, of\nridiculing Akaky Akakiyevich. They decided to make a collection for\nhim on the spot, but the officials had already spent a great deal in\nsubscribing for the director's portrait, and for some book, at the\nsuggestion of the head of that division, who was a friend of the\nauthor; and so the sum was trifling.\n\nOne of them, moved by pity, resolved to help Akaky Akakiyevich with\nsome good advice, at least, and told him that he ought not to go to\nthe police, for although it might happen that a police-officer,\nwishing to win the approval of his superiors, might hunt up the cloak\nby some means, still, his cloak would remain in the possession of the\npolice if he did not offer legal proof that it belonged to him. The\nbest thing for him, therefore, would be to apply to a certain\nprominent personage; since this prominent personage, by entering into\nrelation with the proper persons, could greatly expedite the matter.\n\nAs there was nothing else to be done, Akaky Akakiyevich decided to go\nto the prominent personage. What was the exact official position of\nthe prominent personage, remains unknown to this day. The reader must\nknow that the prominent personage had but recently become a prominent\npersonage, having up to that time been only an insignificant person.\nMoreover, his present position was not considered prominent in\ncomparison with others still more so. But there is always a circle of\npeople to whom what is insignificant in the eyes of others, is\nimportant enough. Moreover, he strove to increase his importance by\nsundry devices. For instance, he managed to have the inferior\nofficials meet him on the staircase when he entered upon his service;\nno one was to presume to come directly to him, but the strictest\netiquette must be observed; the collegiate recorder must make a report\nto the government secretary, the government secretary to the titular\ncouncillor, or whatever other man was proper, and all business must\ncome before him in this manner. In Holy Russia, all is thus\ncontaminated with the love of imitation; every man imitates and copies\nhis superior. They even say that a certain titular councillor, when\npromoted to the head of some small separate office, immediately\npartitioned off a private room for himself, called it the audience\nchamber, and posted at the door a lackey with red collar and braid,\nwho grasped the handle of the door, and opened to all comers, though\nthe audience chamber would hardly hold an ordinary writing table.\n\nThe manners and customs of the prominent personage were grand and\nimposing, but rather exaggerated. The main foundation of his system\nwas strictness. \"Strictness, strictness, and always strictness!\" he\ngenerally said; and at the last word he looked significantly into the\nface of the person to whom he spoke. But there was no necessity for\nthis, for the halfscore of subordinates, who formed the entire force\nof the office, were properly afraid. On catching sight of him afar\noff, they left their work, and waited, drawn up in line, until he had\npassed through the room. His ordinary converse with his inferiors\nsmacked of sternness, and consisted chiefly of three phrases: \"How\ndare you?\" \"Do you know whom you are speaking to?\" \"Do you realise who\nis standing before you?\"\n\nOtherwise he was a very kind-hearted man, good to his comrades, and\nready to oblige. But the rank of general threw him completely off his\nbalance. On receiving any one of that rank, he became confused, lost\nhis way, as it were, and never knew what to do. If he chanced to be\namongst his equals, he was still a very nice kind of man, a very good\nfellow in many respects, and not stupid, but the very moment that he\nfound himself in the society of people but one rank lower than\nhimself, he became silent. And his situation aroused sympathy, the\nmore so, as he felt himself that he might have been making an\nincomparably better use of his time. In his eyes, there was sometimes\nvisible a desire to join some interesting conversation or group, but\nhe was kept back by the thought, \"Would it not be a very great\ncondescension on his part? Would it not be familiar? And would he not\nthereby lose his importance?\" And in consequence of such reflections,\nhe always remained in the same dumb state, uttering from time to time\na few monosyllabic sounds, and thereby earning the name of the most\nwearisome of men.\n\nTo this prominent personage Akaky Akakiyevich presented himself, and\nthis at the most unfavourable time for himself, though opportune for\nthe prominent personage. The prominent personage was in his cabinet,\nconversing very gaily with an old acquaintance and companion of his\nchildhood, whom he had not seen for several years, and who had just\narrived, when it was announced to him that a person named Bashmachkin\nhad come. He asked abruptly, \"Who is he?\"--\"Some official,\" he was\ninformed. \"Ah, he can wait! This is no time for him to call,\" said the\nimportant man.\n\nIt must be remarked here that the important man lied outrageously. He\nhad said all he had to say to his friend long before, and the\nconversation had been interspersed for some time with very long\npauses, during which they merely slapped each other on the leg, and\nsaid, \"You think so, Ivan Abramovich!\" \"Just so, Stepan Varlamovich!\"\nNevertheless, he ordered that the official should be kept waiting, in\norder to show his friend, a man who had not been in the service for a\nlong time, but had lived at home in the country, how long officials\nhad to wait in his ante-room.\n\nAt length, having talked himself completely out, and more than that,\nhaving had his fill of pauses, and smoked a cigar in a very\ncomfortable arm-chair with reclining back, he suddenly seemed to\nrecollect, and said to the secretary, who stood by the door with\npapers of reports, \"So it seems that there is an official waiting to\nsee me. Tell him that he may come in.\" On perceiving Akaky\nAkakiyevich's modest mien and his worn uniform, he turned abruptly to\nhim, and said, \"What do you want?\" in a curt hard voice, which he had\npractised in his room in private, and before the looking-glass, for a\nwhole week before being raised to his present rank.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich, who was already imbued with a due amount of fear,\nbecame somewhat confused, and as well as his tongue would permit,\nexplained, with a rather more frequent addition than usual of the word\n\"that\" that his cloak was quite new, and had been stolen in the most\ninhuman manner; that he had applied to him, in order that he might, in\nsome way, by his intermediation--that he might enter into\ncorrespondence with the chief of police, and find the cloak.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, this conduct seemed familiar to the\nprominent personage.\n\n\"What, my dear sir!\" he said abruptly, \"are you not acquainted with\netiquette? To whom have you come? Don't you know how such matters are\nmanaged? You should first have presented a petition to the office. It\nwould have gone to the head of the department, then to the chief of\nthe division, then it would have been handed over to the secretary,\nand the secretary would have given it to me.\"\n\n\"But, your excellency,\" said Akaky Akakiyevich, trying to collect his\nsmall handful of wits, and conscious at the same time that he was\nperspiring terribly, \"I, your excellency, presumed to trouble you\nbecause secretaries--are an untrustworthy race.\"\n\n\"What, what, what!\" said the important personage. \"Where did you get\nsuch courage? Where did you get such ideas? What impudence towards\ntheir chiefs and superiors has spread among the young generation!\" The\nprominent personage apparently had not observed that Akaky Akakiyevich\nwas already in the neighbourhood of fifty. If he could be called a\nyoung man, it must have been in comparison with some one who was\nseventy. \"Do you know to whom you are speaking? Do you realise who is\nstanding before you? Do you realise it? Do you realise it, I ask you!\"\nThen he stamped his foot, and raised his voice to such a pitch that it\nwould have frightened even a different man from Akaky Akakiyevich.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich's senses failed him. He staggered, trembled in every\nlimb, and, if the porters had not run in to support him, would have\nfallen to the floor. They carried him out insensible. But the\nprominent personage, gratified that the effect should have surpassed\nhis expectations, and quite intoxicated with the thought that his word\ncould even deprive a man of his senses, glanced sideways at his friend\nin order to see how he looked upon this, and perceived, not without\nsatisfaction, that his friend was in a most uneasy frame of mind, and\neven beginning on his part, to feel a trifle frightened.\n\nAkaky Akakiyevich could not remember how he descended the stairs, and\ngot into the street. He felt neither his hands nor feet. Never in his\nlife had he been so rated by any high official, let alone a strange\none. He went staggering on through the snow-storm, which was blowing\nin the streets, with his mouth wide open. The wind, in St. Petersburg\nfashion, darted upon him from all quarters, and down every\ncross-street. In a twinkling it had blown a quinsy into his throat,\nand he reached home unable to utter a word. His throat was swollen,\nand he lay down on his bed. So powerful is sometimes a good scolding!\n\nThe next day a violent fever developed. Thanks to the generous\nassistance of the St. Petersburg climate, the malady progressed more\nrapidly than could have been expected, and when the doctor arrived, he\nfound, on feeling the sick man's pulse, that there was nothing to be\ndone, except to prescribe a poultice, so that the patient might not be\nleft entirely without the beneficent aid of medicine. But at the same\ntime, he predicted his end in thirty-six hours. After this he turned\nto the landlady, and said, \"And as for you, don't waste your time on\nhim. Order his pine coffin now, for an oak one will be too expensive\nfor him.\"\n\nDid Akaky Akakiyevich hear these fatal words? And if he heard them,\ndid they produce any overwhelming effect upon him? Did he lament the\nbitterness of his life?--We know not, for he continued in a delirious\ncondition. Visions incessantly appeared to him, each stranger than the\nother. Now he saw Petrovich, and ordered him to make a cloak, with\nsome traps for robbers, who seemed to him to be always under the bed;\nand he cried every moment to the landlady to pull one of them from\nunder his coverlet. Then he inquired why his old mantle hung before\nhim when he had a new cloak. Next he fancied that he was standing\nbefore the prominent person, listening to a thorough setting-down and\nsaying, \"Forgive me, your excellency!\" but at last he began to curse,\nuttering the most horrible words, so that his aged landlady crossed\nherself, never in her life having heard anything of the kind from him,\nand more so as these words followed directly after the words \"your\nexcellency.\" Later on he talked utter nonsense, of which nothing could\nbe made, all that was evident being that these incoherent words and\nthoughts hovered ever about one thing, his cloak.\n\nAt length poor Akaky Akakiyevich breathed his last. They sealed up\nneither his room nor his effects, because, in the first place, there\nwere no heirs, and, in the second, there was very little to inherit\nbeyond a bundle of goose-quills, a quire of white official paper,\nthree pairs of socks, two or three buttons which had burst off his\ntrousers, and the mantle already known to the reader. To whom all this\nfell, God knows. I confess that the person who told me this tale took\nno interest in the matter. They carried Akaky Akakiyevich out, and\nburied him.\n\nAnd St. Petersburg was left without Akaky Akakiyevich, as though he\nhad never lived there. A being disappeared, who was protected by none,\ndear to none, interesting to none, and who never even attracted to\nhimself the attention of those students of human nature who omit no\nopportunity of thrusting a pin through a common fly and examining it\nunder the microscope. A being who bore meekly the jibes of the\ndepartment, and went to his grave without having done one unusual\ndeed, but to whom, nevertheless, at the close of his life, appeared a\nbright visitant in the form of a cloak, which momentarily cheered his\npoor life, and upon him, thereafter, an intolerable misfortune\ndescended, just as it descends upon the heads of the mighty of this\nworld!\n\nSeveral days after his death, the porter was sent from the department\nto his lodgings, with an order for him to present himself there\nimmediately, the chief commanding it. But the porter had to return\nunsuccessful, with the answer that he could not come; and to the\nquestion, \"Why?\" replied, \"Well, because he is dead! he was buried\nfour days ago.\" In this manner did they hear of Akaky Akakiyevich's\ndeath at the department. And the next day a new official sat in his\nplace, with a handwriting by no means so upright, but more inclined\nand slanting.\n\nBut who could have imagined that this was not really the end of Akaky\nAkakiyevich, that he was destined to raise a commotion after death, as\nif in compensation for his utterly insignificant life? But so it\nhappened, and our poor story unexpectedly gains a fantastic ending.\n\nA rumour suddenly spread through St. Petersburg, that a dead man had\ntaken to appearing on the Kalinkin Bridge, and its vicinity, at night\nin the form of an official seeking a stolen cloak, and that, under the\npretext of its being the stolen cloak, he dragged, without regard to\nrank or calling, every one's cloak from his shoulders, be it cat-skin,\nbeaver, fox, bear, sable, in a word, every sort of fur and skin which\nmen adopted for their covering. One of the department officials saw\nthe dead man with his own eyes, and immediately recognised in him\nAkaky Akakiyevich. This, however, inspired him with such terror, that\nhe ran off with all his might, and therefore did not scan the dead man\nclosely, but only saw how the latter threatened him from afar with his\nfinger. Constant complaints poured in from all quarters, that the\nbacks and shoulders, not only of titular but even of court\ncouncillors, were exposed to the danger of a cold, on account of the\nfrequent dragging off of their cloaks.\n\nArrangements were made by the police to catch the corpse, alive or\ndead, at any cost, and punish him as an example to others, in the most\nsevere manner. In this they nearly succeeded, for a watchman, on guard\nin Kirinshkin Lane, caught the corpse by the collar on the very scene\nof his evil deeds, when attempting to pull off the frieze cloak of a\nretired musician. Having seized him by the collar, he summoned, with a\nshout, two of his comrades, whom he enjoined to hold him fast, while\nhe himself felt for a moment in his boot, in order to draw out his\nsnuff-box, and refresh his frozen nose. But the snuff was of a sort\nwhich even a corpse could not endure. The watchman having closed his\nright nostril with his finger, had no sooner succeeded in holding half\na handful up to the left, than the corpse sneezed so violently that he\ncompletely filled the eyes of all three. While they raised their hands\nto wipe them, the dead man vanished completely, so that they\npositively did not know whether they had actually had him in their\ngrip at all. Thereafter the watchmen conceived such a terror of dead\nmen that they were afraid even to seize the living, and only screamed\nfrom a distance. \"Hey, there! go your way!\" So the dead official began\nto appear even beyond the Kalinkin Bridge, causing no little terror to\nall timid people.\n\nBut we have totally neglected that certain prominent personage who may\nreally be considered as the cause of the fantastic turn taken by this\ntrue history. First of all, justice compels us to say, that after the\ndeparture of poor, annihilated Akaky Akakiyevich, he felt something\nlike remorse. Suffering was unpleasant to him, for his heart was\naccessible to many good impulses, in spite of the fact that his rank\noften prevented his showing his true self. As soon as his friend had\nleft his cabinet, he began to think about poor Akaky Akakiyevich. And\nfrom that day forth, poor Akaky Akakiyevich, who could not bear up\nunder an official reprimand, recurred to his mind almost every day.\nThe thought troubled him to such an extent, that a week later he even\nresolved to send an official to him, to learn whether he really could\nassist him. And when it was reported to him that Akaky Akakiyevich had\ndied suddenly of fever, he was startled, hearkened to the reproaches\nof his conscience, and was out of sorts for the whole day.\n\nWishing to divert his mind in some way and drive away the disagreeable\nimpression, he set out that evening for one of his friends' houses,\nwhere he found quite a large party assembled. What was better, nearly\nevery one was of the same rank as himself, so that he need not feel in\nthe least constrained. This had a marvellous effect upon his mental\nstate. He grew expansive, made himself agreeable in conversation, in\nshort, he passed a delightful evening. After supper he drank a couple\nof glasses of champagne--not a bad recipe for cheerfulness, as every\none knows. The champagne inclined him to various adventures, and he\ndetermined not to return home, but to go and see a certain well-known\nlady, of German extraction, Karolina Ivanovna, a lady, it appears,\nwith whom he was on a very friendly footing.\n\nIt must be mentioned that the prominent personage was no longer a\nyoung man, but a good husband and respected father of a family. Two\nsons, one of whom was already in the service, and a good-looking,\nsixteen-year-old daughter, with a slightly arched but pretty little\nnose, came every morning to kiss his hand and say, \"_Bon jour_, papa.\"\nHis wife, a still fresh and good-looking woman, first gave him her\nhand to kiss, and then, reversing the procedure, kissed his. But the\nprominent personage, though perfectly satisfied in his domestic\nrelations, considered it stylish to have a friend in another quarter\nof the city. This friend was scarcely prettier or younger than his\nwife; but there are such puzzles in the world, and it is not our place\nto judge them. So the important personage descended the stairs,\nstepped into his sledge, said to the coachman, \"To Karolina\nIvanovna's,\" and, wrapping himself luxuriously in his warm cloak,\nfound himself in that delightful frame of mind than which a Russian\ncan conceive nothing better, namely, when you think of nothing\nyourself, yet when the thoughts creep into your mind of their own\naccord, each more agreeable than the other, giving you no trouble\neither to drive them away, or seek them. Fully satisfied, he recalled\nall the gay features of the evening just passed and all the mots which\nhad made the little circle laugh. Many of them he repeated in a low\nvoice, and found them quite as funny as before; so it is not\nsurprising that he should laugh heartily at them. Occasionally,\nhowever, he was interrupted by gusts of wind, which, coming suddenly,\nGod knows whence or why, cut his face, drove masses of snow into it,\nfilled out his cloak-collar like a sail, or suddenly blew it over his\nhead with supernatural force, and thus caused him constant trouble to\ndisentangle himself.\n\nSuddenly the important personage felt some one clutch him firmly by\nthe collar. Turning round, he perceived a man of short stature, in an\nold, worn uniform, and recognised, not without terror, Akaky\nAkakiyevich. The official's face was white as snow, and looked just\nlike a corpse's. But the horror of the important personage transcended\nall bounds when he saw the dead man's mouth open, and heard it utter\nthe following remarks, while it breathed upon him the terrible odour\nof the grave: \"Ah, here you are at last! I have you, that--by the\ncollar! I need your cloak. You took no trouble about mine, but\nreprimanded me. So now give up your own.\"\n\nThe pallid prominent personage almost died of fright. Brave as he was\nin the office and in the presence of inferiors generally, and\nalthough, at the sight of his manly form and appearance, every one\nsaid, \"Ugh! how much character he has!\" at this crisis, he, like many\npossessed of an heroic exterior, experienced such terror, that, not\nwithout cause, he began to fear an attack of illness. He flung his\ncloak hastily from his shoulders and shouted to his coachman in an\nunnatural voice, \"Home at full speed!\" The coachman, hearing the tone\nwhich is generally employed at critical moments, and even accompanied\nby something much more tangible, drew his head down between his\nshoulders in case of an emergency, flourished his whip, and flew on\nlike an arrow. In a little more than six minutes the prominent\npersonage was at the entrance of his own house. Pale, thoroughly\nscared, and cloakless, he went home instead of to Karolina Ivanovna's,\nreached his room somehow or other, and passed the night in the direst\ndistress; so that the next morning over their tea, his daughter said,\n\"You are very pale to-day, papa.\" But papa remained silent, and said\nnot a word to any one of what had happened to him, where he had been,\nor where he had intended to go.\n\nThis occurrence made a deep impression upon him. He even began to say,\n\"How dare you? Do you realise who is standing before you?\" less\nfrequently to the under-officials, and, if he did utter the words, it\nwas only after first having learned the bearings of the matter. But\nthe most noteworthy point was, that from that day forward the\napparition of the dead official ceased to be seen. Evidently the\nprominent personage's cloak just fitted his shoulders. At all events,\nno more instances of his dragging cloaks from people's shoulders were\nheard of. But many active and solicitous persons could by no means\nreassure themselves, and asserted that the dead official still showed\nhimself in distant parts of the city.\n\nIn fact, one watchman in Kolomen saw with his own eyes the apparition\ncome from behind a house. But the watchman was not a strong man, so he\nwas afraid to arrest him, and followed him in the dark, until, at\nlength, the apparition looked round, paused, and inquired, \"What do\nyou want?\" at the same time showing such a fist as is never seen on\nliving men. The watchman said, \"Nothing,\" and turned back instantly.\nBut the apparition was much too tall, wore huge moustaches, and,\ndirecting its steps apparently towards the Obukhov Bridge, disappeared\nin the darkness of the night.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DISTRICT DOCTOR\n\n\n\nBY IVAN S. TURGENEV\n\n\nOne day in autumn on my way back from a remote part of the country I\ncaught cold and fell ill. Fortunately the fever attacked me in the\ndistrict town at the inn; I sent for the doctor. In half-an-hour the\ndistrict doctor appeared, a thin, dark-haired man of middle height. He\nprescribed me the usual sudorific, ordered a mustard-plaster to be put\non, very deftly slid a five-ruble note up his sleeve, coughing drily\nand looking away as he did so, and then was getting up to go home, but\nsomehow fell into talk and remained. I was exhausted with\nfeverishness; I foresaw a sleepless night, and was glad of a little\nchat with a pleasant companion. Tea was served. My doctor began to\nconverse freely. He was a sensible fellow, and expressed himself with\nvigour and some humour. Queer things happen in the world: you may live\na long while with some people, and be on friendly terms with them, and\nnever once speak openly with them from your soul; with others you have\nscarcely time to get acquainted, and all at once you are pouring out\nto him--or he to you--all your secrets, as though you were at\nconfession. I don't know how I gained the confidence of my new\nfriend--anyway, with nothing to lead up to it, he told me a rather\ncurious incident; and here I will report his tale for the information\nof the indulgent reader. I will try to tell it in the doctor's own\nwords.\n\n\"You don't happen to know,\" he began in a weak and quavering voice\n(the common result of the use of unmixed Berezov snuff); \"you don't\nhappen to know the judge here, Mylov, Pavel Lukich?... You don't know\nhim?... Well, it's all the same.\" (He cleared his throat and rubbed\nhis eyes.) \"Well, you see, the thing happened, to tell you exactly\nwithout mistake, in Lent, at the very time of the thaws. I was sitting\nat his house--our judge's, you know--playing preference. Our judge is\na good fellow, and fond of playing preference. Suddenly\" (the doctor\nmade frequent use of this word, suddenly) \"they tell me, 'There's a\nservant asking for you.' I say, 'What does he want?' They say, He has\nbrought a note--it must be from a patient.' 'Give me the note,' I say.\nSo it is from a patient--well and good--you understand--it's our bread\nand butter... But this is how it was: a lady, a widow, writes to me;\nshe says, 'My daughter is dying. Come, for God's sake!' she says, 'and\nthe horses have been sent for you.'... Well, that's all right. But she\nwas twenty miles from the town, and it was midnight out of doors, and\nthe roads in such a state, my word! And as she was poor herself, one\ncould not expect more than two silver rubles, and even that\nproblematic; and perhaps it might only be a matter of a roll of linen\nand a sack of oatmeal in _payment_. However, duty, you know, before\neverything: a fellow-creature may be dying. I hand over my cards at\nonce to Kalliopin, the member of the provincial commission, and return\nhome. I look; a wretched little trap was standing at the steps, with\npeasant's horses, fat--too fat--and their coat as shaggy as felt; and\nthe coachman sitting with his cap off out of respect. Well, I think to\nmyself, 'It's clear, my friend, these patients aren't rolling in\nriches.'... You smile; but I tell you, a poor man like me has to take\neverything into consideration... If the coachman sits like a prince,\nand doesn't touch his cap, and even sneers at you behind his beard,\nand flicks his whip--then you may bet on six rubles. But this case, I\nsaw, had a very different air. However, I think there's no help for\nit; duty before everything. I snatch up the most necessary drugs, and\nset off. Will you believe it? I only just managed to get there at all.\nThe road was infernal: streams, snow, watercourses, and the dyke had\nsuddenly burst there--that was the worst of it! However, I arrived at\nlast. It was a little thatched house. There was a light in the\nwindows; that meant they expected me. I was met by an old lady, very\nvenerable, in a cap. 'Save her!' she says; 'she is dying.' I say,\n'Pray don't distress yourself--Where is the invalid?' 'Come this way.'\nI see a clean little room, a lamp in the corner; on the bed a girl of\ntwenty, unconscious. She was in a burning heat, and breathing\nheavily--it was fever. There were two other girls, her sisters, scared\nand in tears. 'Yesterday,' they tell me, 'she was perfectly well and\nhad a good appetite; this morning she complained of her head, and this\nevening, suddenly, you see, like this.' I say again: 'Pray don't be\nuneasy.' It's a doctor's duty, you know--and I went up to her and bled\nher, told them to put on a mustard-plaster, and prescribed a mixture.\nMeantime I looked at her; I looked at her, you know--there, by God! I\nhad never seen such a face!--she was a beauty, in a word! I felt quite\nshaken with pity. Such lovely features; such eyes!... But, thank God!\nshe became easier; she fell into a perspiration, seemed to come to her\nsenses, looked round, smiled, and passed her hand over her face... Her\nsisters bent over her. They ask, 'How are you?' 'All right,' she says,\nand turns away. I looked at her; she had fallen asleep. 'Well,' I say,\n'now the patient should be left alone.' So we all went out on tiptoe;\nonly a maid remained, in case she was wanted. In the parlour there was\na samovar standing on the table, and a bottle of rum; in our\nprofession one can't get on without it. They gave me tea; asked me to\nstop the night... I consented: where could I go, indeed, at that time\nof night? The old lady kept groaning. 'What is it?' I say; 'she will\nlive; don't worry yourself; you had better take a little rest\nyourself; it is about two o'clock.' 'But will you send to wake me if\nanything happens?' 'Yes, yes.' The old lady went away, and the girls\ntoo went to their own room; they made up a bed for me in the parlour.\nWell, I went to bed--but I could not get to sleep, for a wonder! for\nin reality I was very tired. I could not get my patient out of my\nhead. At last I could not put up with it any longer; I got up\nsuddenly; I think to myself, 'I will go and see how the patient is\ngetting on.' Her bedroom was next to the parlour. Well, I got up, and\ngently opened the door--how my heart beat! I looked in: the servant\nwas asleep, her mouth wide open, and even snoring, the wretch! but the\npatient lay with her face towards me and her arms flung wide apart,\npoor girl! I went up to her ... when suddenly she opened her eyes and\nstared at me! 'Who is it? who is it?' I was in confusion. 'Don't be\nalarmed, madam,' I say; 'I am the doctor; I have come to see how you\nfeel.' 'You the doctor?' 'Yes, the doctor; your mother sent for me\nfrom the town; we have bled you, madam; now pray go to sleep, and in a\nday or two, please God! we will set you on your feet again.' 'Ah, yes,\nyes, doctor, don't let me die... please, please.' 'Why do you talk\nlike that? God bless you!' She is in a fever again, I think to myself;\nI felt her pulse; yes, she was feverish. She looked at me, and then\ntook me by the hand. 'I will tell you why I don't want to die: I will\ntell you... Now we are alone; and only, please don't you ... not to\nany one ... Listen...' I bent down; she moved her lips quite to my\near; she touched my cheek with her hair--I confess my head went\nround--and began to whisper... I could make out nothing of it... Ah,\nshe was delirious! ... She whispered and whispered, but so quickly,\nand as if it were not in Russian; at last she finished, and shivering\ndropped her head on the pillow, and threatened me with her finger:\n'Remember, doctor, to no one.' I calmed her somehow, gave her\nsomething to drink, waked the servant, and went away.\"\n\nAt this point the doctor again took snuff with exasperated energy, and\nfor a moment seemed stupefied by its effects.\n\n\"However,\" he continued, \"the next day, contrary to my expectations,\nthe patient was no better. I thought and thought, and suddenly decided\nto remain there, even though my other patients were expecting me...\nAnd you know one can't afford to disregard that; one's practice\nsuffers if one does. But, in the first place, the patient was really\nin danger; and secondly, to tell the truth, I felt strongly drawn to\nher. Besides, I liked the whole family. Though they were really badly\noff, they were singularly, I may say, cultivated people... Their\nfather had been a learned man, an author; he died, of course, in\npoverty, but he had managed before he died to give his children an\nexcellent education; he left a lot of books too. Either because I\nlooked after the invalid very carefully, or for some other reason;\nanyway, I can venture to say all the household loved me as if I were\none of the family... Meantime the roads were in a worse state than\never; all communications, so to say, were cut off completely; even\nmedicine could with difficulty be got from the town... The sick girl\nwas not getting better... Day after day, and day after day ... but ...\nhere...\" (The doctor made a brief pause.) \"I declare I don't know how\nto tell you.\"... (He again took snuff, coughed, and swallowed a little\ntea.) \"I will tell you without beating about the bush. My patient ...\nhow should I say?... Well she had fallen in love with me ... or, no,\nit was not that she was in love ... however ... really, how should one\nsay?\" (The doctor looked down and grew red.) \"No,\" he went on quickly,\n\"in love, indeed! A man should not over-estimate himself. She was an\neducated girl, clever and well-read, and I had even forgotten my\nLatin, one may say, completely. As to appearance\" (the doctor looked\nhimself over with a smile) \"I am nothing to boast of there either. But\nGod Almighty did not make me a fool; I don't take black for white; I\nknow a thing or two; I could see very clearly, for instance that\nAleksandra Andreyevna--that was her name--did not feel love for me,\nbut had a friendly, so to say, inclination--a respect or something for\nme. Though she herself perhaps mistook this sentiment, anyway this was\nher attitude; you may form your own judgment of it. But,\" added the\ndoctor, who had brought out all these disconnected sentences without\ntaking breath, and with obvious embarrassment, \"I seem to be wandering\nrather--you won't understand anything like this ... There, with your\nleave, I will relate it all in order.\"\n\nHe drank off a glass of tea, and began in a calmer voice.\n\n\"Well, then. My patient kept getting worse and worse. You are not a\ndoctor, my good sir; you cannot understand what passes in a poor\nfellow's heart, especially at first, when he begins to suspect that\nthe disease is getting the upper hand of him. What becomes of his\nbelief in himself? You suddenly grow so timid; it's indescribable. You\nfancy then that you have forgotten everything you knew, and that the\npatient has no faith in you, and that other people begin to notice how\ndistracted you are, and tell you the symptoms with reluctance; that\nthey are looking at you suspiciously, whispering... Ah! it's horrid!\nThere must be a remedy, you think, for this disease, if one could find\nit. Isn't this it? You try--no, that's not it! You don't allow the\nmedicine the necessary time to do good... You clutch at one thing,\nthen at another. Sometimes you take up a book of medical\nprescriptions--here it is, you think! Sometimes, by Jove, you pick one\nout by chance, thinking to leave it to fate... But meantime a\nfellow-creature's dying, and another doctor would have saved him. 'We\nmust have a consultation,' you say; 'I will not take the\nresponsibility on myself.' And what a fool you look at such times!\nWell, in time you learn to bear it; it's nothing to you. A man has\ndied--but it's not your fault; you treated him by the rules. But\nwhat's still more torture to you is to see blind faith in you, and to\nfeel yourself that you are not able to be of use. Well, it was just\nthis blind faith that the whole of Aleksandra Andreyevna's family had\nin me; they had forgotten to think that their daughter was in danger.\nI, too, on my side assure them that it's nothing, but meantime my\nheart sinks into my boots. To add to our troubles, the roads were in\nsuch a state that the coachman was gone for whole days together to get\nmedicine. And I never left the patient's room; I could not tear myself\naway; I tell her amusing stories, you know, and play cards with her. I\nwatch by her side at night. The old mother thanks me with tears in her\neyes; but I think to myself, 'I don't deserve your gratitude.' I\nfrankly confess to you--there is no object in concealing it now--I was\nin love with my patient. And Aleksandra Andreyevna had grown fond of\nme; she would not sometimes let any one be in her room but me. She\nbegan to talk to me, to ask me questions; where I had studied, how I\nlived, who are my people, whom I go to see. I feel that she ought not\nto talk; but to forbid her to--to forbid her resolutely, you know--I\ncould not. Sometimes I held my head in my hands, and asked myself,\n\"What are you doing, villain?\"... And she would take my hand and hold\nit, give me a long, long look, and turn away, sigh, and say, 'How good\nyou are!' Her hands were so feverish, her eyes so large and languid...\n'Yes,' she says, 'you are a good, kind man; you are not like our\nneighbours... No, you are not like that... Why did I not know you till\nnow!' 'Aleksandra Andreyevna, calm yourself,' I say... 'I feel,\nbelieve me, I don't know how I have gained ... but there, calm\nyourself... All will be right; you will be well again.' And meanwhile\nI must tell you,\" continued the doctor, bending forward and raising\nhis eyebrows, \"that they associated very little with the neighbours,\nbecause the smaller people were not on their level, and pride hindered\nthem from being friendly with the rich. I tell you, they were an\nexceptionally cultivated family; so you know it was gratifying for me.\nShe would only take her medicine from my hands ... she would lift\nherself up, poor girl, with my aid, take it, and gaze at me... My\nheart felt as if it were bursting. And meanwhile she was growing worse\nand worse, worse and worse, all the time; she will die, I think to\nmyself; she must die. Believe me, I would sooner have gone to the\ngrave myself; and here were her mother and sisters watching me,\nlooking into my eyes ... and their faith in me was wearing away.\n'Well? how is she?' 'Oh, all right, all right!' All right, indeed! My\nmind was failing me. Well, I was sitting one night alone again by my\npatient. The maid was sitting there too, and snoring away in full\nswing; I can't find fault with the poor girl, though; she was worn out\ntoo. Aleksandra Andreyevna had felt very unwell all the evening; she\nwas very feverish. Until midnight she kept tossing about; at last she\nseemed to fall asleep; at least, she lay still without stirring. The\nlamp was burning in the corner before the holy image. I sat there, you\nknow, with my head bent; I even dozed a little. Suddenly it seemed as\nthough some one touched me in the side; I turned round... Good God!\nAleksandra Andreyevna was gazing with intent eyes at me ... her lips\nparted, her cheeks seemed burning. 'What is it?' 'Doctor, shall I\ndie?' 'Merciful Heavens!' 'No, doctor, no; please don't tell me I\nshall live ... don't say so... If you knew... Listen! for God's sake\ndon't conceal my real position,' and her breath came so fast. 'If I\ncan know for certain that I must die ... then I will tell you all--\nall!' 'Aleksandra Andreyevna, I beg!' 'Listen; I have not been asleep\nat all ... I have been looking at you a long while... For God's\nsake!... I believe in you; you are a good man, an honest man; I\nentreat you by all that is sacred in the world--tell me the truth! If\nyou knew how important it is for me... Doctor, for God's sake tell\nme... Am I in danger?' 'What can I tell you, Aleksandra Andreyevna,\npray?' 'For God's sake, I beseech you!' 'I can't disguise from you,' I\nsay, 'Aleksandra Andreyevna; you are certainly in danger; but God is\nmerciful.' 'I shall die, I shall die.' And it seemed as though she\nwere pleased; her face grew so bright; I was alarmed. 'Don't be\nafraid, don't be afraid! I am not frightened of death at all.' She\nsuddenly sat up and leaned on her elbow. 'Now ... yes, now I can tell\nyou that I thank you with my whole heart ... that you are kind and\ngood--that I love you!' I stare at her, like one possessed; it was\nterrible for me, you know. 'Do you hear, I love you!' 'Aleksandra\nAndreyevna, how have I deserved--' 'No, no, you don't--you don't\nunderstand me.'... And suddenly she stretched out her arms, and taking\nmy head in her hands, she kissed it... Believe me, I almost screamed\naloud... I threw myself on my knees, and buried my head in the pillow.\nShe did not speak; her fingers trembled in my hair; I listen; she is\nweeping. I began to soothe her, to assure her... I really don't know\nwhat I did say to her. 'You will wake up the girl,' I say to her;\n'Aleksandra Andreyevna, I thank you ... believe me ... calm yourself.'\n'Enough, enough!' she persisted; 'never mind all of them; let them\nwake, then; let them come in--it does not matter; I am dying, you\nsee... And what do you fear? why are you afraid? Lift up your head...\nOr, perhaps, you don't love me; perhaps I am wrong... In that case,\nforgive me.' 'Aleksandra Andreyevna, what are you saying!... I love\nyou, Aleksandra Andreyevna.' She looked straight into my eyes, and\nopened her arms wide. 'Then take me in your arms.' I tell you frankly,\nI don't know how it was I did not go mad that night. I feel that my\npatient is killing herself; I see that she is not fully herself; I\nunderstand, too, that if she did not consider herself on the point of\ndeath, she would never have thought of me; and, indeed, say what you\nwill, it's hard to die at twenty without having known love; this was\nwhat was torturing her; this was why, in despair, she caught at\nme--do you understand now? But she held me in her arms, and would not\nlet me go. 'Have pity on me, Aleksandra Andreyevna, and have pity on\nyourself,' I say. 'Why,' she says; 'what is there to think of? You\nknow I must die.' ... This she repeated incessantly ... 'If I knew\nthat I should return to life, and be a proper young lady again, I\nshould be ashamed ... of course, ashamed ... but why now?' 'But who\nhas said you will die?' 'Oh, no, leave off! you will not deceive me;\nyou don't know how to lie--look at your face.' ... 'You shall live,\nAleksandra Andreyevna; I will cure you; we will ask your mother's\nblessing ... we will be united--we will be happy.' 'No, no, I have\nyour word; I must die ... you have promised me ... you have told me.'\n... It was cruel for me--cruel for many reasons. And see what trifling\nthings can do sometimes; it seems nothing at all, but it's painful. It\noccurred to her to ask me, what is my name; not my surname, but my\nfirst name. I must needs be so unlucky as to be called Trifon. Yes,\nindeed; Trifon Ivanich. Every one in the house called me doctor.\nHowever, there's no help for it. I say, 'Trifon, madam.' She frowned,\nshook her head, and muttered something in French--ah, something\nunpleasant, of course!--and then she laughed--disagreeably too. Well,\nI spent the whole night with her in this way. Before morning I went\naway, feeling as though I were mad. When I went again into her room it\nwas daytime, after morning tea. Good God! I could scarcely recognise\nher; people are laid in their grave looking better than that. I swear\nto you, on my honour, I don't understand--I absolutely don't\nunderstand--now, how I lived through that experience. Three days and\nnights my patient still lingered on. And what nights! What things she\nsaid to me! And on the last night--only imagine to yourself--I was\nsitting near her, and kept praying to God for one thing only: 'Take\nher,' I said, 'quickly, and me with her.' Suddenly the old mother\ncomes unexpectedly into the room. I had already the evening before\ntold her---the mother--there was little hope, and it would be well to\nsend for a priest. When the sick girl saw her mother she said: 'It's\nvery well you have come; look at us, we love one another--we have\ngiven each other our word.' 'What does she say, doctor? what does she\nsay?' I turned livid. 'She _is_ wandering,' I say; 'the fever.' But\nshe: 'Hush, hush; you told me something quite different just now, and\nhave taken my ring. Why do you pretend? My mother is good--she will\nforgive--she will understand--and I am dying. ... I have no need to\ntell lies; give me your hand.' I jumped up and ran out of the room.\nThe old lady, of course, guessed how it was.\n\n\"I will not, however, weary you any longer, and to me too, of course,\nit's painful to recall all this. My patient passed away the next day.\nGod rest her soul!\" the doctor added, speaking quickly and with a\nsigh. \"Before her death she asked her family to go out and leave me\nalone with her.\"\n\n\"'Forgive me,' she said; 'I am perhaps to blame towards you ... my\nillness ... but believe me, I have loved no one more than you ... do\nnot forget me ... keep my ring.'\"\n\nThe doctor turned away; I took his hand.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"let us talk of something else, or would you care to\nplay preference for a small stake? It is not for people like me to\ngive way to exalted emotions. There's only one thing for me to think\nof; how to keep the children from crying and the wife from scolding.\nSince then, you know, I have had time to enter into lawful wedlock, as\nthey say... Oh ... I took a merchant's daughter--seven thousand for\nher dowry. Her name's Akulina; it goes well with Trifon. She is an\nill-tempered woman, I must tell you, but luckily she's asleep all\nday... Well, shall it be preference?\"\n\nWe sat down to preference for halfpenny points. Trifon Ivanich won two\nrubles and a half from me, and went home late, well pleased with his\nsuccess.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS TREE AND THE WEDDING\n\n\n\nBY FIODOR M. DOSTOYEVSKY\n\n\nThe other day I saw a wedding... But no! I would rather tell you about\na Christmas tree. The wedding was superb. I liked it immensely. But\nthe other incident was still finer. I don't know why it is that the\nsight of the wedding reminded me of the Christmas tree. This is the\nway it happened:\n\nExactly five years ago, on New Year's Eve, I was invited to a\nchildren's ball by a man high up in the business world, who had his\nconnections, his circle of acquaintances, and his intrigues. So it\nseemed as though the children's ball was merely a pretext for the\nparents to come together and discuss matters of interest to\nthemselves, quite innocently and casually.\n\nI was an outsider, and, as I had no special matters to air, I was able\nto spend the evening independently of the others. There was another\ngentleman present who like myself had just stumbled upon this affair\nof domestic bliss. He was the first to attract my attention. His\nappearance was not that of a man of birth or high family. He was tall,\nrather thin, very serious, and well dressed. Apparently he had no\nheart for the family festivities. The instant he went off into a\ncorner by himself the smile disappeared from his face, and his thick\ndark brows knitted into a frown. He knew no one except the host and\nshowed every sign of being bored to death, though bravely sustaining\nthe role of thorough enjoyment to the end. Later I learned that he was\na provincial, had come to the capital on some important, brain-racking\nbusiness, had brought a letter of recommendation to our host, and our\nhost had taken him under his protection, not at all _con amore_. It\nwas merely out of politeness that he had invited him to the children's\nball.\n\nThey did not play cards with him, they did not offer him cigars. No\none entered into conversation with him. Possibly they recognised the\nbird by its feathers from a distance. Thus, my gentleman, not knowing\nwhat to do with his hands, was compelled to spend the evening stroking\nhis whiskers. His whiskers were really fine, but he stroked them so\nassiduously that one got the feeling that the whiskers had come into\nthe world first and afterwards the man in order to stroke them.\n\nThere was another guest who interested me. But he was of quite a\ndifferent order. He was a personage. They called him Julian\nMastakovich. At first glance one could tell he was an honoured guest\nand stood in the same relation to the host as the host to the\ngentleman of the whiskers. The host and hostess said no end of amiable\nthings to him, were most attentive, wining him, hovering over him,\nbringing guests up to be introduced, but never leading him to any one\nelse. I noticed tears glisten in our host's eyes when Julian\nMastakovich remarked that he had rarely spent such a pleasant evening.\nSomehow I began to feel uncomfortable in this personage's presence.\nSo, after amusing myself with the children, five of whom, remarkably\nwell-fed young persons, were our host's, I went into a little\nsitting-room, entirely unoccupied, and seated myself at the end that\nwas a conservatory and took up almost half the room.\n\nThe children were charming. They absolutely refused to resemble their\nelders, notwithstanding the efforts of mothers and governesses. In a\njiffy they had denuded the Christmas tree down to the very last sweet\nand had already succeeded in breaking half of their playthings before\nthey even found out which belonged to whom.\n\nOne of them was a particularly handsome little lad, dark-eyed,\ncurly-haired, who stubbornly persisted in aiming at me with his wooden\ngun. But the child that attracted the greatest attention was his\nsister, a girl of about eleven, lovely as a Cupid. She was quiet and\nthoughtful, with large, full, dreamy eyes. The children had somehow\noffended her, and she left them and walked into the same room that I\nhad withdrawn into. There she seated herself with her doll in a\ncorner.\n\n\"Her father is an immensely wealthy business man,\" the guests informed\neach other in tones of awe. \"Three hundred thousand rubles set aside\nfor her dowry already.\"\n\nAs I turned to look at the group from which I heard this news item\nissuing, my glance met Julian Mastakovich's. He stood listening to the\ninsipid chatter in an attitude of concentrated attention, with his\nhands behind his back and his head inclined to one side.\n\nAll the while I was quite lost in admiration of the shrewdness our\nhost displayed in the dispensing of the gifts. The little maid of the\nmany-rubied dowry received the handsomest doll, and the rest of the\ngifts were graded in value according to the diminishing scale of the\nparents' stations in life. The last child, a tiny chap of ten, thin,\nred-haired, freckled, came into possession of a small book of nature\nstories without illustrations or even head and tail pieces. He was the\ngoverness's child. She was a poor widow, and her little boy, clad in a\nsorry-looking little nankeen jacket, looked thoroughly crushed and\nintimidated. He took the book of nature stories and circled slowly\nabout the children's toys. He would have given anything to play with\nthem. But he did not dare to. You could tell he already knew his\nplace.\n\nI like to observe children. It is fascinating to watch the\nindividuality in them struggling for self-assertion. I could see that\nthe other children's things had tremendous charm for the red-haired\nboy, especially a toy theatre, in which he was so anxious to take a\npart that he resolved to fawn upon the other children. He smiled and\nbegan to play with them. His one and only apple he handed over to a\npuffy urchin whose pockets were already crammed with sweets, and he\neven carried another youngster pickaback--all simply that he might be\nallowed to stay with the theatre.\n\nBut in a few moments an impudent young person fell on him and gave him\na pummelling. He did not dare even to cry. The governess came and told\nhim to leave off interfering with the other children's games, and he\ncrept away to the same room the little girl and I were in. She let him\nsit down beside her, and the two set themselves busily dressing the\nexpensive doll.\n\nAlmost half an hour passed, and I was nearly dozing off, as I sat\nthere in the conservatory half listening to the chatter of the\nred-haired boy and the dowered beauty, when Julian Mastakovich entered\nsuddenly. He had slipped out of the drawing-room under cover of a\nnoisy scene among the children. From my secluded corner it had not\nescaped my notice that a few moments before he had been eagerly\nconversing with the rich girl's father, to whom he had only just been\nintroduced.\n\nHe stood still for a while reflecting and mumbling to himself, as if\ncounting something on his fingers.\n\n\"Three hundred--three hundred--eleven--twelve--thirteen--sixteen--in\nfive years! Let's say four per cent--five times twelve--sixty, and on\nthese sixty----. Let us assume that in five years it will amount\nto--well, four hundred. Hm--hm! But the shrewd old fox isn't likely to\nbe satisfied with four per cent. He gets eight or even ten, perhaps.\nLet's suppose five hundred, five hundred thousand, at least, that's\nsure. Anything above that for pocket money--hm--\"\n\nHe blew his nose and was about to leave the room when he spied the\ngirl and stood still. I, behind the plants, escaped his notice. He\nseemed to me to be quivering with excitement. It must have been his\ncalculations that upset him so. He rubbed his hands and danced from\nplace to place, and kept getting more and more excited. Finally,\nhowever, he conquered his emotions and came to a standstill. He cast a\ndetermined look at the future bride and wanted to move toward her, but\nglanced about first. Then, as if with a guilty conscience, he stepped\nover to the child on tip-toe, smiling, and bent down and kissed her\nhead.\n\nHis coming was so unexpected that she uttered a shriek of alarm.\n\n\"What are you doing here, dear child?\" he whispered, looking around\nand pinching her cheek.\n\n\"We're playing.\"\n\n\"What, with him?\" said Julian Mastakovich with a look askance at the\ngoverness's child. \"You should go into the drawing-room, my lad,\" he\nsaid to him.\n\nThe boy remained silent and looked up at the man with wide-open eyes.\nJulian Mastakovich glanced round again cautiously and bent down over\nthe girl.\n\n\"What have you got, a doll, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The child quailed a little, and her brow wrinkled.\n\n\"A doll? And do you know, my dear, what dolls are made of?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" she said weakly, and lowered her head.\n\n\"Out of rags, my dear. You, boy, you go back to the drawing-room, to\nthe children,\" said Julian Mastakovich looking at the boy sternly.\n\nThe two children frowned. They caught hold of each other and would not\npart.\n\n\"And do you know why they gave you the doll?\" asked Julian\nMastakovich, dropping his voice lower and lower.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Because you were a good, very good little girl the whole week.\"\n\nSaying which, Julian Mastakovich was seized with a paroxysm of\nagitation. He looked round and said in a tone faint, almost inaudible\nwith excitement and impatience:\n\n\"If I come to visit your parents will you love me, my dear?\"\n\nHe tried to kiss the sweet little creature, but the red-haired boy saw\nthat she was on the verge of tears, and he caught her hand and sobbed\nout loud in sympathy. That enraged the man.\n\n\"Go away! Go away! Go back to the other room, to your playmates.\"\n\n\"I don't want him to. I don't want him to! You go away!\" cried the\ngirl. \"Let him alone! Let him alone!\" She was almost weeping.\n\nThere was a sound of footsteps in the doorway. Julian Mastakovich\nstarted and straightened up his respectable body. The red-haired boy\nwas even more alarmed. He let go the girl's hand, sidled along the\nwall, and escaped through the drawing-room into the dining-room.\n\nNot to attract attention, Julian Mastakovich also made for the\ndining-room. He was red as a lobster. The sight of himself in a mirror\nseemed to embarrass him. Presumably he was annoyed at his own ardour\nand impatience. Without due respect to his importance and dignity, his\ncalculations had lured and pricked him to the greedy eagerness of a\nboy, who makes straight for his object--though this was not as yet an\nobject; it only would be so in five years' time. I followed the worthy\nman into the dining-room, where I witnessed a remarkable play.\n\nJulian Mastakovich, all flushed with vexation, venom in his look,\nbegan to threaten the red-haired boy. The red-haired boy retreated\nfarther and farther until there was no place left for him to retreat\nto, and he did not know where to turn in his fright.\n\n\"Get out of here! What are you doing here? Get out, I say, you\ngood-for-nothing! Stealing fruit, are you? Oh, so, stealing fruit! Get\nout, you freckle face, go to your likes!\"\n\nThe frightened child, as a last desperate resort, crawled quickly\nunder the table. His persecutor, completely infuriated, pulled out his\nlarge linen handkerchief and used it as a lash to drive the boy out of\nhis position.\n\nHere I must remark that Julian Mastakovich was a somewhat corpulent\nman, heavy, well-fed, puffy-cheeked, with a paunch and ankles as round\nas nuts. He perspired and puffed and panted. So strong was his dislike\n(or was it jealousy?) of the child that he actually began to carry on\nlike a madman.\n\nI laughed heartily. Julian Mastakovich turned. He was utterly confused\nand for a moment, apparently, quite oblivious of his immense\nimportance. At that moment our host appeared in the doorway opposite.\nThe boy crawled out from under the table and wiped his knees and\nelbows. Julian Mastakovich hastened to carry his handkerchief, which\nhe had been dangling by the corner, to his nose. Our host looked at\nthe three of us rather suspiciously. But, like a man who knows the\nworld and can readily adjust himself, he seized upon the opportunity\nto lay hold of his very valuable guest and get what he wanted out of\nhim.\n\n\"Here's the boy I was talking to you about,\" he said, indicating the\nred-haired child. \"I took the liberty of presuming on your goodness in\nhis behalf.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Julian Mastakovich, still not quite master of himself.\n\n\"He's my governess's son,\" our host continued in a beseeching tone.\n\"She's a poor creature, the widow of an honest official. That's why,\nif it were possible for you--\"\n\n\"Impossible, impossible!\" Julian Mastakovich cried hastily. \"You must\nexcuse me, Philip Alexeyevich, I really cannot. I've made inquiries.\nThere are no vacancies, and there is a waiting list of ten who have a\ngreater right--I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" said our host. \"He's a quiet, unobtrusive child.\"\n\n\"A very naughty little rascal, I should say,\" said Julian Mastakovich,\nwryly. \"Go away, boy. Why are you here still? Be off with you to the\nother children.\"\n\nUnable to control himself, he gave me a sidelong glance. Nor could I\ncontrol myself. I laughed straight in his face. He turned away and\nasked our host, in tones quite audible to me, who that odd young\nfellow was. They whispered to each other and left the room,\ndisregarding me.\n\nI shook with laughter. Then I, too, went to the drawing-room. There\nthe great man, already surrounded by the fathers and mothers and the\nhost and the hostess, had begun to talk eagerly with a lady to whom he\nhad just been introduced. The lady held the rich little girl's hand.\nJulian Mastakovich went into fulsome praise of her. He waxed ecstatic\nover the dear child's beauty, her talents, her grace, her excellent\nbreeding, plainly laying himself out to flatter the mother, who\nlistened scarcely able to restrain tears of joy, while the father\nshowed his delight by a gratified smile.\n\nThe joy was contagious. Everybody shared in it. Even the children were\nobliged to stop playing so as not to disturb the conversation. The\natmosphere was surcharged with awe. I heard the mother of the\nimportant little girl, touched to her profoundest depths, ask Julian\nMastakovich in the choicest language of courtesy, whether he would\nhonour them by coming to see them. I heard Julian Mastakovich accept\nthe invitation with unfeigned enthusiasm. Then the guests scattered\ndecorously to different parts of the room, and I heard them, with\nveneration in their tones, extol the business man, the business man's\nwife, the business man's daughter, and, especially, Julian\nMastakovich.\n\n\"Is he married?\" I asked out loud of an acquaintance of mine standing\nbeside Julian Mastakovich.\n\nJulian Mastakovich gave me a venomous look.\n\n\"No,\" answered my acquaintance, profoundly shocked by\nmy--intentional--indiscretion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot long ago I passed the Church of----. I was struck by the concourse\nof people gathered there to witness a wedding. It was a dreary day. A\ndrizzling rain was beginning to come down. I made my way through the\nthrong into the church. The bridegroom was a round, well-fed,\npot-bellied little man, very much dressed up. He ran and fussed about\nand gave orders and arranged things. Finally word was passed that the\nbride was coming. I pushed through the crowd, and I beheld a\nmarvellous beauty whose first spring was scarcely commencing. But the\nbeauty was pale and sad. She looked distracted. It seemed to me even\nthat her eyes were red from recent weeping. The classic severity of\nevery line of her face imparted a peculiar significance and solemnity\nto her beauty. But through that severity and solemnity, through the\nsadness, shone the innocence of a child. There was something\ninexpressibly na�ve, unsettled and young in her features, which,\nwithout words, seemed to plead for mercy.\n\nThey said she was just sixteen years old. I looked at the bridegroom\ncarefully. Suddenly I recognised Julian Mastakovich, whom I had not\nseen again in all those five years. Then I looked at the bride\nagain.--Good God! I made my way, as quickly as I could, out of the\nchurch. I heard gossiping in the crowd about the bride's wealth--about\nher dowry of five hundred thousand rubles--so and so much for pocket\nmoney.\n\n\"Then his calculations were correct,\" I thought, as I pressed out into\nthe street.\n\n\n\n\nGOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS\n\n\n\nBY LEO N. TOLSTOY\n\n\nIn the town of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitrich\nAksionov. He had two shops and a house of his own.\n\nAksionov was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full of\nfun, and very fond of singing. When quite a young man he had been\ngiven to drink, and was riotous when he had had too much; but after he\nmarried he gave up drinking, except now and then.\n\nOne summer Aksionov was going to the Nizhny Fair, and as he bade\ngood-bye to his family, his wife said to him, \"Ivan Dmitrich, do not\nstart to-day; I have had a bad dream about you.\"\n\nAksionov laughed, and said, \"You are afraid that when I get to the\nfair I shall go on a spree.\"\n\nHis wife replied: \"I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is\nthat I had a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town, and when\nyou took off your cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.\"\n\nAksionov laughed. \"That's a lucky sign,\" said he. \"See if I don't sell\nout all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair.\"\n\nSo he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.\n\nWhen he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and\nthey put up at the same inn for the night. They had some tea together,\nand then went to bed in adjoining rooms.\n\nIt was not Aksionov's habit to sleep late, and, wishing to travel\nwhile it was still cool, he aroused his driver before dawn, and told\nhim to put in the horses.\n\nThen he made his way across to the landlord of the inn (who lived in a\ncottage at the back), paid his bill, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses to\nbe fed. Aksionov rested awhile in the passage of the inn, then he\nstepped out into the porch, and, ordering a samovar to be heated, got\nout his guitar and began to play.\n\nSuddenly a troika drove up with tinkling bells and an official\nalighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksionov and began to\nquestion him, asking him who he was and whence he came. Aksionov\nanswered him fully, and said, \"Won't you have some tea with me?\" But\nthe official went on cross-questioning him and asking him. \"Where did\nyou spend last night? Were you alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did\nyou see the other merchant this morning? Why did you leave the inn\nbefore dawn?\"\n\nAksionov wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he\ndescribed all that had happened, and then added, \"Why do you\ncross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on\nbusiness of my own, and there is no need to question me.\"\n\nThen the official, calling the soldiers, said, \"I am the\npolice-officer of this district, and I question you because the\nmerchant with whom you spent last night has been found with his throat\ncut. We must search your things.\"\n\nThey entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped\nAksionov's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife\nout of a bag, crying, \"Whose knife is this?\"\n\nAksionov looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag,\nhe was frightened.\n\n\"How is it there is blood on this knife?\"\n\nAksionov tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only\nstammered: \"I--don't know--not mine.\" Then the police-officer said:\n\"This morning the merchant was found in bed with his throat cut. You\nare the only person who could have done it. The house was locked from\ninside, and no one else was there. Here is this blood-stained knife in\nyour bag and your face and manner betray you! Tell me how you killed\nhim, and how much money you stole?\"\n\nAksionov swore he had not done it; that he had not seen the merchant\nafter they had had tea together; that he had no money except eight\nthousand rubles of his own, and that the knife was not his. But his\nvoice was broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear as though\nhe went guilty.\n\nThe police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksionov and to put\nhim in the cart. As they tied his feet together and flung him into the\ncart, Aksionov crossed himself and wept. His money and goods were\ntaken from him, and he was sent to the nearest town and imprisoned\nthere. Enquiries as to his character were made in Vladimir. The\nmerchants and other inhabitants of that town said that in former days\nhe used to drink and waste his time, but that he was a good man. Then\nthe trial came on: he was charged with murdering a merchant from\nRyazan, and robbing him of twenty thousand rubles.\n\nHis wife was in despair, and did not know what to believe. Her\nchildren were all quite small; one was a baby at her breast. Taking\nthem all with her, she went to the town where her husband was in jail.\nAt first she was not allowed to see him; but after much begging, she\nobtained permission from the officials, and was taken to him. When she\nsaw her husband in prison-dress and in chains, shut up with thieves\nand criminals, she fell down, and did not come to her senses for a\nlong time. Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him.\nShe told him of things at home, and asked about what had happened to\nhim. He told her all, and she asked, \"What can we do now?\"\n\n\"We must petition the Czar not to let an innocent man perish.\"\n\nHis wife told him that she had sent a petition to the Czar, but it had\nnot been accepted.\n\nAksionov did not reply, but only looked downcast.\n\nThen his wife said, \"It was not for nothing I dreamt your hair had\nturned grey. You remember? You should not have started that day.\" And\npassing her fingers through his hair, she said: \"Vanya dearest, tell\nyour wife the truth; was it not you who did it?\"\n\n\"So you, too, suspect me!\" said Aksionov, and, hiding his face in his\nhands, he began to weep. Then a soldier came to say that the wife and\nchildren must go away; and Aksionov said good-bye to his family for\nthe last time.\n\nWhen they were gone, Aksionov recalled what had been said, and when he\nremembered that his wife also had suspected him, he said to himself,\n\"It seems that only God can know the truth; it is to Him alone we must\nappeal, and from Him alone expect mercy.\"\n\nAnd Aksionov wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only\nprayed to God.\n\nAksionov was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. So he was\nflogged with a knot, and when the wounds made by the knot were healed,\nhe was driven to Siberia with other convicts.\n\nFor twenty-six years Aksionov lived as a convict in Siberia. His hair\nturned white as snow, and his beard grew long, thin, and grey. All his\nmirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little, and never\nlaughed, but he often prayed.\n\nIn prison Aksionov learnt to make boots, and earned a little money,\nwith which he bought _The Lives of the Saints_. He read this book when\nthere was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays in the\nprison-church he read the lessons and sang in the choir; for his voice\nwas still good.\n\nThe prison authorities liked Aksionov for his meekness, and his\nfellow-prisoners respected him: they called him \"Grandfather,\" and\n\"The Saint.\" When they wanted to petition the prison authorities about\nanything, they always made Aksionov their spokesman, and when there\nwere quarrels among the prisoners they came to him to put things\nright, and to judge the matter.\n\nNo news reached Aksionov from his home, and he did not even know if\nhis wife and children were still alive.\n\nOne day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening\nthe old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked them what\ntowns or villages they came from, and what they were sentenced for.\nAmong the rest Aksionov sat down near the newcomers, and listened with\ndowncast air to what was said.\n\nOne of the new convicts, a tall, strong man of sixty, with a\nclosely-cropped grey beard, was telling the others what be had been\narrested for.\n\n\"Well, friends,\" he said, \"I only took a horse that was tied to a\nsledge, and I was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had only\ntaken it to get home quicker, and had then let it go; besides, the\ndriver was a personal friend of mine. So I said, 'It's all right.'\n'No,' said they, 'you stole it.' But how or where I stole it they\ncould not say. I once really did something wrong, and ought by rights\nto have come here long ago, but that time I was not found out. Now I\nhave been sent here for nothing at all... Eh, but it's lies I'm\ntelling you; I've been to Siberia before, but I did not stay long.\"\n\n\"Where are you from?\" asked some one.\n\n\"From Vladimir. My family are of that town. My name is Makar, and they\nalso call me Semyonich.\"\n\nAksionov raised his head and said: \"Tell me, Semyonich, do you know\nanything of the merchants Aksionov of Vladimir? Are they still alive?\"\n\n\"Know them? Of course I do. The Aksionovs are rich, though their\nfather is in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for you,\nGran'dad, how did you come here?\"\n\nAksionov did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed, and\nsaid, \"For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six years.\"\n\n\"What sins?\" asked Makar Semyonich.\n\nBut Aksionov only said, \"Well, well--I must have deserved it!\" He\nwould have said no more, but his companions told the newcomers how\nAksionov came to be in Siberia; how some one had killed a merchant,\nand had put the knife among Aksionov's things, and Aksionov had been\nunjustly condemned.\n\nWhen Makar Semyonich heard this, he looked at Aksionov, slapped his\n_own_ knee, and exclaimed, \"Well, this is wonderful! Really wonderful!\nBut how old you've grown, Gran'dad!\"\n\nThe others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen\nAksionov before; but Makar Semyonich did not reply. He only said:\n\"It's wonderful that we should meet here, lads!\"\n\nThese words made Aksionov wonder whether this man knew who had killed\nthe merchant; so he said, \"Perhaps, Semyonich, you have heard of that\naffair, or maybe you've seen me before?\"\n\n\"How could I help hearing? The world's full of rumours. But it's a\nlong time ago, and I've forgotten what I heard.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you heard who killed the merchant?\" asked Aksionov.\n\nMakar Semyonich laughed, and replied: \"It must have been him in whose\nbag the knife was found! If some one else hid the knife there, 'He's\nnot a thief till he's caught,' as the saying is. How could any one put\na knife into your bag while it was under your head? It would surely\nhave woke you up.\"\n\nWhen Aksionov heard these words, he felt sure this was the man who had\nkilled the merchant. He rose and went away. All that night Aksionov\nlay awake. He felt terribly unhappy, and all sorts of images rose in\nhis mind. There was the image of his wife as she was when he parted\nfrom her to go to the fair. He saw her as if she were present; her\nface and her eyes rose before him; he heard her speak and laugh. Then\nhe saw his children, quite little, as they were at that time: one\nwith a little cloak on, another at his mother's breast. And then he\nremembered himself as he used to be-young and merry. He remembered how\nhe sat playing the guitar in the porch of the inn where he was\narrested, and how free from care he had been. He saw, in his mind, the\nplace where he was flogged, the executioner, and the people standing\naround; the chains, the convicts, all the twenty-six years of his\nprison life, and his premature old age. The thought of it all made him\nso wretched that he was ready to kill himself.\n\n\"And it's all that villain's doing!\" thought Aksionov. And his anger\nwas so great against Makar Semyonich that he longed for vengeance,\neven if he himself should perish for it. He kept repeating prayers all\nnight, but could get no peace. During the day he did not go near Makar\nSemyonich, nor even look at him.\n\nA fortnight passed in this way. Aksionov could not sleep at night, and\nwas so miserable that he did not know what to do.\n\nOne night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth\nthat came rolling out from under one of the shelves on which the\nprisoners slept. He stopped to see what it was. Suddenly Makar\nSemyonich crept out from under the shelf, and looked up at Aksionov\nwith frightened face. Aksionov tried to pass without looking at him,\nbut Makar seized his hand and told him that he had dug a hole under\nthe wall, getting rid of the earth by putting it into his high-boots,\nand emptying it out every day on the road when the prisoners were\ndriven to their work.\n\n\"Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab,\nthey'll flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.\"\n\nAksionov trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew his\nhand away, saying, \"I have no wish to escape, and you have no need to\nkill me; you killed me long ago! As to telling of you--I may do so or\nnot, as God shall direct.\"\n\nNext day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers\nnoticed that one or other of the prisoners emptied some earth out of\nhis boots. The prison was searched and the tunnel found. The Governor\ncame and questioned all the prisoners to find out who had dug the\nhole. They all denied any knowledge of it. Those who knew would not\nbetray Makar Semyonich, knowing he would be flogged almost to death.\nAt last the Governor turned to Aksionov whom he knew to be a just man,\nand said:\n\n\"You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?\"\n\nMakar Semyonich stood as if he were quite unconcerned, looking at the\nGovernor and not so much as glancing at Aksionov. Aksionov's lips and\nhands trembled, and for a long time he could not utter a word. He\nthought, \"Why should I screen him who ruined my life? Let him pay for\nwhat I have suffered. But if I tell, they will probably flog the life\nout of him, and maybe I suspect him wrongly. And, after all, what good\nwould it be to me?\"\n\n\"Well, old man,\" repeated the Governor, \"tell me the truth: who has\nbeen digging under the wall?\"\n\nAksionov glanced at Makar Semyonich, and said, \"I cannot say, your\nhonour. It is not God's will that I should tell! Do what you like with\nme; I am in your hands.\"\n\nHowever much the Governor tried, Aksionov would say no more, and so\nthe matter had to be left.\n\nThat night, when Aksionov was lying on his bed and just beginning to\ndoze, some one came quietly and sat down on his bed. He peered through\nthe darkness and recognised Makar.\n\n\"What more do you want of me?\" asked Aksionov. \"Why have you come\nhere?\"\n\nMakar Semyonich was silent. So Aksionov sat up and said, \"What do you\nwant? Go away, or I will call the guard!\"\n\nMakar Semyonich bent close over Aksionov, and whispered, \"Ivan\nDmitrich, forgive me!\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Aksionov.\n\n\"It was I who killed the merchant and hid the knife among your things.\nI meant to kill you too, but I heard a noise outside, so I hid the\nknife in your bag and escaped out of the window.\"\n\nAksionov was silent, and did not know what to say. Makar Semyonich\nslid off the bed-shelf and knelt upon the ground. \"Ivan Dmitrich,\"\nsaid he, \"forgive me! For the love of God, forgive me! I will confess\nthat it was I who killed the merchant, and you will be released and\ncan go to your home.\"\n\n\"It is easy for you to talk,\" said Aksionov, \"but I have suffered for\nyou these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now?... My wife is\ndead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere to go...\"\n\nMakar Semyonich did not rise, but beat his head on the floor. \"Ivan\nDmitrich, forgive me!\" he cried. \"When they flogged me with the knot\nit was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now ... yet you had\npity on me, and did not tell. For Christ's sake forgive me, wretch\nthat I am!\" And he began to sob.\n\nWhen Aksionov heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep. \"God will\nforgive you!\" said he. \"Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you.\"\nAnd at these words his heart grew light, and the longing for home left\nhim. He no longer had any desire to leave the prison, but only hoped\nfor his last hour to come.\n\nIn spite of what Aksionov had said, Makar Semyonich confessed his\nguilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksionov was already\ndead.\n\n\n\n\nHOW A MUZHIK FED TWO OFFICIALS\n\n\n\nBY M.Y. SALTYKOV [_N.Shchedrin_]\n\n\nOnce upon a time there were two Officials. They were both\nempty-headed, and so they found themselves one day suddenly\ntransported to an uninhabited isle, as if on a magic carpet.\n\nThey had passed their whole life in a Government Department, where\nrecords were kept; had been born there, bred there, grown old there,\nand consequently hadn't the least understanding for anything outside\nof the Department; and the only words they knew were: \"With assurances\nof the highest esteem, I am your humble servant.\"\n\nBut the Department was abolished, and as the services of the two\nOfficials were no longer needed, they were given their freedom. So the\nretired Officials migrated to Podyacheskaya Street in St. Petersburg.\nEach had his own home, his own cook and his pension.\n\nWaking up on the uninhabited isle, they found themselves lying under\nthe same cover. At first, of course, they couldn't understand what had\nhappened to them, and they spoke as if nothing extraordinary had taken\nplace.\n\n\"What a peculiar dream I had last night, your Excellency,\" said the\none Official. \"It seemed to me as if I were on an uninhabited isle.\"\n\nScarcely had he uttered the words, when he jumped to his feet. The\nother Official also jumped up.\n\n\"Good Lord, what does this mean! Where are we?\" they cried out in\nastonishment.\n\nThey felt each other to make sure that they were no longer dreaming,\nand finally convinced themselves of the sad reality.\n\nBefore them stretched the ocean, and behind them was a little spot of\nearth, beyond which the ocean stretched again. They began to cry--the\nfirst time since their Department had been shut down.\n\nThey looked at each other, and each noticed that the other was clad in\nnothing but his night shirt with his order hanging about his neck.\n\n\"We really should be having our coffee now,\" observed the one\nOfficial. Then he bethought himself again of the strange situation he\nwas in and a second time fell to weeping.\n\n\"What are we going to do now?\" he sobbed. \"Even supposing we were to\ndraw up a report, what good would that do?\"\n\n\"You know what, your Excellency,\" replied the other Official, \"you go\nto the east and I will go to the west. Toward evening we will come\nback here again and, perhaps, we shall have found something.\"\n\nThey started to ascertain which was the east and which was the west.\nThey recalled that the head of their Department had once said to them,\n\"If you want to know where the east is, then turn your face to the\nnorth, and the east will be on your right.\" But when they tried to\nfind out which was the north, they turned to the right and to the left\nand looked around on all sides. Having spent their whole life in the\nDepartment of Records, their efforts were all in vain.\n\n\"To my mind, your Excellency, the best thing to do would be for you to\ngo to the right and me to go to the left,\" said one Official, who had\nserved not only in the Department of Records, but had also been\nteacher of handwriting in the School for Reserves, and so was a little\nbit cleverer.\n\nSo said, so done. The one Official went to the right. He came upon\ntrees, bearing all sorts of fruits. Gladly would he have plucked an\napple, but they all hung so high that he would have been obliged to\nclimb up. He tried to climb up in vain. All he succeeded in doing was\ntearing his night shirt. Then he struck upon a brook. It was swarming\nwith fish.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had all this fish in Podyacheskaya\nStreet!\" he thought, and his mouth watered. Then he entered woods and\nfound partridges, grouse and hares.\n\n\"Good Lord, what an abundance of food!\" he cried. His hunger was going\nup tremendously.\n\nBut he had to return to the appointed spot with empty hands. He found\nthe other Official waiting for him.\n\n\"Well, Your Excellency, how went it? Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing but an old number of the _Moscow Gazette_, not another\nthing.\"\n\nThe Officials lay down to sleep again, but their empty stomachs gave\nthem no rest They were partly robbed of their sleep by the thought of\nwho was now enjoying their pension, and partly by the recollection of\nthe fruit, fishes, partridges, grouse and hares that they had seen\nduring the day.\n\n\"The human pabulum in its original form flies, swims and grows on\ntrees. Who would have thought it your Excellency?\" said the one\nOfficial.\n\n\"To be sure,\" rejoined the other Official. \"I, too, must admit that I\nhad imagined that our breakfast rolls, came into the world just as\nthey appear on the table.\"\n\n\"From which it is to be deduced that if we want to eat a pheasant, we\nmust catch it first, kill it, pull its feathers and roast it. But\nhow's that to be done?\"\n\n\"Yes, how's that to be done?\" repeated the other Official.\n\nThey turned silent and tried again to fall asleep, but their hunger\nscared sleep away. Before their eyes swarmed flocks of pheasants and\nducks, herds of porklings, and they were all so juicy, done so\ntenderly and garnished so deliciously with olives, capers and pickles.\n\n\"I believe I could devour my own boots now,\" said the one Official.\n\n\"Gloves, are not bad either, especially if they have been born quite\nmellow,\" said the other Official.\n\nThe two Officials stared at each other fixedly. In their glances\ngleamed an evil-boding fire, their teeth chattered and a dull groaning\nissued from their breasts. Slowly they crept upon each other and\nsuddenly they burst into a fearful frenzy. There was a yelling and\ngroaning, the rags flew about, and the Official who had been teacher\nof handwriting bit off his colleague's order and swallowed it.\nHowever, the sight of blood brought them both back to their senses.\n\n\"God help us!\" they cried at the same time. \"We certainly don't mean\nto eat each other up. How could we have come to such a pass as this?\nWhat evil genius is making sport of us?\"\n\n\"We must, by all means, entertain each other to pass the time away,\notherwise there will be murder and death,\" said the one Official.\n\n\"You begin,\" said the other.\n\n\"Can you explain why it is that the sun first rises and then sets? Why\nisn't it the reverse?\"\n\n\"Aren't you a funny man, your Excellency? You get up first, then you\ngo to your office and work there, and at night you lie down to sleep.\"\n\n\"But why can't one assume the opposite, that is, that one goes to\nbed, sees all sorts of dream figures, and then gets up?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, certainly. But when I was still an Official, I always\nthought this way: 'Now it is dawn, then it will be day, then will\ncome supper, and finally will come the time to go to bed.'\"\n\nThe word \"supper\" recalled that incident in the day's doings, and the\nthought of it made both Officials melancholy, so that the conversation\ncame to a halt.\n\n\"A doctor once told me that human beings can sustain themselves for a\nlong time on their own juices,\" the one Official began again.\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It is quite simple. You see, one's own juices generate other juices,\nand these in their turn still other juices, and so it goes on until\nfinally all the juices are consumed.\"\n\n\"And then what happens?\"\n\n\"Then food has to be taken into the system again.\"\n\n\"The devil!\"\n\nNo matter what topic the Officials chose, the conversation invariably\nreverted to the subject of eating; which only increased their appetite\nmore and more. So they decided to give up talking altogether, and,\nrecollecting the _Moscow Gazette_ that the one of them had found, they\npicked it up and began to read eagerly.\n\n\nBANQUET GIVEN BY THE MAYOR\n\n\"The table was set for one hundred persons. The magnificence of it\nexceeded all expectations. The remotest provinces were represented at\nthis feast of the gods by the costliest gifts. The golden sturgeon\nfrom Sheksna and the silver pheasant from the Caucasian woods held a\nrendezvous with strawberries so seldom to be had in our latitude in\nwinter...\"\n\n\"The devil! For God's sake, stop reading, your Excellency. Couldn't\nyou find something else to read about?\" cried the other Official in\nsheer desperation. He snatched the paper from his colleague's hands,\nand started to read something else.\n\n\"Our correspondent in Tula informs us that yesterday a sturgeon was\nfound in the Upa (an event which even the oldest inhabitants cannot\nrecall, and all the more remarkable since they recognised the former\npolice captain in this sturgeon). This was made the occasion for\ngiving a banquet in the club. The prime cause of the banquet was\nserved in a large wooden platter garnished with vinegar pickles. A\nbunch of parsley stuck out of its mouth. Doctor P---- who acted as\ntoast-master saw to it that everybody present got a piece of the\nsturgeon. The sauces to go with it were unusually varied and\ndelicate--\"\n\n\"Permit me, your Excellency, it seems to me you are not so careful\neither in the selection of reading matter,\" interrupted the first\nOfficial, who secured the _Gazette_ again and started to read:\n\n\"One of the oldest inhabitants of Viatka has discovered a new and\nhighly original recipe for fish soup; A live codfish (_lota vulgaris_)\nis taken and beaten with a rod until its liver swells up with\nanger...\"\n\nThe Officials' heads drooped. Whatever their eyes fell upon had\nsomething to do with eating. Even their own thoughts were fatal. No\nmatter how much they tried to keep their minds off beefsteak and the\nlike, it was all in vain; their fancy returned invariably, with\nirresistible force, back to that for which they were so painfully\nyearning.\n\nSuddenly an inspiration came to the Official who had once taught\nhandwriting.\n\n\"I have it!\" he cried delightedly. \"What do you say to this, your\nExcellency? What do you say to our finding a muzhik?\"\n\n\"A muzhik, your Excellency? What sort of a muzhik?\"\n\n\"Why a plain ordinary muzhik. A muzhik like all other muzhiks. He\nwould get the breakfast rolls for us right away, and he could also\ncatch partridges and fish for us.\"\n\n\"Hm, a muzhik. But where are we to fetch one from, if there is no\nmuzhik here?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't there be a muzhik here? There are muzhiks everywhere.\nAll one has to do is hunt for them. There certainly must be a muzhik\nhiding here somewhere so as to get out of working.\"\n\nThis thought so cheered the Officials that they instantly jumped up to\ngo in search of a muzhik.\n\nFor a long while they wandered about on the island without the desired\nresult, until finally a concentrated smell of black bread and old\nsheep skin assailed their nostrils and guided them in the right\ndirection. There under a tree was a colossal muzhik lying fast asleep\nwith his hands under his head. It was clear that to escape his duty to\nwork he had impudently withdrawn to this island. The indignation of\nthe Officials knew no bounds.\n\n\"What, lying asleep here you lazy-bones you!\" they raged at him, \"It\nis nothing to you that there are two Officials here who are fairly\nperishing of hunger. Up, forward, march, work.\"\n\nThe Muzhik rose and looked at the two severe gentlemen standing in\nfront of him. His first thought was to make his escape, but the\nOfficials held him fast.\n\nHe had to submit to his fate. He had to work.\n\nFirst he climbed up on a tree and plucked several dozen of the finest\napples for the Officials. He kept a rotten one for himself. Then he\nturned up the earth and dug out some potatoes. Next he started a fire\nwith two bits of wood that he rubbed against each other. Out of his\nown hair he made a snare and caught partridges. Over the fire, by this\ntime burning brightly, he cooked so many kinds of food that the\nquestion arose in the Officials' minds whether they shouldn't give\nsome to this idler.\n\nBeholding the efforts of the Muzhik, they rejoiced in their hearts.\nThey had already forgotten how the day before they had nearly been\nperishing of hunger, and all they thought of now was: \"What a good\nthing it is to be an Official. Nothing bad can ever happen to an\nOfficial.\"\n\n\"Are you satisfied, gentlemen?\" the lazy Muzhik asked.\n\n\"Yes, we appreciate your industry,\" replied the Officials.\n\n\"Then you will permit me to rest a little?\"\n\n\"Go take a little rest, but first make a good strong cord.\"\n\nThe Muzhik gathered wild hemp stalks, laid them in water, beat them\nand broke them, and toward evening a good stout cord was ready. The\nOfficials took the cord and bound the Muzhik to a tree, so that he\nshould not run away. Then they laid themselves to sleep.\n\nThus day after day passed, and the Muzhik became so skilful that he\ncould actually cook soup for the Officials in his bare hands. The\nOfficials had become round and well-fed and happy. It rejoiced them\nthat here they needn't spend any money and that in the meanwhile their\npensions were accumulating in St. Petersburg.\n\n\"What is your opinion, your Excellency,\" one said to the other after\nbreakfast one day, \"is the Story of the Tower of Babel true? Don't you\nthink it is simply an allegory?\"\n\n\"By no means, your Excellency, I think it was something that really\nhappened. What other explanation is there for the existence of so many\ndifferent languages on earth?\"\n\n\"Then the Flood must really have taken place, too?\"\n\n\"Certainly, else; how would you explain the existence of Antediluvian\nanimals? Besides, the _Moscow Gazette_ says----\"\n\nThey made search for the old number of the _Moscow Gazette_, seated\nthemselves in the shade, and read the whole sheet from beginning to\nend. They read of festivities in Moscow, Tula, Penza and Riazan, and\nstrangely enough felt no discomfort at the description of the\ndelicacies served.\n\nThere is no saying how long this life might have lasted. Finally,\nhowever, it began to bore the Officials. They often thought of their\ncooks in St. Petersburg, and even shed a few tears in secret.\n\n\"I wonder how it looks in Podyacheskaya Street now, your Excellency,\"\none of them said to the other.\n\n\"Oh, don't remind me of it, your Excellency. I am pining away with\nhomesickness.\"\n\n\"It is very nice here. There is really no fault to be found with this\nplace, but the lamb longs for its mother sheep. And it is a pity, too,\nfor the beautiful uniforms.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, a uniform of the fourth class is no joke. The gold\nembroidery alone is enough to make one dizzy.\"\n\nNow they began to importune the Muzhik to find some way of getting\nthem back to Podyacheskaya Street, and strange to say, the Muzhik even\nknew where Podyacheskaya Street was. He had once drunk beer and mead\nthere, and as the saying goes, everything had run down his beard,\nalas, but nothing into his mouth. The Officials rejoiced and said: \"We\nare Officials from Podyacheskaya Street.\"\n\n\"And I am one of those men--do you remember?--who sit on a scaffolding\nhung by ropes from the roofs and paint the outside walls. I am one of\nthose who crawl about on the roofs like flies. That is what I am,\"\nreplied the Muzhik.\n\nThe Muzhik now pondered long and heavily on how to give great pleasure\nto his Officials, who had been so gracious to him, the lazy-bones, and\nhad not scorned his work. And he actually succeeded in constructing a\nship. It was not really a ship, but still it was a vessel, that would\ncarry them across the ocean close to Podyacheskaya Street.\n\n\"Now, take care, you dog, that you don't drown us,\" said the\nOfficials, when they saw the raft rising and falling on the waves.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. We muzhiks are used to this,\" said the Muzhik,\nmaking all the preparations for the journey. He gathered swan's-down\nand made a couch for his two Officials, then he crossed himself and\nrowed off from shore.\n\nHow frightened the Officials were on the way, how seasick they were\nduring the storms, how they scolded the coarse Muzhik for his\nidleness, can neither be told nor described. The Muzhik, however, just\nkept rowing on and fed his Officials on herring. At last, they caught\nsight of dear old Mother Neva. Soon they were in the glorious\nCatherine Canal, and then, oh joy! they struck the grand Podyacheskaya\nStreet. When the cooks saw their Officials so well-fed, round and so\nhappy, they rejoiced immensely. The Officials drank coffee and rolls,\nthen put on their uniforms and drove to the Pension Bureau. How much\nmoney they collected there is another thing that can neither be told\nnor described. Nor was the Muzhik forgotten. The Officials sent a\nglass of whiskey out to him and five kopeks. Now, Muzhik, rejoice.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHADES, A PHANTASY\n\n\n\nBY VLADIMIR G. KORLENKO\n\n\nI\n\nA month and two days had elapsed since the judges, amid the loud\nacclaim of the Athenian people, had pronounced the death sentence\nagainst the philosopher Socrates because he had sought to destroy\nfaith in the gods. What the gadfly is to the horse Socrates was to\nAthens. The gadfly stings the horse in order to prevent it from dozing\noff and to keep it moving briskly on its course. The philosopher said\nto the people of Athens:\n\n\"I am your gadfly. My sting pricks your conscience and arouses you\nwhen you are caught napping. Sleep not, sleep not, people of Athens;\nawake and seek the truth!\"\n\nThe people arose in their exasperation and cruelly demanded to be rid\nof their gadfly.\n\n\"Perchance both of his accusers, Meletus and Anytus, are wrong,\" said\nthe citizens, on leaving the court after sentence had been pronounced.\n\n\"But after all whither do his doctrines tend? What would he do? He has\nwrought confusion, he overthrows beliefs that have existed since the\nbeginning, he speaks of new virtues which must be recognised and\nsought for, he speaks of a Divinity hitherto unknown to us. The\nblasphemer, he deems himself wiser than the gods! No, 'twere better we\nremain true to the old gods whom we know. They may not always be just,\nsometimes they may flare up in unjust wrath, and they may also be\nseized with a wanton lust for the wives of mortals; but did not our\nancestors live with them in the peace of their souls, did not our\nforefathers accomplish their heroic deeds with the help of these very\ngods? And now the faces of the Olympians have paled and the old virtue\nis out of joint. What does it all lead to? Should not an end be put to\nthis impious wisdom once for all?\"\n\nThus the citizens of Athens spoke to one another as they left the\nplace, and the blue twilight was falling. They had determined to kill\nthe restless gadfly in the hope that the countenances of the gods\nwould shine again. And yet--before their souls arose the mild figure\nof the singular philosopher. There were some citizens who recalled how\ncourageously he had shared their troubles and dangers at Potid�a; how\nhe alone had prevented them from committing the sin of unjustly\nexecuting the generals after the victory over the Arginus�e; how he\nalone had dared to raise his voice against the tyrants who had had\nfifteen hundred people put to death, speaking to the people on the\nmarket-place concerning shepherds and their sheep.\n\n\"Is not he a good shepherd,\" he asked, \"who guards his flock and\nwatches over its increase? Or is it the work of the good shepherd to\nreduce the number of his sheep and disperse them, and of the good\nruler to do the same with his people? Men of Athens, let us\ninvestigate this question!\"\n\nAnd at this question of the solitary, undefended philosopher, the\nfaces of the tyrants paled, while the eyes of the youths kindled with\nthe fire of just wrath and indignation.\n\nThus, when on dispersing after the sentence the Athenians recalled all\nthese things of Socrates, their hearts were oppressed with heavy\ndoubt.\n\n\"Have we not done a cruel wrong to the son of Sophroniscus?\"\n\nBut then the good Athenians looked upon the harbour and the sea, and\nin the red glow of the dying day they saw the purple sails of the\nsharp-keeled ship, sent to the Delian festival, shimmering in the\ndistance on the blue Pontus. The ship would not return until the\nexpiration of a month, and the Athenians recollected that during this\ntime no blood might be shed in Athens, whether the blood of the\ninnocent or the guilty. A month, moreover, has many days and still\nmore hours. Supposing the son of Sophroniscus had been unjustly\ncondemned, who would hinder his escaping from the prison, especially\nsince he had numerous friends to help him? Was it so difficult for the\nrich Plato, for �schines and others to bribe the guards? Then the\nrestless gadfly would flee from Athens to the barbarians in Thessaly,\nor to the Peloponnesus, or, still farther, to Egypt; Athens would no\nlonger hear his blasphemous speeches; his death would not weigh upon\nthe conscience of the worthy citizens, and so everything would end for\nthe best of all.\n\nThus said many to themselves that evening, while aloud they praised\nthe wisdom of the demos and the heliasts. In secret, however, they\ncherished the hope that the restless philosopher would leave Athens,\nfly from the hemlock to the barbarians, and so free the Athenians of\nhis troublesome presence and of the pangs of consciences that smote\nthem for inflicting death upon an innocent man.\n\nTwo and thirty times since that evening had the sun risen from the\nocean and dipped down into it again. The ship had returned from Delos\nand lay in the harbour with sadly drooping sails, as if ashamed of its\nnative city. The moon did not shine in the heavens, the sea heaved\nunder a heavy fog, and on the hills lights peered through the\nobscurity like the eyes of men gripped by a sense of guilt.\n\nThe stubborn Socrates did not spare the conscience of the good\nAthenians.\n\n\"We part! You go home and I go to death,\" he said to the judges after\nthe sentence had been pronounced. \"I know not, my friends, which of us\nchooses the better lot!\"\n\nAs the time had approached for the return of the ship, many of the\ncitizens had begun to feel uneasy. Must that obstinate fellow really\ndie? And they began to appeal to the consciences of �schines, Ph�do,\nand other pupils of Socrates, trying to urge them on to further\nefforts for their master.\n\n\"Will you permit your teacher to die?\" they asked reproachfully in\nbiting tones. \"Or do you grudge the few coins it would take to bribe\nthe guard?\"\n\nIn vain Crito besought Socrates to take to flight, and complained that\nthe public, was upbraiding his disciples with lack of friendship and\nwith avarice. The self-willed philosopher refused to gratify his\npupils or the good people of Athens.\n\n\"Let us investigate.\" he said. \"If it turns out that I must flee, I\nwill flee; but if I must die, I will die. Let us remember what we once\nsaid--the wise man need not fear death, he need fear nothing but\nfalsehood. Is it right to abide by the laws we ourselves have made so\nlong as they are agreeable to us, and refuse to obey those which are\ndisagreeable? If my memory does not deceive me I believe we once spoke\nof these things, did we not?\"\n\n\"Yes, we did,\" answered his pupil.\n\n\"And I think all were agreed as to the answer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But perhaps what is true for others is not true for us?\"\n\n\"No, truth is alike for all, including ourselves.\"\n\n\"But perhaps when _we_ must die and not some one else, truth becomes\nuntruth?\"\n\n\"No, Socrates, truth remains the truth under all circumstances.\"\n\nAfter his pupil had thus agreed to each premise of Socrates in turn,\nhe smiled and drew his conclusion.\n\n\"If that is so, my friend, mustn't I die? Or has my head already\nbecome so weak that I am no longer in a condition to draw a logical\nconclusion? Then correct me, my friend and show my erring brain the\nright way.\"\n\nHis pupil covered his face with his mantle and turned aside.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"now I see you must die.\"\n\nAnd on that evening when the sea tossed hither and thither and roared\ndully under the load of fog, and the whimsical wind in mournful\nastonishment gently stirred the sails of the ships; when the citizens\nmeeting on the streets asked one another: \"Is he dead?\" and their\nvoices timidly betrayed the hope that he was not dead; when the first\nbreath of awakened conscience, touched the hearts of the Athenians\nlike the first messenger of the storm; and when, it seemed the very\nfaces of the gods were darkened with shame--on that evening at the\nsinking of the sun the self-willed man drank the cup of death!\n\nThe wind increased in violence and shrouded the city more closely in\nthe veil of mist, angrily tugging at the sails of the vessels delayed\nin the harbour. And the Erinyes sang their gloomy songs to the hearts\nof the citizens and whipped up in their breasts that tempest which was\nlater, to overwhelm the denouncers of Socrates.\n\nBut in that hour the first stirrings of regret were still uncertain\nand confused. The citizens found more fault with Socrates than ever\nbecause he had not given them the satisfaction of fleeing to Thessaly;\nthey were annoyed with his pupils because in the last days they had\nwalked about in sombre mourning attire, a living reproach to the\nAthenians; they were vexed with the judges because they had not had\nthe sense and the courage to resist the blind rage of the excited\npeople; they bore even the gods resentment.\n\n\"To you, ye gods, have we brought this sacrifice,\" spoke many.\n\"Rejoice, ye unsatiable!\"\n\n\"I know not which of us chooses the better lot!\"\n\nThose words of Socrates came back to their memory, those his last\nwords to the judges and to the people gathered in the court. Now he\nlay in the prison quiet and motionless under his cloak, while over the\ncity hovered mourning, horror, and shame.\n\nAgain he became the tormentor of the city, he who was himself no\nlonger accessible to torment. The gadfly had been killed, but it stung\nthe people more sharply than ever--sleep not, sleep not this night, O\nmen of Athens! Sleep not! You have committed an injustice, a cruel\ninjustice, which can never be erased!\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nDuring those sad days Xenophon, the general, a pupil of Socrates, was\nmarching with his Ten Thousand in a distant land, amid dangers,\nseeking a way of return to his beloved fatherland.\n\n�schines, Crito, Critobulus, Ph�do, and Apollodorus were now occupied\nwith the preparations for the modest funeral.\n\nPlato was burning his lamp and bending over a parchment; the best\ndisciple of the philosopher was busy inscribing the deeds, words, and\nteachings that marked the end of the sage's life. A thought is never\nlost, and the truth discovered by a great intellect illumines the way\nfor future generations like a torch in the dark.\n\nThere was one other disciple of Socrates. Not long before, the\nimpetuous Ctesippus had been one of the most frivolous and\npleasure-seeking of the Athenian youths. He had set up beauty as his\nsole god, and had bowed before Clinias as its highest exemplar. But\nsince he had become acquainted with Socrates, all desire for pleasure\nand all light-mindedness had gone from him. He looked on indifferently\nwhile others took his place with Clinias. The grace of thought and the\nharmony of spirit that he found in Socrates seemed a hundred times\nmore attractive than the graceful form and the harmonious features of\nClinias. With all the intensity of his stormy temperament he hung on\nthe man who had disturbed the serenity of his virginal soul, which for\nthe first time opened to doubts as the bud of a young oak opens to the\nfresh winds of spring.\n\nNow that the master was dead, he could find peace neither at his own\nhearth nor in the oppressive stillness of the streets nor among his\nfriends and fellow-disciples. The gods of hearth and home and the gods\nof the people inspired him with repugnance.\n\n\"I know not,\" he said, \"whether ye are the best of all the gods to\nwhom numerous generations have burned incense and brought offerings;\nall I know is that for your sake the blind mob extinguished the clear\ntorch of truth, and for your sake sacrificed the greatest and best of\nmortals!\"\n\nIt almost seemed to Ctesippus as though the streets and market-places\nstill echoed with the shrieking of that unjust sentence. And he\nremembered how it was here that the people clamoured for the execution\nof the generals who had led them to victory against the Argunis�, and\nhow Socrates alone had opposed the savage sentence of the judges and\nthe blind rage of the mob. But when Socrates himself needed a\nchampion, no one had been found to defend him with equal strength.\nCtesippus blamed himself and his friends, and for that reason he\nwanted to avoid everybody--even himself, if possible.\n\nThat evening he went to the sea. But his grief grew only the more\nviolent. It seemed to him that the mourning daughters of Nereus were\ntossing hither and thither on the shore bewailing the death of the\nbest of the Athenians and the folly of the frenzied city. The waves\nbroke on the rocky coast with a growl of lament. Their booming sounded\nlike a funeral dirge.\n\nHe turned away, left the shore, and went on further without looking\nbefore him. He forgot time and space and his own ego, filled only with\nthe afflicting thought of Socrates!\n\n\"Yesterday he still was, yesterday his mild words still could be\nheard. How is it possible that to-day he no longer is? O night, O\ngiant mountain shrouded in mist, O heaving sea moved by your own life,\nO restless winds that carry the breath of an immeasurable world on\nyour wings, O starry vault flecked with flying clouds--take me to you,\ndisclose to me the mystery of this death, if it is revealed to you!\nAnd if ye know not, then grant my ignorant soul your own lofty\nindifference. Remove from me these torturing questions. I no longer\nhave strength to carry them in my bosom without an answer, without\neven the hope of an answer. For who shall answer them, now that the\nlips of Socrates are sealed in eternal silence, and eternal darkness\nis laid upon his lids?\"\n\nThus Ctesippus cried out to the sea and the mountains, and to the dark\nnight, which followed its invariable course, ceaselessly, invisibly,\nover the slumbering world. Many hours passed before Ctesippus glanced\nup and saw whither his steps had unconsciously led him. A dark horror\nseized his soul as he looked about him.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt seemed as if the unknown gods of eternal night had heard his\nimpious prayer. Ctesippus looked about, without being able to\nrecognise the place where he was. The lights of the city had long been\nextinguished by the darkness. The roaring of the sea had died away in\nthe distance; his anxious soul had even lost the recollection of\nhaving heard it. No single sound--no mournful cry of nocturnal bird,\nnor whirr of wings, nor rustling of trees, nor murmur of a merry\nstream--broke the deep silence. Only the blind will-o'-the-wisps\nflickered here and there over rocks, and sheet-lightning,\nunaccompanied by any sound, flared up and died down against\ncrag-peaks. This brief illumination merely emphasised the darkness;\nand the dead light disclosed the outlines of dead deserts crossed by\ngorges like crawling serpents, and rising into rocky heights in a wild\nchaos.\n\nAll the joyous gods that haunt green groves, purling brooks, and\nmountain valleys seemed to have fled forever from these deserts. Pan\nalone, the great and mysterious Pan, was hiding somewhere nearby in\nthe chaos of nature, and with mocking glance seemed to be pursuing the\ntiny ant that a short time before had blasphemously asked to know the\nsecret of the world and of death. Dark, senseless horror overwhelmed\nthe soul of Ctesippus. It is thus that the sea in stormy floodtide\noverwhelms a rock on the shore.\n\nWas it a dream, was it reality, or was it the revelation of the\nunknown divinity? Ctesippus felt that in an instant he would step\nacross the threshold of life, and that his soul would melt into an\nocean of unending, inconceivable horror like a drop of rain in the\nwaves of the grey sea on a dark and stormy night. But at this moment\nhe suddenly heard voices that seemed familiar to him, and in the glare\nof the sheet-lightning his eyes recognised human figures.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nOn a rocky slope sat a man in deep despair. He had thrown a cloak over\nhis head and was bowed to the ground. Another figure approached him\nsoftly, cautiously climbing upward and carefully feeling every step.\nThe first man uncovered his face and exclaimed:\n\n\"Is that you I just now saw, my good Socrates? Is that you passing by\nme in this cheerless place? I have already spent many hours here\nwithout knowing when day will relieve the night. I have been waiting\nin vain for the dawn.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am Socrates, my friend, and you, are you not Elpidias who died\nthree days before me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am Elpidias, formerly the richest tanner in Athens, now the\nmost miserable of slaves. For the first time I understand the words of\nthe poet: 'Better to be a slave in this world than a ruler in gloomy\nHades.'\"\n\n\"My friend, if it is disagreeable for you where you are, why don't you\nmove to another spot?\"\n\n\"O Socrates, I marvel at you--how dare you wander about in this\ncheerless gloom? I--I sit here overcome with grief and bemoan the joys\nof a fleeting life.\"\n\n\"Friend Elpidias, like you, I, too, was plunged in this gloom when the\nlight of earthly life was removed from my eyes. But an inner voice\ntold me: 'Tread this new path without hesitation', and I went.\"\n\n\"But whither do you go, O son of Sophroniscus? Here there is no way,\nno path, not even a ray of light; nothing but a chaos of rocks, mist,\nand gloom.\"\n\n\"True. But, my Elpidias, since you are aware of this sad truth, have\nyou not asked yourself what is the most distressing thing in your\npresent situation?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly the dismal darkness.\"\n\n\"Then one should seek for light. Perchance you will find here the\ngreat law--that mortals must in darkness seek the source of life. Do\nyou not think it is better so to seek than to remain sitting in one\nspot? _I_ think it is, therefore I keep walking. Farewell!\"\n\n\"Oh, good Socrates, abandon me not! You go with sure steps through the\npathless chaos in Hades. Hold out to me but a fold of your mantle--\"\n\n\"If you think it is better for you, too, then follow me, friend\nElpidias.\"\n\nAnd the two shades walked on, while the soul of Ctesippus, released by\nsleep from its mortal envelop, flew after them, greedily absorbing the\ntones of the clear Socratic speech.\n\n\"Are you here, good Socrates?\" the voice of the Athenian again was\nheard. \"Why are you silent? Converse shortens the way, and I swear, by\nHercules, never did I have to traverse such a horrid way.\"\n\n\"Put questions, friend Elpidias! The question of one who seeks\nknowledge brings forth answers and produces conversation.\"\n\nElpidias maintained silence for a moment, and then, after he had\ncollected his thoughts, asked:\n\n\"Yes, this is what I wanted to say--tell me, my poor Socrates, did\nthey at least give you a good burial?\"\n\n\"I must confess, friend Elpidias, I cannot satisfy your curiosity.\"\n\n\"I understand, my poor Socrates, it doesn't help you cut a figure. Now\nwith me it was so different! Oh, how they buried me, how magnificently\nthey buried me, my poor fellow-Wanderer! I still think with great\npleasure of those lovely moments after my death. First they washed me\nand sprinkled me with well-smelling balsam. Then my faithful Larissa\ndressed me in garments of the finest weave. The best mourning-women of\nthe city tore their hair from their heads because they had been\npromised good pay, and in the family vault they placed an amphora--a\ncrater with beautiful, decorated handles of bronze, and, besides, a\nvial.--\"\n\n\"Stay, friend Elpidias. I am convinced that the faithful Larissa\nconverted her love into several minas. Yet--\"\n\n\"Exactly ten minas and four drachmas, not counting the drinks for the\nguests. I hardly think that the richest tanner can come before the\nsouls of his ancestors and boast of such respect on the part of the\nliving.\"\n\n\"Friend Elpidias, don't you think that money would have been of more\nuse to the poor people who are still alive in Athens than to you at\nthis moment?\"\n\n\"Admit, Socrates, you are speaking in envy,\" responded Elpidias,\npained. \"I am sorry for you, unfortunate Socrates, although, between\nourselves, you really deserved your fate. I myself in the family\ncircle said more than once that an end ought to be put to your impious\ndoings, because--\"\n\n\"Stay, friend, I thought you wanted to draw a conclusion, and I fear\nyou are straying from the straight path. Tell me, my good friend,\nwhither does your wavering thought tend?\"\n\n\"I wanted to say that in my goodness I am sorry for you. A month ago I\nmyself spoke against you in the assembly, but truly none of us who\nshouted so loud wanted such a great ill to befall you. Believe me, now\nI am all the sorrier for you, unhappy philosopher!\"\n\n\"I thank you. But tell me, my friend, do you perceive a brightness\nbefore your eyes?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary such darkness lies before me that I must ask\nmyself whether this is not the misty region of Orcus.\"\n\n\"This way, therefore, is just as dark for you as for me?\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\n\"If I am not mistaken, you are even holding on to the folds of my\ncloak?\"\n\n\"Also true.\"\n\n\"Then we are in the same position? You see your ancestors are not\nhastening to rejoice in the tale of your pompous burial. Where is the\ndifference between us, my good friend?\"\n\n\"But, Socrates, have the gods enveloped your reason in such obscurity\nthat the difference is not clear to you?\"\n\n\"Friend, if your situation is clearer to you, then give me your hand\nand lead me, for I swear, by the dog, you let me go ahead in this\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Cease your scoffing, Socrates! Do not make sport, and do not compare\nyourself, your godless self, with a man who died in his own bed----\".\n\n\"Ah, I believe I am beginning to understand you. But tell me,\nElpidias, do you hope ever again to rejoice in your bed?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think not.\"\n\n\"And was there ever a time when you did not sleep in it?\"\n\n\"Yes. That was before I bought goods from Agesilaus at half their\nvalue. You see, that Agesilaus is really a deep-dyed rogue----\"\n\n\"Ah, never mind about Agesilaus! Perhaps he is getting them back, from\nyour widow at a quarter their value. Then wasn't I right when I said\nthat you were in possession of your bed only part of the time?\"\n\n\"Yes, you were right.\"\n\n\"Well, and I, too, was in possession of the bed in which I died part\nof the time. Proteus, the good guard of the prison, lent it to me for\na period.\"\n\n\"Oh, if I had known what you were aiming at with your talk, I wouldn't\nhave answered your wily questions. By Hercules, such profanation is\nunheard of--he compares himself with me! Why, I could put an end to\nyou with two words, if it came to it----\"\n\n\"Say them, Elpidias, without fear. Words can scarcely be more\ndestructive to me than the hemlock.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that is just what I wanted to say. You unfortunate man,\nyou died by the sentence of the court and had to drink hemlock!\"\n\n\"But I have known that since the day of my death, even long before.\nAnd you, unfortunate Elpidias, tell me what caused your death?\"\n\n\"Oh, with me, it was different, entirely different! You see I got the\ndropsy in my abdomen. An expensive physician from Corinth was called\nwho promised to cure me for two minas, and he was given half that\namount in advance. I am afraid that Larissa in her lack of experience\nin such things gave him the other half, too----\"\n\n\"Then the physician did not keep his promise?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n\"And you died from dropsy?\"\n\n\"Ah, Socrates, believe me, three times it wanted to vanquish me, and\nfinally it quenched the flame of my life!\"\n\n\"Then tell me--did death by dropsy give you great pleasure?\"\n\n\"Oh, wicked Socrates, don't make sport of me. I told you it wanted to\nvanquish me three times. I bellowed like a steer under the knife of\nthe slaughterer, and begged the Parc� to cut the thread of my life as\nquickly as possible.\"\n\n\"That doesn't surprise me. But from what do you conclude that the\ndropsy was pleasanter to you than the hemlock to me? The hemlock made\nan end of me in a moment.\"\n\n\"I see, I fell into your snare again, you crafty sinner! I won't\nenrage the gods still more by speaking with you, you destroyer of\nsacred customs.\"\n\nBoth were silent, and quiet reigned. But in a short while Elpidias was\nagain the first to begin a conversation.\n\n\"Why are you silent, good Socrates?\"\n\n\"My friend; didn't you yourself ask for silence?\"\n\n\"I am not proud, and I can treat men who are worse than I am\nconsiderately. Don't let us quarrel.\"\n\n\"I did not quarrel with you, friend Elpidias, and did not wish to say\nanything to insult you. I am merely accustomed to get at the truth of\nthings by comparisons. My situation is not clear to me. You consider\nyour situation better, and I should be glad to learn why. On the other\nhand, it would not hurt you to learn the truth, whatever shape it may\ntake.\"\n\n\"Well, no more of this.\"\n\n\"Tell me, are you afraid? I don't think that the feeling I now have\ncan be called fear.\"\n\n\"I am afraid, although I have less cause than you to be at odds with\nthe gods. But don't you think that the gods, in abandoning us to\nourselves here in this chaos, have cheated us of our hopes?\"\n\n\"That depends upon what sort of hopes they were. What did you expect\nfrom the gods, Elpidias?\"\n\n\"Well, well, what did I expect from the gods! What curious questions\nyou ask, Socrates! If a man throughout life brings offerings, and at\nhis death passes away with a pious heart and with all that custom\ndemands, the gods might at least send some one to meet him, at least\none of the inferior gods, to show a man the way. ... But that reminds\nme. Many a time when I begged for good luck in traffic in hides, I\npromised Hermes calves----\"\n\n\"And you didn't have luck?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I had luck, good Socrates, but----\".\n\n\"I understand, you had no calf.\"\n\n\"Bah! Socrates, a rich tanner and not have calves?\"\n\n\"Now I understand. You had luck, had calves, but you kept them for\nyourself, and Hermes received nothing.\"\n\n\"You're a clever man. I've often said so. I kept only three of my ten\noaths, and I didn't deal differently with the other gods. If the same\nis the case with you, isn't that the reason, possibly, why we are now\nabandoned by the gods? To be sure, I ordered Larissa to sacrifice a\nwhole hecatomb after my death.\"\n\n\"But that is Larissa's affair, whereas it was you, friend Elpidias,\nwho made the promises.\"\n\n\"That's true, that's true. But you, good Socrates, could you, godless\nas you are, deal better with the gods than I who was a god-fearing\ntanner?\"\n\n\"My friend, I know not whether I dealt better or worse. At first I\nbrought offerings without having made vows. Later I offered neither\ncalves nor vows.\"\n\n\"What, not a single calf, you unfortunate man?\"\n\n\"Yes, friend, if Hermes had had to live by my gifts, I am afraid he\nwould have grown very thin.\"\n\n\"I understand. You did not traffic in cattle, so you offered articles\nof some other trade--probably a mina or so of what the pupils paid\nyou.\"\n\n\"You know, my friend, I didn't ask pay of my pupils, and my trade\nscarcely sufficed to support me. If the gods reckoned on the sorry\nremnants of my meals they miscalculated.\"\n\n\"Oh, blasphemer, in comparison with you I can be proud of my piety. Ye\ngods, look upon this man! I did deceive you at times, but now and then\nI shared with you the surplus of some fortunate deal. He who gives at\nall gives much in comparison with a blasphemer who gives nothing.\nSocrates, I think you had better go on alone! I fear that your\ncompany, godless one, damages me in the eyes of the gods.\"\n\n\"As you will, good Elpidias. I swear by the dog no one shall force his\ncompany on another. Unhand the fold of my mantle, and farewell. I will\ngo on alone.\"\n\nAnd Socrates walked forward with a sure tread, feeling the ground,\nhowever, at every step.\n\nBut Elpidias behind him instantly cried out:\n\n\"Wait, wait, my good fellow-citizen, do not leave an Athenian alone in\nthis horrible place! I was only making fun. Take what I said as a\njoke, and don't go so quickly. I marvel how you can see a thing in\nthis hellish darkness.\"\n\n\"Friend, I have accustomed my eyes to it.\"\n\n\"That's good. Still I, can't approve of your not having brought\nsacrifices to the gods. No, I can't, poor Socrates, I can't. The\nhonourable Sophroniscus certainly taught you better in your youth, and\nyou yourself used to take part in the prayers. I saw you.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I am accustomed to examine all our motives and to accept\nonly those that after investigation prove to be reasonable. And so a\nday came on which I said to myself: 'Socrates, here you are praying to\nthe Olympians. Why are you praying to them?'\"\n\nElpidias laughed.\n\n\"Really you philosophers sometimes don't know how to answer the\nsimplest questions. I'm a plain tanner who never in my life studied\nsophistry, yet I know why I must honour the Olympians.\"\n\n\"Tell me quickly, so that I, too, may know why.\"\n\n\"Why? Ha! Ha! It's too simple, you wise Socrates.\"\n\n\"So much the better if it's simple. But don't keep your wisdom from\nme. Tell me--why must one honour the gods?\"\n\n\"Why. Because everybody does it.\"\n\n\"Friend, you know very well that not every one honours the gods.\nWouldn't it be more correct to say 'many'?\"\n\n\"Very well, many.\"\n\n\"But tell me, don't more men deal wickedly than righteously?\"\n\n\"I think so. You find more wicked people than good people.\"\n\n\"Therefore, if you follow the majority, you ought to deal wickedly and\nnot righteously?\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"_I'm_ not saying it, _you_ are. But I think the reason that men\nreverence the Olympians is not because the majority worship them. We\nmust find another, more rational ground. Perhaps you mean they deserve\nreverence?\"\n\n\"Yes, very right.\"\n\n\"Good. But then arises a new question: Why do they deserve reverence?\"\n\n\"Because of their greatness.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's more like it. Perhaps I will soon be agreeing with you. It\nonly remains for you to tell me wherein their greatness consists.\nThat's a difficult question, isn't it? Let us seek the answer\ntogether. Homer says that the impetuous Ares, when stretched flat on\nthe ground by a stone thrown by Pallas Athene, covered with his body\nthe space that can be travelled in seven mornings. You see what an\nenormous space.\"\n\n\"Is that wherein greatness consists?\"\n\n\"There you have me, my friend. That raises another question. Do you\nremember the athlete Theophantes? He towered over the people a whole\nhead's length, whereas Pericles was no larger than you. But whom do we\ncall great, Pericles or Theophantes?\"\n\n\"I see that greatness does not consist in size of body. In that you're\nright. I am glad we agree. Perhaps greatness consists in virtue?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I think so, too.\"\n\n\"Well, then, who must bow to whom? The small before the large, or\nthose who are great in virtues before the wicked?\"\n\n\"The answer is clear.\"\n\n\"I think so, too. Now we will look further into this matter. Tell me\ntruly, did you ever kill other people's children with arrows?\"\n\n\"It goes without saying, never! Do you think so ill of me?\"\n\n\"Nor have you, I trust, ever seduced the wives of other men?\"\n\n\"I was an upright tanner and a good husband. Don't forget that,\nSocrates, I beg of you!\"\n\n\"You never became a brute, nor by your lustfulness gave your faithful\nLarissa occasion to revenge herself on women whom you had ruined and\non their innocent children?\"\n\n\"You anger me, really, Socrates.\"\n\n\"But perhaps you snatched your inheritance from your father and threw\nhim into prison?\"\n\n\"Never! Why these insulting questions?\"\n\n\"Wait, my friend. Perhaps we will both reach a conclusion. Tell me,\nwould you have considered a man great who had done all these things of\nwhich I have spoken?\"\n\n\"No, no, no! I should have called such a man a scoundrel, and lodged\npublic complaint against him with the judges in the market-place.\"\n\n\"Well, Elpidias, why did you not complain in the market-place against\nZeus and the Olympians? The son of Cronos carried on war with his own\nfather, and was seized with brutal lust for the daughters of men,\nwhile Hera took vengeance upon innocent virgins. Did not both of them\nconvert the unhappy daughter of Inachos into a common cow? Did not\nApollo kill all the children of Niobe with his arrows? Did not\nCallenius steal bulls? Well, then, Elpidias, if it is true that he who\nhas less virtue must do honour to him who has more, then you should\nnot build altars to the Olympians, but they to you.\"\n\n\"Blaspheme not, impious Socrates! Keep quiet! How dare you judge the\nacts of the gods?\"\n\n\"Friend, a higher power has judged them. Let us investigate the\nquestion. What is the mark of divinity? I think you said, Greatness,\nwhich consists in virtue. Now is not this greatness the one divine\nspark in man? But if we test the greatness of the gods by our small\nhuman virtues, and it turns out that that which measures is greater\nthan that which is measured, then it follows that the divine principle\nitself condemns the Olympians. But, then--\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"Then, friend Elpidias, they are no gods, but deceptive phantoms,\ncreations of a dream. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's whither your talk leads, you bare-footed philosopher! Now\nI see what they said of you is true. You are like that fish that takes\nmen captive with its look. So you took me captive in order to confound\nmy believing soul and awaken doubt in it. It was already beginning to\nwaver in its reverence for Zeus. Speak alone. I won't answer any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Be not wrathful, Elpidias! I don't wish to inflict any evil upon you.\nBut if you are tired of following my arguments to their logical\nconclusions, permit me to relate to you an allegory of a Milesian\nyouth. Allegories rest the mind, and the relaxation is not\nunprofitable.\"\n\n\"Speak, if your story is not too long and its purpose is good.\"\n\n\"Its purpose is truth, friend Elpidias, and I will be brief. Once, you\nknow, in ancient times, Miletus was exposed to the attacks of the\nbarbarians. Among the youth who were seized was a son of the wisest\nand best of all the citizens in the land. His precious child was\novertaken by a severe illness and became unconscious. He was abandoned\nand allowed to lie like worthless booty. In the dead of night he came\nto his senses. High above him glimmered the stars. Round about\nstretched the desert; and in the distance he heard the howl of beasts\nof prey. He was alone.\n\n\"He was entirely alone, and, besides that, the gods had taken from him\nthe recollection of his former life. In vain he racked his brain--it\nwas as dark and empty as the inhospitable desert in which he found\nhimself. But somewhere, far away, behind the misty and obscure figures\nconjured up by his reason, loomed the thought of his lost home, and a\nvague realisation of the figure of the best of all men; and in his\nheart resounded the word 'father.' Doesn't it seem to you that the\nfate of this youth resembles the fate of all humanity?\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Do we not all awake to life on earth with a hazy recollection of\nanother home? And does not the figure of the great unknown hover\nbefore our souls?\"\n\n\"Continue, Socrates, I am listening.\"\n\n\"The youth revived, arose, and walked cautiously, seeking to avoid all\ndangers. When after long wanderings his strength was nearly gone, he\ndiscerned a fire in the misty distance which illumined the darkness\nand banished the cold. A faint hope crept into his weary soul, and the\nrecollections of his father's house again awoke within him. The youth\nwalked toward the light, and cried: 'It is you, my father, it is you!'\n\n\"And was it his father's house?\"\n\n\"No, it was merely a night lodging of wild nomads. So for many years\nhe led the miserable life of a captive slave, and only in his dreams\nsaw the distant home and rested on his father's bosom. Sometimes with\nweak hand he endeavoured to lure from dead clay or wood or stone the\nface and form that ever hovered before him. There even came moments\nwhen he grew weary and embraced his own handiwork and prayed to it and\nwet it with his tears. But the stone remained cold stone. And as he\nwaxed in years the youth destroyed his creations, which already seemed\nto him a vile defamation of his ever-present dreams. At last fate\nbrought him to a good barbarian, who asked him for the cause of his\nconstant mourning. When the youth, confided to him the hopes and\nlongings of his soul, the barbarian, a wise man, said:\n\n\"'The world would be better did such a man and such a country exist as\nthat of which you speak. But by what mark would you recognise your\nfather?'\n\n\"'In my country,' answered the youth, 'they reverenced wisdom and\nvirtue and looked up to my father as to the master.'\n\n\"'Well and good,' answered the barbarian. 'I must assume that a kernel\nof your father's teaching resides in you. Therefore take up the\nwanderer's staff, and proceed on your way. Seek perfect wisdom and\ntruth, and when you have found them, cast aside your staff--there will\nbe your home and your father.'\n\n\"And the youth went on his way at break of day--\"\n\n\"Did he find the one whom he sought?\"\n\n\"He is still seeking. Many countries, cities and men has he seen. He\nhas come to know all the ways by land; he has traversed the stormy\nseas; he has searched the courses of the stars in heaven by which a\npilgrim can direct his course in the limitless deserts. And each time\nthat on his wearisome way an inviting fire lighted up the darkness\nbefore his eyes, his heart beat faster and hope crept into his soul.\n'That is my father's hospitable house,' he thought.\n\n\"And when a hospitable host would greet the tired traveller and offer\nhim the peace and blessing of his hearth, the youth would fall at his\nfeet and say with emotion: 'I thank you, my father! Do you not\nrecognise your son?'\n\n\"And many were prepared to take him as their son, for at that time\nchildren were frequently kidnapped. But after the first glow of\nenthusiasm, the youth would detect traces of imperfection, sometimes\neven of wickedness. Then he would begin to investigate and to test his\nhost with questions concerning justice and injustice. And soon he\nwould be driven forth again upon the cold wearisome way. More than\nonce he said to himself: 'I will remain at this last hearth, I will\npreserve my last belief. It shall be the home of my father.'\"\n\n\"Do you know, Socrates, perhaps that would have been the most sensible\nthing to do.\"\n\n\"So he thought sometimes. But the habit of investigating, the confused\ndream of a father, gave him no peace. Again and again he shook the\ndust from his feet; again and again he grasped his staff. Not a few\nstormy nights found him shelterless. Doesn't it seem to you that the\nfate of this youth resembles the fate of mankind?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Does not the race of man make trial of its childish belief and doubt\nit while seeking the unknown? Doesn't it fashion the form of its\nfather in wood, stone, custom, and tradition? And then man finds the\nform imperfect, destroys it, and again goes on his wanderings in the\ndesert of doubt. Always for the purpose of seeking something better--\"\n\n\"Oh, you cunning sage, now I understand the purpose of your allegory!\nAnd I will tell you to your face that if only a ray of light were to\npenetrate this gloom, I would not put the Lord on trial with\nunnecessary questions--\"\n\n\"Friend, the light is already shining,\" answered Socrates.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nIt seemed as if the words of the philosopher had taken effect. High up\nin the distance a beam of light penetrated a vapoury envelop and\ndisappeared in the mountains. It was followed by a second and a third.\nThere beyond the darkness luminous genii seemed to be hovering, and a\ngreat mystery seemed about to be revealed, as if the breath of life\nwere blowing, as if some great ceremony were in process. But it was\nstill very remote. The shades descended thicker and thicker; foggy\nclouds rolled into masses, separated, and chased one another\nendlessly, ceaselessly.\n\nA blue light from a distant peak fell upon a deep ravine; the clouds\nrose and covered the heavens to the zenith.\n\nThe rays disappeared and withdrew to a greater and greater distance,\nas if fleeing from this vale of shades and horrors. Socrates stood and\nlooked after them sadly. Elpidias peered up at the peak full of dread.\n\n\"Look, Socrates! What do you see there on the mountain?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" answered; the philosopher, \"let us investigate our\nsituation. Since we are in motion, we must arrive somewhere, and since\nearthly existence must have a limit, I believe that this limit is to\nbe found at the parting of two beginnings. In the struggle of light\nwith darkness we attain the crown of our endeavours. Since the ability\nto think has not been taken from us, I believe that it is the will of\nthe divine being who called our power of thinking into existence that\nwe should investigate the goal of our endeavours ourselves. Therefore,\nElpidias, let us in dignified manner go to meet the dawn that lies\nbeyond those clouds.\"\n\n\"Oh, my friend! If that is the dawn, I would rather the long cheerless\nnight had endured forever, for it was quiet and peaceful. Don't you\nthink our time passed tolerably well in instructive converse? And now\nmy soul trembles before the tempest drawing nigh. Say what you will,\nbut there before us are no ordinary shades of the dead night.\"\n\nZeus hurled a bolt into the bottomless gulf.\n\nCtesippus looked up to the peak, and his soul was frozen with horror.\nHuge sombre figures of the Olympian gods crowded on the mountain in a\ncircle. A last ray shot through the region of clouds and mists, and\ndied away like a faint memory. A storm was approaching now, and the\npowers of night were once more in the ascendant. Dark figures covered\nthe heavens. In the centre Ctesippus could discern the all-powerful\nson of Cronos surrounded by a halo. The sombre figures of the older\ngods encircled him in wrathful excitement. Like flocks of birds\nwinging their way in the twilight, like eddies of dust driven by a\nhurricane, like autumn leaves lashed by Boreas, numerous minor gods\nhovered in long clouds and occupied the spaces.\n\nWhen the clouds gradually lifted from the peak and sent down dismal\nhorror to embrace the earth, Ctesippus fell upon his knees. Later, he\nadmitted that in this dreadful moment he forgot all his master's\ndeductions and conclusions. His courage failed him; and terror took\npossession of his soul.\n\nHe merely listened.\n\nTwo voices resounded there where before had been silence, the one the\nmighty and threatening voice of the Godhead, the other the weak voice\nof a mortal which the wind carried from the mountain slope to the spot\nwhere Ctesippus had left Socrates.\n\n\"Are you,\" thus spake the voice from the clouds, \"are you the\nblasphemous Socrates who strives with the gods of heaven and earth?\nOnce there were none so joyous, so immortal, as we. Now, for long we\nhave passed our days in darkness because of the unbelief and doubt\nthat have come upon earth. Never has the mist closed in on us so\nheavily as since the time your voice resounded in Athens, the city we\nonce so dearly loved. Why did you not follow the commands of your\nfather, Sophroniscus? The good man permitted himself a few little\nsins, especially in his youth, yet by way of recompense, we frequently\nenjoyed the smell of his offerings--\"\n\n\"Stay, son of Cronos, and solve my doubts! Do I understand that you\nprefer cowardly hypocrisy to searchings for the truth?\"\n\nAt this question the crags trembled with the shock of a thundering\npeal. The first breath of the tempest scattered in the distant gorges.\nBut the mountains still trembled, for he who was enthroned upon them\nstill trembled. And in the anxious quiet of the night only distant\nsighs could be heard.\n\nIn the very bowels of the earth the chained Titans seemed to be\ngroaning under the blow of the son of Cronos.\n\n\"Where are you now, you impious questioner?\" suddenly came the mocking\nvoice of the Olympian.\n\n\"I am here, son of Cronos, on the same spot. Nothing but your answer\ncan move me from it. I am waiting.\"\n\nThunder bellowed in the clouds like a wild animal amazed at the daring\nof a Lybian tamer's fearless approach. At the end of a few moments the\nVoice again rolled over the spaces:\n\n\"Son of Sophroniscus! Is it not enough that you bred so much\nscepticism on earth that the clouds of your doubt reached even to\nOlympus? Indeed, many a time when you were carrying on your discourse\nin the market-places or in the academies or on the promenades, it\nseemed to me as if you had already destroyed all the altars on earth,\nand the dust were rising from them up to us here on the mountain. Even\nthat is not enough! Here before my very face you will not recognise\nthe power of the immortals--\"\n\n\"Zeus, thou art wrathful. Tell me, who gave me the 'Daemon' which\nspoke to my soul throughout my life and forced me to seek the truth\nwithout resting?\"\n\nMysterious silence reigned in the clouds.\n\n\"Was it not you? You are silent? Then I will investigate the matter.\nEither this divine beginning emanates from you or from some one else.\nIf from you, I bring it to you as an offering. I offer you the ripe\nfruit of my life, the flame of the spark of your own kindling! See,\nson of Cronos, I preserved my gift; in my deepest heart grew the seed\nthat you sowed. It is the very fire of my soul. It burned in those\ncrises when with my own hand I tore the thread of life. Why will you\nnot accept it? Would you have me regard you as a poor master whose age\nprevents him from seeing that his own pupil obediently follows out his\ncommands? Who are you that would command me to stifle the flame that\nhas illuminated my whole life, ever since it was penetrated by the\nfirst ray of sacred thought? The sun says not to the stars: 'Be\nextinguished that I may rise.' The sun rises and the weak glimmer of\nthe stars is quenched by its far, far stronger light. The day says not\nto the torch: 'Be extinguished; you interfere with me.' The day\nbreaks, and the torch smokes, but no longer shines. The divinity that\nI am questing is not you who are afraid of doubt. That divinity is\nlike the day, like the sun, and shines without extinguishing other\nlights. The god I seek is the god who would say to me: 'Wanderer, give\nme your torch, you no longer need it, for I am the source of all\nlight. Searcher for truth, set upon my altar the little gift of your\ndoubt, because in me is its solution.' If you are that god, harken to\nmy questions. No one kills his own child, and my doubts are a branch\nof the eternal spirit whose name is truth.\"\n\nRound about, the fires of heaven tore the dark clouds, and out of the\nhowling storm again resounded the powerful voice:\n\n\"Whither did your doubts tend, you arrogant sage, who renounce\nhumility, the most beautiful adornment of earthly virtues? You\nabandoned the friendly shelter of credulous simplicity to wander in\nthe desert of doubt. You have seen this dead space from which the\nliving gods have departed. Will you traverse it, you insignificant\nworm, who crawl in the dust of your pitiful profanation of the gods?\nWill you vivify the world? Will you conceive the unknown divinity to\nwhom you do not dare to pray? You miserable digger of dung, soiled by\nthe smut of ruined altars, are you perchance the architect who shall\nbuild the new temple? Upon what do you base your hopes, you who\ndisavow the old gods and have no new gods to take their place? The\neternal night of doubts unsolved, the dead desert, deprived of the\nliving spirit--_this_ is your world, you pitiful worm, who gnawed at\nthe living belief which was a refuge for simple hearts, who converted\nthe world into a dead chaos. Now, then, where are you, you\ninsignificant, blasphemous sage?\"\n\nNothing was heard but the mighty storm roaring through the spaces.\nThen the thunder died away, the wind folded its pinions, and torrents\nof rain streamed through the darkness, like incessant floods of tears\nwhich threatened to devour the earth and drown it in a deluge of\nunquenchable grief.\n\nIt seemed to Ctesippus that the master was overcome, and that the\nfearless, restless, questioning voice had been silenced forever. But a\nfew moments later it issued again from the same spot.\n\n\"Your words, son of Cronos, hit the mark better than your\nthunderbolts. The thoughts you have cast into my terrified soul have\nhaunted me often, and it has sometimes seemed as if my heart would\nbreak under the burden of their unendurable anguish. Yes, I abandoned\nthe friendly shelter of credulous simplicity. Yes, I have seen the\nspaces from which the living gods have departed enveloped in the night\nof eternal doubt. But I walked without fear, for my 'Daemon' lighted\nthe way, the divine beginning of all life. Let us investigate the\nquestion. Are not offerings of incense burnt on your altars in the\nname of Him who gives life? You are stealing what belongs to another!\nNot you, but that other, is served by credulous simplicity. Yes, you\nare right, I am no architect. I am not the builder of a new temple.\nNot to me was it given to raise from the earth to the heavens the\nglorious structure of the coming faith. I am one who digs dung, soiled\nby the smut of destruction. But my conscience tells me, son of Cronos,\nthat the work of one who digs dung is also necessary for the future\ntemple. When the time comes for the proud and stately edifice to stand\non the purified place, and for the living divinity of the new belief\nto erect his throne upon it, I, the modest digger of dung, will go to\nhim and say: 'Here am I who restlessly crawled in the dust of\ndisavowal. When surrounded by fog and soot, I had no time to raise my\neyes from the ground; my head had only a vague conception of the\nfuture building. Will you reject me, you just one, Just, and True, and\nGreat?'\"\n\nSilence and astonishment reigned in the spaces. Then Socrates raised\nhis voice, and continued:\n\n\"The sunbeam falls upon the filthy puddle, and light vapour, leaving\nheavy mud behind, rises to the sun, melts, and dissolves in the ether.\nWith your sunbeam you touched my dust-laden soul and it aspired to\nyou, Unknown One, whose name is mystery! I sought for you, because you\nare Truth; I strove to attain to you, because you are Justice; I loved\nyou, because you are Love; I died for you, because you are the Source\nof Life. Will you reject me, O Unknown? My torturing doubts, my\npassionate search for truth, my difficult life, my voluntary\ndeath--accept them as a bloodless offering, as a prayer, as a sigh!\nAbsorb them as the immeasurable ether absorbs the evaporating mists!\nTake them, you whose name I do not know, let not the ghosts of the\nnight I have traversed bar the way to you, to eternal light! Give way,\nyou shades who dim the light of the dawn! I tell you, gods of my\npeople, you are unjust, and where there is no justice there can be no\ntruth, but only phantoms, creations of a dream. To this conclusion\nhave I come, I, Socrates, who sought to fathom all things. Rise, dead\nmists, I go my way to Him whom I have sought all my life long!\"\n\nThe thunder burst again--a short, abrupt peal, as if the egis had\nfallen from the weakened hand of the thunderer. Storm-voices trembled\nfrom the mountains, sounding dully in the gorges, and died away in the\nclefts. In their place resounded other, marvellous tones.\n\nWhen Ctesippus looked up in astonishment, a spectacle presented itself\nsuch as no mortal eyes had ever seen.\n\nThe night vanished. The clouds lifted, and godly figures floated in\nthe azure like golden ornaments on the hem of a festive robe. Heroic\nforms glimmered over the remote crags and ravines, and Elpidias, whose\nlittle figure was seen standing at the edge of a cleft in the rocks,\nstretched his hands toward them, as if beseeching the vanishing gods\nfor a solution of his fate.\n\nA mountain-peak now stood out clearly above the mysterious mist,\ngleaming like a torch over dark blue valleys. The son of Cronos, the\nthunderer, was no longer enthroned upon it, and the other Olympians\ntoo were gone.\n\nSocrates stood alone in the light of the sun under the high heavens.\n\nCtesippus was distinctly conscious of the pulse-beat of a mysterious\nlife quivering throughout nature, stirring even the tiniest blade of\ngrass.\n\nA breath seemed to be stirring the balmy air, a voice to be sounding\nin wonderful harmony, an invisible tread to be heard--the tread of the\nradiant Dawn!\n\nAnd on the illumined peak a man still stood, stretching out his arms\nin mute ecstasy, moved by a mighty impulse.\n\nA moment, and all disappeared, and the light of an ordinary day shone\nupon the awakened soul of Ctesippus. It was like dismal twilight after\nthe revelation of nature that had blown upon him the breath of an\nunknown life.\n\n       *        *        *        *        *\n\nIn deep silence the pupils of the philosopher listened to the\nmarvellous recital of Ctesippus. Plato broke the silence.\n\n\"Let us investigate the dream and its significance,\" he said.\n\n\"Let us investigate it,\" responded the others.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIGNAL\n\n\n\nBY VSEVOLOD M. GARSHIN.\n\n\nSemyon Ivanov was a track-walker. His hut was ten versts away from a\nrailroad station in one direction and twelve versts away in the other.\nAbout four versts away there was a cotton mill that had opened the\nyear before, and its tall chimney rose up darkly from behind the\nforest. The only dwellings around were the distant huts of the other\ntrack-walkers.\n\nSemyon Ivanov's health had been completely shattered. Nine years\nbefore he had served right through the war as servant to an officer.\nThe sun had roasted him, the cold frozen him, and hunger famished him\non the forced marches of forty and fifty versts a day in the heat and\nthe cold and the rain and the shine. The bullets had whizzed about\nhim, but, thank God! none had struck him.\n\nSemyon's regiment had once been on the firing line. For a whole week\nthere had been skirmishing with the Turks, only a deep ravine\nseparating the two hostile armies; and from morn till eve there had\nbeen a steady cross-fire. Thrice daily Semyon carried a steaming\nsamovar and his officer's meals from the camp kitchen to the ravine.\nThe bullets hummed about him and rattled viciously against the rocks.\nSemyon was terrified and cried sometimes, but still he kept right on.\nThe officers were pleased with him, because he always had hot tea\nready for them.\n\nHe returned from the campaign with limbs unbroken but crippled with\nrheumatism. He had experienced no little sorrow since then. He arrived\nhome to find that his father, an old man, and his little four-year-old\nson had died. Semyon remained alone with his wife. They could not do\nmuch. It was difficult to plough with rheumatic arms and legs. They\ncould no longer stay in their village, so they started off to seek\ntheir fortune in new places. They stayed for a short time on the line,\nin Kherson and Donshchina, but nowhere found luck. Then the wife went\nout to service, and Semyon continued to travel about. Once he happened\nto ride on an engine, and at one of the stations the face of the\nstation-master seemed familiar to him. Semyon looked at the\nstation-master and the station-master looked at Semyon, and they\nrecognised each other. He had been an officer in Semyon's regiment.\n\n\"You are Ivanov?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"How do you come to be here?\"\n\nSemyon told him all.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, sir.\"\n\n\"Idiot! What do you mean by 'cannot tell you?'\"\n\n\"I mean what I say, your Excellency. There is nowhere for me to go to.\nI must hunt for work, sir.\"\n\nThe station-master looked at him, thought a bit, and said: \"See here,\nfriend, stay here a while at the station. You are married, I think.\nWhere is your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency, I am married. My wife is at Kursk, in service\nwith a merchant.\"\n\n\"Well, write to your wife to come here. I will give you a free pass\nfor her. There is a position as track-walker open. I will speak to the\nChief on your behalf.\"\n\n\"I shall be very grateful to you, your Excellency,\" replied Semyon.\n\nHe stayed at the station, helped in the kitchen, cut firewood, kept\nthe yard clean, and swept the platform. In a fortnight's time his wife\narrived, and Semyon went on a hand-trolley to his hut. The hut was a\nnew one and warm, with as much wood as he wanted. There was a little\nvegetable garden, the legacy of former track-walkers, and there was\nabout half a dessiatin of ploughed land on either side of the railway\nembankment. Semyon was rejoiced. He began to think of doing some\nfarming, of purchasing a cow and a horse.\n\nHe was given all necessary stores--a green flag, a red flag, lanterns,\na horn, hammer, screw-wrench for the nuts, a crow-bar, spade, broom,\nbolts, and nails; they gave him two books of regulations and a\ntime-table of the train. At first Semyon could not sleep at night, and\nlearnt the whole time-table by heart. Two hours before a train was due\nhe would go over his section, sit on the bench at his hut, and look\nand listen whether the rails were trembling or the rumble of the train\ncould be heard. He even learned the regulations by heart, although he\ncould only read by spelling out each word.\n\nIt was summer; the work was not heavy; there was no snow to clear\naway, and the trains on that line were infrequent. Semyon used to go\nover his verst twice a day, examine and screw up nuts here and there,\nkeep the bed level, look at the water-pipes, and then go home to his\nown affairs. There was only one drawback--he always had to get the\ninspector's permission for the least little thing he wanted to do.\nSemyon and his wife were even beginning to be bored.\n\nTwo months passed, and Semyon commenced to make the acquaintance of\nhis neighbours, the track-walkers on either side of him. One was a\nvery old man, whom the authorities were always meaning to relieve. He\nscarcely moved out of his hut. His wife used to do all his work. The\nother track-walker, nearer the station, was a young man, thin, but\nmuscular. He and Semyon met for the first time on the line midway\nbetween the huts. Semyon took off his hat and bowed. \"Good health to\nyou, neighbour,\" he said.\n\nThe neighbour glanced askance at him. \"How do you do?\" he replied;\nthen turned around and made off.\n\nLater the wives met. Semyon's wife passed the time of day with her\nneighbour, but neither did she say much.\n\nOn one occasion Semyon said to her: \"Young woman, your husband is not\nvery talkative.\"\n\nThe woman said nothing at first, then replied: \"But what is there for\nhim to talk about? Every one has his own business. Go your way, and\nGod be with you.\"\n\nHowever, after another month or so they became acquainted. Semyon\nwould go with Vasily along the line, sit on the edge of a pipe, smoke,\nand talk of life. Vasily, for the most part, kept silent, but Semyon\ntalked of his village, and of the campaign through which he had\npassed.\n\n\"I have had no little sorrow in my day,\" he would say; \"and goodness\nknows I have not lived long. God has not given me happiness, but what\nHe may give, so will it be. That's so, friend Vasily Stepanych.\"\n\nVasily Stepanych knocked the ashes out of his pipe against a rail,\nstood up, and said: \"It is not luck which follows us in life, but\nhuman beings. There is no crueller beast on this earth than man. Wolf\ndoes not eat wolf, but man will readily devour man.\"\n\n\"Come, friend, don't say that; a wolf eats wolf.\"\n\n\"The words came into my mind and I said it. All the same, there is\nnothing crueller than man. If it were not for his wickedness and\ngreed, it would be possible to live. Everybody tries to sting you to\nthe quick, to bite and eat you up.\"\n\nSemyon pondered a bit. \"I don't know, brother,\" he said; \"perhaps it\nis as you say, and perhaps it is God's will.\"\n\n\"And perhaps,\" said Vasily, \"it is waste of time for me to talk to\nyou. To put everything unpleasant on God, and sit and suffer, means,\nbrother, being not a man but an animal. That's what I have to say.\"\nAnd he turned and went off without saying good-bye.\n\nSemyon also got up. \"Neighbour,\" he called, \"why do you lose your\ntemper?\" But his neighbour did not look round, and kept on his way.\n\nSemyon gazed after him until he was lost to sight in the cutting at\nthe turn. He went home and said to his wife: \"Arina, our neighbour is\na wicked person, not a man.\"\n\nHowever, they did not quarrel. They met again and discussed the same\ntopics.\n\n\"All, mend, if it were not for men we should not be poking in these\nhuts,\" said Vasily, on one occasion.\n\n\"And what if we are poking in these huts? It's not so bad. You can\nlive in them.\"\n\n\"Live in them, indeed! Bah, you!... You have lived long and learned\nlittle, looked at much and seen little. What sort of life is there for\na poor man in a hut here or there? The cannibals are devouring you.\nThey are sucking up all your life-blood, and when you become old, they\nwill throw you out just as they do husks to feed the pigs on. What pay\ndo you get?\"\n\n\"Not much, Vasily Stepanych--twelve rubles.\"\n\n\"And I, thirteen and a half rubles. Why? By the regulations the\ncompany should give us fifteen rubles a month with firing and\nlighting. Who decides that you should have twelve rubles, or I\nthirteen and a half? Ask yourself! And you say a man can live on that?\nYou understand it is not a question of one and a half rubles or three\nrubles--even if they paid us each the whole fifteen rubles. I was at\nthe station last month. The director passed through. I saw him. I had\nthat honour. He had a separate coach. He came out and stood on the\nplatform... I shall not stay here long; I shall go somewhere,\nanywhere, follow my nose.\"\n\n\"But where will you go, Stepanych? Leave well enough alone. Here you\nhave a house, warmth, a little piece of land. Your wife is a worker.\"\n\n\"Land! You should look at my piece of land. Not a twig on it--nothing.\nI planted some cabbages in the spring, just when the inspector came\nalong. He said: 'What is this? Why have you not reported this? Why\nhave you done this without permission? Dig them up, roots and all.' He\nwas drunk. Another time he would not have said a word, but this time\nit struck him. Three rubles fine!...\"\n\nVasily kept silent for a while, pulling at his pipe, then added\nquietly: \"A little more and I should have done for him.\"\n\n\"You are hot-tempered.\"\n\n\"No, I am not hot-tempered, but I tell the truth and think. Yes, he\nwill still get a bloody nose from me. I will complain to the Chief. We\nwill see then!\" And Vasily did complain to the Chief.\n\nOnce the Chief came to inspect the line. Three days later important\npersonages were coming from St. Petersburg and would pass over the\nline. They were conducting an inquiry, so that previous to their\njourney it was necessary to put everything in order. Ballast was laid\ndown, the bed was levelled, the sleepers carefully examined, spikes\ndriven in a bit, nuts screwed up, posts painted, and orders given for\nyellow sand to be sprinkled at the level crossings. The woman at the\nneighbouring hut turned her old man out to weed. Semyon worked for a\nwhole week. He put everything in order, mended his kaftan, cleaned and\npolished his brass plate until it fairly shone. Vasily also worked\nhard. The Chief arrived on a trolley, four men working the handles and\nthe levers making the six wheels hum. The trolley travelled at twenty\nversts an hour, but the wheels squeaked. It reached Semyon's hut, and\nhe ran out and reported in soldierly fashion. All appeared to be in\nrepair.\n\n\"Have you been here long?\" inquired the Chief.\n\n\"Since the second of May, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"All right. Thank you. And who is at hut No. 164?\"\n\nThe traffic inspector (he was travelling with the Chief on the\ntrolley) replied: \"Vasily Spiridov.\"\n\n\"Spiridov, Spiridov... Ah! is he the man against whom you made a note\nlast year?\"\n\n\"He is.\"\n\n\"Well, we will see Vasily Spiridov. Go on!\" The workmen laid to the\nhandles, and the trolley got under way. Semyon watched it, and\nthought, \"There will be trouble between them and my neighbour.\"\n\nAbout two hours later he started on his round. He saw some one coming\nalong the line from the cutting. Something white showed on his head.\nSemyon began to look more attentively. It was Vasily. He had a stick\nin his hand, a small bundle on his shoulder, and his cheek was bound\nup in a handkerchief.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" cried Semyon.\n\nVasily came quite close. He was very pale, white as chalk, and his\neyes had a wild look. Almost choking, he muttered: \"To town--to\nMoscow--to the head office.\"\n\n\"Head office? Ah, you are going to complain, I suppose. Give it up!\nVasily Stepanych, forget it.\"\n\n\"No, mate, I will not forget. It is too late. See! He struck me in the\nface, drew blood. So long as I live I will not forget. I will not\nleave it like this!\"\n\nSemyon took his hand. \"Give it up, Stepanych. I am giving you good\nadvice. You will not better things...\"\n\n\"Better things! I know myself I shan't better things. You were right\nabout Fate. It would be better for me not to do it, but one must stand\nup for the right.\" \"But tell me, how did it happen?\"\n\n\"How? He examined everything, got down from the trolley, looked into\nthe hut. I knew beforehand that he would be strict, and so I had put\neverything into proper order. He was just going when I made my\ncomplaint. He immediately cried out: 'Here is a Government inquiry\ncoming, and you make a complaint about a vegetable garden. Here are\nprivy councillors coming, and you annoy me with cabbages!' I lost\npatience and said something--not very much, but it offended him, and\nhe struck me in the face. I stood still; I did nothing, just as if\nwhat he did was perfectly all right. They went off; I came to myself,\nwashed my face, and left.\"\n\n\"And what about the hut?\"\n\n\"My wife is staying there. She will look after things. Never mind\nabout their roads.\"\n\nVasily got up and collected himself. \"Good-bye, Ivanov. I do not know\nwhether I shall get any one at the office to listen to me.\"\n\n\"Surely you are not going to walk?\"\n\n\"At the station I will try to get on a freight train, and to-morrow I\nshall be in Moscow.\"\n\nThe neighbours bade each other farewell. Vasily was absent for some\ntime. His wife worked for him night and day. She never slept, and wore\nherself out waiting for her husband. On the third day the commission\narrived. An engine, luggage-van, and two first-class saloons; but\nVasily was still away. Semyon saw his wife on the fourth day. Her face\nwas swollen from crying and her eyes were red.\n\n\"Has your husband returned?\" he asked. But the woman only made a\ngesture with her hands, and without saying a word went her way.\n\nSemyon had learnt when still a lad to make flutes out of a kind of\nreed. He used to burn out the heart of the stalk, make holes where\nnecessary, drill them, fix a mouthpiece at one end, and tune them so\nwell that it was possible to play almost any air on them. He made a\nnumber of them in his spare time, and sent them by his friends amongst\nthe freight brakemen to the bazaar in the town. He got two kopeks\napiece for them. On the day following the visit of the commission he\nleft his wife at home to meet the six o'clock train, and started off\nto the forest to cut some sticks. He went to the end of his\nsection--at this point the line made a sharp turn--descended the\nembankment, and struck into the wood at the foot of the mountain.\nAbout half a verst away there was a big marsh, around which splendid\nreeds for his flutes grew. He cut a whole bundle of stalks and started\nback home. The sun was already dropping low, and in the dead stillness\nonly the twittering of the birds was audible, and the crackle of the\ndead wood under his feet. As he walked along rapidly, he fancied he\nheard the clang of iron striking iron, and he redoubled his pace.\nThere was no repair going on in his section. What did it mean? He\nemerged from the woods, the railway embankment stood high before him;\non the top a man was squatting on the bed of the line busily engaged\nin something. Semyon commenced quietly to crawl up towards him. He\nthought it was some one after the nuts which secure the rails. He\nwatched, and the man got up, holding a crow-bar in his hand. He had\nloosened a rail, so that it would move to one side. A mist swam before\nSemyon's eyes; he wanted to cry out, but could not. It was Vasily!\nSemyon scrambled up the bank, as Vasily with crow-bar and wrench slid\nheadlong down the other side.\n\n\"Vasily Stepanych! My dear friend, come back! Give me the crow-bar. We\nwill put the rail back; no one will know. Come back! Save your soul\nfrom sin!\"\n\nVasily did not look back, but disappeared into the woods.\n\nSemyon stood before the rail which had been torn up. He threw down his\nbundle of sticks. A train was due; not a freight, but a\npassenger-train. And he had nothing with which to stop it, no flag. He\ncould not replace the rail and could not drive in the spikes with his\nbare hands. It was necessary to run, absolutely necessary to run to\nthe hut for some tools. \"God help me!\" he murmured.\n\nSemyon started running towards his hut. He was out of breath, but\nstill ran, falling every now and then. He had cleared the forest; he\nwas only a few hundred feet from his hut, not more, when he heard the\ndistant hooter of the factory sound--six o'clock! In two minutes' time\nNo. 7 train was due. \"Oh, Lord! Have pity on innocent souls!\" In his\nmind Semyon saw the engine strike against the loosened rail with its\nleft wheel, shiver, careen, tear up and splinter the sleepers--and\njust there, there was a curve and the embankment seventy feet high,\ndown which the engine would topple--and the third-class carriages\nwould be packed ... little children... All sitting in the train now,\nnever dreaming of danger. \"Oh, Lord! Tell me what to do!... No, it is\nimpossible to run to the hut and get back in time.\"\n\nSemyon did not run on to the hut, but turned back and ran faster than\nbefore. He was running almost mechanically, blindly; he did not know\nhimself what was to happen. He ran as far as the rail which had been\npulled up; his sticks were lying in a heap. He bent down, seized one\nwithout knowing why, and ran on farther. It seemed to him the train\nwas already coming. He heard the distant whistle; he heard the quiet,\neven tremor of the rails; but his strength was exhausted, he could run\nno farther, and came to a halt about six hundred feet from the awful\nspot. Then an idea came into his head, literally like a ray of light.\nPulling off his cap, he took out of it a cotton scarf, drew his knife\nout of the upper part of his boot, and crossed himself, muttering,\n\"God bless me!\"\n\nHe buried the knife in his left arm above the elbow; the blood spurted\nout, flowing in a hot stream. In this he soaked his scarf, smoothed it\nout, tied it to the stick and hung out his red flag.\n\nHe stood waving his flag. The train was already in sight. The driver\nwould not see him--would come close up, and a heavy train cannot be\npulled up in six hundred feet.\n\nAnd the blood kept on flowing. Semyon pressed the sides of the wound\ntogether so as to close it, but the blood did not diminish. Evidently\nhe had cut his arm very deep. His head commenced to swim, black spots\nbegan to dance before his eyes, and then it became dark. There was a\nringing in his ears. He could not see the train or hear the noise.\nOnly one thought possessed him. \"I shall not be able to keep standing\nup. I shall fall and drop the flag; the train will pass over me. Help\nme, oh Lord!\"\n\nAll turned black before him, his mind became a blank, and he dropped\nthe flag; but the blood-stained banner did not fall to the ground. A\nhand seized it and held it high to meet the approaching train. The\nengineer saw it, shut the regulator, and reversed steam. The train\ncame to a standstill.\n\nPeople jumped out of the carriages and collected in a crowd. They saw\na man lying senseless on the footway, drenched in blood, and another\nman standing beside him with a blood-stained rag on a stick.\n\nVasily looked around at all. Then, lowering his head, he said: \"Bind\nme. I tore up a rail!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DARLING\n\n\n\nBY ANTON P. CHEKOV\n\n\nOlenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor Plemyanikov,\nwas sitting on the back-door steps of her house doing nothing. It was\nhot, the flies were nagging and teasing, and it was pleasant to think\nthat it would soon be evening. Dark rain clouds were gathering from\nthe east, wafting a breath of moisture every now and then.\n\nKukin, who roomed in the wing of the same house, was standing in the\nyard looking up at the sky. He was the manager of the Tivoli, an\nopen-air theatre.\n\n\"Again,\" he said despairingly. \"Rain again. Rain, rain, rain! Every\nday rain! As though to spite me. I might as well stick my head into a\nnoose and be done with it. It's ruining me. Heavy losses every day!\"\nHe wrung his hands, and continued, addressing Olenka: \"What a life,\nOlga Semyonovna! It's enough to make a man weep. He works, he does his\nbest, his very best, he tortures himself, he passes sleepless nights,\nhe thinks and thinks and thinks how to do everything just right. And\nwhat's the result? He gives the public the best operetta, the very\nbest pantomime, excellent artists. But do they want it? Have they the\nleast appreciation of it? The public is rude. The public is a great\nboor. The public wants a circus, a lot of nonsense, a lot of stuff.\nAnd there's the weather. Look! Rain almost every evening. It began to\nrain on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up through the whole of\nJune. It's simply awful. I can't get any audiences, and don't I have\nto pay rent? Don't I have to pay the actors?\"\n\nThe next day towards evening the clouds gathered again, and Kukin said\nwith an hysterical laugh:\n\n\"Oh, I don't care. Let it do its worst. Let it drown the whole\ntheatre, and me, too. All right, no luck for me in this world or the\nnext. Let the actors bring suit against me and drag me to court.\nWhat's the court? Why not Siberia at hard labour, or even the\nscaffold? Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nIt was the same on the third day.\n\nOlenka listened to Kukin seriously, in silence. Sometimes tears would\nrise to her eyes. At last Kukin's misfortune touched her. She fell in\nlove with him. He was short, gaunt, with a yellow face, and curly hair\ncombed back from his forehead, and a thin tenor voice. His features\npuckered all up when he spoke. Despair was ever inscribed on his face.\nAnd yet he awakened in Olenka a sincere, deep feeling.\n\nShe was always loving somebody. She couldn't get on without loving\nsomebody. She had loved her sick father, who sat the whole time in his\narmchair in a darkened room, breathing heavily. She had loved her\naunt, who came from Brianska once or twice a year to visit them. And\nbefore that, when a pupil at the progymnasium, she had loved her\nFrench teacher. She was a quiet, kind-hearted, compassionate girl,\nwith a soft gentle way about her. And she made a very healthy,\nwholesome impression. Looking at her full, rosy cheeks, at her soft\nwhite neck with the black mole, and at the good na�ve smile that\nalways played on her face when something pleasant was said, the men\nwould think, \"Not so bad,\" and would smile too; and the lady visitors,\nin the middle of the conversation, would suddenly grasp her hand and\nexclaim, \"You darling!\" in a burst of delight.\n\nThe house, hers by inheritance, in which she had lived from birth, was\nlocated at the outskirts of the city on the Gypsy Road, not far from\nthe Tivoli. From early evening till late at night she could hear the\nmusic in the theatre and the bursting of the rockets; and it seemed to\nher that Kukin was roaring and battling with his fate and taking his\nchief enemy, the indifferent public, by assault. Her heart melted\nsoftly, she felt no desire to sleep, and when Kukin returned home\ntowards morning, she tapped on her window-pane, and through the\ncurtains he saw her face and one shoulder and the kind smile she gave\nhim.\n\nHe proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a good look\nof her neck and her full vigorous shoulders, he clapped his hands and\nsaid:\n\n\"You darling!\"\n\nHe was happy. But it rained on their wedding-day, and the expression\nof despair never left his face.\n\nThey got along well together. She sat in the cashier's box, kept the\ntheatre in order, wrote down the expenses, and paid out the salaries.\nHer rosy cheeks, her kind na�ve smile, like a halo around her face,\ncould be seen at the cashier's window, behind the scenes, and in the\ncaf�. She began to tell her friends that the theatre was the greatest,\nthe most important, the most essential thing in the world, that it was\nthe only place to obtain true enjoyment in and become humanised and\neducated.\n\n\"But do you suppose the public appreciates it?\" she asked. \"What the\npublic wants is the circus. Yesterday Vanichka and I gave _Faust\nBurlesqued_, and almost all the boxes were empty. If we had given some\nsilly nonsense, I assure you, the theatre would have been overcrowded.\nTo-morrow we'll put _Orpheus in Hades_ on. Do come.\"\n\nWhatever Kukin said about the theatre and the actors, she repeated.\nShe spoke, as he did, with contempt of the public, of its indifference\nto art, of its boorishness. She meddled in the rehearsals, corrected\nthe actors, watched the conduct of the musicians; and when an\nunfavourable criticism appeared in the local paper, she wept and went\nto the editor to argue with him.\n\nThe actors were fond of her and called her \"Vanichka and I\" and \"the\ndarling.\" She was sorry for them and lent them small sums. When they\nbilked her, she never complained to her husband; at the utmost she\nshed a few tears.\n\nIn winter, too, they got along nicely together. They leased a theatre\nin the town for the whole winter and sublet it for short periods to a\nLittle Russian theatrical company, to a conjuror and to the local\namateur players.\n\nOlenka grew fuller and was always beaming with contentment; while\nKukin grew thinner and yellower and complained of his terrible losses,\nthough he did fairly well the whole winter. At night he coughed, and\nshe gave him raspberry syrup and lime water, rubbed him with eau de\nCologne, and wrapped him up in soft coverings.\n\n\"You are my precious sweet,\" she said with perfect sincerity, stroking\nhis hair. \"You are such a dear.\"\n\nAt Lent he went to Moscow to get his company together, and, while\nwithout him, Olenka was unable to sleep. She sat at the window the\nwhole time, gazing at the stars. She likened herself to the hens that\nare also uneasy and unable to sleep when their rooster is out of the\ncoop. Kukin was detained in Moscow. He wrote he would be back during\nEaster Week, and in his letters discussed arrangements already for the\nTivoli. But late one night, before Easter Monday, there was an\nill-omened knocking at the wicket-gate. It was like a knocking on a\nbarrel--boom, boom, boom! The sleepy cook ran barefooted, plashing\nthrough the puddles, to open the gate.\n\n\"Open the gate, please,\" said some one in a hollow bass voice. \"I have\na telegram for you.\"\n\nOlenka had received telegrams from her husband before; but this time,\nsomehow, she was numbed with terror. She opened the telegram with\ntrembling hands and read:\n\n\"Ivan Petrovich died suddenly to-day. Awaiting propt orders for\nwuneral Tuesday.\"\n\nThat was the way the telegram was written--\"wuneral\"--and another\nunintelligible word--\"propt.\" The telegram was signed by the manager\nof the opera company.\n\n\"My dearest!\" Olenka burst out sobbing. \"Vanichka, my dearest, my\nsweetheart. Why did I ever meet you? Why did I ever get to know you\nand love you? To whom have you abandoned your poor Olenka, your poor,\nunhappy Olenka?\"\n\nKukin was buried on Tuesday in the Vagankov Cemetery in Moscow. Olenka\nreturned home on Wednesday; and as soon as she entered her house she\nthrew herself on her bed and broke into such loud sobbing that she\ncould be heard in the street and in the neighbouring yards.\n\n\"The darling!\" said the neighbours, crossing themselves. \"How Olga\nSemyonovna, the poor darling, is grieving!\"\n\nThree months afterwards Olenka was returning home from mass,\ndownhearted and in deep mourning. Beside her walked a man also\nreturning from church, Vasily Pustovalov, the manager of the merchant\nBabakayev's lumber-yard. He was wearing a straw hat, a white vest with\na gold chain, and looked more like a landowner than a business man.\n\n\"Everything has its ordained course, Olga Semyonovna,\" he said\nsedately, with sympathy in his voice. \"And if any one near and dear to\nus dies, then it means it was God's will and we should remember that\nand bear it with submission.\"\n\nHe took her to the wicket-gate, said good-bye and went away. After\nthat she heard his sedate voice the whole day; and on closing her eyes\nshe instantly had a vision of his dark beard. She took a great liking\nto him. And evidently he had been impressed by her, too; for, not long\nafter, an elderly woman, a distant acquaintance, came in to have a cup\nof coffee with her. As soon as the woman was seated at table she began\nto speak about Pustovalov--how good he was, what a steady man, and any\nwoman could be glad to get him as a husband. Three days later\nPustovalov himself paid Olenka a visit. He stayed only about ten\nminutes, and spoke little, but Olenka fell in love with him, fell in\nlove so desperately that she did not sleep the whole night and burned\nas with fever. In the morning she sent for the elderly woman. Soon\nafter, Olenka and Pustovalov were engaged, and the wedding followed.\n\nPustovalov and Olenka lived happily together. He usually stayed in the\nlumber-yard until dinner, then went out on business. In his absence\nOlenka took his place in the office until evening, attending to the\nbook-keeping and despatching the orders.\n\n\"Lumber rises twenty per cent every year nowadays,\" she told her\ncustomers and acquaintances. \"Imagine, we used to buy wood from our\nforests here. Now Vasichka has to go every year to the government of\nMogilev to get wood. And what a tax!\" she exclaimed, covering her\ncheeks with her hands in terror. \"What a tax!\"\n\nShe felt as if she had been dealing in lumber for ever so long, that\nthe most important and essential thing in life was lumber. There was\nsomething touching and endearing in the way she pronounced the words,\n\"beam,\" \"joist,\" \"plank,\" \"stave,\" \"lath,\" \"gun-carriage,\" \"clamp.\" At\nnight she dreamed of whole mountains of boards and planks, long,\nendless rows of wagons conveying the wood somewhere, far, far from the\ncity. She dreamed that a whole regiment of beams, 36 ft. x 5 in., were\nadvancing in an upright position to do battle against the lumber-yard;\nthat the beams and joists and clamps were knocking against each other,\nemitting the sharp crackling reports of dry wood, that they were all\nfalling and then rising again, piling on top of each other. Olenka\ncried out in her sleep, and Pustovalov said to her gently:\n\n\"Olenka my dear, what is the matter? Cross yourself.\"\n\nHer husband's opinions were all hers. If he thought the room was too\nhot, she thought so too. If he thought business was dull, she thought\nbusiness was dull. Pustovalov was not fond of amusements and stayed\nhome on holidays; she did the same.\n\n\"You are always either at home or in the office,\" said her friends.\n\"Why don't you go to the theatre or to the circus, darling?\"\n\n\"Vasichka and I never go to the theatre,\" she answered sedately. \"We\nhave work to do, we have no time for nonsense. What does one get out\nof going to theatre?\"\n\nOn Saturdays she and Pustovalov went to vespers, and on holidays to\nearly mass. On returning home they walked side by side with rapt\nfaces, an agreeable smell emanating from both of them and her silk\ndress rustling pleasantly. At home they drank tea with milk-bread and\nvarious jams, and then ate pie. Every day at noontime there was an\nappetising odour in the yard and outside the gate of cabbage soup,\nroast mutton, or duck; and, on fast days, of fish. You couldn't pass\nthe gate without being seized by an acute desire to eat. The samovar\nwas always boiling on the office table, and customers were treated to\ntea and biscuits. Once a week the married couple went to the baths and\nreturned with red faces, walking side by side.\n\n\"We are getting along very well, thank God,\" said Olenka to her\nfriends. \"God grant that all should live as well as Vasichka and I.\"\n\nWhen Pustovalov went to the government of Mogilev to buy wood, she was\ndreadfully homesick for him, did not sleep nights, and cried.\nSometimes the veterinary surgeon of the regiment, Smirnov, a young man\nwho lodged in the wing of her house, came to see her evenings. He\nrelated incidents, or they played cards together. This distracted her.\nThe most interesting of his stories were those of his own life. He was\nmarried and had a son; but he had separated from his wife because she\nhad deceived him, and now he hated her and sent her forty rubles a\nmonth for his son's support. Olenka sighed, shook her head, and was\nsorry for him.\n\n\"Well, the Lord keep you,\" she said, as she saw him off to the door by\ncandlelight. \"Thank you for coming to kill time with me. May God give\nyou health. Mother in Heaven!\" She spoke very sedately, very\njudiciously, imitating her husband. The veterinary surgeon had\ndisappeared behind the door when she called out after him: \"Do you\nknow, Vladimir Platonych, you ought to make up with your wife. Forgive\nher, if only for the sake of your son. The child understands\neverything, you may be sure.\"\n\nWhen Pustovalov returned, she told him in a low voice about the\nveterinary surgeon and his unhappy family life; and they sighed and\nshook their heads, and talked about the boy who must be homesick for\nhis father. Then, by a strange association of ideas, they both stopped\nbefore the sacred images, made genuflections, and prayed to God to\nsend them children.\n\nAnd so the Pustovalovs lived for full six years, quietly and\npeaceably, in perfect love and harmony. But once in the winter Vasily\nAndreyich, after drinking some hot tea, went out into the lumber-yard\nwithout a hat on his head, caught a cold and took sick. He was treated\nby the best physicians, but the malady progressed, and he died after\nan illness of four months. Olenka was again left a widow.\n\n\"To whom have you left me, my darling?\" she wailed after the funeral.\n\"How shall I live now without you, wretched creature that I am. Pity\nme, good people, pity me, fatherless and motherless, all alone in the\nworld!\"\n\nShe went about dressed in black and weepers, and she gave up wearing\nhats and gloves for good. She hardly left the house except to go to\nchurch and to visit her husband's grave. She almost led the life of a\nnun.\n\nIt was not until six months had passed that she took off the weepers\nand opened her shutters. She began to go out occasionally in the\nmorning to market with her cook. But how she lived at home and what\nwent on there, could only be surmised. It could be surmised from the\nfact that she was seen in her little garden drinking tea with the\nveterinarian while he read the paper out loud to her, and also from\nthe fact that once on meeting an acquaintance at the post-office, she\nsaid to her:\n\n\"There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town. That is why\nthere is so much disease. You constantly hear of people getting sick\nfrom the milk and becoming infected by the horses and cows. The health\nof domestic animals ought really to be looked after as much as that of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nShe repeated the veterinarian's words and held the same opinions as he\nabout everything. It was plain that she could not exist a single year\nwithout an attachment, and she found her new happiness in the wing of\nher house. In any one else this would have been condemned; but no one\ncould think ill of Olenka. Everything in her life was so transparent.\nShe and the veterinary surgeon never spoke about the change in their\nrelations. They tried, in fact, to conceal it, but unsuccessfully; for\nOlenka could have no secrets. When the surgeon's colleagues from the\nregiment came to see him, she poured tea, and served the supper, and\ntalked to them about the cattle plague, the foot and mouth disease,\nand the municipal slaughter houses. The surgeon was dreadfully\nembarrassed, and after the visitors had left, he caught her hand and\nhissed angrily:\n\n\"Didn't I ask you not to talk about what you don't understand? When we\ndoctors discuss things, please don't mix in. It's getting to be a\nnuisance.\"\n\nShe looked at him in astonishment and alarm, and asked:\n\n\"But, Volodichka, what _am_ I to talk about?\"\n\nAnd she threw her arms round his neck, with tears in her eyes, and\nbegged him not to be angry. And they were both happy.\n\nBut their happiness was of short duration. The veterinary surgeon went\naway with his regiment to be gone for good, when it was transferred to\nsome distant place almost as far as Siberia, and Olenka was left\nalone.\n\nNow she was completely alone. Her father had long been dead, and his\narmchair lay in the attic covered with dust and minus one leg. She got\nthin and homely, and the people who met her on the street no longer\nlooked at her as they had used to, nor smiled at her. Evidently her\nbest years were over, past and gone, and a new, dubious life was to\nbegin which it were better not to think about.\n\nIn the evening Olenka sat on the steps and heard the music playing and\nthe rockets bursting in the Tivoli; but it no longer aroused any\nresponse in her. She looked listlessly into the yard, thought of\nnothing, wanted nothing, and when night came on, she went to bed and\ndreamed of nothing but the empty yard. She ate and drank as though by\ncompulsion.\n\nAnd what was worst of all, she no longer held any opinions. She saw\nand understood everything that went on around her, but she could not\nform an opinion about it. She knew of nothing to talk about. And how\ndreadful not to have opinions! For instance, you see a bottle, or you\nsee that it is raining, or you see a muzhik riding by in a wagon. But\nwhat the bottle or the rain or the muzhik are for, or what the sense\nof them all is, you cannot tell--you cannot tell, not for a thousand\nrubles. In the days of Kukin and Pustovalov and then of the veterinary\nsurgeon, Olenka had had an explanation for everything, and would have\ngiven her opinion freely no matter about what. But now there was the\nsame emptiness in her heart and brain as in her yard. It was as\ngalling and bitter as a taste of wormwood.\n\nGradually the town grew up all around. The Gypsy Road had become a\nstreet, and where the Tivoli and the lumber-yard had been, there were\nnow houses and a row of side streets. How quickly time flies! Olenka's\nhouse turned gloomy, the roof rusty, the shed slanting. Dock and\nthistles overgrew the yard. Olenka herself had aged and grown homely.\nIn the summer she sat on the steps, and her soul was empty and dreary\nand bitter. When she caught the breath of spring, or when the wind\nwafted the chime of the cathedral bells, a sudden flood of memories\nwould pour over her, her heart would expand with a tender warmth, and\nthe tears would stream down her cheeks. But that lasted only a moment.\nThen would come emptiness again, and the feeling, What is the use of\nliving? The black kitten Bryska rubbed up against her and purred\nsoftly, but the little creature's caresses left Olenka untouched. That\nwas not what she needed. What she needed was a love that would absorb\nher whole being, her reason, her whole soul, that would give her\nideas, an object in life, that would warm her aging blood. And she\nshook the black kitten off her skirt angrily, saying:\n\n\"Go away! What are you doing here?\"\n\nAnd so day after day, year after year not a single joy, not a single\nopinion. Whatever Marva, the cook, said was all right.\n\nOne hot day in July, towards evening, as the town cattle were being\ndriven by, and the whole yard was filled with clouds of dust, there\nwas suddenly a knocking at the gate. Olenka herself went to open it,\nand was dumbfounded to behold the veterinarian Smirnov. He had turned\ngrey and was dressed as a civilian. All the old memories flooded into\nher soul, she could not restrain herself, she burst out crying, and\nlaid her head on Smirnov's breast without saying a word. So overcome\nwas she that she was totally unconscious of how they walked into the\nhouse and seated themselves to drink tea.\n\n\"My darling!\" she murmured, trembling with joy. \"Vladimir Platonych,\nfrom where has God sent you?\"\n\n\"I want to settle here for good,\" he told her. \"I have resigned my\nposition and have come here to try my fortune as a free man and lead a\nsettled life. Besides, it's time to send my boy to the gymnasium. He\nis grown up now. You know, my wife and I have become reconciled.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Olenka.\n\n\"At the hotel with the boy. I am looking for lodgings.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, bless you, take my house. Why won't my house do? Oh,\ndear! Why, I won't ask any rent of you,\" Olenka burst out in the\ngreatest excitement, and began to cry again. \"You live here, and the\nwing will be enough for me. Oh, Heavens, what a joy!\"\n\nThe very next day the roof was being painted and the walls\nwhitewashed, and Olenka, arms akimbo, was going about the yard\nsuperintending. Her face brightened with her old smile. Her whole\nbeing revived and freshened, as though she had awakened from a long\nsleep. The veterinarian's wife and child arrived. She was a thin,\nplain woman, with a crabbed expression. The boy Sasha, small for his\nten years of age, was a chubby child, with clear blue eyes and dimples\nin his cheeks. He made for the kitten the instant he entered the yard,\nand the place rang with his happy laughter.\n\n\"Is that your cat, auntie?\" he asked Olenka. \"When she has little\nkitties, please give me one. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice.\"\n\nOlenka chatted with him, gave him tea, and there was a sudden warmth\nin her bosom and a soft gripping at her heart, as though the boy were\nher own son.\n\nIn the evening, when he sat in the dining-room studying his lessons,\nshe looked at him tenderly and whispered to herself:\n\n\"My darling, my pretty. You are such a clever child, so good to look\nat.\"\n\n\"An island is a tract of land entirely surrounded by water,\" he\nrecited.\n\n\"An island is a tract of land,\" she repeated--the first idea\nasseverated with conviction after so many years of silence and mental\nemptiness.\n\nShe now had her opinions, and at supper discussed with Sasha's parents\nhow difficult the studies had become for the children at the\ngymnasium, but how, after all, a classical education was better than a\ncommercial course, because when you graduated from the gymnasium then\nthe road was open to you for any career at all. If you chose to, you\ncould become a doctor, or, if you wanted to, you could become an\nengineer.\n\nSasha began to go to the gymnasium. His mother left on a visit to her\nsister in Kharkov and never came back. The father was away every day\ninspecting cattle, and sometimes was gone three whole days at a time,\nso that Sasha, it seemed to Olenka, was utterly abandoned, was treated\nas if he were quite superfluous, and must be dying of hunger. So she\ntransferred him into the wing along with herself and fixed up a little\nroom for him there.\n\nEvery morning Olenka would come into his room and find him sound\nasleep with his hand tucked under his cheek, so quiet that he seemed\nnot to be breathing. What a shame to have to wake him, she thought.\n\n\"Sashenka,\" she said sorrowingly, \"get up, darling. It's time to go to\nthe gymnasium.\"\n\nHe got up, dressed, said his prayers, then sat down to drink tea. He\ndrank three glasses of tea, ate two large cracknels and half a\nbuttered roll. The sleep was not yet out of him, so he was a little\ncross.\n\n\"You don't know your fable as you should, Sashenka,\" said Olenka,\nlooking at him as though he were departing on a long journey. \"What a\nlot of trouble you are. You must try hard and learn, dear, and mind\nyour teachers.\"\n\n\"Oh, let me alone, please,\" said Sasha.\n\nThen he went down the street to the gymnasium, a little fellow wearing\na large cap and carrying a satchel on his back. Olenka followed him\nnoiselessly.\n\n\"Sashenka,\" she called.\n\nHe looked round and she shoved a date or a caramel into his hand. When\nhe reached the street of the gymnasium, he turned around and said,\nashamed of being followed by a tall, stout woman:\n\n\"You had better go home, aunt. I can go the rest of the way myself.\"\n\nShe stopped and stared after him until he had disappeared into the\nschool entrance.\n\nOh, how she loved him! Not one of her other ties had been so deep.\nNever before had she given herself so completely, so disinterestedly,\nso cheerfully as now that her maternal instincts were all aroused. For\nthis boy, who was not hers, for the dimples in his cheeks and for his\nbig cap, she would have given her life, given it with joy and with\ntears of rapture. Why? Ah, indeed, why?\n\nWhen she had seen Sasha off to the gymnasium, she returned home\nquietly, content, serene, overflowing with love. Her face, which had\ngrown younger in the last half year, smiled and beamed. People who met\nher were pleased as they looked at her.\n\n\"How are you, Olga Semyonovna, darling? How are you getting on,\ndarling?\"\n\n\"The gymnasium course is very hard nowadays,\" she told at the market.\n\"It's no joke. Yesterday the first class had a fable to learn by\nheart, a Latin translation, and a problem. How is a little fellow to\ndo all that?\"\n\nAnd she spoke of the teacher and the lessons and the text-books,\nrepeating exactly what Sasha said about them.\n\nAt three o'clock they had dinner. In the evening they prepared the\nlessons together, and Olenka wept with Sasha over the difficulties.\nWhen she put him to bed, she lingered a long time making the sign of\nthe cross over him and muttering a prayer. And when she lay in bed,\nshe dreamed of the far-away, misty future when Sasha would finish his\nstudies and become a doctor or an engineer, have a large house of his\nown, with horses and a carriage, marry and have children. She would\nfall asleep still thinking of the same things, and tears would roll\ndown her cheeks from her closed eyes. And the black cat would lie at\nher side purring: \"Mrr, mrr, mrr.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a loud knocking at the gate. Olenka woke up\nbreathless with fright, her heart beating violently. Half a minute\nlater there was another knock.\n\n\"A telegram from Kharkov,\" she thought, her whole body in a tremble.\n\"His mother wants Sasha to come to her in Kharkov. Oh, great God!\"\n\nShe was in despair. Her head, her feet, her hands turned cold. There\nwas no unhappier creature in the world, she felt. But another minute\npassed, she heard voices. It was the veterinarian coming home from the\nclub.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she thought. The load gradually fell from her heart, she\nwas at ease again. And she went back to bed, thinking of Sasha who lay\nfast asleep in the next room and sometimes cried out in his sleep:\n\n\"I'll give it to you! Get away! Quit your scrapping!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BET\n\n\n\nBY ANTON P. CHEKHOV\n\n\nI\n\n\nIt was a dark autumn night. The old banker was pacing from corner to\ncorner of his study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the\nautumn fifteen years before. There were many clever people at the\nparty and much interesting conversation. They talked among other\nthings of capital punishment. The guests, among them not a few\nscholars and journalists, for the most part disapproved of capital\npunishment. They found it obsolete as a means of punishment, unfitted\nto a Christian State and immoral. Some of them thought that capital\npunishment should be replaced universally by life-imprisonment.\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said the host. \"I myself have experienced\nneither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if one may judge\n_a priori_, then in my opinion capital punishment is more moral and\nmore humane than imprisonment. Execution kills instantly,\nlife-imprisonment kills by degrees. Who is the more humane\nexecutioner, one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws the\nlife out of you incessantly, for years?\"\n\n\"They're both equally immoral,\" remarked one of the guests, \"because\ntheir purpose is the same, to take away life. The State is not God. It\nhas no right to take away that which it cannot give back, if it should\nso desire.\"\n\nAmong the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five. On\nbeing asked his opinion, he said:\n\n\"Capital punishment and life-imprisonment are equally immoral; but if\nI were offered the choice between them, I would certainly choose the\nsecond. It's better to live somehow than not to live at all.\"\n\nThere ensued a lively discussion. The banker who was then younger and\nmore nervous suddenly lost his temper, banged his fist on the table,\nand turning to the young lawyer, cried out:\n\n\"It's a lie. I bet you two millions you wouldn't stick in a cell even\nfor five years.\"\n\n\"If you mean it seriously,\" replied the lawyer, \"then I bet I'll stay\nnot five but fifteen.\"\n\n\"Fifteen! Done!\" cried the banker. \"Gentlemen, I stake two millions.\"\n\n\"Agreed. You stake two millions, I my freedom,\" said the lawyer.\n\nSo this wild, ridiculous bet came to pass. The banker, who at that\ntime had too many millions to count, spoiled and capricious, was\nbeside himself with rapture. During supper he said to the lawyer\njokingly:\n\n\"Come to your senses, young roan, before it's too late. Two millions\nare nothing to me, but you stand to lose three or four of the best\nyears of your life. I say three or four, because you'll never stick it\nout any longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary\nis much heavier than enforced imprisonment. The idea that you have the\nright to free yourself at any moment will poison the whole of your\nlife in the cell. I pity you.\"\n\nAnd now the banker, pacing from corner to corner, recalled all this\nand asked himself:\n\n\"Why did I make this bet? What's the good? The lawyer loses fifteen\nyears of his life and I throw away two millions. Will it convince\npeople that capital punishment is worse or better than imprisonment\nfor life? No, no! all stuff and rubbish. On my part, it was the\ncaprice of a well-fed man; on the lawyer's pure greed of gold.\"\n\nHe recollected further what happened after the evening party. It was\ndecided that the lawyer must undergo his imprisonment under the\nstrictest observation, in a garden wing of the banker's house. It was\nagreed that during the period he would be deprived of the right to\ncross the threshold, to see living people, to hear human voices, and\nto receive letters and newspapers. He was permitted to have a musical\ninstrument, to read books, to write letters, to drink wine and smoke\ntobacco. By the agreement he could communicate, but only in silence,\nwith the outside world through a little window specially constructed\nfor this purpose. Everything necessary, books, music, wine, he could\nreceive in any quantity by sending a note through the window. The\nagreement provided for all the minutest details, which made the\nconfinement strictly solitary, and it obliged the lawyer to remain\nexactly fifteen years from twelve o'clock of November 14th, 1870, to\ntwelve o'clock of November 14th, 1885. The least attempt on his part\nto violate the conditions, to escape if only for two minutes before\nthe time freed the banker from the obligation to pay him the two\nmillions.\n\nDuring the first year of imprisonment, the lawyer, as far as it was\npossible to judge from his short notes, suffered terribly from\nloneliness and boredom. From his wing day and night came the sound of\nthe piano. He rejected wine and tobacco. \"Wine,\" he wrote, \"excites\ndesires, and desires are the chief foes of a prisoner; besides,\nnothing is more boring than to drink good wine alone,\" and tobacco\nspoils the air in his room. During the first year the lawyer was sent\nbooks of a light character; novels with a complicated love interest,\nstories of crime and fantasy, comedies, and so on.\n\nIn the second year the piano was heard no longer and the lawyer asked\nonly for classics. In the fifth year, music was heard again, and the\nprisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him said that during the\nwhole of that year he was only eating, drinking, and lying on his bed.\nHe yawned often and talked angrily to himself. Books he did not read.\nSometimes at nights he would sit down to write. He would write for a\nlong time and tear it all up in the morning. More than once he was\nheard to weep.\n\nIn the second half of the sixth year, the prisoner began zealously to\nstudy languages, philosophy, and history. He fell on these subjects so\nhungrily that the banker hardly had time to get books enough for him.\nIn the space of four years about six hundred volumes were bought at\nhis request. It was while that passion lasted that the banker received\nthe following letter from the prisoner: \"My dear gaoler, I am writing\nthese lines in six languages. Show them to experts. Let them read\nthem. If they do not find one single mistake, I beg you to give orders\nto have a gun fired off in the garden. By the noise I shall know that\nmy efforts have not been in vain. The geniuses of all ages and\ncountries speak in different languages; but in them all burns the same\nflame. Oh, if you knew my heavenly happiness now that I can understand\nthem!\" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. Two shots were fired in\nthe garden by the banker's order.\n\nLater on, after the tenth year, the lawyer sat immovable before his\ntable and read only the New Testament. The banker found it strange\nthat a man who in four years had mastered six hundred erudite volumes,\nshould have spent nearly a year in reading one book, easy to\nunderstand and by no means thick. The New Testament was then replaced\nby the history of religions and theology.\n\nDuring the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an\nextraordinary amount, quite haphazard. Now he would apply himself to\nthe natural sciences, then he would read Byron or Shakespeare. Notes\nused to come from him in which he asked to be sent at the same time a\nbook on chemistry, a text-book of medicine, a novel, and some treatise\non philosophy or theology. He read as though he were swimming in the\nsea among broken pieces of wreckage, and in his desire to save his\nlife was eagerly grasping one piece after another.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe banker recalled all this, and thought:\n\n\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock he receives his freedom. Under the\nagreement, I shall have to pay him two millions. If I pay, it's all\nover with me. I am ruined for ever ...\"\n\nFifteen years before he had too many millions to count, but now he was\nafraid to ask himself which he had more of, money or debts. Gambling\non the Stock-Exchange, risky speculation, and the recklessness of\nwhich he could not rid himself even in old age, had gradually brought\nhis business to decay; and the fearless, self-confident, proud man of\nbusiness had become an ordinary banker, trembling at every rise and\nfall in the market.\n\n\"That cursed bet,\" murmured the old man clutching his head in\ndespair... \"Why didn't the man die? He's only forty years old. He will\ntake away my last farthing, marry, enjoy life, gamble on the Exchange,\nand I will look on like an envious beggar and hear the same words from\nhim every day: 'I'm obliged to you for the happiness of my life. Let\nme help you.' No, it's too much! The only escape from bankruptcy and\ndisgrace--is that the man should die.\"\n\nThe clock had just struck three. The banker was listening. In the\nhouse every one was asleep, and one could hear only the frozen trees\nwhining outside the windows. Trying to make no sound, he took out of\nhis safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen\nyears, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house. The garden was\ndark and cold. It was raining. A damp, penetrating wind howled in the\ngarden and gave the trees no rest. Though he strained his eyes, the\nbanker could see neither the ground, nor the white statues, nor the\ngarden wing, nor the trees. Approaching the garden wing, he called the\nwatchman twice. There was no answer. Evidently the watchman had taken\nshelter from the bad weather and was now asleep somewhere in the\nkitchen or the greenhouse.\n\n\"If I have the courage to fulfil my intention,\" thought the old man,\n\"the suspicion will fall on the watchman first of all.\"\n\nIn the darkness he groped for the steps and the door and entered the\nhall of the garden-wing, then poked his way into a narrow passage and\nstruck a match. Not a soul was there. Some one's bed, with no\nbedclothes on it, stood there, and an iron stove loomed dark in the\ncorner. The seals on the door that led into the prisoner's room were\nunbroken.\n\nWhen the match went out, the old man, trembling from agitation, peeped\ninto the little window.\n\nIn the prisoner's room a candle was burning dimly. The prisoner\nhimself sat by the table. Only his back, the hair on his head and his\nhands were visible. Open books were strewn about on the table, the two\nchairs, and on the carpet near the table.\n\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner never once stirred. Fifteen\nyears' confinement had taught him to sit motionless. The banker tapped\non the window with his finger, but the prisoner made no movement in\nreply. Then the banker cautiously tore the seals from the door and put\nthe key into the lock. The rusty lock gave a hoarse groan and the door\ncreaked. The banker expected instantly to hear a cry of surprise and\nthe sound of steps. Three minutes passed and it was as quiet inside as\nit had been before. He made up his mind to enter.\n\nBefore the table sat a man, unlike an ordinary human being. It was a\nskeleton, with tight-drawn skin, with long curly hair like a woman's,\nand a shaggy beard. The colour of his face was yellow, of an earthy\nshade; the cheeks were sunken, the back long and narrow, and the hand\nupon which he leaned his hairy head was so lean and skinny that it was\npainful to look upon. His hair was already silvering with grey, and no\none who glanced at the senile emaciation of the face would have\nbelieved that he was only forty years old. On the table, before his\nbended head, lay a sheet of paper on which something was written in a\ntiny hand.\n\n\"Poor devil,\" thought the banker, \"he's asleep and probably seeing\nmillions in his dreams. I have only to take and throw this half-dead\nthing on the bed, smother him a moment with the pillow, and the most\ncareful examination will find no trace of unnatural death. But, first,\nlet us read what he has written here.\"\n\nThe banker took the sheet from the table and read:\n\n\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock midnight, I shall obtain my freedom and\nthe right to mix with people. But before I leave this room and see the\nsun I think it necessary to say a few words to you. On my own clear\nconscience and before God who sees me I declare to you that I despise\nfreedom, life, health, and all that your books call the blessings of\nthe world.\n\n\"For fifteen years I have diligently studied earthly life. True, I saw\nneither the earth nor the people, but in your books I drank fragrant\nwine, sang songs, hunted deer and wild boar in the forests, loved\nwomen... And beautiful women, like clouds ethereal, created by the\nmagic of your poets' genius, visited me by night and whispered to me\nwonderful tales, which made my head drunken. In your books I climbed\nthe summits of Elbruz and Mont Blanc and saw from there how the sun\nrose in the morning, and in the evening suffused the sky, the ocean\nand the mountain ridges with a purple gold. I saw from there how above\nme lightnings glimmered cleaving the clouds; I saw green forests,\nfields, rivers, lakes, cities; I heard syrens singing, and the playing\nof the pipes of Pan; I touched the wings of beautiful devils who came\nflying to me to speak of God... In your books I cast myself into\nbottomless abysses, worked miracles, burned cities to the ground,\npreached new religions, conquered whole countries...\n\n\"Your books gave me wisdom. All that unwearying human thought created\nin the centuries is compressed to a little lump in my skull. I know\nthat I am cleverer than you all.\n\n\"And I despise your books, despise all worldly blessings and wisdom.\nEverything is void, frail, visionary and delusive as a mirage. Though\nyou be proud and wise and beautiful, yet will death wipe you from the\nface of the earth like the mice underground; and your posterity, your\nhistory, and the immortality of your men of genius will be as frozen\nslag, burnt down together with the terrestrial globe.\n\n\"You are mad, and gone the wrong way. You take falsehood for truth and\nugliness for beauty. You would marvel if suddenly apple and orange\ntrees should bear frogs and lizards instead of fruit, and if roses\nshould begin to breathe the odour of a sweating horse. So do I marvel\nat you, who have bartered heaven for earth. I do not want to\nunderstand you.\n\n\"That I may show you in deed my contempt for that by which you live, I\nwaive the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise, and\nwhich I now despise. That I may deprive myself of my right to them, I\nshall come out from here five minutes before the stipulated term, and\nthus shall violate the agreement.\"\n\nWhen he had read, the banker put the sheet on the table, kissed the\nhead of the strange man, and began to weep. He went out of the wing.\nNever at any other time, not even after his terrible losses on the\nExchange, had he felt such contempt for himself as now. Coming home,\nhe lay down on his bed, but agitation and tears kept him a long time\nfrom sleeping...\n\nThe next morning the poor watchman came running to him and told him\nthat they had seen the man who lived in the wing climb through the\nwindow into the garden. He had gone to the gate and disappeared. The\nbanker instantly went with his servants to the wing and established\nthe escape of his prisoner. To avoid unnecessary rumours he took the\npaper with the renunciation from the table and, on his return, locked\nit in his safe.\n\n\n\n\nVANKA\n\n\n\nBY ANTON P. CHEKHOV\n\n\nNine-year-old Vanka Zhukov, who had been apprentice to the shoemaker\nAliakhin for three months, did not go to bed the night before\nChristmas. He waited till the master and mistress and the assistants\nhad gone out to an early church-service, to procure from his\nemployer's cupboard a small phial of ink and a penholder with a rusty\nnib; then, spreading a crumpled sheet of paper in front of him, he\nbegan to write.\n\nBefore, however, deciding to make the first letter, he looked\nfurtively at the door and at the window, glanced several times at the\nsombre ikon, on either side of which stretched shelves full of lasts,\nand heaved a heart-rending sigh. The sheet of paper was spread on a\nbench, and he himself was on his knees in front of it.\n\n\"Dear Grandfather Konstantin Makarych,\" he wrote, \"I am writing you a\nletter. I wish you a Happy Christmas and all God's holy best. I have\nno mamma or papa, you are all I have.\"\n\nVanka gave a look towards the window in which shone the reflection of\nhis candle, and vividly pictured to himself his grandfather,\nKonstantin Makarych, who was night-watchman at Messrs. Zhivarev. He\nwas a small, lean, unusually lively and active old man of sixty-five,\nalways smiling and blear-eyed. All day he slept in the servants'\nkitchen or trifled with the cooks. At night, enveloped in an ample\nsheep-skin coat, he strayed round the domain tapping with his cudgel.\nBehind him, each hanging its head, walked the old bitch Kashtanka, and\nthe dog Viun, so named because of his black coat and long body and his\nresemblance to a loach. Viun was an unusually civil and friendly dog,\nlooking as kindly at a stranger as at his masters, but he was not to\nbe trusted. Beneath his deference and humbleness was hid the most\ninquisitorial maliciousness. No one knew better than he how to sneak\nup and take a bite at a leg, or slip into the larder or steal a\nmuzhik's chicken. More than once they had nearly broken his hind-legs,\ntwice he had been hung up, every week he was nearly flogged to death,\nbut he always recovered.\n\nAt this moment, for certain, Vanka's grandfather must be standing at\nthe gate, blinking his eyes at the bright red windows of the village\nchurch, stamping his feet in their high-felt boots, and jesting with\nthe people in the yard; his cudgel will be hanging from his belt, he\nwill be hugging himself with cold, giving a little dry, old man's\ncough, and at times pinching a servant-girl or a cook.\n\n\"Won't we take some snuff?\" he asks, holding out his snuff-box to the\nwomen. The women take a pinch of snuff, and sneeze.\n\nThe old man goes into indescribable ecstasies, breaks into loud\nlaughter, and cries:\n\n\"Off with it, it will freeze to your nose!\"\n\nHe gives his snuff to the dogs, too. Kashtanka sneezes, twitches her\nnose, and walks away offended. Viun deferentially refuses to sniff and\nwags his tail. It is glorious weather, not a breath of wind, clear,\nand frosty; it is a dark night, but the whole village, its white roofs\nand streaks of smoke from the chimneys, the trees silvered with\nhoar-frost, and the snowdrifts, you can see it all. The sky\nscintillates with bright twinkling stars, and the Milky Way stands out\nso clearly that it looks as if it had been polished and rubbed over\nwith snow for the holidays...\n\nVanka sighs, dips his pen in the ink, and continues to write:\n\n\"Last night I got a thrashing, my master dragged me by my hair into\nthe yard, and belaboured me with a shoe-maker's stirrup, because,\nwhile I was rocking his brat in its cradle, I unfortunately fell\nasleep. And during the week, my mistress told me to clean a herring,\nand I began by its tail, so she took the herring and stuck its snout\ninto my face. The assistants tease me, send me to the tavern for\nvodka, make me steal the master's cucumbers, and the master beats me\nwith whatever is handy. Food there is none; in the morning it's bread,\nat dinner gruel, and in the evening bread again. As for tea or\nsour-cabbage soup, the master and the mistress themselves guzzle that.\nThey make me sleep in the vestibule, and when their brat cries, I\ndon't sleep at all, but have to rock the cradle. Dear Grandpapa, for\nHeaven's sake, take me away from here, home to our village, I can't\nbear this any more... I bow to the ground to you, and will pray to God\nfor ever and ever, take me from here or I shall die...\"\n\nThe corners of Vanka's mouth went down, he rubbed his eyes with his\ndirty fist, and sobbed.\n\n\"I'll grate your tobacco for you,\" he continued, \"I'll pray to God for\nyou, and if there is anything wrong, then flog me like the grey goat.\nAnd if you really think I shan't find work, then I'll ask the manager,\nfor Christ's sake, to let me clean the boots, or I'll go instead of\nFedya as underherdsman. Dear Grandpapa, I can't bear this any more,\nit'll kill me... I wanted to run away to our village, but I have no\nboots, and I was afraid of the frost, and when I grow up I'll look\nafter you, no one shall harm you, and when you die I'll pray for the\nrepose of your soul, just like I do for mamma Pelagueya.\n\n\"As for Moscow, it is a large town, there are all gentlemen's houses,\nlots of horses, no sheep, and the dogs are not vicious. The children\ndon't come round at Christmas with a star, no one is allowed to sing\nin the choir, and once I saw in a shop window hooks on a line and\nfishing rods, all for sale, and for every kind of fish, awfully\nconvenient. And there was one hook which would catch a sheat-fish\nweighing a pound. And there are shops with guns, like the master's,\nand I am sure they must cost 100 rubles each. And in the meat-shops\nthere are woodcocks, partridges, and hares, but who shot them or where\nthey come from, the shopman won't say.\n\n\"Dear Grandpapa, and when the masters give a Christmas tree, take a\ngolden walnut and hide it in my green box. Ask the young lady, Olga\nIgnatyevna, for it, say it's for Vanka.\"\n\nVanka sighed convulsively, and again stared at the window. He\nremembered that his grandfather always went to the forest for the\nChristmas tree, and took his grandson with him. What happy times! The\nfrost crackled, his grandfather crackled, and as they both did, Vanka\ndid the same. Then before cutting down the Christmas tree his\ngrandfather smoked his pipe, took a long pinch of snuff, and made fun\nof poor frozen little Vanka... The young fir trees, wrapt in\nhoar-frost, stood motionless, waiting for which of them would die.\nSuddenly a hare springing from somewhere would dart over the\nsnowdrift... His grandfather could not help shouting:\n\n\"Catch it, catch it, catch it! Ah, short-tailed devil!\"\n\nWhen the tree was down, his grandfather dragged it to the master's\nhouse, and there they set about decorating it. The young lady, Olga\nIgnatyevna, Vanka's great friend, busied herself most about it. When\nlittle Vanka's mother, Pelagueya, was still alive, and was\nservant-woman in the house, Olga Ignatyevna used to stuff him with\nsugar-candy, and, having nothing to do, taught him to read, write,\ncount up to one hundred, and even to dance the quadrille. When\nPelagueya died, they placed the orphan Vanka in the kitchen with his\ngrandfather, and from the kitchen he was sent to Moscow to Aliakhin,\nthe shoemaker.\n\n\"Come quick, dear Grandpapa,\" continued Vanka, \"I beseech you for\nChrist's sake take me from here. Have pity on a poor orphan, for here\nthey beat me, and I am frightfully hungry, and so sad that I can't\ntell you, I cry all the time. The other day the master hit me on the\nhead with a last; I fell to the ground, and only just returned to\nlife. My life is a misfortune, worse than any dog's... I send\ngreetings to Aliona, to one-eyed Tegor, and the coachman, and don't\nlet any one have my mouth-organ. I remain, your grandson, Ivan Zhukov,\ndear Grandpapa, do come.\"\n\nVanka folded his sheet of paper in four, and put it into an envelope\npurchased the night before for a kopek. He thought a little, dipped\nthe pen into the ink, and wrote the address:\n\n\"The village, to my grandfather.\" He then scratched his head, thought\nagain, and added: \"Konstantin Makarych.\" Pleased at not having been\ninterfered with in his writing, he put on his cap, and, without\nputting on his sheep-skin coat, ran out in his shirt-sleeves into the\nstreet.\n\nThe shopman at the poulterer's, from whom he had inquired the night\nbefore, had told him that letters were to be put into post-boxes, and\nfrom there they were conveyed over the whole earth in mail troikas by\ndrunken post-boys and to the sound of bells. Vanka ran to the first\npost-box and slipped his precious letter into the slit.\n\nAn hour afterwards, lulled by hope, he was sleeping soundly. In his\ndreams he saw a stove, by the stove his grandfather sitting with his\nlegs dangling down, barefooted, and reading a letter to the cooks, and\nViun walking round the stove wagging his tail.\n\n\n\n\nHIDE AND SEEK\n\n\n\nBY FIODOR SOLOGUB\n\n\nEverything in Lelechka's nursery was bright, pretty, and cheerful.\nLelechka's sweet voice charmed her mother. Lelechka was a delightful\nchild. There was no other such child, there never had been, and there\nnever would be. Lelechka's mother, Serafima Aleksandrovna, was sure of\nthat. Lelechka's eyes were dark and large, her cheeks were rosy, her\nlips were made for kisses and for laughter. But it was not these\ncharms in Lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy. Lelechka was\nher mother's only child. That was why every movement of Lelechka's\nbewitched her mother. It was great bliss to hold Lelechka on her knees\nand to fondle her; to feel the little girl in her arms--a thing as\nlively and as bright as a little bird.\n\nTo tell the truth, Serafima Aleksandrovna felt happy only in the\nnursery. She felt cold with her husband.\n\nPerhaps it was because he himself loved the cold--he loved to drink\ncold water, and to breathe cold air. He was always fresh and cool,\nwith a frigid smile, and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to\nmove in the air.\n\nThe Nesletyevs, Sergey Modestovich and Serafima Aleksandrovna, had\nmarried without love or calculation, because it was the accepted\nthing. He was a young man of thirty-five, she a young woman of\ntwenty-five; both were of the same circle and well brought up; he was\nexpected to take a wife, and the time had come for her to take a\nhusband.\n\nIt even seemed to Serafima Aleksandrovna that she was in love with her\nfuture husband, and this made her happy. He looked handsome and\nwell-bred; his intelligent grey eyes always preserved a dignified\nexpression; and he fulfilled his obligations of a fianc� with\nirreproachable gentleness.\n\nThe bride was also good-looking; she was a tall, dark-eyed,\ndark-haired girl, somewhat timid but very tactful. He was not after\nher dowry, though it pleased him to know that she had something. He\nhad connexions, and his wife came of good, influential people. This\nmight, at the proper opportunity, prove useful. Always irreproachable\nand tactful, Nesletyev got on in his position not so fast that any one\nshould envy him, nor yet so slow that he should envy any one\nelse--everything came in the proper measure and at the proper time.\n\nAfter their marriage there was nothing in the manner of Sergey\nModestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife. Later, however,\nwhen his wife was about to have a child, Sergey Modestovich\nestablished connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature.\nSerafima Aleksandrovna found this out, and, to her own astonishment,\nwas not particularly hurt; she awaited her infant with a restless\nanticipation that swallowed every other feeling.\n\nA little girl was born; Serafima Aleksandrovna gave herself up to her.\nAt the beginning she used to tell her husband, with rapture, of all\nthe joyous details of Lelechka's existence. But she soon found that he\nlistened to her without the slightest interest, and only from the\nhabit of politeness. Serafima Aleksandrovna drifted farther and\nfarther away from him. She loved her little girl with the ungratified\npassion that other women, deceived in their husbands, show their\nchance young lovers.\n\n\"_Mamochka_, let's play _priatki_\" (hide and seek), cried Lelechka,\npronouncing the _r_ like the _l_, so that the word sounded \"pliatki.\"\n\nThis charming inability to speak always made Serafima Aleksandrovna\nsmile with tender rapture. Lelechka then ran away, stamping with her\nplump little legs over the carpets, and hid herself behind the\ncurtains near her bed.\n\n\"_Tiu-tiu, mamochka!_\" she cried out in her sweet, laughing voice, as\nshe looked out with a single roguish eye.\n\n\"Where is my baby girl?\" the mother asked, as she looked for Lelechka\nand made believe that she did not see her.\n\nAnd Lelechka poured out her rippling laughter in her hiding place.\nThen she came out a little farther, and her mother, as though she had\nonly just caught sight of her, seized her by her little shoulders and\nexclaimed joyously: \"Here she is, my Lelechka!\"\n\nLelechka laughed long and merrily, her head close to her mother's\nknees, and all of her cuddled up between her mother's white hands. Her\nmother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion.\n\n\"Now, _mamochka_, you hide,\" said Lelechka, as she ceased laughing.\n\nHer mother went to hide. Lelechka turned away as though not to see,\nbut watched her _mamochka_ stealthily all the time. Mamma hid behind\nthe cupboard, and exclaimed: \"_Tiu-tiu_, baby girl!\"\n\nLelechka ran round the room and looked into all the corners, making\nbelieve, as her mother had done before, that she was seeking--though\nshe really knew all the time where her _mamochka_ was standing.\n\n\"Where's my _mamochka_?\" asked Lelechka. \"She's not here, and she's\nnot here,\" she kept on repeating, as she ran from corner to corner.\n\nHer mother stood, with suppressed breathing, her head pressed against\nthe wall, her hair somewhat disarranged. A smile of absolute bliss\nplayed on her red lips.\n\nThe nurse, Fedosya, a good-natured and fine-looking, if somewhat\nstupid woman, smiled as she looked at her mistress with her\ncharacteristic expression, which seemed to say that it was not for her\nto object to gentlewomen's caprices. She thought to herself: \"The\nmother is like a little child herself--look how excited she is.\"\n\nLelechka was getting nearer her mother's corner. Her mother was\ngrowing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game; her\nheart beat with short quick strokes, and she pressed even closer to\nthe wall, disarranging her hair still more. Lelechka suddenly glanced\ntoward her mother's corner and screamed with joy.\n\n\"I've found 'oo,\" she cried out loudly and joyously, mispronouncing\nher words in a way that again made her mother happy.\n\nShe pulled her mother by her hands to the middle of the room, they\nwere merry and they laughed; and Lelechka again hid her head against\nher mother's knees, and went on lisping and lisping, without end, her\nsweet little words, so fascinating yet so awkward.\n\nSergey Modestovich was coming at this moment toward the nursery.\nThrough the half-closed doors he heard the laughter, the joyous\noutcries, the sound of romping. He entered the nursery, smiling his\ngenial cold smile; he was irreproachably dressed, and he looked fresh\nand erect, and he spread round him an atmosphere of cleanliness,\nfreshness and coldness. He entered in the midst of the lively game,\nand he confused them all by his radiant coldness. Even Fedosya felt\nabashed, now for her mistress, now for herself. Serafima Aleksandrovna\nat once became calm and apparently cold--and this mood communicated\nitself to the little girl, who ceased to laugh, but looked instead,\nsilently and intently, at her father.\n\nSergey Modestovich gave a swift glance round the room. He liked coming\nhere, where everything was beautifully arranged; this was done by\nSerafima Aleksandrovna, who wished to surround her little girl, from\nher very infancy, only with the loveliest things. Serafima\nAleksandrovna dressed herself tastefully; this, too, she did for\nLelechka, with the same end in view. One thing Sergey Modestovich had\nnot become reconciled to, and this was his wife's almost continuous\npresence in the nursery.\n\n\"It's just as I thought... I knew that I'd find you here,\" he said\nwith a derisive and condescending smile.\n\nThey left the nursery together. As he followed his wife through the\ndoor Sergey Modestovich said rather indifferently, in an incidental\nway, laying no stress on his words: \"Don't you think that it would be\nwell for the little girl if she were sometimes without your company?\nMerely, you see, that the child should feel its own individuality,\" he\nexplained in answer to Serafima Aleksandrovna's puzzled glance.\n\n\"She's still so little,\" said Serafima Aleksandrovna.\n\n\"In any case, this is but my humble opinion. I don't insist. It's your\nkingdom there.\"\n\n\"I'll think it over,\" his wife answered, smiling, as he did, coldly\nbut genially.\n\nThen they began to talk of something else.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nNurse Fedosya, sitting in the kitchen that evening, was telling the\nsilent housemaid Darya and the talkative old cook Agathya about the\nyoung lady of the house, and how the child loved to play _priatki_\nwith her mother--\"She hides her little face, and cries '_tiutiu_'!\"\n\n\"And the mistress herself is like a little one,\" added Fedosya,\nsmiling.\n\nAgathya listened and shook her head ominously; while her face became\ngrave and reproachful.\n\n\"That the mistress does it, well, that's one thing; but that the young\nlady does it, that's bad.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Fedosya with curiosity.\n\nThis expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden,\nroughly-painted doll.\n\n\"Yes, that's bad,\" repeated Agathya with conviction. \"Terribly bad!\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Fedosya, the ludicrous expression of curiosity on her\nface becoming more emphatic.\n\n\"She'll hide, and hide, and hide away,\" said Agathya, in a mysterious\nwhisper, as she looked cautiously toward the door.\n\n\"What are you saying?\" exclaimed Fedosya, frightened.\n\n\"It's the truth I'm saying, remember my words,\" Agathya went on with\nthe same assurance and secrecy. \"It's the surest sign.\"\n\nThe old woman had invented this sign, quite suddenly, herself; and she\nwas evidently very proud of it.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nLelechka was asleep, and Serafima Aleksandrovna was sitting in her own\nroom, thinking with joy and tenderness of Lelechka. Lelechka was in\nher thoughts, first a sweet, tiny girl, then a sweet, big girl, then\nagain a delightful little girl; and so until the end she remained\nmamma's little Lelechka.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna did not even notice that Fedosya came up to her\nand paused before her. Fedosya had a worried, frightened look.\n\n\"Madam, madam,\" she said quietly, in a trembling voice.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna gave a start. Fedosya's face made her anxious.\n\n\"What is it, Fedosya?\" she asked with great concern. \"Is there\nanything wrong with Lelechka?\"\n\n\"No, madam,\" said Fedosya, as she gesticulated with her hands to\nreassure her mistress and to make her sit down. \"Lelechka is asleep,\nmay God be with her! Only I'd like to say something--you see--Lelechka\nis always hiding herself--that's not good.\"\n\nFedosya looked at her mistress with fixed eyes, which had grown round\nfrom fright.\n\n\"Why not good?\" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna, with vexation,\nsuccumbing involuntarily to vague fears.\n\n\"I can't tell you how bad it is,\" said Fedosya, and her face expressed\nthe most decided confidence.\n\n\"Please speak in a sensible way,\" observed Serafima Aleksandrovna\ndryly. \"I understand nothing of what you are saying.\"\n\n\"You see, madam, it's a kind of omen,\" explained Fedosya abruptly, in\na shamefaced way.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Serafima Aleksandrovna.\n\nShe did not wish to hear any further as to the sort of omen it was,\nand what it foreboded. But, somehow, a sense of fear and of sadness\ncrept into her mood, and it was humiliating to feel that an absurd\ntale should disturb her beloved fancies, and should agitate her so\ndeeply.\n\n\"Of course I know that gentlefolk don't believe in omens, but it's a\nbad omen, madam,\" Fedosya went on in a doleful voice, \"the young lady\nwill hide, and hide...\"\n\nSuddenly she burst into tears, sobbing out loudly: \"She'll hide, and\nhide, and hide away, angelic little soul, in a damp grave,\" she\ncontinued, as she wiped her tears with her apron and blew her nose.\n\n\"Who told you all this?\" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna in an austere\nlow voice.\n\n\"Agathya says so, madam,\" answered Fedosya; \"it's she that knows.\"\n\n\"Knows!\" exclaimed Serafima Aleksandrovna in irritation, as though she\nwished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety. \"What\nnonsense! Please don't come to me with any such notions in the future.\nNow you may go.\"\n\nFedosya, dejected, her feelings hurt, left her mistress.\n\n\"What nonsense! As though Lelechka could die!\" thought Serafima\nAleksandrovna to herself, trying to conquer the feeling of coldness\nand fear which took possession, of her at the thought of the possible\ndeath of Lelechka. Serafima Aleksandrovna, upon reflection, attributed\nthese women's beliefs in omens to ignorance. She saw clearly that\nthere could be no possible connexion between a child's quite ordinary\ndiversion and the continuation of the child's life. She made a special\neffort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters, but her\nthoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that Lelechka loved to\nhide herself.\n\nWhen Lelechka was still quite small, and had learned to distinguish\nbetween her mother and her nurse, she sometimes, sitting in her\nnurse's arms, made a sudden roguish grimace, and hid her laughing face\nin the nurse's shoulder. Then she would look out with a sly glance.\n\nOf late, in those rare moments of the mistress' absence from the\nnursery, Fedosya had again taught Lelechka to hide; and when\nLelechka's mother, on coming in, saw how lovely the child looked when\nshe was hiding, she herself began to play hide and seek with her tiny\ndaughter.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe next day Serafima Aleksandrovna, absorbed in her joyous cares for\nLelechka, had forgotten Fedosya's words of the day before.\n\nBut when she returned to the nursery, after having ordered the dinner,\nand she heard Lelechka suddenly cry _\"Tiu-tiu!\"_ from under the table,\na feeling of fear suddenly took hold of her. Though she reproached\nherself at once for this unfounded, superstitious dread, nevertheless\nshe could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of Lelechka's\nfavourite game, and she tried to divert Lelechka's attention to\nsomething else.\n\nLelechka was a lovely and obedient child. She eagerly complied with\nher mother's new wishes. But as she had got into the habit of hiding\nfrom her mother in some corner, and of crying out _\"Tiu-tiu!\"_ so even\nthat day she returned more than once to the game.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse Lelechka. This was\nnot so easy because restless, threatening thoughts obtruded themselves\nconstantly.\n\n\"Why does Lelechka keep on recalling the _tiu-tiu_? Why does she not\nget tired of the same thing--of eternally closing her eyes, and of\nhiding her face? Perhaps,\" thought Serafima Aleksandrovna, \"she is not\nas strongly drawn to the world as other children, who are attracted by\nmany things. If this is so, is it not a sign of organic weakness? Is\nit not a germ of the unconscious non-desire to live?\"\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna was tormented by presentiments. She felt\nashamed of herself for ceasing to play hide and seek with Lelechka\nbefore Fedosya. But this game had become agonising to her, all the\nmore agonising because she had a real desire to play it, and because\nsomething drew her very strongly to hide herself from Lelechka and to\nseek out the hiding child. Serafima Aleksandrovna herself began the\ngame once or twice, though she played it with a heavy heart. She\nsuffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness.\n\nIt was a sad day for Serafima Aleksandrovna.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nLelechka was about to fall asleep. No sooner had she climbed into her\nlittle bed, protected by a network on all sides, than her eyes began\nto close from fatigue. Her mother covered her with a blue blanket.\nLelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and\nstretched them out to embrace her mother. Her mother bent down.\nLelechka, with a tender expression on her sleepy face, kissed her\nmother and let her head fall on the pillow. As her hands hid\nthemselves under the blanket Lelechka whispered: \"The hands\n_tiu-tiu!_\"\n\nThe mother's heart seemed to stop--Lelechka lay there so small, so\nfrail, so quiet. Lelechka smiled gently, closed her eyes and said\nquietly: \"The eyes _tiu-tiu!_\"\n\nThen even more quietly: \"Lelechka _tiu-tiu!_\"\n\nWith these words she fell asleep, her face pressing the pillow. She\nseemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her. Her\nmother looked at her with sad eyes.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna remained standing over Lelechka's bed a long\nwhile, and she kept looking at Lelechka with tenderness and fear.\n\n\"I'm a mother: is it possible that I shouldn't be able to protect\nher?\" she thought, as she imagined the various ills that might befall\nLelechka.\n\nShe prayed long that night, but the prayer did not relieve her\nsadness.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nSeveral days passed. Lelechka caught cold. The fever came upon her at\nnight. When Serafima Aleksandrovna, awakened by Fedosya, came to\nLelechka and saw her looking so hot, so restless, and so tormented,\nshe instantly recalled the evil omen, and a hopeless despair took\npossession of her from the first moments.\n\nA doctor was called, and everything was done that is usual on such\noccasions--but the inevitable happened. Serafima Aleksandrovna tried\nto console herself with the hope that Lelechka would get well, and\nwould again laugh and play--yet this seemed to her an unthinkable\nhappiness! And Lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour.\n\nAll simulated tranquillity, so as not to frighten Serafima\nAleksandrovna, but their masked faces only made her sad.\n\nNothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of Fedosya, uttered\nbetween sobs: \"She hid herself and hid herself, our Lelechka!\"\n\nBut the thoughts of Serafima Aleksandrovna were confused, and she\ncould not quite grasp what was happening.\n\nFever was consuming Lelechka, and there were times when she lost\nconsciousness and spoke in delirium. But when she returned to herself\nshe bore her pain and her fatigue with gentle good nature; she smiled\nfeebly at her _mamochka_, so that her _mamochka_ should not see how\nmuch she suffered. Three days passed, torturing like a nightmare.\nLelechka grew quite feeble. She did not know that she was dying.\n\nShe glanced at her mother with her dimmed eyes, and lisped in a\nscarcely audible, hoarse voice: \"_Tiu-tiu, mamochka!_ Make _tiu-tiu,\nmamochka!_\"\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near\nLelechka's bed. How tragic!\n\n\"_Mamochka!_\" called Lelechka in an almost inaudible voice.\n\nLelechka's mother bent over her, and Lelechka, her vision grown still\nmore dim, saw her mother's pale, despairing face for the last time.\n\n\"A white _mamochka_!\" whispered Lelechka.\n\n_Mamochka's_ white face became blurred, and everything grew dark\nbefore Lelechka. She caught the edge of the bed-cover feebly with her\nhands and whispered: \"_Tiu-tiu!_\"\n\nSomething rattled in her throat; Lelechka opened and again closed her\nrapidly paling lips, and died.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna was in dumb despair as she left Lelechka, and\nwent out of the room. She met her husband.\n\n\"Lelechka is dead,\" she said in a quiet, dull voice.\n\nSergey Modestovich looked anxiously at her pale face. He was struck by\nthe strange stupor in her formerly animated handsome features.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n\nLelechka was dressed, placed in a little coffin, and carried into the\nparlour. Serafima Aleksandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking\ndully at her dead child. Sergey Modestovich went to his wife and,\nconsoling her with cold, empty words, tried to draw her away from the\ncoffin. Serafima Aleksandrovna smiled.\n\n\"Go away,\" she said quietly. \"Lelechka is playing. She'll be up in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Sima, my dear, don't agitate yourself,\" said Sergey Modestovich in a\nwhisper. \"You must resign yourself to your fate.\"\n\n\"She'll be up in a minute,\" persisted Serafima Aleksandrovna, her eyes\nfixed on the dead little girl.\n\nSergey Modestovich looked round him cautiously: he was afraid of the\nunseemly and of the ridiculous.\n\n\"Sima, don't agitate yourself,\" he repeated. \"This would be a miracle,\nand miracles do not happen in the nineteenth century.\"\n\nNo sooner had he said these words than Sergey Modestovich felt their\nirrelevance to what had happened. He was confused and annoyed.\n\nHe took his wife by the arm, and cautiously led her away from the\ncoffin. She did not oppose him.\n\nHer face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry. She went into the\nnursery and began to walk round the room, looking into those places\nwhere Lelechka used to hide herself. She walked all about the room,\nand bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed, and\nkept on repeating cheerfully: \"Where is my little one? Where is my\nLelechka?\"\n\nAfter she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest\nanew. Fedosya, motionless, with dejected face, sat in a corner, and\nlooked frightened at her mistress; then she suddenly burst out\nsobbing, and she wailed loudly:\n\n\"She hid herself, and hid herself, our Lelechka, our angelic little\nsoul!\"\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna trembled, paused, cast a perplexed look at\nFedosya, began to weep, and left the nursery quietly.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n\nSergey Modestovich hurried the funeral. He saw that Serafima\nAleksandrovna was terribly shocked by her sudden misfortune, and as\nhe feared for her reason he thought she would more readily be diverted\nand consoled when Lelechka was buried.\n\nNext morning Serafima Aleksandrovna dressed with particular care--for\nLelechka. When she entered the parlour there were several people\nbetween her and Lelechka. The priest and deacon paced up and down the\nroom; clouds of blue smoke drifted in the air, and there was a smell\nof incense. There was an oppressive feeling of heaviness in Serafima\nAleksandrovna's head as she approached Lelechka. Lelechka lay there\nstill and pale, and smiled pathetically. Serafima Aleksandrovna laid\nher cheek upon the edge of Lelechka's coffin, and whispered:\n\"_Tiu-tiu_, little one!\"\n\nThe little one did not reply. Then there was some kind of stir and\nconfusion around Serafima Aleksandrovna; strange, unnecessary faces\nbent over her, some one held her--and Lelechka was carried away\nsomewhere.\n\nSerafima Aleksandrovna stood up erect, sighed in a lost way, smiled,\nand called loudly: \"Lelechka!\"\n\nLelechka was being carried out. The mother threw herself after the\ncoffin with despairing sobs, but she was held back. She sprang behind\nthe door, through which Lelechka had passed, sat down there on the\nfloor, and as she looked through the crevice, she cried out:\n\"Lelechka, _tiu-tiu!_\"\n\nThen she put her head out from behind the door, and began to laugh.\n\nLelechka was quickly carried away from her mother, and those who\ncarried her seemed to run rather than to walk.\n\n\n\n\nDETHRONED\n\n\n\nBY I.N. POTAPENKO\n\n\n\"Well?\" Captain Zarubkin's wife called out impatiently to her husband,\nrising from the sofa and turning to face him as he entered.\n\n\"He doesn't know anything about it,\" he replied indifferently, as if\nthe matter were of no interest to him. Then he asked in a businesslike\ntone: \"Nothing for me from the office?\"\n\n\"Why should I know? Am I your errand boy?\"\n\n\"How they dilly-dally! If only the package doesn't come too late. It's\nso important!\"\n\n\"Idiot!\"\n\n\"Who's an idiot?\"\n\n\"You, with your indifference, your stupid egoism.\"\n\nThe captain said nothing. He was neither surprised nor insulted. On\nthe contrary, the smile on his face was as though he had received a\ncompliment. These wifely animadversions, probably oft-heard, by no\nmeans interfered with his domestic peace.\n\n\"It can't be that the man doesn't know when his wife is coming back\nhome,\" Mrs. Zarubkin continued excitedly. \"She's written to him every\nday of the four months that she's been away. The postmaster told me\nso.\"\n\n\"Semyonov! Ho, Semyonov! Has any one from the office been here?\"\n\n\"I don't know, your Excellency,\" came in a loud, clear voice from back\nof the room.\n\n\"Why don't you know? Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I went to Abramka, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"The tailor again?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency, the tailor Abramka.\"\n\nThe captain spat in annoyance.\n\n\"And where is Krynka?\"\n\n\"He went to market, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Was he told to go to market?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency.\"\n\nThe captain spat again.\n\n\"Why do you keep spitting? Such vulgar manners!\" his wife cried\nangrily. \"You behave at home like a drunken subaltern. You haven't the\nleast consideration for your wife. You are so coarse in your behaviour\ntowards me! Do, please, go to your office.\"\n\n\"Semyonov.\"\n\n\"Your Excellency?\"\n\n\"If the package comes, please have it sent back to the office and say\nI've gone there. And listen! Some one must always be here. I won't\nhave everybody out of the house at the same time. Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency.\"\n\nThe captain put on his cap to go. In the doorway he turned and\naddressed his wife.\n\n\"Please, Tasya, please don't send all the servants on your errands at\nthe same time. Something important may turn up, and then there's\nnobody here to attend to it.\"\n\nHe went out, and his wife remained reclining in the sofa corner as if\nhis plea were no concern of hers. But scarcely had he left the house,\nwhen she called out:\n\n\"Semyonov, come here. Quick!\"\n\nA bare-footed unshaven man in dark blue pantaloons and cotton shirt\npresented himself. His stocky figure and red face made a wholesome\nappearance. He was the Captain's orderly.\n\n\"At your service, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Listen, Semyonov, you don't seem to be stupid.\"\n\n\"I don't know, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"For goodness' sake, drop 'your Excellency.' I am not your superior\nofficer.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excel--\"\n\n\"Idiot!\"\n\nBut the lady's manner toward the servant was far friendlier than\ntoward her husband. Semyonov had it in his power to perform important\nservices for her, while the captain had not come up to her\nexpectations.\n\n\"Listen, Semyonov, how do you and the doctor's men get along together?\nAre you friendly?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Intolerable!\" cried the lady, jumping up. \"Stop using that silly\ntitle. Can't you speak like a sensible man?\"\n\nSemyonov had been standing in the stiff attitude of attention, with\nthe palms of his hands at the seams of his trousers. Now he suddenly\nrelaxed, and even wiped his nose with his fist.\n\n\"That's the way we are taught to do,\" he said carelessly, with a\nclownish grin. \"The gentlemen, the officers, insist on it.\"\n\n\"Now, tell me, you are on good terms with the doctor's men?\"\n\n\"You mean Podmar and Shuchok? Of course, we're friends.\"\n\n\"Very well, then go straight to them and try to find out when Mrs.\nShaldin is expected back. They ought to know. They must be getting\nthings ready against her return--cleaning her bedroom and fixing it\nup. Do you understand? But be careful to find out right. And also be\nvery careful not to let on for whom you are finding it out. Do you\nunderstand?'\n\n\"Of course, I understand.\"\n\n\"Well, then, go. But one more thing. Since you're going out, you may\nas well stop at Abramka's again and tell him to come here right away.\nYou understand?\"\n\n\"But his Excellency gave me orders to stay at home,\" said Semyonov,\nscratching himself behind his ears.\n\n\"Please don't answer back. Just do as I tell you. Go on, now.\"\n\n\"At your service.\" And the orderly, impressed by the lady's severe\nmilitary tone, left the room.\n\nMrs. Zarubkin remained reclining on the sofa for a while. Then she\nrose and walked up and down the room and finally went to her bedroom,\nwhere her two little daughters were playing in their nurse's care. She\nscolded them a bit and returned to her former place on the couch. Her\nevery movement betrayed great excitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTatyana Grigoryevna Zarubkin was one of the most looked-up to ladies\nof the S---- Regiment and even of the whole town of Chmyrsk, where the\nregiment was quartered. To be sure, you hardly could say that, outside\nthe regiment, the town could boast any ladies at all. There were very\nrespectable women, decent wives, mothers, daughters and widows of\nhonourable citizens; but they all dressed in cotton and flannel, and\non high holidays made a show of cheap Cashmere gowns over which they\nwore gay shawls with borders of wonderful arabesques. Their hats and\nother headgear gave not the faintest evidence of good taste. So they\ncould scarcely be dubbed \"ladies.\" They were satisfied to be called\n\"women.\" Each one of them, almost, had the name of her husband's trade\nor position tacked to her name--Mrs. Grocer so-and-so, Mrs. Mayor\nso-and-so, Mrs. Milliner so-and-so, etc. Genuine _ladies_ in the\nRussian society sense had never come to the town before the\nS---- Regiment had taken up its quarters there; and it goes without\nsaying that the ladies of the regiment had nothing in common, and\ntherefore no intercourse with, the women of the town. They were so\ndissimilar that they were like creatures of a different species.\n\nThere is no disputing that Tatyana Grigoryevna Zarubkin was one of the\nmost looked-up-to of the ladies. She invariably played the most\nimportant part at all the regimental affairs--the amateur theatricals,\nthe social evenings, the afternoon teas. If the captain's wife was not\nto be present, it was a foregone conclusion that the affair would not\nbe a success.\n\nThe most important point was that Mrs. Zarubkin had the untarnished\nreputation of being the best-dressed of all the ladies. She was always\nthe most distinguished looking at the annual ball. Her gown for the\noccasion, ordered from Moscow, was always chosen with the greatest\nregard for her charms and defects, and it was always exquisitely\nbeautiful. A new fashion could not gain admittance to the other ladies\nof the regiment except by way of the captain's wife. Thanks to her\ngood taste in dressing, the stately blonde was queen at all the balls\nand in all the salons of Chmyrsk. Another advantage of hers was that\nalthough she was nearly forty she still looked fresh and youthful, so\nthat the young officers were constantly hovering about her and paying\nher homage.\n\nNovember was a very lively month in the regiment's calendar. It was on\nthe tenth of November that the annual ball took place. The ladies, of\ncourse, spent their best efforts in preparation for this event.\nNeedless to say that in these arduous activities, Abramka Stiftik, the\nladies' tailor, played a prominent role. He was the one man in Chmyrsk\nwho had any understanding at all for the subtle art of the feminine\ntoilet. Preparations had begun in his shop in August already. Within\nthe last weeks his modest parlour--furnished with six shabby chairs\nplaced about a round table, and a fly-specked mirror on the wall--the\natmosphere heavy with a smell of onions and herring, had been filled\nfrom early morning to the evening hours with the most charming and\nelegant of the fairer sex. There was trying-on and discussion of\nstyles and selection of material. It was all very nerve-racking for\nthe ladies.\n\nThe only one who had never appeared in this parlour was the captain's\nwife. That had been a thorn in Abramka's flesh. He had spent days and\nnights going over in his mind how he could rid this lady of the, in\nhis opinion, wretched habit of ordering her clothes from Moscow. For\nthis ball, however, as she herself had told him, she had not ordered a\ndress but only material from out of town, from which he deduced that\nhe was to make the gown for her. But there was only one week left\nbefore the ball, and still she had not come to him. Abramka was in a\nstate of feverishness. He longed once to make a dress for Mrs.\nZarubkin. It would add to his glory. He wanted to prove that he\nunderstood his trade just as well as any tailor in Moscow, and that it\nwas quite superfluous for her to order her gowns outside of Chmyrsk.\nHe would come out the triumphant competitor of Moscow.\n\nAs each day passed and Mrs. Zarubkin did not appear in his shop, his\nnervousness increased. Finally she ordered a dressing-jacket from\nhim--but not a word said of a ball gown. What was he to think of it?\n\nSo, when Semyonov told him that Mrs. Zarubkin was expecting him at her\nhome, it goes without saying that he instantly removed the dozen pins\nin his mouth, as he was trying on a customer's dress, told one of his\nassistants to continue with the fitting, and instantly set off to call\non the captain's wife. In this case, it was not a question of a mere\nball gown, but of the acquisition of the best customer in town.\n\nAlthough Abramka wore a silk hat and a suit in keeping with the silk\nhat, still he was careful not to ring at the front entrance, but\nalways knocked at the back door. At another time when the captain's\norderly was not in the house--for the captain's orderly also performed\nthe duties of the captain's cook--he might have knocked long and loud.\nOn other occasions a cannon might have been shot off right next to\nTatyana Grigoryevna's ears and she would not have lifted her fingers\nto open the door. But now she instantly caught the sound of the modest\nknocking and opened the back door herself for Abramka.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried delightedly. \"You, Abramka!\"\n\nShe really wanted to address him less familiarly, as was more\nbefitting so dignified a man in a silk hat; but everybody called him\n\"Abramka,\" and he would have been very much surprised had he been\nhonoured with his full name, Abram Srulevich Stiftik. So she thought\nit best to address him as the others did.\n\nMr. \"Abramka\" was tall and thin. There was always a melancholy\nexpression in his pale face. He had a little stoop, a long and very\nheavy greyish beard. He had been practising his profession for thirty\nyears. Ever since his apprenticeship he had been called \"Abramka,\"\nwhich did not strike him as at all derogatory or unfitting. Even his\nshingle read: \"Ladies' Tailor: Abramka Stiftik\"--the most valid proof\nthat he deemed his name immaterial, but that the chief thing to him\nwas his art. As a matter of fact, he had attained, if not perfection\nin tailoring, yet remarkable skill. To this all the ladies of the\nS---- Regiment could attest with conviction.\n\nAbramka removed his silk hat, stepped into the kitchen, and said\ngravely, with profound feeling:\n\n\"Mrs. Zarubkin, I am entirely at your service.\"\n\n\"Come into the reception room. I have something very important to\nspeak to you about.\"\n\nAbramka followed in silence. He stepped softly on tiptoe, as if afraid\nof waking some one.\n\n\"Sit down, Abramka, listen--but give me your word of honour, you won't\ntell any one?\" Tatyana Grigoryevna began, reddening a bit. She was\nashamed to have to let the tailor Abramka into her secret, but since\nthere was no getting around it, she quieted herself and in an instant\nhad regained her ease.\n\n\"I don't know what you are speaking of, Mrs. Zarubkin,\" Abramka\nrejoined. He assumed a somewhat injured manner. \"Have you ever heard\nof Abramka ever babbling anything out? You certainly know that in my\nprofession--you know everybody has some secret to be kept.\"\n\n\"Oh, you must have misunderstood me, Abramka. What sort of secrets do\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Well, one lady is a little bit one-sided, another lady\"--he pointed\nto his breast--\"is not quite full enough, another lady has scrawny\narms--such things as that have to be covered up or filled out or laced\nin, so as to look better. That is where our art comes in. But we are\nin duty bound not to say anything about it.\"\n\nTatyana Grigoryevna smiled.\n\n\"Well, I can assure you I am all right that way. There is nothing\nabout me that needs to be covered up or filled out.\"\n\n\"Oh, as if I didn't know that! Everybody knows that Mrs. Zarubkin's\nfigure is perfect,\" Abramka cried, trying to flatter his new customer.\n\nMrs. Zarubkin laughed and made up her mind to remember \"Everybody\nknows that Mrs. Zarubkin's figure is perfect.\" Then she said:\n\n\"You know that the ball is to take place in a week.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Mrs. Zarubkin, in only one week; unfortunately, only one\nweek,\" replied Abramka, sighing.\n\n\"But you remember your promise to make my dress for me for the ball\nthis time?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Zarubkin,\" Abramka cried, laying his hand on his heart. \"Have I\nsaid that I was not willing to make it? No, indeed, I said it must be\nmade and made right--for Mrs. Zarubkin, it must be better than for any\none else. That's the way I feel about it.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Just what I wanted to know.\"\n\n\"But why don't you show me your material? Why don't you say to me,\n'Here, Abramka, here is the stuff, make a dress?' Abramka would work\non it day and night.\"\n\n\"Ahem, that's just it--I can't order it. That is where the trouble\ncomes in. Tell me, Abramka, what is the shortest time you need for\nmaking the dress? Listen, the very shortest?\"\n\nAbramka shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, is a week too much for a ball dress such as you will want? It's\ngot to be sewed, it can't be pasted together, You, yourself, know\nthat, Mrs. Zarubkin.\"\n\n\"But supposing I order it only three days before the ball?\"\n\nAbramka started.\n\n\"Only three days before the ball? A ball dress? Am I a god, Mrs.\nZarubkin? I am nothing but the ladies' tailor, Abramka Stiftik.\"\n\n\"Well, then you are a nice tailor!\" said Tatyana Grigoryevna,\nscornfully. \"In Moscow they made a ball dress for me in two days.\"\n\nAbramka jumped up as if at a shot, and beat his breast.\n\n\"Is that so? Then I say, Mrs. Zarubkin,\" he cried pathetically, \"if\nthey made a ball gown for you in Moscow in two days, very well, then I\nwill make a ball gown for you, if I must, in one day. I will neither\neat nor sleep, and I won't let my help off either for one minute. How\ndoes that suit you?\"\n\n\"Sit down, Abramka, thank you very much. I hope I shall not have to\nput such a strain on you. It really does not depend upon me, otherwise\nI should have ordered the dress from you long ago.\"\n\n\"It doesn't depend upon you? Then upon whom does it depend?\"\n\n\"Ahem, it depends upon--but now, Abramka, remember this is just\nbetween you and me--it depends upon Mrs. Shaldin.\"\n\n\"Upon Mrs. Shaldin, the doctor's wife? Why she isn't even here.\"\n\n\"That's just it. That is why I have to wait. How is it that a clever\nman like you, Abramka, doesn't grasp the situation?\"\n\n\"Hm, hm! Let me see.\" Abramka racked his brains for a solution of the\nriddle. How could it be that Mrs. Shaldin, who was away, should have\nanything to do with Mrs. Zarubkin's order for a gown? No, that passed\nhis comprehension.\n\n\"She certainly will get back in time for the ball,\" said Mrs.\nZarubkin, to give him a cue.\n\n\"Well, yes.\"\n\n\"And certainly will bring a dress back with her.\"\n\n\"Certainly!\"\n\n\"A dress from abroad, something we have never seen here--something\nhighly original.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Zarubkin!\" Abramka cried, as if a truth of tremendous import had\nbeen revealed to him. \"Mrs. Zarubkin, I understand. Why certainly!\nYes, but that will be pretty hard.\"\n\n\"That's just it.\"\n\nAbramka reflected a moment, then said:\n\n\"I assure you, Mrs. Zarubkin, you need not be a bit uneasy. I will\nmake a dress for you that will be just as grand as the one from\nabroad. I assure you, your dress will be the most elegant one at the\nball, just as it always has been. I tell you, my name won't be Abramka\nStiftik if--\"\n\nHis eager asseverations seemed not quite to satisfy the captain's\nwife. Her mind was not quite set at ease. She interrupted him.\n\n\"But the style, Abramka, the style! You can't possibly guess what the\nlatest fashion is abroad.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I know what the latest fashion is, Mrs. Zarubkin? In\nKiev I have a friend who publishes fashion-plates. I will telegraph to\nhim, and he will immediately send me pictures of the latest French\nmodels. The telegram will cost only eighty cents, Mrs. Zarubkin, and I\nswear to you I will copy any dress he sends. Mrs. Shaldin can't\npossibly have a dress like that.\"\n\n\"All very well and good, and that's what we'll do. Still we must wait\nuntil Mrs. Shaldin comes back. Don't you see, Abramka, I must have\nexactly the same style that she has? Can't you see, so that nobody can\nsay that she is in the latest fashion?\"\n\nAt this point Semyonov entered the room cautiously. He was wearing the\noddest-looking jacket and the captain's old boots. His hair was\nrumpled, and his eyes were shining suspiciously. There was every sign\nthat he had used the renewal of friendship with the doctor's men as a\npretext for a booze.\n\n\"I had to stand them some brandy, your Excellency,\" he said saucily,\nbut catching his mistress's threatening look, he lowered his head\nguiltily.\n\n\"Idiot,\" she yelled at him, \"face about. Be off with you to the\nkitchen.\"\n\nIn his befuddlement, Semyonov had not noticed Abramka's presence. Now\nhe became aware of him, faced about and retired to the kitchen\nsheepishly.\n\n\"What an impolite fellow,\" said Abramka reproachfully.\n\n\"Oh, you wouldn't believe--\" said the captain's wife, but instantly\nfollowed Semyonov into the kitchen.\n\nSemyonov aware of his awful misdemeanour, tried to stand up straight\nand give a report.\n\n\"She will come back, your Excellency, day after to-morrow toward\nevening. She sent a telegram.\"\n\n\"Is that true now?\"\n\n\"I swear it's true. Shuchok saw it himself.\"\n\n\"All right, very good. You will get something for this.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Silence, you goose. Go on, set the table.\"\n\nAbramka remained about ten minutes longer with the captain's wife, and\non leaving said:\n\n\"Let me assure you once again, Mrs. Zarubkin, you needn't worry; just\nselect the style, and I will make a gown for you that the best tailor\nin Paris can't beat.\" He pressed his hand to his heart in token of his\nintention to do everything in his power for Mrs. Zarubkin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was seven o'clock in the evening. Mrs. Shaldin and her trunk had\narrived hardly half an hour before, yet the captain's wife was already\nthere paying visit; which was a sign of the warm friendship that\nexisted between the two women. They kissed each other and fell to\ntalking. The doctor, a tall man of forty-five, seemed discomfited by\nthe visit, and passed unfriendly side glances at his guest. He had\nhoped to spend that evening undisturbed with his wife, and he well\nknew that when the ladies of the regiment came to call upon each other\n\"for only a second,\" it meant a whole evening of listening to idle\ntalk.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me, dear, how bored I was the whole time you\nwere away, how I longed for you, Natalie Semyonovna. But you probably\nnever gave us a thought.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can you say anything like that. I was thinking of you every\nminute, every second. If I hadn't been obliged to finish the cure, I\nshould have returned long ago. No matter how beautiful it may be away\nfrom home, still the only place to live is among those that are near\nand dear to you.\"\n\nThese were only the preliminary soundings. They lasted with variations\nfor a quarter of an hour. First Mrs. Shaldin narrated a few incidents\nof the trip, then Mrs. Zarubkin gave a report of some of the chief\nhappenings in the life of the regiment. When the conversation was in\nfull swing, and the samovar was singing on the table, and the pancakes\nwere spreading their appetising odour, the captain's wife suddenly\ncried:\n\n\"I wonder what the fashions are abroad now. I say, you must have\nfeasted your eyes on them!\"\n\nMrs. Shaldin simply replied with a scornful gesture.\n\n\"Other people may like them, but I don't care for them one bit. I am\nglad we here don't get to see them until a year later. You know,\nTatyana Grigoryevna, you sometimes see the ugliest styles.\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked the captain's wife eagerly, her eyes gleaming with\ncuriosity. The great moment of complete revelation seemed to have\narrived.\n\n\"Perfectly hideous, I tell you. Just imagine, you know how nice the\nplain skirts were. Then why change them? But no, to be in style now,\nthe skirts have to be draped. Why? It is just a sign of complete lack\nof imagination. And in Lyons they got out a new kind of silk--but that\nis still a French secret.\"\n\n\"Why a secret? The silk is certainly being worn already?\"\n\n\"Yes, one does see it being worn already, but when it was first\nmanufactured, the greatest secret was made of it. They were afraid the\nGermans would imitate. You understand?\"\n\n\"Oh, but what is the latest style?\"\n\n\"I really can't explain it to you. All I know is, it is something\nawful.\"\n\n\"She can't explain! That means she doesn't want to explain. Oh, the\ncunning one. What a sly look she has in her eyes.\" So thought the\ncaptain's wife. From the very beginning of the conversation, the two\nwarm friends, it need scarcely be said, were mutually distrustful.\nEach had the conviction that everything the other said was to be taken\nin the very opposite sense. They were of about the same age, Mrs.\nShaldin possibly one or two years younger than Mrs. Zarubkin. Mrs.\nZarubkin was rather plump, and had heavy light hair. Her appearance\nwas blooming. Mrs. Shaldin was slim, though well proportioned. She was\na brunette with a pale complexion and large dark eyes. They were two\ntypes of beauty very likely to divide the gentlemen of the regiment\ninto two camps of admirers. But women are never content with halves.\nMrs. Zarubkin wanted to see all the officers of the regiment at her\nfeet, and so did Mrs. Shaldin. It naturally led to great rivalry\nbetween the two women, of which they were both conscious, though they\nalways had the friendliest smiles for each other.\n\nMrs. Shaldin tried to give a different turn to the conversation.\n\n\"Do you think the ball will be interesting this year?\"\n\n\"Why should it be interesting?\" rejoined the captain's wife\nscornfully. \"Always the same people, the same old humdrum jog-trot.\"\n\n\"I suppose the ladies have been besieging our poor Abramka?\"\n\n\"I really can't tell you. So far as I am concerned, I have scarcely\nlooked at what he made for me.\"\n\n\"Hm, how's that? Didn't you order your dress from Moscow again?\"\n\n\"No, it really does not pay. I am sick of the bother of it all. Why\nall that trouble? For whom? Our officers don't care a bit how one\ndresses. They haven't the least taste.\"\n\n\"Hm, there's something back of that,\" thought Mrs. Shaldin.\n\nThe captain's wife continued with apparent indifference:\n\n\"I can guess what a gorgeous dress you had made abroad. Certainly in\nthe latest fashion?\"\n\n\"I?\" Mrs. Shaldin laughed innocently. \"How could I get the time during\nmy cure to think of a dress? As a matter of fact, I completely forgot\nthe ball, thought of it at the last moment, and bought the first piece\nof goods I laid my hands on.\"\n\n\"Pink?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. How can you say pink!\"\n\n\"Light blue, then?\"\n\n\"You can't call it exactly light blue. It is a very undefined sort of\ncolour. I really wouldn't know what to call it.\"\n\n\"But it certainly must have some sort of a shade?\"\n\n\"You may believe me or not if you choose, but really I don't know.\nIt's a very indefinite shade.\"\n\n\"Is it Sura silk?\"\n\n\"No, I can't bear Sura. It doesn't keep the folds well.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is cr�pe de Chine?\"\n\n\"Heavens, no! Cr�pe de Chine is much too expensive for me.\"\n\n\"Then what can it be?\"\n\n\"Oh, wait a minute, what _is_ the name of that goods? You know there\nare so many funny new names now. They don't make any sense.\"\n\n\"Then show me your dress, dearest. Do please show me your dress.\"\n\nMrs. Shaldin seemed to be highly embarrassed.\n\n\"I am so sorry I can't. It is way down at the bottom of the trunk.\nThere is the trunk. You see yourself I couldn't unpack it now.\"\n\nThe trunk, close to the wall, was covered with oil cloth and tied\ntight with heavy cords. The captain's wife devoured it with her eyes.\nShe would have liked to see through and through it. She had nothing to\nsay in reply, because it certainly was impossible to ask her friend,\ntired out from her recent journey, to begin to unpack right away and\ntake out all her things just to show her her new dress. Yet she could\nnot tear her eyes away from the trunk. There was a magic in it that\nheld her enthralled. Had she been alone she would have begun to unpack\nit herself, nor even have asked the help of a servant to undo the\nknots. Now there was nothing left for her but to turn her eyes\nsorrowfully away from the fascinating object and take up another topic\nof conversation to which she would be utterly indifferent. But she\ncouldn't think of anything else to talk about. Mrs. Shaldin must have\nprepared herself beforehand. She must have suspected something. So now\nMrs. Zarubkin pinned her last hope to Abramka's inventiveness. She\nglanced at the clock.\n\n\"Dear me,\" she exclaimed, as if surprised at the lateness of the hour.\n\"I must be going. I don't want to disturb you any longer either,\ndearest. You must be very tired. I hope you rest well.\"\n\nShe shook hands with Mrs. Shaldin, kissed her and left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbramka Stiftik had just taken off his coat and was doing some ironing\nin his shirt sleeves, when a peculiar figure appeared in his shop. It\nwas that of a stocky orderly in a well-worn uniform without buttons\nand old galoshes instead of boots. His face was gloomy-looking and was\ncovered with a heavy growth of hair. Abramka knew this figure well. It\nseemed always just to have been awakened from the deepest sleep.\n\n\"Ah, Shuchok, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Shaldin would like you to call upon her,\" said Shuchok. He\nbehaved as if he had come on a terribly serious mission.\n\n\"Ah, that's so, your lady has come back. I heard about it. You see I\nam very busy. Still you may tell her I am coming right away. I just\nwant to finish ironing Mrs. Konopotkin's dress.\"\n\nAbramka simply wanted to keep up appearances, as always when he was\nsent for. But his joy at the summons to Mrs. Shaldin was so great that\nto the astonishment of his helpers and Shuchok he left immediately.\n\nHe found Mrs. Shaldin alone. She had not slept well the two nights\nbefore and had risen late that morning. Her husband had left long\nbefore for the Military Hospital. She was sitting beside her open\ntrunk taking her things out very carefully.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Shaldin? Welcome back to Chmyrsk. I congratulate\nyou on your happy arrival.\"\n\n\"Oh, how do you do, Abramka?\" said Mrs. Shaldin delightedly; \"we\nhaven't seen each other for a long time, have we? I was rather\nhomesick for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Shaldin, you must have had a very good time abroad. But what\ndo you need me for? You certainly brought a dress back with you?\"\n\n\"Abramka always comes in handy,\" said Mrs. Shaldin jestingly. \"We\nladies of the regiment are quite helpless without Abramka. Take a\nseat.\"\n\nAbramka seated himself. He felt much more at ease in Mrs. Shaldin's\nhome than in Mrs. Zarubkin's. Mrs. Shaldin did not order her clothes\nfrom Moscow. She was a steady customer of his. In this room he had\nmany a time circled about the doctor's wife with a yard measure, pins,\nchalk and scissors, had kneeled down beside her, raised himself to his\nfeet, bent over again and stood puzzling over some difficult problem\nof dressmaking--how low to cut the dress out at the neck, how long to\nmake the train, how wide the hem, and so on. None of the ladies of the\nregiment ordered as much from him as Mrs. Shaldin. Her grandmother\nwould send her material from Kiev or the doctor would go on a\nprofessional trip to Chernigov and always bring some goods back with\nhim; or sometimes her aunt in Voronesh would make her a gift of some\nsilk.\n\n\"Abramka is always ready to serve Mrs. Shaldin first,\" said the\ntailor, though seized with a little pang, as if bitten by a guilty\nconscience.\n\n\"Are you sure you are telling the truth? Is Abramka always to be\ndepended upon? Eh, is he?\" She looked at him searchingly from beneath\ndrooping lids.\n\n\"What a question,\" rejoined Abramka. His face quivered slightly. His\nfeeling of discomfort was waxing. \"Has Abramka ever--\"\n\n\"Oh, things can happen. But, all right, never mind. I brought a dress\nalong with me. I had to have it made in a great hurry, and there is\njust a little more to be done on it. Now if I give you this dress to\nfinish, can I be sure that you positively won't tell another soul how\nit is made?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Shaldin, oh, Mrs. Shaldin,\" said Abramka reproachfully.\nNevertheless, the expression of his face was not so reassuring as\nusual.\n\n\"You give me your word of honour?\"\n\n\"Certainly! My name isn't Abramka Stiftik if I--\"\n\n\"Well, all right, I will trust you. But be careful. You know of whom\nyou must be careful?\"\n\n\"Who is that, Mrs. Shaldin?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know very well whom I mean. No, you needn't put your hand on\nyour heart. She was here to see me yesterday and tried in every way\nshe could to find out how my dress is made. But she couldn't get it\nout of me.\" Abramka sighed. Mrs. Shaldin seemed to suspect his\nbetrayal. \"I am right, am I not? She has not had her dress made yet,\nhas she? She waited to see my dress, didn't she? And she told you to\ncopy the style, didn't she?\" Mrs, Shaldin asked with honest na�vet�.\n\"But I warn you, Abramka, if you give away the least little thing\nabout my dress, then all is over between you and me. Remember that.\"\n\nAbramka's hand went to his heart again, and the gesture carried the\nsame sense of conviction as of old.\n\n\"Mrs. Shaldin, how can you speak like that?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\nMrs. Shaldin left the room. About ten minutes passed during which\nAbramka had plenty of time to reflect. How could he have given the\ncaptain's wife a promise like that so lightly? What was the captain's\nwife to him as compared with the doctor's wife? Mrs. Zarubkin had\nnever given him a really decent order--just a few things for the house\nand some mending. Supposing he were now to perform this great service\nfor her, would that mean that he could depend upon her for the future?\nWas any woman to be depended upon? She would wear this dress out and\ngo back to ordering her clothes from Moscow again. But _Mrs. Shaldin_,\nshe was very different. He could forgive her having brought this one\ndress along from abroad. What woman in Russia would have refrained,\nwhen abroad, from buying a new dress? Mrs. Shaldin would continue to\nbe his steady customer all the same.\n\nThe door opened. Abramka rose involuntarily, and clasped his hands in\nastonishment.\n\n\"Well,\" he exclaimed rapturously, \"that is a dress, that is--My, my!\"\nHe was so stunned he could find nothing more to say. And how charming\nMrs. Shaldin looked in her wonderful gown! Her tall slim figure seemed\nto have been made for it. What simple yet elegant lines. At first\nglance you would think it was nothing more than an ordinary\nhouse-gown, but only at first glance. If you looked at it again, you\ncould tell right away that it met all the requirements of a fancy\nball-gown. What struck Abramka most was that it had no waist line,\nthat it did not consist of bodice and skirt. That was strange. It was\njust caught lightly together under the bosom, which it brought out in\nrelief. Draped over the whole was a sort of upper garment of exquisite\nold-rose lace embroidered with large silk flowers, which fell from the\nshoulders and broadened out in bold superb lines. The dress was cut\nlow and edged with a narrow strip of black down around the bosom,\naround the bottom of the lace drapery, and around the hem of the\nskirt. A wonderful fan of feathers to match the down edging gave the\nfinishing touch.\n\n\"Well, how do you like it, Abramka!\" asked Mrs. Shaldin with a\ntriumphant smile.\n\n\"Glorious, glorious! I haven't the words at my command. What a dress!\nNo, I couldn't make a dress like that. And how beautifully it fits\nyou, as if you had been born in it, Mrs. Shaldin. What do you call the\nstyle?\"\n\n\"Empire.\"\n\n\"Ampeer?\" he queried. \"Is that a new style? Well, well, what people\ndon't think of. Tailors like us might just as well throw our needles\nand scissors away.\"\n\n\"Now, listen, Abramka, I wouldn't have shown it to you if there were\nnot this sewing to be done on it. You are the only one who will have\nseen it before the ball. I am not even letting my husband look at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Shaldin, you can rely upon me as upon a rock. But after the\nball may I copy it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, after the ball copy it as much as you please, but not now,\nnot for anything in the world.\"\n\nThere were no doubts in Abramka's mind when he left the doctor's\nhouse. He had arrived at his decision. That superb creation had\nconquered him. It would be a piece of audacity on his part, he felt,\neven to think of imitating such a gown. Why, it was not a gown. It was\na dream, a fantastic vision--without a bodice, without puffs or frills\nor tawdry trimmings of any sort. Simplicity itself and yet so chic.\n\nBack in his shop he opened the package of fashion-plates that had just\narrived from Kiev. He turned the pages and stared in astonishment.\nWhat was that? Could he trust his eyes? An Empire gown. There it was,\nwith the broad voluptuous drapery of lace hanging from the shoulders\nand the edging of down. Almost exactly the same thing as Mrs.\nShaldin's.\n\nHe glanced up and saw Semyonov outside the window. He had certainly\ncome to fetch him to the captain's wife, who must have ordered him to\nwatch the tailor's movements, and must have learned that he had just\nbeen at Mrs. Shaldin's. Semyonov entered and told him his mistress\nwanted to see him right away.\n\nAbramka slammed the fashion magazine shut as if afraid that Semyonov\nmight catch a glimpse of the new Empire fashion and give the secret\naway.\n\n\"I will come immediately,\" he said crossly.\n\nHe picked up his fashion plates, put the yard measure in his pocket,\nrammed his silk hat sorrowfully on his head and set off for the\ncaptain's house. He found Mrs. Zarubkin pacing the room excitedly,\ngreeted her, but carefully avoided meeting her eyes.\n\n\"Well, what did you find out?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Mrs. Zarubkin,\" said Abramka dejectedly. \"Unfortunately I\ncouldn't find out a thing.\"\n\n\"Idiot! I have no patience with you. Where are the fashion plates?\"\n\n\"Here, Mrs. Zarubkin.\"\n\nShe turned the pages, looked at one picture after the other, and\nsuddenly her eyes shone and her cheeks reddened.\n\n\"Oh, Empire! The very thing. Empire is the very latest. Make this one\nfor me,\" she cried commandingly.\n\nAbramka turned pale.\n\n\"Ampeer, Mrs. Zarubkin? I can't make that Ampeer dress for you,\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the captain's wife, giving him a searching look.\n\n\"Because--because--I can't.\"\n\n\"Oh--h--h, you can't? You know why you can't. Because that is the\nstyle of Mrs. Shaldin's dress. So that is the reliability you boast so\nabout? Great!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Zarubkin, I will make any other dress you choose, but it is\nabsolutely impossible for me to make this one.\"\n\n\"I don't need your fashion plates, do you hear me? Get out of here,\nand don't ever show your face again.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Zarubkin, I--\"\n\n\"Get out of here,\" repeated the captain's wife, quite beside herself.\n\nThe poor tailor stuck his yard measure, which he had already taken\nout, back into his pocket and left.\n\nHalf an hour later the captain's wife was entering a train for Kiev,\ncarrying a large package which contained material for a dress. The\ncaptain had accompanied her to the station with a pucker in his\nforehead. That was five days before the ball.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the ball two expensive Empire gowns stood out conspicuously from\namong the more or less elegant gowns which had been finished in the\nshop of Abramka Stiftik, Ladies' Tailor. The one gown adorned Mrs.\nShaldin's figure, the other the figure of the captain's wife.\n\nMrs. Zarubkin had bought her gown ready made at Kiev, and had returned\nonly two hours before the beginning of the ball. She had scarcely had\ntime to dress. Perhaps it would have been better had she not appeared\nat this one of the annual balls, had she not taken that fateful trip\nto Kiev. For in comparison with the make and style of Mrs. Shaldin's\ndress, which had been brought abroad, hers was like the botched\nimitation of an amateur.\n\nThat was evident to everybody, though the captain's wife had her\nlittle group of partisans, who maintained with exaggerated eagerness\nthat she looked extraordinarily fascinating in her dress and Mrs.\nShaldin still could not rival her. But there was no mistaking it,\nthere was little justice in this contention. Everybody knew better;\nwhat was worst of all, Mrs. Zarubkin herself knew better. Mrs.\nShaldin's triumph was complete.\n\nThe two ladies gave each other the same friendly smiles as always, but\none of them was experiencing the fine disdain and the derision of the\nconqueror, while the other was burning inside with the furious\nresentment of a dethroned goddess--goddess of the annual ball.\n\nFrom that time on Abramka cautiously avoided passing the captain's\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SERVANT\n\n\n\nBY S.T. SEMYONOV\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nGerasim returned to Moscow just at a time when it was hardest to find\nwork, a short while before Christmas, when a man sticks even to a poor\njob in the expectation of a present. For three weeks the peasant lad\nhad been going about in vain seeking a position.\n\nHe stayed with relatives and friends from his village, and although he\nhad not yet suffered great want, it disheartened him that he, a strong\nyoung man, should go without work.\n\nGerasim had lived in Moscow from early boyhood. When still a mere\nchild, he had gone to work in a brewery as bottle-washer, and later as\na lower servant in a house. In the last two years he had been in a\nmerchant's employ, and would still have held that position, had he not\nbeen summoned back to his village for military duty. However, he had\nnot been drafted. It seemed dull to him in the village, he was not\nused to the country life, so he decided he would rather count the\nstones in Moscow than stay there.\n\nEvery minute it was getting to be more and more irk-some for him to be\ntramping the streets in idleness. Not a stone did he leave unturned in\nhis efforts to secure any sort of work. He plagued all of his\nacquaintances, he even held up people on the street and asked them if\nthey knew of a situation--all in vain.\n\nFinally Gerasim could no longer bear being a burden on his people.\nSome of them were annoyed by his coming to them; and others had\nsuffered unpleasantness from their masters on his account. He was\naltogether at a loss what to do. Sometimes he would go a whole day\nwithout eating.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nOne day Gerasim betook himself to a friend from his village, who lived\nat the extreme outer edge of Moscow, near Sokolnik. The man was\ncoachman to a merchant by the name of Sharov, in whose service he had\nbeen for many years. He had ingratiated himself with his master, so\nthat Sharov trusted him absolutely and gave every sign of holding him\nin high favour. It was the man's glib tongue, chiefly, that had gained\nhim his master's confidence. He told on all the servants, and Sharov\nvalued him for it.\n\nGerasim approached and greeted him. The coachman gave his guest a\nproper reception, served him with tea and something to eat, and asked\nhim how he was doing.\n\n\"Very badly, Yegor Danilych,\" said Gerasim. \"I've been without a job\nfor weeks.\"\n\n\"Didn't you ask your old employer to take you back?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't take you again?\"\n\n\"The position was filled already.\"\n\n\"That's it. That's the way you young fellows are. You serve your\nemployers so-so, and when you leave your jobs, you usually have\nmuddied up the way back to them. You ought to serve your masters so\nthat they will think a lot of you, and when you come again, they will\nnot refuse you, but rather dismiss the man who has taken your place.\"\n\n\"How can a man do that? In these days there aren't any employers like\nthat, and we aren't exactly angels, either.\"\n\n\"What's the use of wasting words? I just want to tell you about\nmyself. If for some reason or other I should ever have to leave this\nplace and go home, not only would Mr. Sharov, if I came back, take me\non again without a word, but he would be glad to, too.\"\n\nGerasim sat there downcast. He saw his friend was boasting, and it\noccurred to him to gratify him.\n\n\"I know it,\" he said. \"But it's hard to find men like you, Yegor\nDanilych. If you were a poor worker, your master would not have kept\nyou twelve years.\"\n\nYegor smiled. He liked the praise.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"If you were to live and serve as I do, you\nwouldn't be out of work for months and months.\"\n\nGerasim made no reply.\n\nYegor was summoned to his master.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" he said to Gerasim. \"I'll be right back.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nYegor came back and reported that inside of half an hour he would have\nto have the horses harnessed, ready to drive his master to town. He\nlighted his pipe and took several turns in the room. Then he came to a\nhalt in front of Gerasim.\n\n\"Listen, my boy,\" he said, \"if you want, I'll ask my master to take\nyou as a servant here.\"\n\n\"Does he need a man?\"\n\n\"We have one, but he's not much good. He's getting old, and it's very\nhard for him to do the work. It's lucky for us that the neighbourhood\nisn't a lively one and the police don't make a fuss about things being\nkept just so, else the old man couldn't manage to keep the place clean\nenough for them.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you can, then please do say a word for me, Yegor Danilych.\nI'll pray for you all my life. I can't stand being without work any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll speak for you. Come again to-morrow, and in the\nmeantime take this ten-kopek piece. It may come in handy.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Yegor Danilych. Then you _will_ try for me? Please do me the\nfavour.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll try for you.\"\n\nGerasim left, and Yegor harnessed up his horses. Then he put on his\ncoachman's habit, and drove up to the front door. Mr. Sharov stepped\nout of the house, seated himself in the sleigh, and the horses\ngalloped off. He attended to his business in town and returned home.\nYegor, observing that his master was in a good humour, said to him:\n\n\"Yegor Fiodorych, I have a favour to ask of you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"There's a young man from my village here, a good boy. He's without a\njob.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you take him?\"\n\n\"What do I want him for?\"\n\n\"Use him as man of all work round the place.\"\n\n\"How about Polikarpych?\"\n\n\"What good is he? It's about time you dismissed him.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be fair. He has been with me so many years. I can't let\nhim go just so, without any cause.\"\n\n\"Supposing he _has_ worked for you for years. He didn't work for\nnothing. He got paid for it. He's certainly saved up a few dollars for\nhis old age.\"\n\n\"Saved up! How could he? From what? He's not alone in the world. He\nhas a wife to support, and she has to eat and drink also.\"\n\n\"His wife earns money, too, at day's work as charwoman.\"\n\n\"A lot she could have made! Enough for _kvas_.\"\n\n\"Why should you care about Polikarpych and his wife? To tell you the\ntruth, he's a very poor servant. Why should you throw your money away\non him? He never shovels the snow away on time, or does anything\nright. And when it comes his turn to be night watchman, he slips away\nat least ten times a night. It's too cold for him. You'll see, some\nday, because of him, you will have trouble with the police. The\nquarterly inspector will descend on us, and it won't be so agreeable\nfor you to be responsible for Polikarpych.\"\n\n\"Still, it's pretty rough. He's been with me fifteen years. And to\ntreat him that way in his old age--it would be a sin.\"\n\n\"A sin! Why, what harm would you be doing him? He won't starve. He'll\ngo to the almshouse. It will be better for him, too, to be quiet in\nhis old age.\"\n\nSharov reflected.\n\n\"All right,\" he said finally. \"Bring your friend here. I'll see what I\ncan do.\"\n\n\"Do take him, sir. I'm so sorry for him. He's a good boy, and he's\nbeen without work for such a long time. I know he'll do his work well\nand serve you faithfully. On account of having to report for military\nduty, he lost his last position. If it hadn't been for that, his\nmaster would never have let him go.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe next evening Gerasim came again and asked:\n\n\"Well, could you do anything for me?\"\n\n\"Something, I believe. First let's have some tea. Then we'll go see my\nmaster.\"\n\nEven tea had no allurements for Gerasim. He was eager for a decision;\nbut under the compulsion of politeness to his host, he gulped down two\nglasses of tea, and then they betook themselves to Sharov.\n\nSharov asked Gerasim where he had lived before and what work he could\ndo. Then he told him he was prepared to engage him as man of all work,\nand he should come back the next day ready to take the place.\n\nGerasim was fairly stunned by the great stroke of fortune. So\noverwhelming was his joy that his legs would scarcely carry him. He\nwent to the coachman's room, and Yegor said to him:\n\n\"Well, my lad, see to it that you do your work right, so that I shan't\nhave to be ashamed of you. You know what masters are like. If you go\nwrong once, they'll be at you forever after with their fault-finding,\nand never give you peace.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that, Yegor Danilych.\"\n\n\"Well--well.\"\n\nGerasim took leave, crossing the yard to go out by the gate.\nPolikarpych's rooms gave on the yard, and a broad beam of light from\nthe window fell across Gerasim's way. He was curious to get a glimpse\nof his future home, but the panes were all frosted over, and it was\nimpossible to peep through. However, he could hear what the people\ninside were saying.\n\n\"What will we do now?\" was said in a woman's voice.\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know,\" a man, undoubtedly Polikarpych, replied.\n\"Go begging, I suppose.\"\n\n\"That's all we can do. There's nothing else left,\" said the woman.\n\"Oh, we poor people, what a miserable life we lead. We work and work\nfrom early morning till late at night, day after day, and when we get\nold, then it's, 'Away with you!'\"\n\n\"What can we do? Our master is not one of us. It wouldn't be worth the\nwhile to say much to him about it. He cares only for his own\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"All the masters are so mean. They don't think of any one but\nthemselves. It doesn't occur to them that we work for them honestly\nand faithfully for years, and use up our best strength in their\nservice. They're afraid to keep us a year longer, even though we've\ngot all the strength we need to do their work. If we weren't strong\nenough, we'd go of our own accord.\"\n\n\"The master's not so much to blame as his coachman. Yegor Danilych\nwants to get a good position for his friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's a serpent. He knows how to wag his tongue. You wait, you\nfoul-mouthed beast, I'll get even with you. I'll go straight to the\nmaster and tell him how the fellow deceives him, how he steals the hay\nand fodder. I'll put it down in writing, and he can convince himself\nhow the fellow lies about us all.\"\n\n\"Don't, old woman. Don't sin.\"\n\n\"Sin? Isn't what I said all true? I know to a dot what I'm saying, and\nI mean to tell it straight out to the master. He should see with his\nown eyes. Why not? What can we do now anyhow? Where shall we go? He's\nruined us, ruined us.\"\n\nThe old woman burst out sobbing.\n\nGerasim heard all that, and it stabbed him like a dagger. He realised\nwhat misfortune he would be bringing the old people, and it made him\nsick at heart. He stood there a long while, saddened, lost in thought,\nthen he turned and went back into the coachman's room.\n\n\"Ah, you forgot something?\"\n\n\"No, Yegor Danilych.\" Gerasim stammered out, \"I've come--listen--I\nwant to thank you ever and ever so much--for the way you received\nme--and--and all the trouble you took for me--but--I can't take the\nplace.\"\n\n\"What! What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I don't want the place. I will look for another one for\nmyself.\"\n\nYegor flew into a rage.\n\n\"Did you mean to make a fool of me, did you, you idiot? You come here\nso meek--'Try for me, do try for me'--and then you refuse to take the\nplace. You rascal, you have disgraced me!\"\n\nGerasim found nothing to say in reply. He reddened, and lowered his\neyes. Yegor turned his back scornfully and said nothing more.\n\nThen Gerasim quietly picked up his cap and left the coachman's room.\nHe crossed the yard rapidly, went out by the gate, and hurried off\ndown the street. He felt happy and lighthearted.\n\n\n\n\nONE AUTUMN NIGHT\n\n\n\nBY MAXIM GORKY\n\n\nOnce in the autumn I happened to be in a very unpleasant and\ninconvenient position. In the town where I had just arrived and where\nI knew not a soul, I found myself without a farthing in my pocket and\nwithout a night's lodging.\n\nHaving sold during the first few days every part of my costume without\nwhich it was still possible to go about, I passed from the town into\nthe quarter called \"Yste,\" where were the steamship wharves--a quarter\nwhich during the navigation season fermented with boisterous,\nlaborious life, but now was silent and deserted, for we were in the\nlast days of October.\n\nDragging my feet along the moist sand, and obstinately scrutinising it\nwith the desire to discover in it any sort of fragment of food, I\nwandered alone among the deserted buildings and warehouses, and\nthought how good it would be to get a full meal.\n\nIn our present state of culture hunger of the mind is more quickly\nsatisfied than hunger of the body. You wander about the streets, you\nare surrounded by buildings not bad-looking from the outside and--you\nmay safely say it--not so badly furnished inside, and the sight of\nthem may excite within you stimulating ideas about architecture,\nhygiene, and many other wise and high-flying subjects. You may meet\nwarmly and neatly dressed folks--all very polite, and turning away\nfrom you tactfully, not wishing offensively to notice the lamentable\nfact of your existence. Well, well, the mind of a hungry man is always\nbetter nourished and healthier than the mind of the well-fed man; and\nthere you have a situation from which you may draw a very ingenious\nconclusion in favour of the ill fed.\n\nThe evening was approaching, the rain was falling, and the wind blew\nviolently from the north. It whistled in the empty booths and shops,\nblew into the plastered window-panes of the taverns, and whipped into\nfoam the wavelets of the river which splashed noisily on the sandy\nshore, casting high their white crests, racing one after another into\nthe dim distance, and leaping impetuously over one another's\nshoulders. It seemed as if the river felt the proximity of winter, and\nwas running at random away from the fetters of ice which the north\nwind might well have flung upon her that very night. The sky was heavy\nand dark; down from it swept incessantly scarcely visible drops of\nrain, and the melancholy elegy in nature all around me was emphasised\nby a couple of battered and misshapen willow-trees and a boat, bottom\nupwards, that was fastened to their roots.\n\nThe overturned canoe with its battered keel and the miserable old\ntrees rifled by the cold wind--everything around me was bankrupt,\nbarren, and dead, and the sky flowed with undryable tears...\nEverything around was waste and gloomy ... it seemed as if everything\nwere dead, leaving me alone among the living, and for me also a cold\ndeath waited.\n\nI was then eighteen years old--a good time!\n\nI walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering\nteeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was\ncarefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty\ncrates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in\nwoman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping\nshoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It\nappeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her\nhands--digging away under one of the crates.\n\n\"Why are you doing that?\" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite\nclose to her.\n\nShe gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that\nshe stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of\nterror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very\npleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks.\nThis spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a\nremarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal\nsize--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just\nover the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of\nan artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human\nphysiognomy.\n\nThe girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died\nout... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton\nhead-gear, cowered down, and said:\n\n\"I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are\ntired. Over there\"--she nodded her head in the direction of a\nbooth--\"there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth\nis still carrying on business.\"\n\nI began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat\ndown beside me and began to help me.\n\nWe worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that\nmoment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all\nthe other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced\npersons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to\nkeep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently\nI was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely\nforgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be\ninside that crate?\n\nThe evening drew on. The grey, mouldy, cold fog grew thicker and\nthicker around us. The waves roared with a hollower sound than before,\nand the rain pattered down on the boards of that crate more loudly and\nmore frequently. Somewhere or other the night-watchman began springing\nhis rattle.\n\n\"Has it got a bottom or not?\" softly inquired my assistant. I did not\nunderstand what she was talking about, and I kept silence.\n\n\"I say, has the crate got a bottom? If it has we shall try in vain to\nbreak into it. Here we are digging a trench, and we may, after all,\ncome upon nothing but solid boards. How shall we take them off? Better\nsmash the lock; it is a wretched lock.\"\n\nGood ideas rarely visit the heads of women, but, as you see, they do\nvisit them sometimes. I have always valued good ideas, and have always\ntried to utilise them as far as possible.\n\nHaving found the lock, I tugged at it and wrenched off the whole\nthing. My accomplice immediately stooped down and wriggled like a\nserpent into the gaping-open, four cornered cover of the crate whence\nshe called to me approvingly, in a low tone:\n\n\"You're a brick!\"\n\nNowadays a little crumb of praise from a woman is dearer to me than a\nwhole dithyramb from a man, even though he be more eloquent than all\nthe ancient and modern orators put together. Then, however, I was less\namiably disposed than I am now, and, paying no attention to the\ncompliment of my comrade, I asked her curtly and anxiously:\n\n\"Is there anything?\"\n\nIn a monotonous tone she set about calculating our discoveries.\n\n\"A basketful of bottles--thick furs--a sunshade--an iron pail.\"\n\nAll this was uneatable. I felt that my hopes had vanished... But\nsuddenly she exclaimed vivaciously:\n\n\"Aha! here it is!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Bread ... a loaf ... it's only wet ... take it!\"\n\nA loaf flew to my feet and after it herself, my valiant comrade. I had\nalready bitten off a morsel, stuffed it in my mouth, and was chewing\nit...\n\n\"Come, give me some too!... And we mustn't stay here... Where shall we\ngo?\" she looked inquiringly about on all sides... It was dark, wet,\nand boisterous.\n\n\"Look! there's an upset canoe yonder ... let us go there.\"\n\n\"Let us go then!\" And off we set, demolishing our booty as we went,\nand filling our mouths with large portions of it... The rain grew more\nviolent, the river roared; from somewhere or other resounded a\nprolonged mocking whistle--just as if Someone great who feared nobody\nwas whistling down all earthly institutions and along with them this\nhorrid autumnal wind and us its heroes. This whistling made my heart\nthrob painfully, in spite of which I greedily went on eating, and in\nthis respect the girl, walking on my left hand, kept even pace with\nme.\n\n\"What do they call you?\" I asked her--why I know not.\n\n\"Natasha,\" she answered shortly, munching loudly.\n\nI stared at her. My heart ached within me; and then I stared into the\nmist before me, and it seemed to me as if the inimical countenance of\nmy Destiny was smiling at me enigmatically and coldly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rain scourged the timbers of the skiff incessantly, and its soft\npatter induced melancholy thoughts, and the wind whistled as it flew\ndown into the boat's battered bottom through a rift, where some loose\nsplinters of wood were rattling together--a disquieting and depressing\nsound. The waves of the river were splashing on the shore, and sounded\nso monotonous and hopeless, just as if they were telling something\nunbearably dull and heavy, which was boring them into utter disgust,\nsomething from which they wanted to run away and yet were obliged to\ntalk about all the same. The sound of the rain blended with their\nsplashing, and a long-drawn sigh seemed to be floating above the\noverturned skiff--the endless, labouring sigh of the earth, injured\nand exhausted by the eternal changes from the bright and warm summer\nto the cold misty and damp autumn. The wind blew continually over the\ndesolate shore and the foaming river--blew and sang its melancholy\nsongs...\n\nOur position beneath the shelter of the skiff was utterly devoid of\ncomfort; it was narrow and damp, tiny cold drops of rain dribbled\nthrough the damaged bottom; gusts of wind penetrated it. We sat in\nsilence and shivered with cold. I remembered that I wanted to go to\nsleep. Natasha leaned her back against the hull of the boat and curled\nherself up into a tiny ball. Embracing her knees with her hands, and\nresting her chin upon them, she stared doggedly at the river with\nwide-open eyes; on the pale patch of her face they seemed immense,\nbecause of the blue marks below them. She never moved, and this\nimmobility and silence--I felt it--gradually produced within me a\nterror of my neighbour. I wanted to talk to her, but I knew not how to\nbegin.\n\nIt was she herself who spoke.\n\n\"What a cursed thing life is!\" she exclaimed plainly, abstractedly,\nand in a tone of deep conviction.\n\nBut this was no complaint. In these words there was too much of\nindifference for a complaint. This simple soul thought according to\nher understanding--thought and proceeded to form a certain conclusion\nwhich she expressed aloud, and which I could not confute for fear of\ncontradicting myself. Therefore I was silent, and she, as if she had\nnot noticed me, continued to sit there immovable.\n\n\"Even if we croaked ... what then...?\" Natasha began again, this time\nquietly and reflectively, and still there was not one note of\ncomplaint in her words. It was plain that this person, in the course\nof her reflections on life, was regarding her own case, and had\narrived at the conviction that in order to preserve herself from the\nmockeries of life, she was not in a position to do anything else but\nsimply \"croak\"--to use her own expression.\n\nThe clearness of this line of thought was inexpressibly sad and\npainful to me, and I felt that if I kept silence any longer I was\nreally bound to weep... And it would have been shameful to have done\nthis before a woman, especially as she was not weeping herself. I\nresolved to speak to her.\n\n\"Who was it that knocked you about?\" I asked. For the moment I could\nnot think of anything more sensible or more delicate.\n\n\"Pashka did it all,\" she answered in a dull and level tone.\n\n\"And who is he?\"\n\n\"My lover... He was a baker.\"\n\n\"Did he beat you often?\"\n\n\"Whenever he was drunk he beat me... Often!\"\n\nAnd suddenly, turning towards me, she began to talk about herself,\nPashka, and their mutual relations. He was a baker with red moustaches\nand played very well on the banjo. He came to see her and greatly\npleased her, for he was a merry chap and wore nice clean clothes. He\nhad a vest which cost fifteen rubles and boots with dress tops. For\nthese reasons she had fallen in love with him, and he became her\n\"creditor.\" And when he became her creditor he made it his business to\ntake away from her the money which her other friends gave to her for\nbonbons, and, getting drunk on this money, he would fall to beating\nher; but that would have been nothing if he hadn't also begun to \"run\nafter\" other girls before her very eyes.\n\n\"Now, wasn't that an insult? I am not worse than the others. Of course\nthat meant that he was laughing at me, the blackguard. The day before\nyesterday I asked leave of my mistress to go out for a bit, went to\nhim, and there I found Dimka sitting beside him drunk. And he, too,\nwas half seas over. I said, 'You scoundrel, you!' And he gave me a\nthorough hiding. He kicked me and dragged me by the hair. But that was\nnothing to what came after. He spoiled everything I had on--left me\njust as I am now! How could I appear before my mistress? He spoiled\neverything ... my dress and my jacket too--it was quite a new one; I\ngave a fiver for it ... and tore my kerchief from my head... Oh, Lord!\nWhat will become of me now?\" she suddenly whined in a lamentable\noverstrained voice.\n\nThe wind howled, and became ever colder and more boisterous... Again\nmy teeth began to dance up and down, and she, huddled up to avoid the\ncold, pressed as closely to me as she could, so that I could see the\ngleam of her eyes through the darkness.\n\n\"What wretches all you men are! I'd burn you all in an oven; I'd cut\nyou in pieces. If any one of you was dying I'd spit in his mouth, and\nnot pity him a bit. Mean skunks! You wheedle and wheedle, you wag your\ntails like cringing dogs, and we fools give ourselves up to you, and\nit's all up with us! Immediately you trample us underfoot... Miserable\nloafers\"\n\nShe cursed us up and down, but there was no vigour, no malice, no\nhatred of these \"miserable loafers\" in her cursing that I could hear.\nThe tone of her language by no means corresponded with its\nsubject-matter, for it was calm enough, and the gamut of her voice was\nterribly poor.\n\nYet all this made a stronger impression on me than the most eloquent\nand convincing pessimistic books and speeches, of which I had read a\ngood many and which I still read to this day. And this, you see, was\nbecause the agony of a dying person is much more natural and violent\nthan the most minute and picturesque descriptions of death.\n\nI felt really wretched--more from cold than from the words of my\nneighbour. I groaned softly and ground my teeth.\n\nAlmost at the same moment I felt two little arms about me--one of them\ntouched my neck and the other lay upon my face--and at the same time\nan anxious, gentle, friendly voice uttered the question:\n\n\"What ails you?\"\n\nI was ready to believe that some one else was asking me this and not\nNatasha, who had just declared that all men were scoundrels, and\nexpressed a wish for their destruction. But she it was, and now she\nbegan speaking quickly, hurriedly.\n\n\"What ails you, eh? Are you cold? Are you frozen? Ah, what a one you\nare, sitting there so silent like a little owl! Why, you should have\ntold me long ago that you were cold. Come ... lie on the ground ...\nstretch yourself out and I will lie ... there! How's that? Now put\nyour arms round me?... tighter! How's that? You shall be warm very\nsoon now... And then we'll lie back to back... The night will pass so\nquickly, see if it won't. I say ... have you too been drinking?...\nTurned out of your place, eh?... It doesn't matter.\"\n\nAnd she comforted me... She encouraged me.\n\nMay I be thrice accursed! What a world of irony was in this single\nfact for me! Just imagine! Here was I, seriously occupied at this very\ntime with the destiny of humanity, thinking of the re-organisation of\nthe social system, of political revolutions, reading all sorts of\ndevilishly-wise books whose abysmal profundity was certainly\nunfathomable by their very authors--at this very time, I say, I was\ntrying with all my might to make of myself \"a potent active social\nforce.\" It even seemed to me that I had partially accomplished my\nobject; anyhow, at this time, in my ideas about myself, I had got so\nfar as to recognise that I had an exclusive right to exist, that I had\nthe necessary greatness to deserve to live my life, and that I was\nfully competent to play a great historical part therein. And a woman\nwas now warming me with her body, a wretched, battered, hunted\ncreature, who had no place and no value in life, and whom I had never\nthought of helping till she helped me herself, and whom I really would\nnot have known how to help in any way even if the thought of it had\noccurred to me.\n\nAh! I was ready to think that all this was happening to me in a\ndream--in a disagreeable, an oppressive dream.\n\nBut, ugh! it was impossible for me to think that, for cold drops of\nrain were dripping down upon me, the woman was pressing close to me,\nher warm breath was fanning my face, and--despite a slight odor of\nvodka--it did me good. The wind howled and raged, the rain smote upon\nthe skiff, the waves splashed, and both of us, embracing each other\nconvulsively, nevertheless shivered with cold. All this was only too\nreal, and I am certain that nobody ever dreamed such an oppressive and\nhorrid dream as that reality.\n\nBut Natasha was talking all the time of something or other, talking\nkindly and sympathetically, as only women can talk. Beneath the\ninfluence of her voice and kindly words a little fire began to burn up\nwithin me, and something inside my heart thawed in consequence.\n\nThen tears poured from my eyes like a hailstorm, washing away from my\nheart much that was evil, much that was stupid, much sorrow and dirt\nwhich had fastened upon it before that night. Natasha comforted me.\n\n\"Come, come, that will do, little one! Don't take on! That'll do! God\nwill give you another chance ... you will right yourself and stand in\nyour proper place again ... and it will be all right...\"\n\nAnd she kept kissing me ... many kisses did she give me ... burning\nkisses ... and all for nothing...\n\nThose were the first kisses from a woman that had ever been bestowed\nupon me, and they were the best kisses too, for all the subsequent\nkisses cost me frightfully dear, and really gave me nothing at all in\nexchange.\n\n\"Come, don't take on so, funny one! I'll manage for you to-morrow if\nyou cannot find a place.\" Her quiet persuasive whispering sounded in\nmy ears as if it came through a dream...\n\nThere we lay till dawn...\n\nAnd when the dawn came, we crept from behind the skiff and went into\nthe town... Then we took friendly leave of each other and never met\nagain, although for half a year I searched in every hole and corner\nfor that kind Natasha, with whom I spent the autumn night just\ndescribed.\n\nIf she be already dead--and well for her if it were so--may she rest\nin peace! And if she be alive ... still I say \"Peace to her soul!\" And\nmay the consciousness of her fall never enter her soul ... for that\nwould be a superfluous and fruitless suffering if life is to be\nlived...\n\n\n\n\nHER LOVER\n\n\n\nBY MAXIM GORKY\n\n\nAn acquaintance of mine once told me the following story.\n\nWhen I was a student at Moscow I happened to live alongside one of\nthose ladies whose repute is questionable. She was a Pole, and they\ncalled her Teresa. She was a tallish, powerfully-built brunette, with\nblack, bushy eyebrows and a large coarse face as if carved out by a\nhatchet--the bestial gleam of her dark eyes, her thick bass voice, her\ncabman-like gait and her immense muscular vigour, worthy of a\nfishwife, inspired me with horror. I lived on the top flight and her\ngarret was opposite to mine. I never left my door open when I knew her\nto be at home. But this, after all, was a very rare occurrence.\nSometimes I chanced to meet her on the staircase or in the yard, and\nshe would smile upon me with a smile which seemed to me to be sly and\ncynical. Occasionally, I saw her drunk, with bleary eyes, tousled\nhair, and a particularly hideous grin. On such occasions she would\nspeak to me.\n\n\"How d'ye do, Mr. Student!\" and her stupid laugh would still further\nintensify my loathing of her. I should have liked to have changed my\nquarters in order to have avoided such encounters and greetings; but\nmy little chamber was a nice one, and there was such a wide view from\nthe window, and it was always so quiet in the street below--so I\nendured.\n\nAnd one morning I was sprawling on my couch, trying to find some sort\nof excuse for not attending my class, when the door opened, and the\nbass voice of Teresa the loathsome resounded from my threshold:\n\n\"Good health to you, Mr. Student!\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" I said. I saw that her face was confused and\nsupplicatory... It was a very unusual sort of face for her.\n\n\"Sir! I want to beg a favour of you. Will you grant it me?\"\n\nI lay there silent, and thought to myself:\n\n\"Gracious!... Courage, my boy!\"\n\n\"I want to send a letter home, that's what it is,\" she said; her voice\nwas beseeching, soft, timid.\n\n\"Deuce take you!\" I thought; but up I jumped, sat down at my table,\ntook a sheet of paper, and said:\n\n\"Come here, sit down, and dictate!\"\n\nShe came, sat down very gingerly on a chair, and looked at me with a\nguilty look.\n\n\"Well, to whom do you want to write?\"\n\n\"To Boleslav Kashput, at the town of Svieptziana, on the Warsaw\nRoad...\"\n\n\"Well, fire away!\"\n\n\"My dear Boles ... my darling ... my faithful lover. May the Mother of\nGod protect thee! Thou heart of gold, why hast thou not written for\nsuch a long time to thy sorrowing little dove, Teresa?\"\n\nI very nearly burst out laughing. \"A sorrowing little dove!\" more than\nfive feet high, with fists a stone and more in weight, and as black a\nface as if the little dove had lived all its life in a chimney, and\nhad never once washed itself! Restraining myself somehow, I asked:\n\n\"Who is this Bolest?\"\n\n\"Boles, Mr. Student,\" she said, as if offended with me for blundering\nover the name, \"he is Boles--my young man.\"\n\n\"Young man!\"\n\n\"Why are you so surprised, sir? Cannot I, a girl, have a young man?\"\n\nShe? A girl? Well!\n\n\"Oh, why not?\" I said. \"All things are possible. And has he been your\nyoung man long?\"\n\n\"Six years.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho!\" I thought. \"Well, let us write your letter...\"\n\nAnd I tell you plainly that I would willingly have changed places with\nthis Boles if his fair correspondent had been not Teresa but something\nless than she.\n\n\"I thank you most heartily, sir, for your kind services,\" said Teresa\nto me, with a curtsey. \"Perhaps _I_ can show _you_ some service, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I most humbly thank you all the same.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, sir, your shirts or your trousers may want a little\nmending?\"\n\nI felt that this mastodon in petticoats had made me grow quite red\nwith shame, and I told her pretty sharply that I had no need whatever\nof her services.\n\nShe departed.\n\nA week or two passed away. It was evening. I was sitting at my window\nwhistling and thinking of some expedient for enabling me to get away\nfrom myself. I was bored; the weather was dirty. I didn't want to go\nout, and out of sheer ennui I began a course of self-analysis and\nreflection. This also was dull enough work, but I didn't care about\ndoing anything else. Then the door opened. Heaven be praised! Some one\ncame in.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Student, you have no pressing business, I hope?\"\n\nIt was Teresa. Humph!\n\n\"No. What is it?\"\n\n\"I was going to ask you, sir, to write me another letter.\"\n\n\"Very well! To Boles, eh?\"\n\n\"No, this time it is from him.\"\n\n\"Wha-at?\"\n\n\"Stupid that I am! It is not for me, Mr. Student, I beg your pardon.\nIt is for a friend of mine, that is to say, not a friend but an\nacquaintance--a man acquaintance. He has a sweetheart just like me\nhere, Teresa. That's how it is. Will you, sir, write a letter to this\nTeresa?\"\n\nI looked at her--her face was troubled, her fingers were trembling. I\nwas a bit fogged at first--and then I guessed how it was.\n\n\"Look here, my lady,\" I said, \"there are no Boleses or Teresas at all,\nand you've been telling me a pack of lies. Don't you come sneaking\nabout me any longer. I have no wish whatever to cultivate your\nacquaintance. Do you understand?\"\n\nAnd suddenly she grew strangely terrified and distraught; she began to\nshift from foot to foot without moving from the place, and spluttered\ncomically, as if she wanted to say something and couldn't. I waited to\nsee what would come of all this, and I saw and felt that, apparently,\nI had made a great mistake in suspecting her of wishing to draw me\nfrom the path of righteousness. It was evidently something very\ndifferent.\n\n\"Mr. Student!\" she began, and suddenly, waving her hand, she turned\nabruptly towards the door and went out. I remained with a very\nunpleasant feeling in my mind. I listened. Her door was flung\nviolently to--plainly the poor wench was very angry... I thought it\nover, and resolved to go to her, and, inviting her to come in here,\nwrite everything she wanted.\n\nI entered her apartment. I looked round. She was sitting at the table,\nleaning on her elbows, with her head in her hands.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" I said.\n\nNow, whenever I come to this point in my story, I always feel horribly\nawkward and idiotic. Well, well!\n\n\"Listen to me,\" I said.\n\nShe leaped from her seat, came towards me with flashing eyes, and\nlaying her hands on my shoulders, began to whisper, or rather to hum\nin her peculiar bass voice:\n\n\"Look you, now! It's like this. There's no Boles at all, and there's\nno Teresa either. But what's that to you? Is it a hard thing for you\nto draw your pen over paper? Eh? Ah, and _you_, too! Still such a\nlittle fair-haired boy! There's nobody at all, neither Boles, nor\nTeresa, only me. There you have it, and much good may it do you!\"\n\n\"Pardon me!\" said I, altogether flabbergasted by such a reception,\n\"what is it all about? There's no Boles, you say?\"\n\n\"No. So it is.\"\n\n\"And no Teresa either?\"\n\n\"And no Teresa. I'm Teresa.\"\n\nI didn't understand it at all. I fixed my eyes upon her, and tried to\nmake out which of us was taking leave of his or her senses. But she\nwent again to the table, searched about for something, came back to\nme, and said in an offended tone:\n\n\"If it was so hard for you to write to Boles, look, there's your\nletter, take it! Others will write for me.\"\n\nI looked. In her hand was my letter to Boles. Phew!\n\n\"Listen, Teresa! What is the meaning of all this? Why must you get\nothers to write for you when I have already written it, and you\nhaven't sent it?\"\n\n\"Sent it where?\"\n\n\"Why, to this--Boles.\"\n\n\"There's no such person.\"\n\nI absolutely did not understand it. There was nothing for me but to\nspit and go. Then she explained.\n\n\"What is it?\" she said, still offended. \"There's no such person, I\ntell you,\" and she extended her arms as if she herself did not\nunderstand why there should be no such person. \"But I wanted him to\nbe... Am I then not a human creature like the rest of them? Yes, yes,\nI know, I know, of course... Yet no harm was done to any one by my\nwriting to him that I can see...\"\n\n\"Pardon me--to whom?\"\n\n\"To Boles, of course.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Alas! alas! But what if he doesn't? He doesn't exist, but he _might!_\nI write to him, and it looks as if he did exist. And Teresa--that's\nme, and he replies to me, and then I write to him again...\"\n\nI understood at last. And I felt so sick, so miserable, so ashamed,\nsomehow. Alongside of me, not three yards away, lived a human creature\nwho had nobody in the world to treat her kindly, affectionately, and\nthis human being had invented a friend for herself!\n\n\"Look, now! you wrote me a letter to Boles, and I gave it to some one\nelse to read it to me; and when they read it to me I listened and\nfancied that Boles was there. And I asked you to write me a letter\nfrom Boles to Teresa--that is to me. When they write such a letter for\nme, and read it to me, I feel quite sure that Boles is there. And life\ngrows easier for me in consequence.\"\n\n\"Deuce take you for a blockhead!\" said I to myself when I heard this.\n\nAnd from thenceforth, regularly, twice a week, I wrote a letter to\nBoles, and an answer from Boles to Teresa. I wrote those answers\nwell... She, of course, listened to them, and wept like anything,\nroared, I should say, with her bass voice. And in return for my thus\nmoving her to tears by real letters from the imaginary Boles, she\nbegan to mend the holes I had in my socks, shirts, and other articles\nof clothing. Subsequently, about three months after this history\nbegan, they put her in prison for something or other. No doubt by this\ntime she is dead.\n\nMy acquaintance shook the ash from his cigarette, looked pensively up\nat the sky, and thus concluded:\n\nWell, well, the more a human creature has tasted of bitter things the\nmore it hungers after the sweet things of life. And we, wrapped round\nin the rags of our virtues, and regarding others through the mist of\nour self-sufficiency, and persuaded of our universal impeccability, do\nnot understand this.\n\nAnd the whole thing turns out pretty stupidly--and very cruelly. The\nfallen classes, we say. And who are the fallen classes, I should like\nto know? They are, first of all, people with the same bones, flesh,\nand blood and nerves as ourselves. We have been told this day after\nday for ages. And we actually listen--and the devil only knows how\nhideous the whole thing is. Or are we completely depraved by the loud\nsermonising of humanism? In reality, we also are fallen folks, and, so\nfar as I can see, very deeply fallen into the abyss of\nself-sufficiency and the conviction of our own superiority. But enough\nof this. It is all as old as the hills--so old that it is a shame to\nspeak of it. Very old indeed--yes, that's what it is!\n\n\n\n\nLAZARUS\n\n\n\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nWhen Lazarus rose from the grave, after three days and nights in the\nmysterious thraldom of death, and returned alive to his home, it was a\nlong time before any one noticed the evil peculiarities in him that\nwere later to make his very name terrible. His friends and relatives\nwere jubilant that he had come back to life. They surrounded him with\ntenderness, they were lavish of their eager attentions, spending the\ngreatest care upon his food and drink and the new garments they made\nfor him. They clad him gorgeously in the glowing colours of hope and\nlaughter, and when, arrayed like a bridegroom, he sat at table with\nthem again, ate again, and drank again, they wept fondly and summoned\nthe neighbours to look upon the man miraculously raised from the dead.\n\nThe neighbours came and were moved with joy. Strangers arrived from\ndistant cities and villages to worship the miracle. They burst into\nstormy exclamations, and buzzed around the house of Mary and Martha,\nlike so many bees.\n\nThat which was new in Lazarus' face and gestures they explained\nnaturally, as the traces of his severe illness and the shock he had\npassed through. It was evident that the disintegration of the body had\nbeen halted by a miraculous power, but that the restoration had not\nbeen complete; that death had left upon his face and body the effect\nof an artist's unfinished sketch seen through a thin glass. On his\ntemples, under his eyes, and in the hollow of his cheek lay a thick,\nearthy blue. His fingers were blue, too, and under his nails, which\nhad grown long in the grave, the blue had turned livid. Here and there\non his lips and body, the skin, blistered in the grave, had burst open\nand left reddish glistening cracks, as if covered with a thin, glassy\nslime. And he had grown exceedingly stout. His body was horribly\nbloated and suggested the fetid, damp smell of putrefaction. But the\ncadaverous, heavy odour that clung to his burial garments and, as it\nseemed, to his very body, soon wore off, and after some time the blue\nof his hands and face softened, and the reddish cracks of his skin\nsmoothed out, though they never disappeared completely. Such was the\naspect of Lazarus in his second life. It looked natural only to those\nwho had seen him buried.\n\nNot merely Lazarus' face, but his very character, it seemed, had\nchanged; though it astonished no one and did not attract the attention\nit deserved. Before his death Lazarus had been cheerful and careless,\na lover of laughter and harmless jest. It was because of his good\nhumour, pleasant and equable, his freedom from meanness and gloom,\nthat he had been so beloved by the Master. Now he was grave and\nsilent; neither he himself jested nor did he laugh at the jests of\nothers; and the words he spoke occasionally were simple, ordinary and\nnecessary words--words as much devoid of sense and depth as are the\nsounds with which an animal expresses pain and pleasure, thirst and\nhunger. Such words a man may speak all his life and no one would ever\nknow the sorrows and joys that dwelt within him.\n\nThus it was that Lazarus sat at the festive table among his friends\nand relatives--his face the face of a corpse over which, for three\ndays, death had reigned in darkness, his garments gorgeous and\nfestive, glittering with gold, bloody-red and purple; his mien heavy\nand silent. He was horribly changed and strange, but as yet\nundiscovered. In high waves, now mild, now stormy, the festivities\nwent on around him. Warm glances of love caressed his face, still cold\nwith the touch of the grave; and a friend's warm hand patted his\nbluish, heavy hand. And the music played joyous tunes mingled of the\nsounds of the tympanum, the pipe, the zither and the dulcimer. It was\nas if bees were humming, locusts buzzing and birds singing over the\nhappy home of Mary and Martha.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSome one recklessly lifted the veil. By one breath of an uttered word\nhe destroyed the serene charm, and uncovered the truth in its ugly\nnakedness. No thought was clearly defined in his mind, when his lips\nsmilingly asked: \"Why do you not tell us, Lazarus, what was There?\"\nAnd all became silent, struck with the question. Only now it seemed to\nhave occurred to them that for three days Lazarus had been dead; and\nthey looked with curiosity, awaiting an answer. But Lazarus remained\nsilent.\n\n\"You will not tell us?\" wondered the inquirer. \"Is it so terrible\nThere?\"\n\nAgain his thought lagged behind his words. Had it preceded them, he\nwould not have asked the question, for, at the very moment he uttered\nit, his heart sank with a dread fear. All grew restless; they awaited\nthe words of Lazarus anxiously. But he was silent, cold and severe,\nand his eyes were cast down. And now, as if for the first time, they\nperceived the horrible bluishness of his face and the loathsome\ncorpulence of his body. On the table, as if forgotten by Lazarus, lay\nhis livid blue hand, and all eyes were riveted upon it, as though\nexpecting the desired answer from that hand. The musicians still\nplayed; then silence fell upon them, too, and the gay sounds died\ndown, as scattered coals are extinguished by water. The pipe became\nmute, and the ringing tympanum and the murmuring dulcimer; and as\nthough a chord were broken, as though song itself were dying, the\nzither echoed a trembling broken sound. Then all was quiet.\n\n\"You will not?\" repeated the inquirer, unable to restrain his babbling\ntongue. Silence reigned, and the livid blue hand lay motionless. It\nmoved slightly, and the company sighed with relief and raised their\neyes. Lazarus, risen from the dead, was looking straight at them,\nembracing all with one glance, heavy and terrible.\n\nThis was on the third day after Lazarus had arisen from the grave.\nSince then many had felt that his gaze was the gaze of destruction,\nbut neither those who had been forever crushed by it, nor those who in\nthe prime of life (mysterious even as death) had found the will to\nresist his glance, could ever explain the terror that lay immovable in\nthe depths of his black pupils. He looked quiet and simple. One felt\nthat he had no intention to hide anything, but also no intention to\ntell anything. His look was cold, as of one who is entirely\nindifferent to all that is alive. And many careless people who pressed\naround him, and did not notice him, later learned with wonder and fear\nthe name of this stout, quiet man who brushed against them with his\nsumptuous, gaudy garments. The sun did not stop shining when he\nlooked, neither did the fountain cease playing, and the Eastern sky\nremained cloudless and blue as always; but the man who fell under his\ninscrutable gaze could no longer feel the sun, nor hear the fountain,\nnor recognise his native sky. Sometimes he would cry bitterly,\nsometimes tear his hair in despair and madly call for help; but\ngenerally it happened that the men thus stricken by the gaze of\nLazarus began to fade away listlessly and quietly and pass into a slow\ndeath lasting many long years. They died in the presence of everybody,\ncolourless, haggard and gloomy, like trees withering on rocky ground.\nThose who screamed in madness sometimes came back to life; but the\nothers, never.\n\n\"So you will not tell us, Lazarus, what you saw There?\" the inquirer\nrepeated for the third time. But now his voice was dull, and a dead,\ngrey weariness looked stupidly from out his eyes. The faces of all\npresent were also covered by the same dead grey weariness like a mist.\nThe guests stared at one another stupidly, not knowing why they had\ncome together or why they sat around this rich table. They stopped\ntalking, and vaguely felt it was time to leave; but they could not\novercome the lassitude that spread through their muscles. So they\ncontinued to sit there, each one isolated, like little dim lights\nscattered in the darkness of night.\n\nThe musicians were paid to play, and they again took up the\ninstruments, and again played gay or mournful airs. But it was music\nmade to order, always the same tunes, and the guests listened\nwonderingly. Why was this music necessary, they thought, why was it\nnecessary and what good did it do for people to pull at strings and\nblow their cheeks into thin pipes, and produce varied and\nstrange-sounding noises?\n\n\"How badly they play!\" said some one.\n\nThe musicians were insulted and left. Then the guests departed one by\none, for it was nearing night. And when the quiet darkness enveloped\nthem, and it became easier to breathe, the image of Lazarus suddenly\narose before each one in stern splendour. There he stood, with the\nblue face of a corpse and the raiment of a bridegroom, sumptuous and\nresplendent, in his eyes that cold stare in the depths of which lurked\n_The Horrible!_ They stood still as if turned into stone. The darkness\nsurrounded them, and in the midst of this darkness flamed up the\nhorrible apparition, the supernatural vision, of the one who for three\ndays had lain under the measureless power of death. Three days he had\nbeen dead. Thrice had the sun risen and set--and he had lain dead. The\nchildren had played, the water had murmured as it streamed over the\nrocks, the hot dust had clouded the highway--and he had been dead. And\nnow he was among men again--touched them--looked at them--_looked at\nthem!_ And through the black rings of his pupils, as through dark\nglasses, the unfathomable _There_ gazed upon humanity.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nNo one took care of Lazarus, and no friends or kindred remained with\nhim. Only the great desert, enfolding the Holy City, came close to the\nthreshold of his abode. It entered his home, and lay down on his couch\nlike a spouse, and put out all the fires. No one cared for Lazarus.\nOne after the other went away, even his sisters, Mary and Martha. For\na long while Martha did not want to leave him, for she knew not who\nwould nurse him or take care of him; and she cried and prayed. But one\nnight, when the wind was roaming about the desert, and the rustling\ncypress trees were bending over the roof, she dressed herself quietly,\nand quietly went away. Lazarus probably heard how the door was\nslammed--it had not shut properly and the wind kept knocking it\ncontinually against the post--but he did not rise, did not go out, did\nnot try to find out the reason. And the whole night until the morning\nthe cypress trees hissed over his head, and the door swung to and fro,\nallowing the cold, greedily prowling desert to enter his dwelling.\nEverybody shunned him as though he were a leper. They wanted to put a\nbell on his neck to avoid meeting him. But some one, turning pale,\nremarked it would be terrible if at night, under the windows, one\nshould happen to hear Lazarus' bell, and all grew pale and assented.\n\nSince he did nothing for himself, he would probably have starved had\nnot his neighbours, in trepidation, saved some food for him. Children\nbrought it to him. They did not fear him, neither did they laugh at\nhim in the innocent cruelty in which children often laugh at\nunfortunates. They were indifferent to him, and Lazarus showed the\nsame indifference to them. He showed no desire to thank them for their\nservices; he did not try to pat the dark hands and look into the\nsimple shining little eyes. Abandoned to the ravages of time and the\ndesert, his house was falling to ruins, and his hungry, bleating goats\nhad long been scattered among his neighbours. His wedding garments had\ngrown old. He wore them without changing them, as he had donned them\non that happy day when the musicians played. He did not see the\ndifference between old and new, between torn and whole. The brilliant\ncolours were burnt and faded; the vicious dogs of the city and the\nsharp thorns of the desert had rent the fine clothes to shreds.\n\nDuring the day, when the sun beat down mercilessly upon all living\nthings, and even the scorpions hid under the stones, convulsed with a\nmad desire to sting, he sat motionless in the burning rays, lifting\nhigh his blue face and shaggy wild beard.\n\nWhile yet the people were unafraid to speak to him, same one had asked\nhim: \"Poor Lazarus! Do you find it pleasant to sit so, and look at the\nsun?\" And he answered: \"Yes, it is pleasant.\"\n\nThe thought suggested itself to people that the cold of the three days\nin the grave had been so intense, its darkness so deep, that there was\nnot in all the earth enough heat or light to warm Lazarus and lighten\nthe gloom of his eyes; and inquirers turned away with a sigh.\n\nAnd when the setting sun, flat and purple-red, descended to earth,\nLazarus went into the desert and walked straight toward it, as though\nintending to reach it. Always he walked directly toward the sun, and\nthose who tried to follow him and find out what he did at night in the\ndesert had indelibly imprinted upon their mind's vision the black\nsilhouette of a tall, stout man against the red background of an\nimmense disk. The horrors of the night drove them away, and so they\nnever found out what Lazarus did in the desert; but the image of the\nblack form against the red was burned forever into their brains. Like\nan animal with a cinder in its eye which furiously rubs its muzzle\nagainst its paws, they foolishly rubbed their eyes; but the impression\nleft by Lazarus was ineffaceable, forgotten only in death.\n\nThere were people living far away who never saw Lazarus and only heard\nof him. With an audacious curiosity which is stronger than fear and\nfeeds on fear, with a secret sneer in their hearts, some of them came\nto him one day as he basked in the sun, and entered into conversation\nwith him. At that time his appearance had changed for the better and\nwas not so frightful. At first the visitors snapped their fingers and\nthought disapprovingly of the foolish inhabitants of the Holy City.\nBut when the short talk came to an end and they went home, their\nexpression was such that the inhabitants of the Holy City at once knew\ntheir errand and said: \"Here go some more madmen at whom Lazarus has\nlooked.\" The speakers raised their hands in silent pity.\n\nOther visitors came, among them brave warriors in clinking armour, who\nknew not fear, and happy youths who made merry with laughter and song.\nBusy merchants, jingling their coins, ran in for awhile, and proud\nattendants at the Temple placed their staffs at Lazarus' door. But no\none returned the same as he came. A frightful shadow fell upon their\nsouls, and gave a new appearance to the old familiar world.\n\nThose who felt any desire to speak, after they had been stricken by\nthe gaze of Lazarus, described the change that had come over them\nsomewhat like this:\n\n_All objects seen by the eye and palpable to the hand became empty,\nlight and transparent, as though they were light shadows in the\ndarkness; and this darkness enveloped the whole universe. It was\ndispelled neither by the sun, nor by the moon, nor by the stars, but\nembraced the earth like a mother, and clothed it in a boundless black\nveil_.\n\n_Into all bodies it penetrated, even into iron and stone; and the\nparticles of the body lost their unity and became lonely. Even to the\nheart of the particles it penetrated, and the particles of the\nparticles became lonely_.\n\n_The vast emptiness which surrounds the universe, was not filled with\nthings seen, with sun or moon or stars; it stretched boundless,\npenetrating everywhere, disuniting everything, body from body,\nparticle from particle_.\n\n_In emptiness the trees spread their roots, themselves empty; in\nemptiness rose phantom temples, palaces and houses--all empty; and in\nthe emptiness moved restless Man, himself empty and light, like a\nshadow_.\n\n_There was no more a sense of time; the beginning of all things and\ntheir end merged into one. In the very moment when a building was\nbeing erected and one could hear the builders striking with their\nhammers, one seemed already to see its ruins, and then emptiness where\nthe ruins were_.\n\n_A man was just born, and funeral candles were already lighted at his\nhead, and then were extinguished; and soon there was emptiness where\nbefore had been the man and the candles._\n\n_And surrounded by Darkness and Empty Waste, Man trembled hopelessly\nbefore the dread of the Infinite_.\n\nSo spoke those who had a desire to speak. But much more could probably\nhave been told by those who did not want to talk, and who died in\nsilence.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAt that time there lived in Rome a celebrated sculptor by the name of\nAurelius. Out of clay, marble and bronze he created forms of gods and\nmen of such beauty that this beauty was proclaimed immortal. But he\nhimself was not satisfied, and said there was a supreme beauty that he\nhad never succeeded in expressing in marble or bronze. \"I have not yet\ngathered the radiance of the moon,\" he said; \"I have not yet caught\nthe glare of the sun. There is no soul in my marble, there is no life\nin my beautiful bronze.\" And when by moonlight he would slowly wander\nalong the roads, crossing the black shadows of the cypress-trees, his\nwhite tunic flashing in the moonlight, those he met used to laugh\ngood-naturedly and say: \"Is it moonlight that you are gathering,\nAurelius? Why did you not bring some baskets along?\"\n\nAnd he, too, would laugh and point to his eyes and say: \"Here are the\nbaskets in which I gather the light of the moon and the radiance of\nthe sun.\"\n\nAnd that was the truth. In his eyes shone moon and sun. But he could\nnot transmit the radiance to marble. Therein lay the greatest tragedy\nof his life. He was a descendant of an ancient race of patricians, had\na good wife and children, and except in this one respect, lacked\nnothing.\n\nWhen the dark rumour about Lazarus reached him, he consulted his wife\nand friends and decided to make the long voyage to Judea, in order\nthat he might look upon the man miraculously raised from the dead. He\nfelt lonely in those days and hoped on the way to renew his jaded\nenergies. What they told him about Lazarus did not frighten him. He\nhad meditated much upon death. He did not like it, nor did he like\nthose who tried to harmonise it with life. On this side, beautiful\nlife; on the other, mysterious death, he reasoned, and no better lot\ncould befall a man than to live--to enjoy life and the beauty of\nliving. And he already had conceived a desire to convince Lazarus of\nthe truth of this view and to return his soul to life even as his body\nhad been returned. This task did not appear impossible, for the\nreports about Lazarus, fearsome and strange as they were, did not tell\nthe whole truth about him, but only carried a vague warning against\nsomething awful.\n\nLazarus was getting up from a stone to follow in the path of the\nsetting sun, on the evening when the rich Roman, accompanied by an\narmed slave, approached him, and in a ringing voice called to him:\n\"Lazarus!\"\n\nLazarus saw a proud and beautiful face, made radiant by fame, and\nwhite garments and precious jewels shining in the sunlight. The ruddy\nrays of the sun lent to the head and face a likeness to dimly shining\nbronze--that was what Lazarus saw. He sank back to his seat\nobediently, and wearily lowered his eyes.\n\n\"It is true you are not beautiful, my poor Lazarus,\" said the Roman\nquietly, playing with his gold chain. \"You are even frightful, my poor\nfriend; and death was not lazy the day when you so carelessly fell\ninto its arms. But you are as fat as a barrel, and 'Fat people are not\nbad,' as the great C�sar said. I do not understand why people are so\nafraid of you. You will permit me to stay with you over night? It is\nalready late, and I have no abode.\"\n\nNobody had ever asked Lazarus to be allowed to pass the night with\nhim.\n\n\"I have no bed,\" said he.\n\n\"I am somewhat of a warrior and can sleep sitting,\" replied the Roman.\n\"We shall make a light.\"\n\n\"I have no light.\"\n\n\"Then we will converse in the darkness like two friends. I suppose you\nhave some wine?\"\n\n\"I have no wine.\"\n\nThe Roman laughed.\n\n\"Now I understand why you are so gloomy and why you do not like your\nsecond life. No wine? Well, we shall do without. You know there are\nwords that go to one's head even as Falernian wine.\"\n\nWith a motion of his head he dismissed the slave, and they were alone.\nAnd again the sculptor spoke, but it seemed as though the sinking sun\nhad penetrated into his words. They faded, pale and empty, as if\ntrembling on weak feet, as if slipping and falling, drunk with the\nwine of anguish and despair. And black chasms appeared between the two\nmen--like remote hints of vast emptiness and vast darkness.\n\n\"Now I am your guest and you will not ill-treat me, Lazarus!\" said the\nRoman. \"Hospitality is binding even upon those who have been three\ndays dead. Three days, I am told, you were in the grave. It must have\nbeen cold there... and it is from there that you have brought this bad\nhabit of doing without light and wine. I like a light. It gets dark so\nquickly here. Your eyebrows and forehead have an interesting line:\neven as the ruins of castles covered with the ashes of an earthquake.\nBut why in such strange, ugly clothes? I have seen the bridegrooms of\nyour country, they wear clothes like that--such ridiculous\nclothes--such awful garments... Are you a bridegroom?\"\n\nAlready the sun had disappeared. A gigantic black shadow was\napproaching fast from the west, as if prodigious bare feet were\nrustling over the sand. And the chill breezes stole up behind.\n\n\"In the darkness you seem even bigger, Lazarus, as though you had\ngrown stouter in these few minutes. Do you feed on darkness,\nperchance?... And I would like a light... just a small light... just a\nsmall light. And I am cold. The nights here are so barbarously cold...\nIf it were not so dark, I should say you were looking at me, Lazarus.\nYes, it seems, you are looking. You are looking. _You are looking at\nme!_... I feel it--now you are smiling.\"\n\nThe night had come, and a heavy blackness filled the air.\n\n\"How good it will be when the sun rises again to-morrow... You know I\nam a great sculptor... so my friends call me. I create, yes, they say\nI create, but for that daylight is necessary. I give life to cold\nmarble. I melt the ringing bronze in the fire, in a bright, hot fire.\nWhy did you touch me with your hand?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Lazarus, \"you are my guest.\" And they went into the\nhouse. And the shadows of the long evening fell on the earth...\n\nThe slave at last grew tired waiting for his master, and when the sun\nstood high he came to the house. And he saw, directly under its\nburning rays, Lazarus and his master sitting close together. They\nlooked straight up and were silent.\n\nThe slave wept and cried aloud: \"Master, what ails you, Master!\"\n\nThe same day Aurelius left for Rome. The whole way he was thoughtful\nand silent, attentively examining everything, the people, the ship,\nand the sea, as though endeavouring to recall something. On the sea a\ngreat storm overtook them, and all the while Aurelius remained on deck\nand gazed eagerly at the approaching and falling waves. When he\nreached home his family were shocked at the terrible change in his\ndemeanour, but he calmed them with the words: \"I have found it!\"\n\nIn the dusty clothes which he had worn during the entire journey and\nhad not changed, he began his work, and the marble ringingly responded\nto the resounding blows of the hammer. Long and eagerly he worked,\nadmitting no one. At last, one morning, he announced that the work was\nready, and gave instructions that all his friends, and the severe\ncritics and judges of art, be called together. Then he donned gorgeous\ngarments, shining with gold, glowing with the purple of the byssin.\n\n\"Here is what I have created,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\nHis friends looked, and immediately the shadow of deep sorrow covered\ntheir faces. It was a thing monstrous, possessing none of the forms\nfamiliar to the eye, yet not devoid of a hint of some new unknown\nform. On a thin tortuous little branch, or rather an ugly likeness of\none, lay crooked, strange, unsightly, shapeless heaps of something\nturned outside in, or something turned inside out--wild fragments\nwhich seemed to be feebly trying to get away from themselves. And,\naccidentally, under one of the wild projections, they noticed a\nwonderfully sculptured butterfly, with transparent wings, trembling as\nthough with a weak longing to fly.\n\n\"Why that wonderful butterfly, Aurelius?\" timidly asked some one.\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered the sculptor.\n\nThe truth had to be told, and one of his friends, the one who loved\nAurelius best, said: \"This is ugly, my poor friend. It must be\ndestroyed. Give me the hammer.\" And with two blows he destroyed the\nmonstrous mass, leaving only the wonderfully sculptured butterfly.\n\nAfter that Aurelius created nothing. He looked with absolute\nindifference at marble and at bronze and at his own divine creations,\nin which dwelt immortal beauty. In the hope of breathing into him once\nagain the old flame of inspiration, with the idea of awakening his\ndead soul, his friends led him to see the beautiful creations of\nothers, but he remained indifferent and no smile warmed his closed\nlips. And only after they spoke to him much and long of beauty, he\nwould reply wearily:\n\n\"But all this is--a lie.\"\n\nAnd in the daytime, when the sun was shining, he would go into his\nrich and beautifully laid-out garden, and finding a place where there\nwas no shadow, would expose his bare head and his dull eyes to the\nglitter and burning heat of the sun. Red and white butterflies\nfluttered around; down into the marble cistern ran splashing water\nfrom the crooked mouth of a blissfully drunken Satyr; but he sat\nmotionless, like a pale shadow of that other one who, in a far land,\nat the very gates of the stony desert, also sat motionless under the\nfiery sun.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nAnd it came about finally that Lazarus was summoned to Rome by the\ngreat Augustus.\n\nThey dressed him in gorgeous garments as though it had been ordained\nthat he was to remain a bridegroom to an unknown bride until the very\nday of his death. It was as if an old coffin, rotten and falling\napart, were regilded over and over, and gay tassels were hung on it.\nAnd solemnly they conducted him in gala attire, as though in truth it\nwere a bridal procession, the runners loudly sounding the trumpet that\nthe way be made for the ambassadors of the Emperor. But the roads\nalong which he passed were deserted. His entire native land cursed the\nexecrable name of Lazarus, the man miraculously brought to life, and\nthe people scattered at the mere report of his horrible approach. The\ntrumpeters blew lonely blasts, and only the desert answered with a\ndying echo.\n\nThen they carried him across the sea on the saddest and most gorgeous\nship that was ever mirrored in the azure waves of the Mediterranean.\nThere were many people aboard, but the ship was silent and still as a\ncoffin, and the water seemed to moan as it parted before the short\ncurved prow. Lazarus sat lonely, baring his head to the sun, and\nlistening in silence to the splashing of the waters. Further away the\nseamen and the ambassadors gathered like a crowd of distressed\nshadows. If a thunderstorm had happened to burst upon them at that\ntime or the wind had overwhelmed the red sails, the ship would\nprobably have perished, for none of those who were on her had strength\nor desire enough to fight for life. With supreme effort some went to\nthe side of the ship and eagerly gazed at the blue, transparent abyss.\nPerhaps they imagined they saw a naiad flashing a pink shoulder\nthrough the waves, or an insanely joyous and drunken centaur galloping\nby, splashing up the water with his hoofs. But the sea was deserted\nand mute, and so was the watery abyss.\n\nListlessly Lazarus set foot on the streets of the Eternal City, as\nthough all its riches, all the majesty of its gigantic edifices, all\nthe lustre and beauty and music of refined life, were simply the echo\nof the wind in the desert, or the misty images of hot running sand.\nChariots whirled by; the crowd of strong, beautiful, haughty men\npassed on, builders of the Eternal City and proud partakers of its\nlife; songs rang out; fountains laughed; pearly laughter of women\nfilled the air, while the drunkard philosophised and the sober ones\nsmilingly listened; horseshoes rattled on the pavement. And surrounded\non all sides by glad sounds, a fat, heavy man moved through the centre\nof the city like a cold spot of silence, sowing in his path grief,\nanger and vague, carking distress. Who dared to be sad in Rome?\nindignantly demanded frowning citizens; and in two days the\nswift-tongued Rome knew of Lazarus, the man miraculously raised from\nthe grave, and timidly evaded him.\n\nThere were many brave men ready to try their strength, and at their\nsenseless call Lazarus came obediently. The Emperor was so engrossed\nwith state affairs that he delayed receiving the visitor, and for\nseven days Lazarus moved among the people.\n\nA jovial drunkard met him with a smile on his red lips. \"Drink,\nLazarus, drink!\" he cried, \"Would not Augustus laugh to see you\ndrink!\" And naked, besotted women laughed, and decked the blue hands\nof Lazarus with rose-leaves. But the drunkard looked into the eyes of\nLazarus--and his joy ended forever. Thereafter he was always drunk. He\ndrank no more, but was drunk all the time, shadowed by fearful dreams,\ninstead of the joyous reveries that wine gives. Fearful dreams became\nthe food of his broken spirit. Fearful dreams held him day and night\nin the mists of monstrous fantasy, and death itself was no more\nfearful than the apparition of its fierce precursor.\n\nLazarus came to a youth and his lass who loved each other and were\nbeautiful in their love. Proudly and strongly holding in his arms his\nbeloved one, the youth said, with gentle pity: \"Look at us, Lazarus,\nand rejoice with us. Is there anything stronger than love?\"\n\nAnd Lazarus looked at them. And their whole life they continued to\nlove one another, but their love became mournful and gloomy, even as\nthose cypress trees over the tombs that feed their roots on the\nputrescence of the grave, and strive in vain in the quiet evening hour\nto touch the sky with their pointed tops. Hurled by fathomless\nlife-forces into each other's arms, they mingled their kisses with\ntears, their joy with pain, and only succeeded in realising the more\nvividly a sense of their slavery to the silent Nothing. Forever\nunited, forever parted, they flashed like sparks, and like sparks went\nout in boundless darkness.\n\nLazarus came to a proud sage, and the sage said to him: \"I already\nknow all the horrors that you may tell me, Lazarus. With what else can\nyou terrify me?\"\n\nOnly a few moments passed before the sage realised that the knowledge\nof the horrible is not the horrible, and that the sight of death is\nnot death. And he felt that in the eyes of the Infinite wisdom and\nfolly are the same, for the Infinite knows them not. And the\nboundaries between knowledge and ignorance, between truth and\nfalsehood, between top and bottom, faded and his shapeless thought was\nsuspended in emptiness. Then he grasped his grey head in his hands and\ncried out insanely: \"I cannot think! I cannot think!\"\n\nThus it was that under the cool gaze of Lazarus, the man miraculously\nraised from the dead, all that serves to affirm life, its sense and\nits joys, perished. And people began to say it was dangerous to allow\nhim to see the Emperor; that it were better to kill him and bury him\nsecretly, and swear he had disappeared. Swords were sharpened and\nyouths devoted to the welfare of the people announced their readiness\nto become assassins, when Augustus upset the cruel plans by demanding\nthat Lazarus appear before him.\n\nEven though Lazarus could not be kept away, it was felt that the heavy\nimpression conveyed by his face might be somewhat softened. With that\nend in view expert painters, barbers and artists were secured who\nworked the whole night on Lazarus' head. His beard was trimmed and\ncurled. The disagreeable and deadly bluishness of his hands and face\nwas covered up with paint; his hands were whitened, his cheeks rouged.\nThe disgusting wrinkles of suffering that ridged his old face were\npatched up and painted, and on the smooth surface, wrinkles of\ngood-nature and laughter, and of pleasant, good-humoured cheeriness,\nwere laid on artistically with fine brushes.\n\nLazarus submitted indifferently to all they did with him, and soon was\ntransformed into a stout, nice-looking old man, for all the world a\nquiet and good-humoured grandfather of numerous grandchildren. He\nlooked as though the smile with which he told funny stories had not\nleft his lips, as though a quiet tenderness still lay hidden in the\ncorner of his eyes. But the wedding-dress they did not dare to take\noff; and they could not change his eyes--the dark, terrible eyes from\nout of which stared the incomprehensible _There_.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nLazarus was untouched by the magnificence of the imperial apartments.\nHe remained stolidly indifferent, as though he saw no contrast between\nhis ruined house at the edge of the desert and the solid, beautiful\npalace of stone. Under his feet the hard marble of the floor took on\nthe semblance of the moving sands of the desert, and to his eyes the\nthrongs of gaily dressed, haughty men were as unreal as the emptiness\nof the air. They looked not into his face as he passed by, fearing to\ncome under the awful bane of his eyes; but when the sound of his heavy\nsteps announced that he had passed, heads were lifted, and eyes\nexamined with timid curiosity the figure of the corpulent, tall,\nslightly stooping old man, as he slowly passed into the heart of the\nimperial palace. If death itself had appeared men would not have\nfeared it so much; for hitherto death had been known to the dead only,\nand life to the living only, and between these two there had been no\nbridge. But this strange being knew death, and that knowledge of his\nwas felt to be mysterious and cursed. \"He will kill our great, divine\nAugustus,\" men cried with horror, and they hurled curses after him.\nSlowly and stolidly he passed them by, penetrating ever deeper into\nthe palace.\n\nCaesar knew already who Lazarus was, and was prepared to meet him. He\nwas a courageous man; he felt his power was invincible, and in the\nfateful encounter with the man \"wonderfully raised from the dead\" he\nrefused to lean on other men's weak help. Man to man, face to face, he\nmet Lazarus.\n\n\"Do not fix your gaze on me, Lazarus,\" he commanded. \"I have heard\nthat your head is like the head of Medusa, and turns into stone all\nupon whom you look. But I should like to have a close look at you, and\nto talk to you before I turn into stone,\" he added in a spirit of\nplayfulness that concealed his real misgivings.\n\nApproaching him, he examined closely Lazarus' face and his strange\nfestive clothes. Though his eyes were sharp and keen, he was deceived\nby the skilful counterfeit.\n\n\"Well, your appearance is not terrible, venerable sir. But all the\nworse for men, when the terrible takes on such a venerable and\npleasant appearance. Now let us talk.\"\n\nAugustus sat down, and as much by glance as by words began the\ndiscussion. \"Why did you not salute me when you entered?\"\n\nLazarus answered indifferently: \"I did not know it was necessary.\"\n\n\"You are a Christian?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAugustus nodded approvingly. \"That is good. I do not like the\nChristians. They shake the tree of life, forbidding it to bear fruit,\nand they scatter to the wind its fragrant blossoms. But who are you?\"\n\nWith some effort Lazarus answered: \"I was dead.\"\n\n\"I heard about that. But who are you now?\"\n\nLazarus' answer came slowly. Finally he said again, listlessly and\nindistinctly: \"I was dead.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, stranger,\" said the Emperor sharply, giving expression\nto what had been in his mind before. \"My empire is an empire of the\nliving; my people are a people of the living and not of the dead. You\nare superfluous here. I do not know who you are, I do not know what\nyou have seen There, but if you lie, I hate your lies, and if you tell\nthe truth, I hate your truth. In my heart I feel the pulse of life; in\nmy hands I feel power, and my proud thoughts, like eagles, fly through\nspace. Behind my back, under the protection of my authority, under the\nshadow of the laws I have created, men live and labour and rejoice. Do\nyou hear this divine harmony of life? Do you hear the war cry that men\nhurl into the face of the future, challenging it to strife?\"\n\nAugustus extended his arms reverently and solemnly cried out: \"Blessed\nart thou, Great Divine Life!\"\n\nBut Lazarus was silent, and the Emperor continued more severely: \"You\nare not wanted here. Pitiful remnant, half devoured of death, you fill\nmen with distress and aversion to life. Like a caterpillar on the\nfields, you are gnawing away at the full seed of joy, exuding the\nslime of despair and sorrow. Your truth is like a rusted sword in the\nhands of a night assassin, and I shall condemn you to death as an\nassassin. But first I want to look into your eyes. Mayhap only cowards\nfear them, and brave men are spurred on to struggle and victory. Then\nwill you merit not death but a reward. Look at me, Lazarus.\"\n\nAt first it seemed to divine Augustus as if a friend were looking at\nhim, so soft, so alluring, so gently fascinating was the gaze of\nLazarus. It promised not horror but quiet rest, and the Infinite dwelt\nthere as a fond mistress, a compassionate sister, a mother. And ever\nstronger grew its gentle embrace, until he felt, as it were, the\nbreath of a mouth hungry for kisses... Then it seemed as if iron bones\nprotruded in a ravenous grip, and closed upon him in an iron band; and\ncold nails touched his heart, and slowly, slowly sank into it.\n\n\"It pains me,\" said divine Augustus, growing pale; \"but look, Lazarus,\nlook!\"\n\nPonderous gates, shutting off eternity, appeared to be slowly swinging\nopen, and through the growing aperture poured in, coldly and calmly,\nthe awful horror of the Infinite. Boundless Emptiness and Boundless\nGloom entered like two shadows, extinguishing the sun, removing the\nground from under the feet, and the cover from over the head. And the\npain in his icy heart ceased.\n\n\"Look at me, look at me, Lazarus!\" commanded Augustus, staggering...\n\nTime ceased and the beginning of things came perilously near to the\nend. The throne of Augustus, so recently erected, fell to pieces, and\nemptiness took the place of the throne and of Augustus. Rome fell\nsilently into ruins. A new city rose in its place, and it too was\nerased by emptiness. Like phantom giants, cities, kingdoms, and\ncountries swiftly fell and disappeared into emptiness--swallowed up in\nthe black maw of the Infinite...\n\n\"Cease,\" commanded the Emperor. Already the accent of indifference was\nin his voice. His arms hung powerless, and his eagle eyes flashed and\nwere dimmed again, struggling against overwhelming darkness.\n\n\"You have killed me, Lazarus,\" he said drowsily.\n\nThese words of despair saved him. He thought of the people, whose\nshield he was destined to be, and a sharp, redeeming pang pierced his\ndull heart. He thought of them doomed to perish, and he was filled\nwith anguish. First they seemed bright shadows in the gloom of the\nInfinite.--How terrible! Then they appeared as fragile vessels with\nlife-agitated blood, and hearts that knew both sorrow and great\njoy.--And he thought of them with tenderness.\n\nAnd so thinking and feeling, inclining the scales now to the side of\nlife, now to the side of death, he slowly returned to life, to find in\nits suffering and joy a refuge from the gloom, emptiness and fear of\nthe Infinite.\n\n\"No, you did not kill me, Lazarus,\" said he firmly. \"But I will kill\nyou. Go!\"\n\nEvening came and divine Augustus partook of food and drink with great\njoy. But there were moments when his raised arm would remain suspended\nin the air, and the light of his shining, eager eyes was dimmed. It\nseemed as if an icy wave of horror washed against his feet. He was\nvanquished but not killed, and coldly awaited his doom, like a black\nshadow. His nights were haunted by horror, but the bright days still\nbrought him the joys, as well as the sorrows, of life.\n\nNext day, by order of the Emperor, they burned out Lazarus' eyes with\nhot irons and sent him home. Even Augustus dared not kill him.\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nLazarus returned to the desert and the desert received him with the\nbreath of the hissing wind and the ardour of the glowing sun. Again he\nsat on the stone with matted beard uplifted; and two black holes,\nwhere the eyes had once been, looked dull and horrible at the sky. In\nthe distance the Holy City surged and roared restlessly, but near him\nall was deserted and still. No one approached the place where Lazarus,\nmiraculously raised from the dead, passed his last days, for his\nneighbours had long since abandoned their homes. His cursed knowledge,\ndriven by the hot irons from his eyes deep into the brain, lay there\nin ambush; as if from ambush it might spring out upon men with a\nthousand unseen eyes. No one dared to look at Lazarus.\n\nAnd in the evening, when the sun, swollen crimson and growing larger,\nbent its way toward the west, blind Lazarus slowly groped after it. He\nstumbled against stones and fell; corpulent and feeble, he rose\nheavily and walked on; and against the red curtain of sunset his dark\nform and outstretched arms gave him the semblance of a cross.\n\nIt happened once that he went and never returned. Thus ended the\nsecond life of Lazarus, who for three days had been in the mysterious\nthraldom of death and then was miraculously raised from the dead.\n\n\n\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONIST\n\n\n\nBY MICHA�L P. ARTZYBASHEV\n\n\nI\n\n\nGabriel Andersen, the teacher, walked to the edge of the school\ngarden, where he paused, undecided what to do. Off in the distance,\ntwo miles away, the woods hung like bluish lace over a field of pure\nsnow. It was a brilliant day. A hundred tints glistened on the white\nground and the iron bars of the garden railing. There was a lightness\nand transparency in the air that only the days of early spring\npossess. Gabriel Andersen turned his steps toward the fringe of blue\nlace for a tramp in the woods.\n\n\"Another spring in my life,\" he said, breathing deep and peering up at\nthe heavens through his spectacles. Andersen was rather given to\nsentimental poetising. He walked with his hands folded behind him,\ndangling his cane.\n\nHe had gone but a few paces when he noticed a group of soldiers and\nhorses on the road beyond the garden rail. Their drab uniforms stood\nout dully against the white of the snow, but their swords and horses'\ncoats tossed back the light. Their bowed cavalry legs moved awkwardly\non the snow. Andersen wondered what they were doing there. Suddenly the\nnature of their business flashed upon him. It was an ugly errand they\nwere upon, an instinct rather that his reason told him. Something\nunusual and terrible was to happen. And the same instinct told him he\nmust conceal himself from the soldiers. He turned to the left quickly,\ndropped on his knees, and crawled on the soft, thawing, crackling snow\nto a low haystack, from behind which, by craning his neck, he could\nwatch what the soldiers were doing.\n\nThere were twelve of them, one a stocky young officer in a grey cloak\ncaught in prettily at the waist by a silver belt. His face was so red\nthat even at that distance Andersen caught the odd, whitish gleam of\nhis light protruding moustache and eyebrows against the vivid colour\nof his skin. The broken tones of his raucous voice reached distinctly\nto where the teacher, listening intently, lay hidden.\n\n\"I know what I am about. I don't need anybody's advice,\" the officer\ncried. He clapped his arms akimbo and looked down at some one among\nthe group of bustling soldiers. \"I'll show you how to be a rebel, you\ndamned skunk.\"\n\nAndersen's heart beat fast. \"Good heavens!\" he thought. \"Is it\npossible?\" His head grew chill as if struck by a cold wave.\n\n\"Officer,\" a quiet, restrained, yet distinct voice came from among the\nsoldiers, \"you have no right--It's for the court to decide--you aren't\na judge--it's plain murder, not--\" \"Silence!\" thundered the officer,\nhis voice choking with rage. \"I'll give you a court. Ivanov, go\nahead.\"\n\nHe put the spurs to his horse and rode away. Gabriel Andersen\nmechanically observed how carefully the horse picked its way, placing\nits feet daintily as if for the steps of a minuet. Its ears were\npricked to catch every sound. There was momentary bustle and\nexcitement among the soldiers. Then they dispersed in different\ndirections, leaving three persons in black behind, two tall men and\none very short and frail. Andersen could see the hair of the short\none's head. It was very light. And he saw his rosy ears sticking out\non each side.\n\nNow he fully understood what was to happen. But it was a thing so out\nof the ordinary, so horrible, that he fancied he was dreaming.\n\n\"It's so bright, so beautiful--the snow, the field, the woods, the\nsky. The breath of spring is upon everything. Yet people are going to\nbe killed. How can it be? Impossible!\" So his thoughts ran in\nconfusion. He had the sensation of a man suddenly gone insane, who\nfinds he sees, hears and feels what he is not accustomed to, and ought\nnot hear, see and feel.\n\nThe three men in black stood next to one another hard by the railing,\ntwo quite close together, the short one some distance away.\n\n\"Officer!\" one of them cried in a desperate voice--Andersen could not\nsee which it was--\"God sees us! Officer!\"\n\nEight soldiers dismounted quickly, their spurs and sabres catching\nawkwardly. Evidently they were in a hurry, as if doing a thief's job.\n\nSeveral seconds passed in silence until the soldiers placed themselves\nin a row a few feet from the black figures and levelled their guns. In\ndoing so one soldier knocked his cap from his head. He picked it up\nand put it on again without brushing off the wet snow.\n\nThe officer's mount still kept dancing on one spot with his ears\npricked, while the other horses, also with sharp ears erect to catch\nevery sound, stood motionless looking at the men in black, their long\nwise heads inclined to one side.\n\n\"Spare the boy at least!\" another voice suddenly pierced the air. \"Why\nkill a child, damn you! What has the child done?\"\n\n\"Ivanov, do what I told you to do,\" thundered the officer, drowning\nthe other voice. His face turned as scarlet as a piece of red flannel.\n\nThere followed a scene savage and repulsive in its gruesomeness. The\nshort figure in black, with the light hair and the rosy ears, uttered\na wild shriek in a shrill child's tones and reeled to one side.\nInstantly it was caught up by two or three soldiers. But the boy began\nto struggle, and two more soldiers ran up.\n\n\"Ow-ow-ow-ow!\" the boy cried. \"Let me go, let me go! Ow-ow!\"\n\nHis shrill voice cut the air like the yell of a stuck porkling not\nquite done to death. Suddenly he grew quiet. Some one must have struck\nhim. An unexpected, oppressive silence ensued. The boy was being\npushed forward. Then there came a deafening report. Andersen started\nback all in a tremble. He saw distinctly, yet vaguely as in a dream,\nthe dropping of two dark bodies, the flash of pale sparks, and a light\nsmoke rising in the clean, bright atmosphere. He saw the soldiers\nhastily mounting their horses without even glancing at the bodies. He\nsaw them galloping along the muddy road, their arms clanking, their\nhorses' hoofs clattering.\n\nHe saw all this, himself now standing in the middle of the road, not\nknowing when and why he had jumped from behind the haystack. He was\ndeathly pale. His face was covered with dank sweat, his body was\naquiver. A physical sadness smote and tortured him. He could not make\nout the nature of the feeling. It was akin to extreme sickness, though\nfar more nauseating and terrible.\n\nAfter the soldiers had disappeared beyond the bend toward the woods,\npeople came hurrying to the spot of the shooting, though till then not\na soul had been in sight.\n\nThe bodies lay at the roadside on the other side of the railing, where\nthe snow was clean, brittle and untrampled and glistened cheerfully in\nthe bright atmosphere. There were three dead bodies, two men and a\nboy. The boy lay with his long soft neck stretched on the snow. The\nface of the man next to the boy was invisible. He had fallen face\ndownward in a pool of blood. The third was a big man with a black\nbeard and huge, muscular arms. He lay stretched out to the full length\nof his big body, his arms extended over a large area of blood-stained\nsnow.\n\nThe three men who had been shot lay black against the white snow,\nmotionless. From afar no one could have told the terror that was in\ntheir immobility as they lay there at the edge of the narrow road\ncrowded with people.\n\nThat night Gabriel Andersen in his little room in the schoolhouse did\nnot write poems as usual. He stood at the window and looked at the\ndistant pale disk of the moon in the misty blue sky, and thought. And\nhis thoughts were confused, gloomy, and heavy as if a cloud had\ndescended upon his brain.\n\nIndistinctly outlined in the dull moonlight he saw the dark railing,\nthe trees, the empty garden. It seemed to him that he beheld them--the\nthree men who had been shot, two grown up, one a child. They were\nlying there now at the roadside, in the empty, silent field, looking\nat the far-off cold moon with their dead, white eyes as he with his\nliving eyes.\n\n\"The time will come some day,\" he thought, \"when the killing of people\nby others will be an utter impossibility. The time will come when even\nthe soldiers and officers who killed these three men will realise what\nthey have done and will understand that what they killed them for is\njust as necessary, important, and dear to them--to the officers and\nsoldiers--as to those whom they killed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said aloud and solemnly, his eyes moistening, \"that time\nwill come. They will understand.\" And the pale disk of the moon was\nblotted out by the moisture in his eyes.\n\nA large pity pierced his heart for the three victims whose eyes looked\nat the moon, sad and unseeing. A feeling of rage cut him as with a\nsharp knife and took possession of him.\n\nBut Gabriel Andersen quieted his heart, whispering softly, \"They know\nnot what they do.\" And this old and ready phrase gave him the strength\nto stifle his rage and indignation.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe day was as bright and white, but the spring was already advanced.\nThe wet soil smelt of spring. Clear cold water ran everywhere from\nunder the loose, thawing snow. The branches of the trees were springy\nand elastic. For miles and miles around, the country opened up in\nclear azure stretches.\n\nYet the clearness and the joy of the spring day were not in the\nvillage. They were somewhere outside the village, where there were no\npeople--in the fields, the woods and the mountains. In the village the\nair was stifling, heavy and terrible as in a nightmare.\n\nGabriel Andersen stood in the road near a crowd of dark, sad,\nabsent-minded people and craned his neck to see the preparations for\nthe flogging of seven peasants.\n\nThey stood in the thawing snow, and Gabriel Andersen could not\npersuade himself that they were people whom he had long known and\nunderstood. By that which was about to happen to them, the shameful,\nterrible, ineradicable thing that was to happen to them, they were\nseparated from all the rest of the world, and so were unable to feel\nwhat he, Gabriel Andersen, felt, just as he was unable to feel what\nthey felt. Round them were the soldiers, confidently and beautifully\nmounted on high upon their large steeds, who tossed their wise heads\nand turned their dappled wooden faces slowly from side to side,\nlooking contemptuously at him, Gabriel Andersen, who was soon to\nbehold this horror, this disgrace, and would do nothing, would not\ndare to do anything. So it seemed to Gabriel Andersen; and a sense of\ncold, intolerable shame gripped him as between two clamps of ice\nthrough which he could see everything without being able to move, cry\nout or utter a groan.\n\nThey took the first peasant. Gabriel Andersen saw his strange,\nimploring, hopeless look. His lips moved, but no sound was heard, and\nhis eyes wandered. There was a bright gleam in them as in the eyes of\na madman. His mind, it was evident, was no longer able to comprehend\nwhat was happening.\n\nAnd so terrible was that face, at once full of reason and of madness,\nthat Andersen felt relieved when they put him face downward on the\nsnow and, instead of the fiery eyes, he saw his bare back\nglistening--a senseless, shameful, horrible sight.\n\nThe large, red-faced soldier in a red cap pushed toward him, looked\ndown at his body with seeming delight, and then cried in a clear\nvoice:\n\n\"Well, let her go, with God's blessing!\"\n\nAndersen seemed not to see the soldiers, the sky, the horses or the\ncrowd. He did not feel the cold, the terror or the shame. He did not\nhear the swish of the knout in the air or the savage howl of pain and\ndespair. He only saw the bare back of a man's body swelling up and\ncovered over evenly with white and purple stripes. Gradually the bare\nback lost the semblance of human flesh. The blood oozed and squirted,\nforming patches, drops and rivulets, which ran down on the white,\nthawing snow.\n\nTerror gripped the soul of Gabriel Andersen as he thought of the\nmoment when the man would rise and face all the people who had seen\nhis body bared out in the open and reduced to a bloody pulp. He closed\nhis eyes. When he opened them, he saw four soldiers in uniform and red\nhats forcing another man down on the snow, his back bared just as\nshamefully, terribly and absurdly--a ludicrously tragic sight.\n\nThen came the third, the fourth, and so on, to the end.\n\nAnd Gabriel Andersen stood on the wet, thawing snow, craning his neck,\ntrembling and stuttering, though he did not say a word. Dank sweat\npoured from his body. A sense of shame permeated his whole being. It\nwas a humiliating feeling, having to escape being noticed so that they\nshould not catch him and lay him there on the snow and strip him\nbare--him, Gabriel Andersen.\n\nThe soldiers pressed and crowded, the horses tossed their heads, the\nknout swished in the air, and the bare, shamed human flesh swelled up,\ntore, ran over with blood, and curled like a snake. Oaths, wild\nshrieks rained upon the village through the clean white air of that\nspring day.\n\nAndersen now saw five men's faces at the steps of the town hall, the\nfaces of those men who had already undergone their shame. He quickly\nturned his eyes away. After seeing this a man must die, he thought.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThere were seventeen of them, fifteen soldiers, a subaltern and a\nyoung beardless officer. The officer lay in front of the fire looking\nintently into the flames. The soldiers were tinkering with the\nfirearms in the wagon.\n\nTheir grey figures moved about quietly on the black thawing ground,\nand occasionally stumbled across the logs sticking out from the\nblazing fire.\n\nGabriel Andersen, wearing an overcoat and carrying his cane behind his\nback, approached them. The subaltern, a stout fellow with a moustache,\njumped up, turned from the fire, and looked at him.\n\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" he asked excitedly. From his tone it\nwas evident that the soldiers feared everybody in that district,\nthrough which they went scattering death, destruction and torture.\n\n\"Officer,\" he said, \"there is a man here I don't know.\"\n\nThe officer looked at Andersen without speaking.\n\n\"Officer,\" said Andersen in a thin, strained voice, \"my name is\nMichelson. I am a business man here, and I am going to the village on\nbusiness. I was afraid I might be mistaken for some one else--you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Then what are you nosing about here for?\" the officer said angrily,\nand turned away.\n\n\"A business man,\" sneered a soldier. \"He ought to be searched, this\nbusiness man ought, so as not to be knocking about at night. A good\none in the jaw is what he needs.\"\n\n\"He's a suspicious character, officer,\" said the subaltern. \"Don't you\nthink we'd better arrest him, what?\"\n\n\"Don't,\" answered the officer lazily. \"I'm sick of them, damn 'em.\"\n\nGabriel Andersen stood there without saying anything. His eyes flashed\nstrangely in the dark by the firelight. And it was strange to see his\nshort, substantial, clean, neat figure in the field at night among the\nsoldiers, with his overcoat and cane and glasses glistening in the\nfirelight.\n\nThe soldiers left him and walked away. Gabriel Andersen remained\nstanding for a while. Then he turned and left, rapidly disappearing in\nthe darkness.\n\nThe night was drawing to a close. The air turned chilly, and the tops\nof the bushes defined themselves more clearly in the dark. Gabriel\nAndersen went again to the military post. But this time he hid,\ncrouching low as he made his way under the cover of the bushes. Behind\nhim people moved about quietly and carefully, bending the bushes,\nsilent as shadows. Next to Gabriel, on his right, walked a tall man\nwith a revolver in his hand.\n\nThe figure of a soldier on the hill outlined itself strangely,\nunexpectedly, not where they had been looking for it. It was faintly\nillumined by the gleam from the dying fire. Gabriel Andersen\nrecognised the soldier. It was the one who had proposed that he should\nbe searched. Nothing stirred in Andersen's heart. His face was cold\nand motionless, as of a man who is asleep. Round the fire the soldiers\nlay stretched out sleeping, all except the subaltern, who sat with his\nhead drooping over his knees.\n\nThe tall thin man on Andersen's right raised the revolver and pulled\nthe trigger. A momentary blinding flash, a deafening report.\n\nAndersen saw the guard lift his hands and then sit down on the ground\nclasping his bosom. From all directions short, crackling sparks\nflashed up which combined into one riving roar. The subaltern jumped\nup and dropped straight into the fire. Grey soldiers' figures moved\nabout in all directions like apparitions, throwing up their hands and\nfalling and writhing on the black earth. The young officer ran past\nAndersen, fluttering his hands like some strange, frightened bird.\nAndersen, as if he were thinking of something else, raised his cane.\nWith all his strength he hit the officer on the head, each blow\ndescending with a dull, ugly thud. The officer reeled in a circle,\nstruck a bush, and sat down after the second blow, covering his head\nwith both hands, as children do. Some one ran up and discharged a\nrevolver as if from Andersen's own hand. The officer sank together in\na heap and lunged with great force head foremost on the ground. His\nlegs twitched for a while, then he curled up quietly.\n\nThe shots ceased. Black men with white faces, ghostly grey in the\ndark, moved about the dead bodies of the soldiers, taking away their\narms and ammunition.\n\nAndersen watched all this with a cold, attentive stare. When all was\nover, he went up, took hold of the burned subaltern's legs, and tried\nto remove the body from the fire. But it was too heavy for him, and he\nlet it go.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAndersen sat motionless on the steps of the town hall, and thought. He\nthought of how he, Gabriel Andersen, with his spectacles, cane,\novercoat and poems, had lied and betrayed fifteen men. He thought it\nwas terrible, yet there was neither pity, shame nor regret in his\nheart. Were he to be set free, he knew that he, Gabriel Andersen, with\nthe spectacles and poems, would go straightway and do it again. He\ntried to examine himself, to see what was going on inside his soul.\nBut his thoughts were heavy and confused. For some reason it was more\npainful for him to think of the three men lying on the snow, looking\nat the pale disk of the far-off moon with their dead, unseeing eyes,\nthan of the murdered officer whom he had struck two dry, ugly blows on\nthe head. Of his own death he did not think. It seemed to him that he\nhad done with everything long, long ago. Something had died, had gone\nout and left him empty, and he must not think about it.\n\nAnd when they grabbed him by the shoulder and he rose, and they\nquickly led him through the garden where the cabbages raised their dry\nheads, he could not formulate a single thought.\n\nHe was conducted to the road and placed at the railing with his back\nto one of the iron bars. He fixed his spectacles, put his hands behind\nhim, and stood there with his neat, stocky body, his head slightly\ninclined to one side.\n\nAt the last moment he looked in front of him and saw rifle barrels\npointing at his head, chest and stomach, and pale faces with trembling\nlips. He distinctly saw how one barrel levelled at his forehead\nsuddenly dropped.\n\nSomething strange and incomprehensible, as if no longer of this world,\nno longer earthly, passed through Andersen's mind. He straightened\nhimself to the full height of his short body and threw back his head\nin simple pride. A strange indistinct sense of cleanness, strength and\npride filled his soul, and everything--the sun and the sky and the\npeople and the field and death--seemed to him insignificant, remote\nand useless.\n\nThe bullets hit him in the chest, in the left eye, in the stomach,\nwent through his clean coat buttoned all the way up. His glasses\nshivered into bits. He uttered a shriek, circled round, and fell with\nhis face against one of the iron bars, his one remaining eye wide\nopen. He clawed the ground with his outstretched hands as if trying to\nsupport himself.\n\nThe officer, who had turned green, rushed toward him, and senselessly\nthrust the revolver against his neck, and fired twice. Andersen\nstretched out on the ground.\n\nThe soldiers left quickly. But Andersen remained pressed flat to the\nground. The index finger of his left hand continued to quiver for\nabout ten seconds.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OUTRAGE--A TRUE STORY\n\n\n\nBY ALEKSANDR I. KUPRIN\n\n\nIt was five o'clock on a July afternoon. The heat was terrible. The\nwhole of the huge stone-built town breathed out heat like a glowing\nfurnace. The glare of the white-walled house was insufferable. The\nasphalt pavements grew soft and burned the feet. The shadows of the\nacacias spread over the cobbled road, pitiful and weary. They too\nseemed hot. The sea, pale in the sunlight, lay heavy and immobile as\none dead. Over the streets hung a white dust.\n\nIn the foyer of one of the private theatres a small committee of local\nbarristers who had undertaken to conduct the cases of those who had\nsuffered in the last pogrom against the Jews was reaching the end of\nits daily task. There were nineteen of them, all juniors, young,\nprogressive and conscientious men. The sitting was without formality,\nand white suits of duck, flannel and alpaca were in the majority. They\nsat anywhere, at little marble tables, and the chairman stood in front\nof an empty counter where chocolates were sold in the winter.\n\nThe barristers were quite exhausted by the heat which poured in\nthrough the windows, with the dazzling sunlight and the noise of the\nstreets. The proceedings went lazily and with a certain irritation.\n\nA tall young man with a fair moustache and thin hair was in the chair.\nHe was dreaming voluptuously how he would be off in an instant on his\nnew-bought bicycle to the bungalow. He would undress quickly, and\nwithout waiting to cool, still bathed in sweat, would fling himself\ninto the clear, cold, sweet-smelling sea. His whole body was enervated\nand tense, thrilled by the thought. Impatiently moving the papers\nbefore him, he spoke in a drowsy voice.\n\n\"So, Joseph Moritzovich will conduct the case of Rubinchik... Perhaps\nthere is still a statement to be made on the order of the day?\"\n\nHis youngest colleague, a short, stout Karaite, very black and lively,\nsaid in a whisper so that every one could hear: \"On the order of the\nday, the best thing would be iced _kvas_...\"\n\nThe chairman gave him a stern side-glance, but could not restrain a\nsmile. He sighed and put both his hands on the table to raise himself\nand declare the meeting closed, when the doorkeeper, who stood at the\nentrance to the theatre, suddenly moved forward and said: \"There are\nseven people outside, sir. They want to come in.\"\n\nThe chairman looked impatiently round the company.\n\n\"What is to be done, gentlemen?\"\n\nVoices were heard.\n\n\"Next time. _Basta!_\"\n\n\"Let 'em put it in writing.\"\n\n\"If they'll get it over quickly... Decide it at once.\"\n\n\"Let 'em go to the devil. Phew! It's like boiling pitch.\"\n\n\"Let them in.\" The chairman gave a sign with his head, annoyed. \"Then\nbring me a Vichy, please. But it must be cold.\"\n\nThe porter opened the door and called down the corridor: \"Come in.\nThey say you may.\"\n\nThen seven of the most surprising and unexpected individuals filed\ninto the foyer. First appeared a full-grown, confident man in a smart\nsuit, of the colour of dry sea-sand, in a magnificent pink shirt with\nwhite stripes and a crimson rose in his buttonhole. From the front his\nhead looked like an upright bean, from the side like a horizontal\nbean. His face was adorned with a strong, bushy, martial moustache. He\nwore dark blue pince-nez on his nose, on his hands straw-coloured\ngloves. In his left hand he held a black walking-stick with a silver\nmount, in his right a light blue handkerchief.\n\nThe other six produced a strange, chaotic, incongruous impression,\nexactly as though they had all hastily pooled not merely their\nclothes, but their hands, feet and heads as well. There was a man with\nthe splendid profile of a Roman senator, dressed in rags and tatters.\nAnother wore an elegant dress waistcoat, from the deep opening of\nwhich a dirty Little-Russian shirt leapt to the eye. Here were the\nunbalanced faces of the criminal type, but looking with a confidence\nthat nothing could shake. All these men, in spite of their apparent\nyouth, evidently possessed a large experience of life, an easy manner,\na bold approach, and some hidden, suspicious cunning.\n\nThe gentleman in the sandy suit bowed just his head, neatly and\neasily, and said with a half-question in his voice: \"Mr. Chairman?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am the chairman. What is your business?\"\n\n\"We--all whom you see before you,\" the gentleman began in a quiet\nvoice and turned round to indicate his companions, \"we come as\ndelegates from the United Rostov-Kharkov-and-Odessa-Nikolayev\nAssociation of Thieves.\"\n\nThe barristers began to shift in their seats.\n\nThe chairman flung himself back and opened his eyes wide. \"Association\nof _what_?\" he said, perplexed.\n\n\"The Association of Thieves,\" the gentleman in the sandy suit coolly\nrepeated. \"As for myself, my comrades did me the signal honour of\nelecting me as the spokesman of the deputation.\"\n\n\"Very ... pleased,\" the chairman said uncertainly.\n\n\"Thank you. All seven of us are ordinary thieves--naturally of\ndifferent departments. The Association has authorised us to put before\nyour esteemed Committee\"--the gentleman again made an elegant\nbow--\"our respectful demand for assistance.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand ... quite frankly ... what is the\nconnection...\" The chairman waved his hands helplessly. \"However,\nplease go on.\"\n\n\"The matter about which we have the courage and the honour to apply to\nyou, gentlemen, is very clear, very simple, and very brief. It will\ntake only six or seven minutes. I consider it my duty to warn you of\nthis beforehand, in view of the late hour and the 115 degrees that\nFahrenheit marks in the shade.\" The orator expectorated slightly and\nglanced at his superb gold watch. \"You see, in the reports that have\nlately appeared in the local papers of the melancholy and terrible\ndays of the last pogrom, there have very often been indications that\namong the instigators of the pogrom who were paid and organised by the\npolice--the dregs of society, consisting of drunkards, tramps,\nsouteneurs, and hooligans from the slums--thieves were also to be\nfound. At first we were silent, but finally we considered ourselves\nunder the necessity of protesting against such an unjust and serious\naccusation, before the face of the whole of intellectual society. I\nknow well that in the eye of the law we are offenders and enemies of\nsociety. But imagine only for a moment, gentlemen, the situation of\nthis enemy of society when he is accused wholesale of an offence which\nhe not only never committed, but which he is ready to resist with the\nwhole strength of his soul. It goes without saying that he will feel\nthe outrage of such an injustice more keenly than a normal, average,\nfortunate citizen. Now, we declare that the accusation brought against\nus is utterly devoid of all basis, not merely of fact but even of\nlogic. I intend to prove this in a few words if the honourable\ncommittee will kindly listen.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said the chairman.\n\n\"Please do ... Please ...\" was heard from the barristers, now\nanimated.\n\n\"I offer you my sincere thanks in the name of all my comrades. Believe\nme, you will never repent your attention to the representatives of our\n... well, let us say, slippery, but nevertheless difficult,\nprofession. 'So we begin,' as Giraldoni sings in the prologue to\n_Pagliacci_.\n\n\"But first I would ask your permission, Mr. Chairman, to quench my\nthirst a little... Porter, bring me a lemonade and a glass of English\nbitter, there's a good fellow. Gentlemen, I will not speak of the\nmoral aspect of our profession nor of its social importance. Doubtless\nyou know better than I the striking and brilliant paradox of Proudhon:\n_La propriete c'est le vol_--a paradox if you like, but one that has\nnever yet been refuted by the sermons of cowardly bourgeois or fat\npriests. For instance: a father accumulates a million by energetic and\nclever exploitation, and leaves it to his son--a rickety, lazy,\nignorant, degenerate idiot, a brainless maggot, a true parasite.\nPotentially a million rubles is a million working days, the absolutely\nirrational right to labour, sweat, life, and blood of a terrible\nnumber of men. Why? What is the ground of reason? Utterly unknown.\nThen why not agree with the proposition, gentlemen, that our\nprofession is to some extent as it were a correction of the excessive\naccumulation of values in the hands of individuals, and serves as a\nprotest against all the hardships, abominations, arbitrariness,\nviolence, and negligence of the human personality, against all the\nmonstrosities created by the bourgeois capitalistic organisation of\nmodern society? Sooner or later, this order of things will assuredly\nbe overturned by the social revolution. Property will pass away into\nthe limbo of melancholy memories and with it, alas! we will disappear\nfrom the face of the earth, we, _les braves chevaliers d'industrie_.\"\n\nThe orator paused to take the tray from the hands of the porter, and\nplaced it near to his hand on the table.\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen... Here, my good man, take this,... and by the\nway, when you go out shut the door close behind you.\"\n\n\"Very good, your Excellency!\" the porter bawled in jest.\n\nThe orator drank off half a glass and continued: \"However, let us\nleave aside the philosophical, social, and economic aspects of the\nquestion. I do not wish to fatigue your attention. I must nevertheless\npoint out that our profession very closely approaches the idea of that\nwhich is called art. Into it enter all the elements which go to form\nart--vocation, inspiration, fantasy, inventiveness, ambition, and a\nlong and arduous apprenticeship to the science. From it is absent\nvirtue alone, concerning which the great Karamzin wrote with such\nstupendous and fiery fascination. Gentlemen, nothing is further from\nmy intention than to trifle with you and waste your precious time with\nidle paradoxes; but I cannot avoid expounding my idea briefly. To an\noutsider's ear it sounds absurdly wild and ridiculous to speak of the\nvocation of a thief. However, I venture to assure you that this\nvocation is a reality. There are men who possess a peculiarly strong\nvisual memory, sharpness and accuracy of eye, presence of mind,\ndexterity of hand, and above all a subtle sense of touch, who are as\nit were born into God's world for the sole and special purpose of\nbecoming distinguished card-sharpers. The pickpockets' profession\ndemands extraordinary nimbleness and agility, a terrific certainty of\nmovement, not to mention a ready wit, a talent for observation and\nstrained attention. Some have a positive vocation for breaking open\nsafes: from their tenderest childhood they are attracted by the\nmysteries of every kind of complicated mechanism--bicycles, sewing\nmachines, clock-work toys and watches. Finally, gentlemen, there are\npeople with an hereditary animus against private property. You may\ncall this phenomenon degeneracy. But I tell you that you cannot entice\na true thief, and thief by vocation, into the prose of honest\nvegetation by any gingerbread reward, or by the offer of a secure\nposition, or by the gift of money, or by a woman's love: because there\nis here a permanent beauty of risk, a fascinating abyss of danger, the\ndelightful sinking of the heart, the impetuous pulsation of life, the\necstasy! You are armed with the protection of the law, by locks,\nrevolvers, telephones, police and soldiery; but we only by our own\ndexterity, cunning and fearlessness. We are the foxes, and society--is\na chicken-run guarded by dogs. Are you aware that the most artistic\nand gifted natures in our villages become horse-thieves and poachers?\nWhat would you have? Life is so meagre, so insipid, so intolerably\ndull to eager and high-spirited souls!\n\n\"I pass on to inspiration. Gentlemen, doubtless you have had to read\nof thefts that were supernatural in design and execution. In the\nheadlines of the newspapers they are called 'An Amazing Robbery,' or\n'An Ingenious Swindle,' or again 'A Clever Ruse of the Gangsters.' In\nsuch cases our bourgeois paterfamilias waves his hands and exclaims:\n'What a terrible thing! If only their abilities were turned to\ngood--their inventiveness, their amazing knowledge of human\npsychology, their self-possession, their fearlessness, their\nincomparable histrionic powers! What extraordinary benefits they would\nbring to the country!' But it is well known that the bourgeois\npaterfamilias was specially devised by Heaven to utter commonplaces\nand trivialities. I myself sometimes--we thieves are sentimental\npeople, I confess--I myself sometimes admire a beautiful sunset in\nAleksandra Park or by the sea-shore. And I am always certain\nbeforehand that some one near me will say with infallible _aplomb_:\n'Look at it. If it were put into picture no one would ever believe\nit!' I turn round and naturally I see a self-satisfied, full-fed\npaterfamilias, who delights in repeating some one else's silly\nstatement as though it were his own. As for our dear country, the\nbourgeois paterfamilias looks upon it as though it were a roast\nturkey. If you've managed to cut the best part of the bird for\nyourself, eat it quietly in a comfortable corner and praise God. But\nhe's not really the important person. I was led away by my detestation\nof vulgarity and I apologise for the digression. The real point is\nthat genius and inspiration, even when they are not devoted to the\nservice of the Orthodox Church, remain rare and beautiful things.\nProgress is a law--and theft too has its creation.\n\n\"Finally, our profession is by no means as easy and pleasant as it\nseems to the first glance. It demands long experience, constant\npractice, slow and painful apprenticeship. It comprises in itself\nhundreds of supple, skilful processes that the cleverest juggler\ncannot compass. That I may not give you only empty words, gentlemen, I\nwill perform a few experiments before you now. I ask you to have every\nconfidence in the demonstrators. We are all at present in the\nenjoyment of legal freedom, and though we are usually watched, and\nevery one of us is known by face, and our photographs adorn the albums\nof all detective departments, for the time being we are not under the\nnecessity of hiding ourselves from anybody. If any one of you should\nrecognise any of us in the future under different circumstances, we\nask you earnestly always to act in accordance with your professional\nduties and your obligations as citizens. In grateful return for your\nkind attention we have decided to declare your property inviolable,\nand to invest it with a thieves' taboo. However, I proceed to\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe orator turned round and gave an order: \"Sesoi the Great, will you\ncome this way!\"\n\nAn enormous fellow with a stoop, whose hands reached to his knees,\nwithout a forehead or a neck, like a big, fair Hercules, came forward.\nHe grinned stupidly and rubbed his left eyebrow in his confusion.\n\n\"Can't do nothin' here,\" he said hoarsely.\n\nThe gentleman in the sandy suit spoke for him, turning to the\ncommittee.\n\n\"Gentlemen, before you stands a respected member of our association.\nHis specialty is breaking open safes, iron strong boxes, and other\nreceptacles for monetary tokens. In his night work he sometimes avails\nhimself of the electric current of the lighting installation for\nfusing metals. Unfortunately he has nothing on which he can\ndemonstrate the best items of his repertoire. He will open the most\nelaborate lock irreproachably... By the way, this door here, it's\nlocked, is it not?\"\n\nEvery one turned to look at the door, on which a printed notice hung:\n\"Stage Door. Strictly Private.\"\n\n\"Yes, the door's locked, evidently,\" the chairman agreed.\n\n\"Admirable. Sesoi the Great, will you be so kind?\"\n\n\"'Tain't nothin' at all,\" said the giant leisurely.\n\nHe went close to the door, shook it cautiously with his hand, took out\nof his pocket a small bright instrument, bent down to the keyhole,\nmade some almost imperceptible movements with the tool, suddenly\nstraightened and flung the door wide in silence. The chairman had his\nwatch in his hands. The whole affair took only ten seconds.\n\n\"Thank you, Sesoi the Great,\" said the gentleman in the sandy suit\npolitely. \"You may go back to your seat.\"\n\nBut the chairman interrupted in some alarm: \"Excuse me. This is all\nvery interesting and instructive, but ... is it included in your\nesteemed colleague's profession to be able to lock the door again?\"\n\n\"Ah, _mille pardons_.\" The gentleman bowed hurriedly. \"It slipped my\nmind. Sesoi the Great, would you oblige?\"\n\nThe door was locked with the same adroitness and the same silence. The\nesteemed colleague waddled back to his friends, grinning.\n\n\"Now I will have the honour to show you the skill of one of our\ncomrades who is in the line of picking pockets in theatres and\nrailway-stations,\" continued the orator. \"He is still very young, but\nyou may to some extent judge from the delicacy of his present work of\nthe heights he will attain by diligence. Yasha!\" A swarthy youth in a\nblue silk blouse and long glac� boots, like a gipsy, came forward with\na swagger, fingering the tassels of his belt, and merrily screwing up\nhis big, impudent black eyes with yellow whites.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the gentleman in the sandy suit persuasively, \"I\nmust ask if one of you would be kind enough to submit himself to a\nlittle experiment. I assure you this will be an exhibition only, just\na game.\"\n\nHe looked round over the seated company.\n\nThe short plump Karaite, black as a beetle, came forward from his\ntable.\n\n\"At your service,\" he said amusedly.\n\n\"Yasha!\" The orator signed with his head.\n\nYasha came close to the solicitor. On his left arm, which was bent,\nhung a bright-coloured, figured scarf.\n\n\"Suppose yer in church or at the bar in one of the halls,--or watchin'\na circus,\" he began in a sugary, fluent voice. \"I see straight\noff--there's a toff... Excuse me, sir. Suppose you're the toff.\nThere's no offence--just means a rich gent, decent enough, but don't\nknow his way about. First--what's he likely to have about 'im? All\nsorts. Mostly, a ticker and a chain. Whereabouts does he keep 'em?\nSomewhere in his top vest pocket--here. Others have 'em in the bottom\npocket. Just here. Purse--most always in the trousers, except when a\ngreeny keeps it in his jacket. Cigar-case. Have a look first what it\nis--gold, silver--with a monogram. Leather--what decent man'd soil his\nhands? Cigar-case. Seven pockets: here, here, here, up there, there,\nhere and here again. That's right, ain't it? That's how you go to\nwork.\"\n\nAs he spoke the young man smiled. His eyes shone straight into the\nbarrister's. With a quick, dexterous movement of his right hand he\npointed to various portions of his clothes.\n\n\"Then again you might see a pin here in the tie. However we do not\nappropriate. Such _gents_ nowadays--they hardly ever wear a real\nstone. Then I comes up to him. I begin straight off to talk to him\nlike a gent: 'Sir, would you be so kind as to give me a light from\nyour cigarette'--or something of the sort. At any rate, I enter into\nconversation. What's next? I look him straight in the peepers, just\nlike this. Only two of me fingers are at it--just this and this.\"\nYasha lifted two fingers of his right hand on a level with the\nsolicitor's face, the forefinger and the middle finger and moved them\nabout.\n\n\"D' you see? With these two fingers I run over the whole pianner.\nNothin' wonderful in it: one, two, three--ready. Any man who wasn't\nstupid could learn easily. That's all it is. Most ordinary business. I\nthank you.\"\n\nThe pickpocket swung on his heel as if to return to his seat.\n\n\"Yasha!\" The gentleman in the sandy suit said with meaning weight.\n\"Yasha!\" he repeated sternly.\n\nYasha stopped. His back was turned to the barrister, but be evidently\ngave his representative an imploring look, because the latter frowned\nand shook his head.\n\n\"Yasha!\" he said for the third time, in a threatening tone.\n\n\"Huh!\" The young thief grunted in vexation and turned to face the\nsolicitor. \"Where's your little watch, sir?\" he said in a piping\nvoice.\n\n\"Oh!\" the Karaite brought himself up sharp.\n\n\"You see--now you say 'Oh!'\" Yasha continued reproachfully. \"All the\nwhile you were admiring me right hand, I was operatin' yer watch with\nmy left. Just with these two little fingers, under the scarf. That's\nwhy we carry a scarf. Since your chain's not worth anything--a present\nfrom some _mamselle_ and the watch is a gold one, I've left you the\nchain as a keepsake. Take it,\" he added with a sigh, holding out the\nwatch.\n\n\"But ... That is clever,\" the barrister said in confusion. \"I didn't\nnotice it at all.\"\n\n\"That's our business,\" Yasha said with pride.\n\nHe swaggered back to his comrades. Meantime the orator took a drink\nfrom his glass and continued.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, our next collaborator will give you an exhibition of\nsome ordinary card tricks, which are worked at fairs, on steamboats\nand railways. With three cards, for instance, an ace, a queen, and a\nsix, he can quite easily... But perhaps you are tired of these\ndemonstrations, gentlemen.\"...\n\n\"Not at all. It's extremely interesting,\" the chairman answered\naffably. \"I should like to ask one question--that is if it is not too\nindiscreet--what is your own specialty?\"\n\n\"Mine... H'm... No, how could it be an indiscretion?... I work the big\ndiamond shops ... and my other business is banks,\" answered the orator\nwith a modest smile. \"Don't think this occupation is easier than\nothers. Enough that I know four European languages, German, French,\nEnglish, and Italian, not to mention Polish, Ukrainian and Yiddish.\nBut shall I show you some more experiments, Mr. Chairman?\"\n\nThe chairman looked at his watch.\n\n\"Unfortunately the time is too short,\" he said. \"Wouldn't it be better\nto pass on to the substance of your business? Besides, the experiments\nwe have just seen have amply convinced us of the talent of your\nesteemed associates... Am I not right, Isaac Abramovich?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes ... absolutely,\" the Karaite barrister readily confirmed.\n\n\"Admirable,\" the gentleman in the sandy suit kindly agreed. \"My dear\nCount\"--he turned to a blond, curly-haired man, with a face like a\nbilliard-maker on a bank-holiday--\"put your instruments away. They\nwill not be wanted. I have only a few words more to say, gentlemen.\nNow that you have convinced yourselves that our art, although it does\nnot enjoy the patronage of high-placed individuals, is nevertheless an\nart; and you have probably come to my opinion that this art is one\nwhich demands many personal qualities besides constant labour, danger,\nand unpleasant misunderstandings--you will also, I hope, believe that\nit is possible to become attached to its practice and to love and\nesteem it, however strange that may appear at first sight. Picture to\nyourselves that a famous poet of talent, whose tales and poems adorn\nthe pages of our best magazines, is suddenly offered the chance of\nwriting verses at a penny a line, signed into the bargain, as an\nadvertisement for 'Cigarettes Jasmine'--or that a slander was spread\nabout one of you distinguished barristers, accusing you of making a\nbusiness of concocting evidence for divorce cases, or of writing\npetitions from the cabmen to the governor in public-houses! Certainly\nyour relatives, friends and acquaintances wouldn't believe it. But the\nrumour has already done its poisonous work, and you have to live\nthrough minutes of torture. Now picture to yourselves that such a\ndisgraceful and vexatious slander, started by God knows whom, begins\nto threaten not only your good name and your quiet digestion, but your\nfreedom, your health, and even your life!\n\n\"This is the position of us thieves, now being slandered by the\nnewspapers. I must explain. There is in existence a class of\nscum--_passez-moi le mot_--whom we call their 'Mothers' Darlings.'\nWith these we are unfortunately confused. They have neither shame nor\nconscience, a dissipated riff-raff, mothers' useless darlings, idle,\nclumsy drones, shop assistants who commit unskilful thefts. He thinks\nnothing of living on his mistress, a prostitute, like the male\nmackerel, who always swims after the female and lives on her\nexcrements. He is capable of robbing a child with violence in a dark\nalley, in order to get a penny; he will kill a man in his sleep and\ntorture an old woman. These men are the pests of our profession. For\nthem the beauties and the traditions of the art have no existence.\nThey watch us real, talented thieves like a pack of jackals after a\nlion. Suppose I've managed to bring off an important job--we won't\nmention the fact that I have to leave two-thirds of what I get to the\nreceivers who sell the goods and discount the notes, or the customary\nsubsidies to our incorruptible police--I still have to share out\nsomething to each one of these parasites, who have got wind of my job,\nby accident, hearsay, or a casual glance.\n\n\"So we call them _Motients_, which means 'half,' a corruption of\n_moiti�_ ... Original etymology. I pay him only because he knows and\nmay inform against me. And it mostly happens that even when he's got\nhis share he runs off to the police in order to get another dollar.\nWe, honest thieves... Yes, you may laugh, gentlemen, but I repeat it:\nwe honest thieves detest these reptiles. We have another name for\nthem, a stigma of ignominy; but I dare not utter it here out of\nrespect for the place and for my audience. Oh, yes, they would gladly\naccept an invitation to a pogrom. The thought that we may be confused\nwith them is a hundred times more insulting to us even than the\naccusation of taking part in a pogrom.\n\n\"Gentlemen! While I have been speaking I have often noticed smiles on\nyour faces. I understand you. Our presence here, our application for\nyour assistance, and above all the unexpectedness of such a phenomenon\nas a systematic organisation of thieves, with delegates who are\nthieves, and a leader of the deputation, also a thief by\nprofession--it is all so original that it must inevitably arouse a\nsmile. But now I will speak from the depth of my heart. Let us be rid\nof our outward wrappings, gentlemen, let us speak as men to men.\n\n\"Almost all of us are educated, and all love books. We don't only read\nthe adventures of Roqueambole, as the realistic writers say of us. Do\nyou think our hearts did not bleed and our cheeks did not burn from\nshame, as though we had been slapped in the face, all the time that\nthis unfortunate, disgraceful, accursed, cowardly war lasted. Do you\nreally think that our souls do not flame with anger when our country\nis lashed with Cossack-whips, and trodden under foot, shot and spit at\nby mad, exasperated men? Will you not believe that we thieves meet\nevery step towards the liberation to come with a thrill of ecstasy?\n\n\"We understand, every one of us--perhaps only a little less than you\nbarristers, gentlemen--the real sense of the pogroms. Every time that\nsome dastardly event or some ignominious failure has occurred, after\nexecuting a martyr in a dark corner of a fortress, or after deceiving\npublic confidence, some one who is hidden and unapproachable gets\nfrightened of the people's anger and diverts its vicious element upon\nthe heads of innocent Jews. Whose diabolical mind invents these\npogroms--these titanic blood-lettings, these cannibal amusements for\nthe dark, bestial souls?\n\n\"We all see with certain clearness that the last convulsions of the\nbureaucracy are at hand. Forgive me if I present it imaginatively.\nThere was a people that had a chief temple, wherein dwelt a\nbloodthirsty deity, behind a curtain, guarded by priests. Once\nfearless hands tore the curtain away. Then all the people saw, instead\nof a god, a huge, shaggy, voracious spider, like a loathsome\ncuttlefish. They beat it and shoot at it: it is dismembered already;\nbut still in the frenzy of its final agony it stretches over all the\nancient temple its disgusting, clawing tentacles. And the priests,\nthemselves under sentence of death, push into the monster's grasp all\nwhom they can seize in their terrified, trembling fingers.\n\n\"Forgive me. What I have said is probably wild and incoherent. But I\nam somewhat agitated. Forgive me. I continue. We thieves by profession\nknow better than any one else how these pogroms were organised. We\nwander everywhere: into public houses, markets, tea-shops,\ndoss-houses, public places, the harbour. We can swear before God and\nman and posterity that we have seen how the police organise the\nmassacres, without shame and almost without concealment. We know them\nall by face, in uniform or disguise. They invited many of us to take\npart; but there was none so vile among us as to give even the outward\nconsent that fear might have extorted.\n\n\"You know, of course, how the various strata of Russian society behave\ntowards the police? It is not even respected by those who avail\nthemselves of its dark services. But we despise and hate it three, ten\ntimes more--not because many of us have been tortured in the detective\ndepartments, which are just chambers of horror, beaten almost to\ndeath, beaten with whips of ox-hide and of rubber in order to extort a\nconfession or to make us betray a comrade. Yes, we hate them for that\ntoo. But we thieves, all of us who have been in prison, have a mad\npassion for freedom. Therefore we despise our gaolers with all the\nhatred that a human heart can feel. I will speak for myself. I have\nbeen tortured three times by police detectives till I was half dead.\nMy lungs and liver have been shattered. In the mornings I spit blood\nuntil I can breathe no more. But if I were told that I will be spared\na fourth flogging only by shaking hands with a chief of the detective\npolice, I would refuse to do it!\n\n\"And then the newspapers say that we took from these hands\nJudas-money, dripping with human blood. No, gentlemen, it is a slander\nwhich stabs our very soul, and inflicts insufferable pain. Not money,\nnor threats, nor promises will suffice to make us mercenary murderers\nof our brethren, nor accomplices with them.\"\n\n\"Never ... No ... No ... ,\" his comrades standing behind him began to\nmurmur.\n\n\"I will say more,\" the thief continued. \"Many of us protected the\nvictims during this pogrom. Our friend, called Sesoi the Great--you\nhave just seen him, gentlemen--was then lodging with a Jewish\nbraid-maker on the Moldavanka. With a poker in his hands he defended\nhis landlord from a great horde of assassins. It is true, Sesoi the\nGreat is a man of enormous physical strength, and this is well known\nto many of the inhabitants of the Moldavanka. But you must agree,\ngentlemen, that in these moments Sesoi the Great looked straight into\nthe face of death. Our comrade Martin the Miner--this gentleman here\"\n--the orator pointed to a pale, bearded man with beautiful eyes who\nwas holding himself in the background--\"saved an old Jewess, whom he\nhad never seen before, who was being pursued by a crowd of these\n_canaille_. They broke his head with a crowbar for his pains, smashed\nhis arm in two places and splintered a rib. He is only just out of\nhospital. That is the way our most ardent and determined members\nacted. The others trembled for anger and wept for their own impotence.\n\n\"None of us will forget the horrors of those bloody days and bloody\nnights lit up by the glare of fires, those sobbing women, those little\nchildren's bodies torn to pieces and left lying in the street. But for\nall that not one of us thinks that the police and the mob are the real\norigin of the evil. These tiny, stupid, loathsome vermin are only a\nsenseless fist that is governed by a vile, calculating mind, moved by\na diabolical will.\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" the orator continued, \"we thieves have nevertheless\nmerited your legal contempt. But when you, noble gentlemen, need the\nhelp of clever, brave, obedient men at the barricades, men who will be\nready to meet death with a song and a jest on their lips for the most\nglorious word in the world--Freedom--will you cast us off then and\norder us away because of an inveterate revulsion? Damn it all, the\nfirst victim in the French Revolution was a prostitute. She jumped up\non to a barricade, with her skirt caught elegantly up into her hand\nand called out: 'Which of you soldiers will dare to shoot a woman?'\nYes, by God.\" The orator exclaimed aloud and brought down his fist on\nto the marble table top: \"They killed her, but her action was\nmagnificent, and the beauty of her words immortal.\n\n\"If you should drive us away on the great day, we will turn to you and\nsay: 'You spotless Cherubim--if human thoughts had the power to wound,\nkill, and rob man of honour and property, then which of you innocent\ndoves would not deserve the knout and imprisonment for life?' Then we\nwill go away from you and build our own gay, sporting, desperate\nthieves' barricade, and will die with such united songs on our lips\nthat you will envy us, you who are whiter than snow!\n\n\"But I have been once more carried away. Forgive me. I am at the end.\nYou now see, gentlemen, what feelings the newspaper slanders have\nexcited in us. Believe in our sincerity and do what you can to remove\nthe filthy stain which has so unjustly been cast upon us. I have\nfinished.\"\n\nHe went away from the table and joined his comrades. The barristers\nwere whispering in an undertone, very much as the magistrates of the\nbench at sessions. Then the chairman rose.\n\n\"We trust you absolutely, and we will make every effort to clear your\nassociation of this most grievous charge. At the same time my\ncolleagues have authorised me, gentlemen, to convey to you their deep\nrespect for your passionate feelings as citizens. And for my own part\nI ask the leader of the deputation for permission to shake him by the\nhand.\"\n\nThe two men, both tall and serious, held each other's hands in a\nstrong, masculine grip.\n\nThe barristers were leaving the theatre; but four of them hung back a\nlittle beside the clothes rack in the hall. Isaac Abramovich could not\nfind his new, smart grey hat anywhere. In its place on the wooden peg\nhung a cloth cap jauntily flattened in on either side.\n\n\"Yasha!\" The stern voice of the orator was suddenly heard from the\nother side of the door. \"Yasha! It's the last time I'll speak to you,\ncurse you! ... Do you hear?\" The heavy door opened wide. The gentleman\nin the sandy suit entered. In his hands he held Isaac Abramovich's\nhat; on his face was a well-bred smile.\n\n\"Gentlemen, for Heaven's sake forgive us--an odd little\nmisunderstanding. One of our comrades exchanged his hat by accident...\nOh, it is yours! A thousand pardons. Doorkeeper! Why don't you keep an\neye on things, my good fellow, eh? Just give me that cap, there. Once\nmore, I ask you to forgive me, gentlemen.\"\n\nWith a pleasant bow and the same well-bred smile he made his way\nquickly into the street.", "title": "Best Russian Short Stories"}
