{"summary": "Volpone (The Fox) is a Venetian gentleman who pretends to be on his deathbed after a long illness in order to dupe Voltore (The Vulture), Corbaccio (The Raven) and Corvino (The Crow), three men who aspire to inherit his fortune. In their turns, each man arrives to Volpone’s house bearing a luxurious gift, intent upon having his name inscribed to the will of Volpone, as his heir. Mosca (The Fly), Volpone’s parasite servant, encourages each man, Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino, to believe that he has been named heir to Volpone’s fortune; in the course of which, Mosca persuades Corbaccio to disinherit his own son in favour of Volpone.\nTo Volpone, Mosca mentions that Corvino has a beautiful wife, Celia. Disguised as Scoto the Mountebank, Volpone goes to see Celia. Corvino drives away \"Scoto\" (Volpone), who then becomes insistent that he must possess Celia as his own. Mosca deceives Corvino into believing that the moribund Volpone requires sexual congress with a young woman in order to revive and rise from his deathbed. The cupidity of Corvino leads him to offer Celia, his wife, in order to please Volpone’s voluptuousness, and so become his heir.\nJust before Corvino and Celia are due to arrive for her sexual congress with Volpone, Corbaccio’s son Bonario arrives to catch his father in the act of disinheriting him. Mosca guides Corbaccio to a sideroom, and Volpone and Celia are left alone. Upon failing to seduce Celia with fantastic promises of luxury and wealth, Volpone attempts to rape her. Bonario comes forward to rescue Celia. In the ensuing trial at court, the truth of the matter is well-buried by Voltore, using his prowess as a lawyer to convince the Avocatori, with false evidence given by Mosca, Volpone and the other dupes.\nThere are episodes involving the English travellers Sir and Lady Politic Would-Be and Peregrine. Sir Politic constantly talks of plots and his outlandish business plans, while Lady Would-Be annoys Volpone with her ceaseless talking. Mosca co-ordinates a mix-up between them which leaves Peregrine, a more sophisticated traveller, feeling offended. He humiliates Sir Politick by telling him he is to be arrested for sedition and making him hide inside a giant tortoise shell.\nVolpone insists on disguising himself and having it announced that he has died and willed his wealth to Mosca, which enrages the would-be heirs Voltore, Corbaccio and Corvino, and everyone returns to court to dispute the will of Volpone, who becomes entangled in the circumstances of the plots that he and Mosca devised. Despite Volpone’s pleas, Mosca refuses to relinquish his new role as a rich man; Volpone reveals himself, and his deceits, in order to topple the rich Mosca; in the event, Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca and Volpone himself finally are punished.\n\n", "full_text": "VOLPONE; OR, THE FOX\n\n\nBy Ben Jonson\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first\nliterary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose, satire,\nand criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the\nsubsequent course of English letters: such was Ben Jonson, and as such\nhis strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled, at\nleast in his age.\n\nBen Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the\nworld Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of Annandale, over\nthe Solway, whence he migrated to England. Jonson's father lost his\nestate under Queen Mary, \"having been cast into prison and forfeited.\"\nHe entered the church, but died a month before his illustrious son was\nborn, leaving his widow and child in poverty. Jonson's birthplace was\nWestminster, and the time of his birth early in 1573. He was thus nearly\nten years Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better\nborn. But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage. His\nmother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was for a\ntime apprenticed to the trade. As a youth he attracted the attention of\nthe famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at Westminster School,\nand there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning.\nJonson always held Camden in veneration, acknowledging that to him he\nowed,\n\n     \"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"\n\nand dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His Humour,\"\nto him. It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either university,\nthough Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted into St. John's\nCollege, Cambridge.\" He tells us that he took no degree, but was later\n\"Master of Arts in both the universities, by their favour, not his\nstudy.\" When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as a soldier, trailing his\npike in Flanders in the protracted wars of William the Silent against\nthe Spanish. Jonson was a large and raw-boned lad; he became by his\nown account in time exceedingly bulky. In chat with his friend William\nDrummond of Hawthornden, Jonson told how \"in his service in the Low\nCountries he had, in the face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and\ntaken opima spolia from him;\" and how \"since his coming to England,\nbeing appealed to the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt\nhim in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\" Jonson's\nreach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his prowess\nlost nothing in the telling. Obviously Jonson was brave, combative, and\nnot averse to talking of himself and his doings.\n\nIn 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless. Soon after he married,\nalmost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare. He told\nDrummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\"; for some\nyears he lived apart from her in the household of Lord Albany. Yet two\ntouching epitaphs among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On my first daughter,\" and\n\"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the poet's family affections.\nThe daughter died in infancy, the son of the plague; another son grew up\nto manhood little credit to his father whom he survived. We know nothing\nbeyond this of Jonson's domestic life.\n\nHow soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the theatrical\nprofession\" we do not know. In 1593, Marlowe made his tragic exit from\nlife, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the popular stage,\nhad preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before.\nShakespeare already had the running to himself. Jonson appears first in\nthe employment of Philip Henslowe, the exploiter of several troupes of\nplayers, manager, and father-in-law of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn.\nFrom entries in \"Henslowe's Diary,\" a species of theatrical account book\nwhich has been handed down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with\nthe Admiral's men; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597,\npaying back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what\nis not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same year,\nHenslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed the plot unto\nthe company which he promised to deliver unto the company at Christmas\nnext.\" In the next August Jonson was in collaboration with Chettle and\nPorter in a play called \"Hot Anger Soon Cold.\" All this points to an\nassociation with Henslowe of some duration, as no mere tyro would be\nthus paid in advance upon mere promise. From allusions in Dekker's play,\n\"Satiromastix,\" it appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as\nan actor, and that he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking\nat one time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, \"The Spanish\nTragedy.\" By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy\ncircumstances, had begun to receive recognition. Francis Meres--well\nknown for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the\nGreek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his mention\ntherein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title--accords to Ben Jonson\na place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of some surprise, as\nno known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date has come down to us.\nThat Jonson was at work on tragedy, however, is proved by the entries in\nHenslowe of at least three tragedies, now lost, in which he had a\nhand. These are \"Page of Plymouth,\" \"King Robert II. of Scotland,\"\nand \"Richard Crookback.\" But all of these came later, on his return to\nHenslowe, and range from August 1599 to June 1602.\n\nReturning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for\na time Jonson's relations with Henslowe. In a letter to Alleyn, dated\nSeptember 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one of my\ncompany that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer], for he is\nslain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson, bricklayer.\"\nThe last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson in his displeasure\nrather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to\nthis time. It is fair to Jonson to remark however, that his adversary\nappears to have been a notorious fire-eater who had shortly before\nkilled one Feeke in a similar squabble. Duelling was a frequent\noccurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility; it was an\nimpudent breach of the peace on the part of a player. This duel is the\none which Jonson described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson\nwas duly arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted. He was sent to\nprison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\" It is\na thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law permitting\nconvicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit of clergy,\nJonson might have been hanged for this deed. The circumstance that the\npoet could read and write saved him; and he received only a brand of the\nletter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left thumb. While in jail Jonson became a\nRoman Catholic; but he returned to the faith of the Church of England a\ndozen years later.\n\nOn his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former associates,\nJonson offered his services as a playwright to Henslowe's rivals,\nthe Lord Chamberlain's company, in which Shakespeare was a prominent\nshareholder. A tradition of long standing, though not susceptible\nof proof in a court of law, narrates that Jonson had submitted the\nmanuscript of \"Every Man in His Humour\" to the Chamberlain's men and had\nreceived from the company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back,\nread the play himself, and at once accepted it. Whether this story is\ntrue or not, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted\nby Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with\nShakespeare taking a part. The evidence of this is contained in the list\nof actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's works, 1616.\nBut it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare's name stands first\nin the list of actors and the elder Kno'well first in the dramatis\npersonae, that Shakespeare took that particular part. The order of a\nlist of Elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or\npriority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded\nto the list of characters.\n\n\"Every Man in His Humour\" was an immediate success, and with it Jonson's\nreputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established\nonce and for all. This could have been by no means Jonson's earliest\ncomedy, and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of \"our\nbest in tragedy.\" Indeed, one of Jonson's extant comedies, \"The Case\nis Altered,\" but one never claimed by him or published as his, must\ncertainly have preceded \"Every Man in His Humour\" on the stage. The\nformer play may be described as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of\nPlautus. (It combines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\"\nand the \"Aulularia\" of that dramatist). But the pretty story of the\nbeggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the\nclassics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had\nalready popularised on the stage. Jonson never again produced so fresh\nand lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other respects\n\"The Case is Altered\" is not a conspicuous play, and, save for the\nsatirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio Balladino and\nGabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least characteristic of the\ncomedies of Jonson.\n\n\"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer of\n1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making play;\nand this view is not unjustified. As to plot, it tells little more than\nhow an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly\nstudious son to London, and there observe his life with the gallants of\nthe time. The real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in\nthe theory upon which they are conceived. Ben Jonson had theories about\npoetry and the drama, and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in\nexperimenting with them in his plays. This makes Jonson, like Dryden\nin his time, and Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with;\nparticularly when we remember that many of Jonson's notions came for\na time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English\npoetry. First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed in\nrestraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned\nand irresponsible Renaissance spirit. Jonson believed that there was a\nprofessional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of\nthe best examples, and he found these examples for the most part among\nthe ancients. To confine our attention to the drama, Jonson objected to\nthe amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and\nset himself to do something different; and the first and most striking\nthing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of\nhumours.\n\nAs Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote his\nown words as to \"humour.\" A humour, according to Jonson, was a bias of\ndisposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which\n\n     \"Some one peculiar quality\n     Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw\n     All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,\n     In their confluctions, all to run one way.\"\n\n     But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:\n\n     \"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,\n     The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,\n     A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot\n     On his French garters, should affect a humour!\n     O, it is more than most ridiculous.\"\n\nJonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage personages\non the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable simplification\nof actual life be it observed in passing); and, placing these typified\ntraits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast, struck the\nspark of comedy. Downright, as his name indicates, is \"a plain squire\";\nBobadill's humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally, and with\ndelightfully comic effect, a coward; Brainworm's humour is the finding\nout of things to the end of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled\nin the end himself. But it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the\nsuccess of \"Every Man in His Humour.\" The play is admirably written\nand each character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on\nobservation of the men of the London of the day. Jonson was neither in\nthis, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that he wrote),\na supine classicist, urging that English drama return to a slavish\nadherence to classical conditions. He says as to the laws of the old\ncomedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the unities of time and place\nand the use of chorus): \"I see not then, but we should enjoy the same\nlicence, or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they\n[the ancients] did; and not be tied to those strict and regular forms\nwhich the niceness of a few, who are nothing but form, would thrust upon\nus.\" \"Every Man in His Humour\" is written in prose, a novel practice\nwhich Jonson had of his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly. Even the word\n\"humour\" seems to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman\nbefore Jonson's use of it. Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only\na heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,\nviewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent\nspecies of comedy in the language. None the less, Jonson's comedy\nmerited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which\ncomedy long continued to run. To mention only Shakespeare's Falstaff\nand his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the rest, whether in\n\"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" all are conceived in\nthe spirit of humours. So are the captains, Welsh, Scotch, and Irish\nof \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially later; though Shakespeare never\nemployed the method of humours for an important personage. It was not\nJonson's fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing\nthat he had reprobated, that is, degrade \"the humour: into an oddity of\nspeech, an eccentricity of manner, of dress, or cut of beard. There was\nan anonymous play called \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\" Chapman wrote \"A\nHumourous Day's Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later,\n\"The Humourous Lieutenant,\" and Jonson, besides \"Every Man Out of His\nHumour,\" returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in\n\"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled.\"\n\nWith the performance of \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" in 1599, by\nShakespeare's company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in\nJonson's career. Despite his many real virtues, if there is one feature\nmore than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his arrogance; and\nto this may be added his self-righteousness, especially under criticism\nor satire. \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" is the first of three \"comical\nsatires\" which Jonson contributed to what Dekker called the poetomachia\nor war of the theatres as recent critics have named it. This play as a\nfabric of plot is a very slight affair; but as a satirical picture\nof the manners of the time, proceeding by means of vivid caricature,\ncouched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that righteous\nindignation which must lie at the heart of all true satire--as a\nrealisation, in short, of the classical ideal of comedy--there had been\nnothing like Jonson's comedy since the days of Aristophanes. \"Every Man\nin His Humour,\" like the two plays that follow it, contains two kinds\nof attack, the critical or generally satiric, levelled at abuses\nand corruptions in the abstract; and the personal, in which specific\napplication is made of all this in the lampooning of poets and others,\nJonson's contemporaries. The method of personal attack by actual\ncaricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama.\nAristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and Socrates in\n\"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in English drama this\nkind of thing is alluded to again and again. What Jonson really did,\nwas to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art, and make out of a casual\nburlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary pretensions\nand permanency. With the arrogant attitude mentioned above and his\nuncommon eloquence in scorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no\nwonder that Jonson soon involved himself in literary and even personal\nquarrels with his fellow-authors. The circumstances of the origin of\nthis 'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have written on the\ntopic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer. The origin\nof the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references, apparently to\nJonson, contained in \"The Scourge of Villainy,\" a satire in regular form\nafter the manner of the ancients by John Marston, a fellow playwright,\nsubsequent friend and collaborator of Jonson's. On the other hand,\nepigrams of Jonson have been discovered (49, 68, and 100) variously\ncharging \"playwright\" (reasonably identified with Marston) with\nscurrility, cowardice, and plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams\ncannot be ascertained with certainty. Jonson's own statement of the\nmatter to Drummond runs: \"He had many quarrels with Marston, beat\nhim, and took his pistol from him, wrote his \"Poetaster\" on him; the\nbeginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on the stage.\"*\n\n     * The best account of this whole subject is to be\n     found in the edition of \"Poetaster\" and \"Satiromastrix\" by\n     J. H. Penniman in \"Belles Lettres Series\" shortly to appear.\n     See also his earlier work, \"The War of the Theatres,\" 1892,\n     and the excellent contributions to the subject by H. C. Hart\n     in \"Notes and Queries,\" and in his edition of Jonson, 1906.\n\nHere at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the\nquarrel are known. \"Histriomastix,\" a play revised by Marston in 1598,\nhas been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus \"represented on\nthe stage\"; although the personage in question, Chrisogonus, a poet,\nsatirist, and translator, poor but proud, and contemptuous of the common\nherd, seems rather a complimentary portrait of Jonson than a caricature.\nAs to the personages actually ridiculed in \"Every Man Out of His\nHumour,\" Carlo Buffone was formerly thought certainly to be Marston,\nas he was described as \"a public, scurrilous, and profane jester,\" and\nelsewhere as the \"grand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of\nthe time\" (Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston's\nwork being entitled \"The Scourge of Villainy\"). Apparently we must now\nprefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of whom\ngossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold impertinent\nfellow... a perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room. So\none time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth\n(that is his upper and nether beard) with hard wax. From him Ben Jonson\ntakes his Carlo Buffone ['i.e.', jester] in \"Every Man in His Humour\"\n['sic'].\" Is it conceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing\nMarston, and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional\nconfusion of \"the grand scourge or second untruss\" with \"the scurrilous\nand profane\" Chester?\n\nWe have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the\ndifficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in\nthese forgotten quarrels. We are on sounder ground of fact in recording\nother manifestations of Jonson's enmity. In \"The Case is Altered\" there\nis clear ridicule in the character Antonio Balladino of Anthony Munday,\npageant-poet of the city, translator of romances and playwright as well.\nIn \"Every Man in His Humour\" there is certainly a caricature of Samuel\nDaniel, accepted poet of the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of\nfashion. These men held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his\ntalents better entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies.\nIt seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his\nsatire through \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" and \"Cynthia's Revels,\"\nDaniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as\nPuntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire once\nmore. Jonson's literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again and again,\nin the entertainments that welcomed King James on his way to London, in\nthe masques at court, and in the pastoral drama. As to Jonson's personal\nambitions with respect to these two men, it is notable that he became,\nnot pageant-poet, but chronologer to the City of London; and that, on\nthe accession of the new king, he came soon to triumph over Daniel as\nthe accepted entertainer of royalty.\n\n\"Cynthia's Revels,\" the second \"comical satire,\" was acted in 1600, and,\nas a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible than \"Every\nMan Out of His Humour.\" Here personal satire seems to have absorbed\neverything, and while much of the caricature is admirable, especially in\nthe detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue, the central idea\nof a fountain of self-love is not very well carried out, and the persons\nrevert at times to abstractions, the action to allegory. It adds to our\nwonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children\nof Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom Jonson\nread Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to make plays.\nAnother of these precocious little actors was Salathiel Pavy, who died\nbefore he was thirteen, already famed for taking the parts of old men.\nHim Jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs. An\ninteresting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable\nand rugged satirist, that he should thus have befriended and tenderly\nremembered these little theatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had\nbeen literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre\nand whipped to the conning of their difficult parts. To the caricature\nof Daniel and Munday in \"Cynthia's Revels\" must be added Anaides\n(impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),\ninterpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh. Crites, like\nAsper-Macilente in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" is Jonson's\nself-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable, and\njudicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the yelping\ncurs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny attacks on his\nperfections with only too mindful a neglect.\n\nThe third and last of the \"comical satires\" is \"Poetaster,\" acted, once\nmore, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson's only avowed\ncontribution to the fray. According to the author's own account, this\nplay was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had\nentrusted to Dekker the preparation of \"Satiromastix, the Untrussing of\nthe Humorous Poet,\" a dramatic attack upon himself. In this attempt to\nforestall his enemies Jonson succeeded, and \"Poetaster\" was an immediate\nand deserved success. While hardly more closely knit in structure than\nits earlier companion pieces, \"Poetaster\" is planned to lead up to\nthe ludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the\n\"Lexiphanes\" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus, is\nmade to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his\nstomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary. In the end Crispinus with\nhis fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over to keep the peace and never\nthenceforward \"malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of\nQuintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson] or any other eminent man transcending\nyou in merit.\" One of the most diverting personages in Jonson's comedy\nis Captain Tucca. \"His peculiarity\" has been well described by Ward as\n\"a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the\nmost complete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a\nwalking dictionary of slang.\"\n\nIt was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his reply,\n\"Satiromastix,\" and he amplified him, turning his abusive vocabulary\nback upon Jonson and adding \"an immodesty to his dialogue that did not\nenter into Jonson's conception.\" It has been held, altogether plausibly,\nthat when Dekker was engaged professionally, so to speak, to write\na dramatic reply to Jonson, he was at work on a species of chronicle\nhistory, dealing with the story of Walter Terill in the reign of William\nRufus. This he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters\nsuggested by \"Poetaster,\" and fashioned to convey the satire of his\nreply. The absurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is\nthe result. But Dekker's play is not without its palpable hits at the\narrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of Jonson-Horace,\nwhose \"ningle\" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has recently been shown\nto figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson's friend, the poet Drayton.\nSlight and hastily adapted as is \"Satiromastix,\" especially in a\ncomparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of\n\"Poetaster,\" the town awarded the palm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and\nJonson gave over in consequence his practice of \"comical satire.\" Though\nJonson was cited to appear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer\ncertain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers\nin \"Poetaster,\" nothing came of this complaint. It may be suspected that\nmuch of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure playing to the\ngallery. The town was agog with the strife, and on no less an authority\nthan Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" ii. 2), we learn that the children's company\n(acting the plays of Jonson) did \"so berattle the common stages... that\nmany, wearing rapiers, are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come\nthither.\"\n\nSeveral other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part\nin the war of the theatres. Among them the most important is a college\nplay, entitled \"The Return from Parnassus,\" dating 1601-02. In it a\nmuch-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a character, declare: \"Why here's\nour fellow Shakespeare puts them all down; aye and Ben Jonson, too. O\nthat Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the\npoets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that\nmade him bewray his credit.\" Was Shakespeare then concerned in this\nwar of the stages? And what could have been the nature of this \"purge\"?\nAmong several suggestions, \"Troilus and Cressida\" has been thought by\nsome to be the play in which Shakespeare thus \"put down\" his friend,\nJonson. A wiser interpretation finds the \"purge\" in \"Satiromastix,\"\nwhich, though not written by Shakespeare, was staged by his company,\nand therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the\nleaders of that company.\n\nThe last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised as\na dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to him as\na dramatic satirist. But Jonson now turned his talents to new fields.\nPlays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the\nstage from the beginning of the drama, so that Shakespeare was making\nno new departure when he wrote his \"Julius Caesar\" about 1600. Therefore\nwhen Jonson staged \"Sejanus,\" three years later and with Shakespeare's\ncompany once more, he was only following in the elder dramatist's\nfootsteps. But Jonson's idea of a play on classical history, on the one\nhand, and Shakespeare's and the elder popular dramatists, on the other,\nwere very different. Heywood some years before had put five straggling\nplays on the stage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid\nand dramatised with little taste or discrimination. Shakespeare had\na finer conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his\nancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and dramatise his\nsubject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a classical\nantiquarian. He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness, and wrote\nhis \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius, and\nother authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and his\natmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the\nmargin when he came to print. \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of genuine dramatic\npower in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the\nhaughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical overthrow. Our drama\npresents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient\nRoman life than may be found in Jonson's \"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his\nConspiracy,\" which followed in 1611. A passage in the address of the\nformer play to the reader, in which Jonson refers to a collaboration\nin an earlier version, has led to the surmise that Shakespeare may have\nbeen that \"worthier pen.\" There is no evidence to determine the matter.\n\nIn 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman and Marston\nin the admirable comedy of London life entitled \"Eastward Hoe.\" In\nthe previous year, Marston had dedicated his \"Malcontent,\" in terms\nof fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the wounds of the war of the\ntheatres must have been long since healed. Between Jonson and Chapman\nthere was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals. The two continued\nfriends throughout life. \"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary\npopularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year. But\nthis was not due entirely to the merits of the play. In its earliest\nversion a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory\nto his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but the\nmatter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had influence at\ncourt.\n\nWith the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and successful\ncareer as a writer of masques. He wrote more masques than all his\ncompetitors together, and they are of an extraordinary variety\nand poetic excellence. Jonson did not invent the masque; for such\npremeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a court ball had\nbeen known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before\nhis time. But Jonson gave dramatic value to the masque, especially in\nhis invention of the antimasque, a comedy or farcical element of relief,\nentrusted to professional players or dancers. He enhanced, as well, the\nbeauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords\nand ladies took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and\nartistic grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show. On the mechanical\nand scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in\nInigo Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised\nthe standard of stage representation in the England of his day. Jonson\ncontinued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques\nand other entertainments far into the reign of King Charles; but,\ntowards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his life, and the two\ntesty old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to\neach other, but intolerable bores at court. In \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque\nof Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\" \"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure\nReconciled to Virtue,\" and many more will be found Jonson's aptitude,\nhis taste, his poetry and inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama;\nwhile in \"The Masque of Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\"\nespecially, is discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at\ncourt as well as in the city, was not the least element of Jonson's\ncontemporary popularity.\n\nBut Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to\nthe amusement of King James. In 1605 \"Volpone\" was produced, \"The Silent\nWoman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the following year. These comedies,\nwith \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614, represent Jonson at his height, and for\nconstructive cleverness, character successfully conceived in the manner\nof caricature, wit and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in\nEnglish drama. \"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play\nfrom the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy\nrepresented in the plays named above. Its subject is a struggle of\nwit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from the\nvillainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore (the\nvulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little raven), to Sir\nPolitic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a virtuous character in\nthe play. Question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding\ncan be considered a comedy, for, although the plot ends in the\ndiscomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious, it involves no mortal\ncatastrophe. But Jonson was on sound historical ground, for \"Volpone\"\nis conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients' theory\nof comedy than was ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however\nrepulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the\nworld into the rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains\nwith roguery and innocence with folly, admires the former while\ninconsistently punishing them.\n\n\"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious\nconstruction. The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a\nheartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take to\nhimself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in the end,\nturns out neither silent nor a woman at all. In \"The Alchemist,\" again,\nwe have the utmost cleverness in construction, the whole fabric building\nclimax on climax, witty, ingenious, and so plausibly presented that we\nforget its departures from the possibilities of life. In \"The Alchemist\"\nJonson represented, none the less to the life, certain sharpers of\nthe metropolis, revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the\nvariety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims. We may object\nto the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple\nof honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is\napproved in the end and rewarded. The comedy is so admirably written and\ncontrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness\nin their several kinds, and the whole is animated with such verve and\nresourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel every time it is\nread. Lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy, \"Bartholomew\nFair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less structurally worthy\nof praise than its three predecessors, but full of the keenest and\ncleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any English comedy\nsave some other of Jonson's own. It is in \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are\npresented to the immortal caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land\nBusy, and the Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this\nextraordinary comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this\ndanger, loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James\nin \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\" Another comedy of less merit is \"The\nDevil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616. It was the failure of this play that\ncaused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of\nnearly ten years.\n\n\"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice. Whether because of the success\nof \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three comedies declare\nin the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":\n\n     \"Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known\n     No country's mirth is better than our own.\"\n\nIndeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for\ncollected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the scene\nof \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also, converting\nSignior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to Master Welborn,\nand Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i' the Old Jewry.\"\n\nIn his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards caricature,\nJonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing from the life about\nhim with an experience and insight rare in any generation. A happy\ncomparison has been suggested between Ben Jonson and Charles Dickens.\nBoth were men of the people, lowly born and hardly bred. Each knew\nthe London of his time as few men knew it; and each represented it\nintimately and in elaborate detail. Both men were at heart moralists,\nseeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature;\nperverse, even wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and\nlargeness of heart, and when all has been said--though the Elizabethan\nran to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality--leaving the world better\nfor the art that they practised in it.\n\nIn 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his\nplays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective\nedition. This was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted\nby no dramatist before Jonson. This volume published, in a carefully\nrevised text, all the plays thus far mentioned, excepting \"The Case is\nAltered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The\nDevil is an Ass,\" which was written too late. It included likewise a\nbook of some hundred and thirty odd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief\nand pungent writing Jonson was an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a\nsmaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\"\nand \"Entertainments.\" In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate\nwith a pension of one hundred marks a year. This, with his fees and\nreturns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his plays\nmust have formed the bulk of his income. The poet appears to have done\ncertain literary hack-work for others, as, for example, parts of the\nPunic Wars contributed to Raleigh's \"History of the World.\" We know\nfrom a story, little to the credit of either, that Jonson accompanied\nRaleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor. In 1618 Jonson was\ngranted the reversion of the office of Master of the Revels, a post\nfor which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did not live to enjoy its\nperquisites. Jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities,\nthough when and under what circumstances is not known. It has been said\nthat he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists\nof the day averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate\nhand. Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson.\n\nFrom 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced\nnothing for the stage. But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his wonted\nstudies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as by report,\none of the most learned men of his time. Jonson's theory of authorship\ninvolved a wide acquaintance with books and \"an ability,\" as he put it,\n\"to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use.\"\nAccordingly Jonson read not only the Greek and Latin classics down to\nthe lesser writers, but he acquainted himself especially with the Latin\nwritings of his learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their\npoetry, their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid\nlearning. Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of\nbooks. He told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds\nevery first day of the new year to buy new books.\" Unhappily, in 1623,\nhis library was destroyed by fire, an accident serio-comically described\nin his witty poem, \"An Execration upon Vulcan.\" Yet even now a book\nturns up from time to time in which is inscribed, in fair large Italian\nlettering, the name, Ben Jonson. With respect to Jonson's use of his\nmaterial, Dryden said memorably of him: \"[He] was not only a professed\nimitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of all the others; you track\nhim everywhere in their snow.... But he has done his robberies so openly\nthat one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law. He invades authors\nlike a monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory\nin him.\" And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself, and\njustly, on his originality. In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses Sallust's\naccount of the conspiracy, but he models some of the speeches of Cicero\non the Roman orator's actual words. In \"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole\nsatire out of Horace and dramatises it effectively for his purposes. The\nsophist Libanius suggests the situation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin\ncomedy of Giordano Bruno, \"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes\nand the sharpers in \"The Alchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its\nadmirable opening scene. But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and\nputting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed\nmade it thenceforward to all time current and his own.\n\nThe lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a peculiar\nmerit. His theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish.\nHe was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an\nidle day; and he believed that Apollo could only be worthily served in\nsinging robes and laurel crowned. And yet many of Jonson's lyrics will\nlive as long as the language. Who does not know \"Queen and huntress,\nchaste and fair.\" \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be\nneat, still to be dressed\"? Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in\nexpression, with not a word too much or one that bears not its part\nin the total effect, there is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a\ncertain stiffness and formality, a suspicion that they were not quite\nspontaneous and unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak,\nwith disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual\nthought is on greater things. It is for these reasons that Jonson is\neven better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical\nfinish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion\nwhich we usually associate with lyrical poetry. There are no such\nepitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the charming ones on his own children,\non Salathiel Pavy, the child-actor, and many more; and this even though\nthe rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of\nTavistock the famous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\"\nJonson is unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment,\nseldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet\nshowing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others, a\ndiscriminating taste and a generous personal regard. There was no man in\nEngland of his rank so well known and universally beloved as Ben Jonson.\nThe list of his friends, of those to whom he had written verses, and\nthose who had written verses to him, includes the name of every man of\nprominence in the England of King James. And the tone of many of these\nproductions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the\namiable personality and sound worth of the laureate. In 1619, growing\nunwieldy through inactivity, Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a\njourney afoot to Scotland. On his way thither and back he was hospitably\nreceived at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends\nhad recommended him. When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met to\ngrant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of Scottish\npoets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at Hawthornden.\nSome of the noblest of Jonson's poems were inspired by friendship.\nSuch is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry\nMoryson,\" and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial\naffection, prefixed to the first Shakespeare folio, \"To the memory of\nmy beloved master, William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to\nmention only these. Nor can the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know\nvice at all,\" be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own\nwise and stately age.\n\nBut if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio\nand up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from inactive;\nfor year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to\ncontribute to the masquing and entertainment at court. In \"The Golden\nAge Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with its attendant evils into\nstatues which sink out of sight; in \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\"\nAtlas figures represented as an old man, his shoulders covered with\nsnow, and Comus, \"the god of cheer or the belly,\" is one of the\ncharacters, a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten, named John\nMilton, was not to forget. \"Pan's Anniversary,\" late in the reign\nof James, proclaimed that Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write\nexquisite lyrics, and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old\ndrollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable.\nThese, too, and the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo\nRoom of the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of\nEnglish literary Bohemia. We hear of a room blazoned about with Jonson's\nown judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a company made\nup of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly attached to their\nveteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions, affections, and enmities.\nAnd we hear, too, of valorous potations; but in the words of Herrick\naddressed to his master, Jonson, at the Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the\nTriple Tun, and at the Mermaid,\n\n     \"We such clusters had\n     As made us nobly wild, not mad,\n     And yet each verse of thine\n     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\"\n\nBut the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,\nthough Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet returned\nto the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The Staple of News,\"\n\"The New Inn,\" \"The Magnetic Lady,\" and \"The Tale of a Tub,\" the last\ndoubtless revised from a much earlier comedy. None of these plays met\nwith any marked success, although the scathing generalisation of Dryden\nthat designated them \"Jonson's dotages\" is unfair to their genuine\nmerits. Thus the idea of an office for the gathering, proper dressing,\nand promulgation of news (wild flight of the fancy in its time) was\nan excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among\nnewsmongers; although as much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic\nLady,\" who, in her bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours\nto reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title, or\n\"Humours Reconciled.\" These last plays of the old dramatist revert to\ncaricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more than\never present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon, especially\nof his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears unworthily to have used\nhis influence at court against the broken-down old poet. And now disease\nclaimed Jonson, and he was bedridden for months. He had succeeded\nMiddleton in 1628 as Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the\npost for not fulfilling its duties. King Charles befriended him, and\neven commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;\nand he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted\nfriends among the younger poets who were proud to be \"sealed of the\ntribe of Ben.\"\n\nJonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which\nhe had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in its\nvarious parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642. It included all the plays\nmentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting \"The Case is Altered;\"\nthe masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617 and 1630; another\ncollection of lyrics and occasional poetry called \"Underwoods\", including\nsome further entertainments; a translation of \"Horace's Art of Poetry\"\n(also published in a vicesimo quarto in 1640), and certain fragments and\ningatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself. These\nlast comprise the fragment (less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called\n\"Mortimer his Fall,\" and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty\nand poetic spirit, \"The Sad Shepherd.\" There is also the exceedingly\ninteresting \"English Grammar\" \"made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all\nstrangers out of his observation of the English language now spoken and\nin use,\" in Latin and English; and \"Timber, or Discoveries\" \"made upon\nmen and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading, or had\ntheir reflux to his peculiar notion of the times.\" The \"Discoveries,\"\nas it is usually called, is a commonplace book such as many literary\nmen have kept, in which their reading was chronicled, passages that took\ntheir fancy translated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted.\nMany passages of Jonson's \"Discoveries\" are literal translations from\nthe authors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not,\nas the accident of the moment prescribed. At times he follows the line\nof Macchiavelli's argument as to the nature and conduct of princes; at\nothers he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse\nto Aristotle. He finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in Seneca the\nelder and applies it to his own recollection of Bacon's power as an\norator; and another on facile and ready genius, and translates it,\nadapting it to his recollection of his fellow-playwright,\nShakespeare. To call such passages--which Jonson never intended for\npublication--plagiarism, is to obscure the significance of words.\nTo disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of\nscholarship. Jonson's prose, both in his dramas, in the descriptive\ncomments of his masques, and in the \"Discoveries,\" is characterised by\nclarity and vigorous directness, nor is it wanting in a fine sense of\nform or in the subtler graces of diction.\n\nWhen Jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his\nmemory. But the Civil War was at hand, and the project failed. A\nmemorial, not insufficient, was carved on the stone covering his grave\nin one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey:\n\n\"O rare Ben Jonson.\"\n\nFELIX E.

If this be true, and that the fortune\nof all writers doth daily prove it, it behoves the careful to provide\nwell towards these accidents; and, having acquired them, to preserve\nthat part of reputation most tenderly, wherein the benefit of a friend\nis also defended. Hence is it, that I now render myself grateful, and am\nstudious to justify the bounty of your act; to which, though your mere\nauthority were satisfying, yet it being an age wherein poetry and the\nprofessors of it hear so ill on all sides, there will a reason be looked\nfor in the subject. It is certain, nor can it with any forehead be\nopposed, that the too much license of poetasters in this time, hath much\ndeformed their mistress; that, every day, their manifold and manifest\nignorance doth stick unnatural reproaches upon her: but for their\npetulancy, it were an act of the greatest injustice, either to let\nthe learned suffer, or so divine a skill (which indeed should not be\nattempted with unclean hands) to fall under the least contempt. For,\nif men will impartially, and not asquint, look toward the offices\nand function of a poet, they will easily conclude to themselves the\nimpossibility of any man's being the good poet, without first being a\ngood man. He that is said to be able to inform young men to all good\ndisciplines, inflame grown men to all great virtues, keep old men in\ntheir best and supreme state, or, as they decline to childhood, recover\nthem to their first strength; that comes forth the interpreter and\narbiter of nature, a teacher of things divine no less than human, a\nmaster in manners; and can alone, or with a few, effect the business\nof mankind: this, I take him, is no subject for pride and ignorance\nto exercise their railing rhetoric upon. But it will here be hastily\nanswered, that the writers of these days are other things; that not only\ntheir manners, but their natures, are inverted, and nothing remaining\nwith them of the dignity of poet, but the abused name, which every\nscribe usurps; that now, especially in dramatic, or, as they term it,\nstage-poetry, nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blasphemy, all license\nof offence to God and man is practised. I dare not deny a great part of\nthis, and am sorry I dare not, because in some men's abortive features\n(and would they had never boasted the light) it is over-true; but that\nall are embarked in this bold adventure for hell, is a most uncharitable\nthought, and, uttered, a more malicious slander. For my particular, I\ncan, and from a most clear conscience, affirm, that I have ever trembled\nto think toward the least profaneness; have loathed the use of such\nfoul and unwashed bawdry, as is now made the food of the scene: and,\nhowsoever I cannot escape from some, the imputation of sharpness, but\nthat they will say, I have taken a pride, or lust, to be bitter, and not\nmy youngest infant but hath come into the world with all his teeth;\nI would ask of these supercilious politics, what nation, society, or\ngeneral order or state, I have provoked? What public person? Whether I\nhave not in all these preserved their dignity, as mine own person, safe?\nMy works are read, allowed, (I speak of those that are intirely mine,)\nlook into them, what broad reproofs have I used? where have I been\nparticular? where personal? except to a mimic, cheater, bawd, or\nbuffoon, creatures, for their insolencies, worthy to be taxed? yet to\nwhich of these so pointingly, as he might not either ingenuously have\nconfest, or wisely dissembled his disease? But it is not rumour can make\nmen guilty, much less entitle me to other men's crimes. I know, that\nnothing can be so innocently writ or carried, but may be made obnoxious\nto construction; marry, whilst I bear mine innocence about me, I fear\nit not. Application is now grown a trade with many; and there are that\nprofess to have a key for the decyphering of every thing: but let wise\nand noble persons take heed how they be too credulous, or give leave to\nthese invading interpreters to be over-familiar with their fames, who\ncunningly, and often, utter their own virulent malice, under other men's\nsimplest meanings. As for those that will (by faults which charity hath\nraked up, or common honesty concealed) make themselves a name with the\nmultitude, or, to draw their rude and beastly claps, care not whose\nliving faces they intrench with their petulant styles, may they do it\nwithout a rival, for me! I choose rather to live graved in obscurity,\nthan share with them in so preposterous a fame. Nor can I blame the\nwishes of those severe and wise patriots, who providing the hurts these\nlicentious spirits may do in a state, desire rather to see fools and\ndevils, and those antique relics of barbarism retrieved, with all other\nridiculous and exploded follies, than behold the wounds of private\nmen, of princes and nations: for, as Horace makes Trebatius speak among\nthese,\n\n   \"Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intactus, et odit.\"\n\nAnd men may justly impute such rages, if continued, to the writer, as\nhis sports. The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the\npresent trade of the stage, in all their miscelline interludes, what\nlearned or liberal soul doth not already abhor? where nothing but the\nfilth of the time is uttered, and with such impropriety of phrase, such\nplenty of solecisms, such dearth of sense, so bold prolepses, so racked\nmetaphors, with brothelry, able to violate the ear of a pagan, and\nblasphemy, to turn the blood of a Christian to water. I cannot but be\nserious in a cause of this nature, wherein my fame, and the reputation\nof divers honest and learned are the question; when a name so full of\nauthority, antiquity, and all great mark, is, through their insolence,\nbecome the lowest scorn of the age; and those men subject to the\npetulancy of every vernaculous orator, that were wont to be the care of\nkings and happiest monarchs. This it is that hath not only rapt me to\npresent indignation, but made me studious heretofore, and by all my\nactions, to stand off from them; which may most appear in this my latest\nwork, which you, most learned Arbitresses, have seen, judged, and to\nmy crown, approved; wherein I have laboured for their instruction and\namendment, to reduce not only the ancient forms, but manners of the\nscene, the easiness, the propriety, the innocence, and last, the\ndoctrine, which is the principal end of poesie, to inform men in the\nbest reason of living. And though my catastrophe may, in the strict\nrigour of comic law, meet with censure, as turning back to my promise;\nI desire the learned and charitable critic, to have so much faith in\nme, to think it was done of industry: for, with what ease I could have\nvaried it nearer his scale (but that I fear to boast my own faculty) I\ncould here insert. But my special aim being to put the snaffle in their\nmouths, that cry out, We never punish vice in our interludes, etc., I\ntook the more liberty; though not without some lines of example, drawn\neven in the ancients themselves, the goings out of whose comedies are\nnot always joyful, but oft times the bawds, the servants, the rivals,\nyea, and the masters are mulcted; and fitly, it being the office of a\ncomic poet to imitate justice, and instruct to life, as well as purity\nof language, or stir up gentle affections; to which I shall take the\noccasion elsewhere to speak.\n\nFor the present, most reverenced Sisters, as I have cared to be thankful\nfor your affections past, and here made the understanding acquainted\nwith some ground of your favours; let me not despair their continuance,\nto the maturing of some worthier fruits; wherein, if my muses be true to\nme, I shall raise the despised head of poetry again, and stripping her\nout of those rotten and base rags wherewith the times have adulterated\nher form, restore her to her primitive habit, feature, and majesty,\nand render her worthy to be embraced and kist of all the great and\nmaster-spirits of our world. As for the vile and slothful, who never\naffected an act worthy of celebration, or are so inward with their own\nvicious natures, as they worthily fear her, and think it an high point\nof policy to keep her in contempt, with their declamatory and windy\ninvectives; she shall out of just rage incite her servants (who are\ngenus irritabile) to spout ink in their faces, that shall eat farther\nthan their marrow into their fames; and not Cinnamus the barber, with\nhis art, shall be able to take out the brands; but they shall live, and\nbe read, till the wretches die, as things worst deserving of themselves\nin chief, and then of all mankind.\n\nFrom my House in the Black-Friars,\n\nthis 11th day of February, 1607.\n\n\n\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\nVOLPONE, a Magnifico.\n\nMOSCA, his Parasite.\n\nVOLTORE, an Advocate.\n\nCORBACCIO, an old Gentleman.\n\nCORVINO, a Merchant.\n\nBONARIO, son to Corbaccio.\n\nSIR POLITICK WOULD-BE, a Knight.\n\nPEREGRINE, a Gentleman Traveller.\n\nNANO, a Dwarf.\n\nCASTRONE, an Eunuch.\n\nANDROGYNO, an Hermaphrodite.\n\nGREGE (or Mob).\n\nCOMMANDADORI, Officers of Justice.\n\nMERCATORI, three Merchants.\n\nAVOCATORI, four Magistrates.\n\nNOTARIO, the Register.\n\nLADY WOULD-BE, Sir Politick's Wife.\n\nCELIA, Corvino's Wife.\n\nSERVITORI, Servants, two Waiting-women, etc.\n\n\n\nSCENE: VENICE.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ARGUMENT.\n\nV olpone, childless, rich, feigns sick, despairs,\n\nO ffers his state to hopes of several heirs,\n\nL ies languishing: his parasite receives\n\nP resents of all, assures, deludes; then weaves\n\nO ther cross plots, which ope themselves, are told.\n\nN ew tricks for safety are sought; they thrive: when bold,\n\nE ach tempts the other again, and all are sold.\n\n\n\n\n     PROLOGUE.\n\n     Now, luck yet sends us, and a little wit\n     Will serve to make our play hit;\n     (According to the palates of the season)\n     Here is rhime, not empty of reason.\n     This we were bid to credit from our poet,\n     Whose true scope, if you would know it,\n     In all his poems still hath been this measure,\n     To mix profit with your pleasure;\n     And not as some, whose throats their envy failing,\n     Cry hoarsely, All he writes is railing:\n     And when his plays come forth, think they can flout them,\n     With saying, he was a year about them.\n     To this there needs no lie, but this his creature,\n     Which was two months since no feature;\n     And though he dares give them five lives to mend it,\n     'Tis known, five weeks fully penn'd it,\n     From his own hand, without a co-adjutor,\n     Novice, journey-man, or tutor.\n     Yet thus much I can give you as a token\n     Of his play's worth, no eggs are broken,\n     Nor quaking custards with fierce teeth affrighted,\n     Wherewith your rout are so delighted;\n     Nor hales he in a gull old ends reciting,\n     To stop gaps in his loose writing;\n     With such a deal of monstrous and forced action,\n     As might make Bethlem a faction:\n     Nor made he his play for jests stolen from each table,\n     But makes jests to fit his fable;\n     And so presents quick comedy refined,\n     As best critics have designed;\n     The laws of time, place, persons he observeth,\n     From no needful rule he swerveth.\n     All gall and copperas from his ink he draineth,\n     Only a little salt remaineth,\n     Wherewith he'll rub your cheeks, till red, with laughter,\n     They shall look fresh a week after.\n\n\n\n\nACT 1.

No, no, worthy gentlemen; to tell you\n     true, I cannot endure to see the rabble of these ground\n     ciarlitani, that spread their cloaks on the pavement, as if\n     they meant to do feats of activity, and then come in lamely,\n     with their mouldy tales out of Boccacio, like stale Tabarine,\n     the fabulist: some of them discoursing their travels, and of\n     their tedious captivity in the Turks' galleys, when, indeed,\n     were the truth known, they were the Christians' galleys, where\n     very temperately they eat bread, and drunk water, as a\n     wholesome penance, enjoined them by their confessors, for base\n     pilferies.\n\n     SIR P: Note but his bearing, and contempt of these.\n\n     VOLP: These turdy-facy-nasty-paty-lousy-fartical rogues, with\n     one poor groat's-worth of unprepared antimony, finely wrapt up\n     in several scartoccios, are able, very well, to kill their\n     twenty a week, and play; yet, these meagre, starved spirits,\n     who have half stopt the organs of their minds with earthy\n     oppilations, want not their favourers among your shrivell'd\n     sallad-eating artizans, who are overjoyed that they may have\n     their half-pe'rth of physic; though it purge them into another\n     world, it makes no matter.\n\n     SIR P: Excellent! have you heard better language, sir?\n\n     VOLP: Well, let them go.
