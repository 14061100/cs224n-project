{"summary": "In his home town of Saratoga, New York, Solomon Northup, a free negro who was a skilled carpenter and violinist, was approached by two circus promoters. They offered him a brief, high-paying job as a musician with their traveling circus. Without informing his wife, who was away at work in a nearby town, he traveled with the strangers to downstate New York and Washington, D.C. Soon after arriving in the capital, he awoke to find himself drugged, bound, and in the cell of a slave pen. When Northup asserted his rights as a free man, he was beaten and warned never again to mention his free life in New York.\nTransported by ship to New Orleans, Northup and other enslaved blacks contracted smallpox and one died. In transit, Northup implored a sympathetic sailor to send a letter to his family. The letter arrived safely, but, lacking knowledge of his final destination, Northup's family was unable to effect his rescue.\nNorthup's first owner was William Prince Ford, who ran a lumber mill on a bayou of the Red River. Northup subsequently had several other owners, less humane than Ford, during his twelve-year bondage. At times, his carpentry and other skills contributed to his being treated relatively well; but he also suffered extreme cruelty. On two occasions, he was attacked by John Tibeats, a white man he was leased to, and defended himself, for which he suffered severe reprisals. After about two years of enslavement, Northup was sold to Edwin Epps, a notoriously cruel cotton planter. Epps held Northup enslaved for 10 years, during which time he assigned the New Yorker to various roles from cotton picker, to hauler to driver, which required Northup to oversee the work of fellow slaves and punish them for undesirable behavior. While on Epps' plantation, Northup became friends with a slave girl named Patsey, whom he writes about briefly in the book.\nAfter being beaten for claiming his free status in Washington, D.C., Northup in the ensuing 12 years did not reveal his true history again to a single person, slave or owner. Finally he confided his story to Samuel Bass, a white carpenter and abolitionist from Canada working at the Epps plantation. Bass, at great risk to himself, sent letters to Northupâ€™s wife and friends in Saratoga. Parker, a white shopkeeper, received one of the letters and sought assistance from Henry B. Northup, a white attorney and politician whose family had held and freed Solomon Northup's father and with whom Solomon had a longtime friendship. Henry contacted New York state officials. As the state had passed a law in 1840 to provide financial resources for the rescue of citizens kidnapped into slavery, the Governor appointed Henry Northup as an agent to travel to Louisiana and work with law enforcement to free Solomon. Once in Louisiana, Henry Northup hired local Avoyelles Parish attorney, John P. Waddill, to assist in securing Solomon Northup's freedom. After a variety of bureaucratic measures and searches were undertaken, the attorney succeeded in locating Solomon and freeing him from the plantation. Northup later filed charges against the men who sold him into slavery but was unsuccessful in his suit. He returned to New York and reunited with his family there.\nNorthup concludes his narrative with the following statement:\n\nMy narrative is at an end. I have no comments to make upon the subject of Slavery. Those who read this book may form their own opinions of the \"peculiar institution.\" What it may be in other States, I do not profess to know; what it is in the region of Red River, is truly and faithfully delineated in these pages. This is no fiction, no exaggeration. If I have failed in anything, it has been in presenting to the reader too prominently the bright side of the picture. I doubt not hundreds have been as unfortunate as myself; that hundreds of free citizens have been kidnapped and sold into slavery, and are at this moment wearing out their lives on plantations in Texas and Louisiana. But I forbear. Chastened and subdued in spirit by the sufferings I have borne, and thankful to that good Being through whose mercy I have been restored to happiness and liberty, I hope henceforward to lead an upright though lowly life, and rest at last in the church yard where my father sleeps.\n\n", "full_text": "Proofreading volunteers at http://www.pgdp.net for Project\nGutenberg.

In order,\nhowever, to present all the facts which have been communicated to him,\nit has seemed necessary to extend it to its present length.\n\nMany of the statements contained in the following pages are\ncorroborated by abundant evidence--others rest entirely upon Solomon's\nassertion. That he has adhered strictly to the truth, the editor, at\nleast, who has had an opportunity of detecting any contradiction or\ndiscrepancy in his statements, is well satisfied. He has invariably\nrepeated the same story without deviating in the slightest particular,\nand has also carefully perused the manuscript, dictating an alteration\nwherever the most trivial inaccuracy has appeared.\n\nIt was Solomon's fortune, during his captivity, to be owned by\nseveral masters. The treatment he received while at the \"Pine\nWoods\" shows that among slaveholders there are men of humanity as\nwell as of cruelty. Some of them are spoken of with emotions of\ngratitude--others in a spirit of bitterness. It is believed that the\nfollowing account of his experience on Bayou Boeuf presents a correct\npicture of Slavery, in all its lights and shadows, as it now exists\nin that locality. Unbiased, as he conceives, by any prepossessions or\nprejudices, the only object of the editor has been to give a faithful\nhistory of Solomon Northup's life, as he received it from his lips.\n\nIn the accomplishment of that object, he trusts he has succeeded,\nnotwithstanding the numerous faults of style and of expression it may\nbe found to contain.\n\n                                               DAVID WILSON.\n  WHITEHALL, N. Y., May, 1853.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVE OF SOLOMON NORTHUP.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n  INTRODUCTORY--ANCESTRY--THE NORTHUP FAMILY--BIRTH AND\n  PARENTAGE--MINTUS NORTHUP--MARRIAGE WITH ANNE HAMPTON--GOOD\n  RESOLUTIONS--CHAMPLAIN CANAL--RAFTING EXCURSION TO\n  CANADA--FARMING--THE VIOLIN--COOKING--REMOVAL TO SARATOGA--PARKER AND\n  PERRY--SLAVES AND SLAVERY--THE CHILDREN--THE BEGINNING OF SORROW.\n\n\nHaving been born a freeman, and for more than thirty years enjoyed\nthe blessings of liberty in a free State--and having at the end of\nthat time been kidnapped and sold into Slavery, where I remained,\nuntil happily rescued in the month of January, 1853, after a bondage\nof twelve years--it has been suggested that an account of my life and\nfortunes would not be uninteresting to the public.\n\nSince my return to liberty, I have not failed to perceive the\nincreasing interest throughout the Northern States, in regard to\nthe subject of Slavery. Works of fiction, professing to portray\nits features in their more pleasing as well as more repugnant\naspects, have been circulated to an extent unprecedented, and, as I\nunderstand, have created a fruitful topic of comment and discussion.\n\nI can speak of Slavery only so far as it came under my own\nobservation--only so far as I have known and experienced it in my\nown person. My object is, to give a candid and truthful statement of\nfacts: to repeat the story of my life, without exaggeration, leaving\nit for others to determine, whether even the pages of fiction present\na picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage.\n\nAs far back as I have been able to ascertain, my ancestors on the\npaternal side were slaves in Rhode Island. They belonged to a family\nby the name of Northup, one of whom, removing to the State of\nNew-York, settled at Hoosic, in Rensselaer county. He brought with him\nMintus Northup, my father. On the death of this gentleman, which must\nhave occurred some fifty years ago, my father became free, having been\nemancipated by a direction in his will.\n\nHenry B. Northup, Esq., of Sandy Hill, a distinguished counselor at\nlaw, and the man to whom, under Providence, I am indebted for my\npresent liberty, and my return to the society of my wife and children,\nis a relative of the family in which my forefathers were thus held to\nservice, and from which they took the name I bear. To this fact may be\nattributed the persevering interest he has taken in my behalf.\n\nSometime after my father's liberation, he removed to the town of\nMinerva, Essex county, N. Y., where I was born, in the month of July,\n1808. How long he remained in the latter place I have not the means\nof definitely ascertaining. From thence he removed to Granville,\nWashington county, near a place known as Slyborough, where, for some\nyears, he labored on the farm of Clark Northup, also a relative of his\nold master; from thence he removed to the Alden farm, at Moss Street,\na short distance north of the village of Sandy Hill; and from thence\nto the farm now owned by Russel Pratt, situated on the road leading\nfrom Fort Edward to Argyle, where he continued to reside until his\ndeath, which took place on the 22d day of November, 1829. He left a\nwidow and two children--myself, and Joseph, an elder brother. The\nlatter is still living in the county of Oswego, near the city of that\nname; my mother died during the period of my captivity.\n\nThough born a slave, and laboring under the disadvantages to which\nmy unfortunate race is subjected, my father was a man respected for\nhis industry and integrity, as many now living, who well remember\nhim, are ready to testify. His whole life was passed in the peaceful\npursuits of agriculture, never seeking employment in those more menial\npositions, which seem to be especially allotted to the children of\nAfrica. Besides giving us an education surpassing that ordinarily\nbestowed upon children in our condition, he acquired, by his diligence\nand economy, a sufficient property qualification to entitle him to\nthe right of suffrage. He was accustomed to speak to us of his early\nlife; and although at all times cherishing the warmest emotions of\nkindness, and even of affection towards the family, in whose house\nhe had been a bondsman, he nevertheless comprehended the system of\nSlavery, and dwelt with sorrow on the degradation of his race. He\nendeavored to imbue our minds with sentiments of morality, and to\nteach us to place our trust and confidence in Him who regards the\nhumblest as well as the highest of his creatures. How often since\nthat time has the recollection of his paternal counsels occurred to\nme, while lying in a slave hut in the distant and sickly regions of\nLouisiana, smarting with the undeserved wounds which an inhuman master\nhad inflicted, and longing only for the grave which had covered him,\nto shield me also from the lash of the oppressor. In the church-yard\nat Sandy Hill, an humble stone marks the spot where he reposes, after\nhaving worthily performed the duties appertaining to the lowly sphere\nwherein God had appointed him to walk.\n\nUp to this period I had been principally engaged with my father in the\nlabors of the farm. The leisure hours allowed me were generally either\nemployed over my books, or playing on the violin--an amusement which\nwas the ruling passion of my youth. It has also been the source of\nconsolation since, affording pleasure to the simple beings with whom\nmy lot was cast, and beguiling my own thoughts, for many hours, from\nthe painful contemplation of my fate.\n\nOn Christmas day, 1829, I was married to Anne Hampton, a colored\ngirl then living in the vicinity of our residence. The ceremony was\nperformed at Fort Edward, by Timothy Eddy, Esq., a magistrate of that\ntown, and still a prominent citizen of the place. She had resided\na long time at Sandy Hill, with Mr. Baird, proprietor of the Eagle\nTavern, and also in the family of Rev. Alexander Proudfit, of Salem.\nThis gentleman for many years had presided over the Presbyterian\nsociety at the latter place, and was widely distinguished for his\nlearning and piety. Anne still holds in grateful remembrance the\nexceeding kindness and the excellent counsels of that good man. She\nis not able to determine the exact line of her descent, but the blood\nof three races mingles in her veins. It is difficult to tell whether\nthe red, white, or black predominates. The union of them all, however,\nin her origin, has given her a singular but pleasing expression, such\nas is rarely to be seen. Though somewhat resembling, yet she cannot\nproperly be styled a quadroon, a class to which, I have omitted to\nmention, my mother belonged.\n\nI had just now passed the period of my minority, having reached the\nage of twenty-one years in the month of July previous. Deprived of\nthe advice and assistance of my father, with a wife dependent upon\nme for support, I resolved to enter upon a life of industry; and\nnotwithstanding the obstacle of color, and the consciousness of my\nlowly state, indulged in pleasant dreams of a good time coming, when\nthe possession of some humble habitation, with a few surrounding\nacres, should reward my labors, and bring me the means of happiness\nand comfort.\n\nFrom the time of my marriage to this day the love I have borne my\nwife has been sincere and unabated; and only those who have felt\nthe glowing tenderness a father cherishes for his offspring, can\nappreciate my affection for the beloved children which have since been\nborn to us. This much I deem appropriate and necessary to say, in\norder that those who read these pages, may comprehend the poignancy of\nthose sufferings I have been doomed to bear.\n\nImmediately upon our marriage we commenced house-keeping, in the old\nyellow building then standing at the southern extremity of Fort Edward\nvillage, and which has since been transformed into a modern mansion,\nand lately occupied by Captain Lathrop. It is known as the Fort House.\nIn this building the courts were sometime held after the organization\nof the county. It was also occupied by Burgoyne in 1777, being\nsituated near the old Fort on the left bank of the Hudson.\n\nDuring the winter I was employed with others repairing the Champlain\nCanal, on that section over which William Van Nortwick was\nsuperintendent. David McEachron had the immediate charge of the men in\nwhose company I labored. By the time the canal opened in the spring,\nI was enabled, from the savings of my wages, to purchase a pair of\nhorses, and other things necessarily required in the business of\nnavigation.\n\nHaving hired several efficient hands to assist me, I entered into\ncontracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake\nChamplain to Troy. Dyer Beckwith and a Mr. Bartemy, of Whitehall,\naccompanied me on several trips. During the season I became perfectly\nfamiliar with the art and mysteries of rafting--a knowledge which\nafterwards enabled me to render profitable service to a worthy master,\nand to astonish the simple-witted lumbermen on the banks of the Bayou\nBoeuf.\n\nIn one of my voyages down Lake Champlain, I was induced to make a\nvisit to Canada. Repairing to Montreal, I visited the cathedral\nand other places of interest in that city, from whence I continued\nmy excursion to Kingston and other towns, obtaining a knowledge of\nlocalities, which was also of service to me afterwards, as will appear\ntowards the close of this narrative.\n\nHaving completed my contracts on the canal satisfactorily to myself\nand to my employer, and not wishing to remain idle, now that the\nnavigation of the canal was again suspended, I entered into another\ncontract with Medad Gunn, to cut a large quantity of wood. In this\nbusiness I was engaged during the winter of 1831-32.\n\nWith the return of spring, Anne and myself conceived the project of\ntaking a farm in the neighborhood. I had been accustomed from earliest\nyouth to agricultural labors, and it was an occupation congenial to\nmy tastes. I accordingly entered into arrangements for a part of the\nold Alden farm, on which my father formerly resided. With one cow,\none swine, a yoke of fine oxen I had lately purchased of Lewis Brown,\nin Hartford, and other personal property and effects, we proceeded to\nour new home in Kingsbury. That year I planted twenty-five acres of\ncorn, sowed large fields of oats, and commenced farming upon as large\na scale as my utmost means would permit. Anne was diligent about the\nhouse affairs, while I toiled laboriously in the field.\n\nOn this place we continued to reside until 1834. In the winter season\nI had numerous calls to play on the violin. Wherever the young people\nassembled to dance, I was almost invariably there. Throughout the\nsurrounding villages my fiddle was notorious. Anne, also, during her\nlong residence at the Eagle Tavern, had become somewhat famous as a\ncook. During court weeks, and on public occasions, she was employed at\nhigh wages in the kitchen at Sherrill's Coffee House.\n\nWe always returned home from the performance of these services with\nmoney in our pockets; so that, with fiddling, cooking, and farming,\nwe soon found ourselves in the possession of abundance, and, in fact,\nleading a happy and prosperous life. Well, indeed, would it have been\nfor us had we remained on the farm at Kingsbury; but the time came\nwhen the next step was to be taken towards the cruel destiny that\nawaited me.\n\nIn March, 1834, we removed to Saratoga Springs. We occupied a house\nbelonging to Daniel O'Brien, on the north side of Washington street.\nAt that time Isaac Taylor kept a large boarding house, known as\nWashington Hall, at the north end of Broadway. He employed me to drive\na hack, in which capacity I worked for him two years. After this\ntime I was generally employed through the visiting season, as also\nwas Anne, in the United States Hotel, and other public houses of the\nplace. In winter seasons I relied upon my violin, though during the\nconstruction of the Troy and Saratoga railroad, I performed many hard\ndays' labor upon it.\n\nI was in the habit, at Saratoga, of purchasing articles necessary for\nmy family at the stores of Mr. Cephas Parker and Mr. William Perry,\ngentlemen towards whom, for many acts of kindness, I entertained\nfeelings of strong regard. It was for this reason that, twelve years\nafterwards, I caused to be directed to them the letter, which is\nhereinafter inserted, and which was the means, in the hands of Mr.\nNorthup, of my fortunate deliverance.\n\nWhile living at the United States Hotel, I frequently met with slaves,\nwho had accompanied their masters from the South. They were always\nwell dressed and well provided for, leading apparently an easy life,\nwith but few of its ordinary troubles to perplex them. Many times they\nentered into conversation with me on the subject of Slavery. Almost\nuniformly I found they cherished a secret desire for liberty. Some of\nthem expressed the most ardent anxiety to escape, and consulted me\non the best method of effecting it. The fear of punishment, however,\nwhich they knew was certain to attend their re-capture and return, in\nall cases proved sufficient to deter them from the experiment. Having\nall my life breathed the free air of the North, and conscious that I\npossessed the same feelings and affections that find a place in the\nwhite man's breast; conscious, moreover, of an intelligence equal to\nthat of some men, at least, with a fairer skin, I was too ignorant,\nperhaps too independent, to conceive how any one could be content to\nlive in the abject condition of a slave. I could not comprehend the\njustice of that law, or that religion, which upholds or recognizes the\nprinciple of Slavery; and never once, I am proud to say, did I fail to\ncounsel any one who came to me, to watch his opportunity, and strike\nfor freedom.\n\nI continued to reside at Saratoga until the spring of 1841. The\nflattering anticipations which, seven years before, had seduced us\nfrom the quiet farm-house, on the east side of the Hudson, had not\nbeen realized. Though always in comfortable circumstances, we had\nnot prospered. The society and associations at that world-renowned\nwatering place, were not calculated to preserve the simple habits\nof industry and economy to which I had been accustomed, but, on\nthe contrary, to substitute others in their stead, tending to\nshiftlessness and extravagance.\n\nAt this time we were the parents of three children--Elizabeth,\nMargaret, and Alonzo. Elizabeth, the eldest, was in her tenth year;\nMargaret was two years younger, and little Alonzo had just passed his\nfifth birth-day. They filled our house with gladness. Their young\nvoices were music in our ears. Many an airy castle did their mother\nand myself build for the little innocents. When not at labor I was\nalways walking with them, clad in their best attire, through the\nstreets and groves of Saratoga. Their presence was my delight; and\nI clasped them to my bosom with as warm and tender love as if their\nclouded skins had been as white as snow.\n\nThus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever\nunusual--nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an\nobscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world. But now\nI had reached a turning point in my existence--reached the threshold\nof unutterable wrong, and sorrow, and despair. Now had I approached\nwithin the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was\nsoon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all\nmy kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a\nweary year.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n  THE TWO STRANGERS--THE CIRCUS COMPANY--DEPARTURE FROM\n  SARATOGA--VENTRILOQUISM AND LEGERDEMAIN--JOURNEY TO NEW-YORK--FREE\n  PAPERS--BROWN AND HAMILTON--THE HASTE TO REACH THE CIRCUS--ARRIVAL IN\n  WASHINGTON--FUNERAL OF HARRISON--THE SUDDEN SICKNESS--THE TORMENT OF\n  THIRST--THE RECEDING LIGHT--INSENSIBILITY--CHAINS AND DARKNESS.\n\n\nOne morning, towards the latter part of the month of March, 1841,\nhaving at that time no particular business to engage my attention, I\nwas walking about the village of Saratoga Springs, thinking to myself\nwhere I might obtain some present employment, until the busy season\nshould arrive. Anne, as was her usual custom, had gone over to Sandy\nHill, a distance of some twenty miles, to take charge of the culinary\ndepartment at Sherrill's Coffee House, during the session of the\ncourt. Elizabeth, I think, had accompanied her. Margaret and Alonzo\nwere with their aunt at Saratoga.\n\nOn the corner of Congress street and Broadway, near the tavern,\nthen, and for aught I know to the contrary, still kept by Mr. Moon,\nI was met by two gentlemen of respectable appearance, both of whom\nwere entirely unknown to me. I have the impression that they were\nintroduced to me by some one of my acquaintances, but who, I have in\nvain endeavored to recall, with the remark that I was an expert player\non the violin.\n\nAt any rate, they immediately entered into conversation on that\nsubject, making numerous inquiries touching my proficiency in that\nrespect. My responses being to all appearances satisfactory, they\nproposed to engage my services for a short period, stating, at the\nsame time, I was just such a person as their business required. Their\nnames, as they afterwards gave them to me, were Merrill Brown and\nAbram Hamilton, though whether these were their true appellations,\nI have strong reasons to doubt. The former was a man apparently\nforty years of age, somewhat short and thick-set, with a countenance\nindicating shrewdness and intelligence. He wore a black frock coat and\nblack hat, and said he resided either at Rochester or at Syracuse.\nThe latter was a young man of fair complexion and light eyes, and, I\nshould judge, had not passed the age of twenty-five. He was tall and\nslender, dressed in a snuff-colored coat, with glossy hat, and vest of\nelegant pattern. His whole apparel was in the extreme of fashion. His\nappearance was somewhat effeminate, but prepossessing, and there was\nabout him an easy air, that showed he had mingled with the world. They\nwere connected, as they informed me, with a circus company, then in\nthe city of Washington; that they were on their way thither to rejoin\nit, having left it for a short time to make an excursion northward,\nfor the purpose of seeing the country, and were paying their expenses\nby an occasional exhibition. They also remarked that they had found\nmuch difficulty in procuring music for their entertainments, and that\nif I would accompany them as far as New-York, they would give me one\ndollar for each day's services, and three dollars in addition for\nevery night I played at their performances, besides sufficient to pay\nthe expenses of my return from New-York to Saratoga.\n\nI at once accepted the tempting offer, both for the reward it\npromised, and from a desire to visit the metropolis. They were anxious\nto leave immediately. Thinking my absence would be brief, I did\nnot deem it necessary to write to Anne whither I had gone; in fact\nsupposing that my return, perhaps, would be as soon as hers. So taking\na change of linen and my violin, I was ready to depart. The carriage\nwas brought round--a covered one, drawn by a pair of noble bays,\naltogether forming an elegant establishment. Their baggage, consisting\nof three large trunks, was fastened on the rack, and mounting to the\ndriver's seat, while they took their places in the rear, I drove away\nfrom Saratoga on the road to Albany, elated with my new position, and\nhappy as I had ever been, on any day in all my life.\n\nWe passed through Ballston, and striking the ridge road, as it is\ncalled, if my memory correctly serves me, followed it direct to\nAlbany. We reached that city before dark, and stopped at a hotel\nsouthward from the Museum.\n\nThis night I had an opportunity of witnessing one of their\nperformances--the only one, during the whole period I was with them.\nHamilton was stationed at the door; I formed the orchestra, while\nBrown provided the entertainment. It consisted in throwing balls,\ndancing on the rope, frying pancakes in a hat, causing invisible pigs\nto squeal, and other like feats of ventriloquism and legerdemain.\nThe audience was extraordinarily sparse, and not of the selectest\ncharacter at that, and Hamilton's report of the proceeds presented but\na \"beggarly account of empty boxes.\"\n\nEarly next morning we renewed our journey. The burden of their\nconversation now was the expression of an anxiety to reach the\ncircus without delay. They hurried forward, without again stopping\nto exhibit, and in due course of time, we reached New-York, taking\nlodgings at a house on the west side of the city, in a street running\nfrom Broadway to the river. I supposed my journey was at an end, and\nexpected in a day or two at least, to return to my friends and family\nat Saratoga. Brown and Hamilton, however, began to importune me to\ncontinue with them to Washington. They alleged that immediately on\ntheir arrival, now that the summer season was approaching, the circus\nwould set out for the north. They promised me a situation and high\nwages if I would accompany them. Largely did they expatiate on the\nadvantages that would result to me, and such were the flattering\nrepresentations they made, that I finally concluded to accept the\noffer.\n\nThe next morning they suggested that, inasmuch as we were about\nentering a slave State, it would be well, before leaving New-York, to\nprocure free papers. The idea struck me as a prudent one, though I\nthink it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they not proposed it.\nWe proceeded at once to what I understood to be the Custom House. They\nmade oath to certain facts showing I was a free man. A paper was drawn\nup and handed us, with the direction to take it to the clerk's office.\nWe did so, and the clerk having added something to it, for which he\nwas paid six shillings, we returned again to the Custom House. Some\nfurther formalities were gone through with before it was completed,\nwhen, paying the officer two dollars, I placed the papers in my\npocket, and started with my two friends to our hotel. I thought at the\ntime, I must confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of\nobtaining them--the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never\nhaving suggested itself to me in the remotest manner. The clerk, to\nwhom we were directed, I remember, made a memorandum in a large book,\nwhich, I presume, is in the office yet. A reference to the entries\nduring the latter part of March, or first of April, 1841, I have no\ndoubt will satisfy the incredulous, at least so far as this particular\ntransaction is concerned.\n\nWith the evidence of freedom in my possession, the next day after\nour arrival in New-York, we crossed the ferry to Jersey City, and\ntook the road to Philadelphia. Here we remained one night, continuing\nour journey towards Baltimore early in the morning. In due time, we\narrived in the latter city, and stopped at a hotel near the railroad\ndepot, either kept by a Mr. Rathbone, or known as the Rathbone House.\nAll the way from New-York, their anxiety to reach the circus seemed\nto grow more and more intense. We left the carriage at Baltimore, and\nentering the cars, proceeded to Washington, at which place we arrived\njust at nightfall, the evening previous to the funeral of General\nHarrison, and stopped at Gadsby's Hotel, on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAfter supper they called me to their apartments, and paid me\nforty-three dollars, a sum greater than my wages amounted to, which\nact of generosity was in consequence, they said, of their not having\nexhibited as often as they had given me to anticipate, during our\ntrip from Saratoga. They moreover informed me that it had been\nthe intention of the circus company to leave Washington the next\nmorning, but that on account of the funeral, they had concluded to\nremain another day. They were then, as they had been from the time\nof our first meeting, extremely kind. No opportunity was omitted of\naddressing me in the language of approbation; while, on the other\nhand, I was certainly much prepossessed in their favor. I gave them\nmy confidence without reserve, and would freely have trusted them to\nalmost any extent. Their constant conversation and manner towards\nme--their foresight in suggesting the idea of free papers, and a\nhundred other little acts, unnecessary to be repeated--all indicated\nthat they were friends indeed, sincerely solicitous for my welfare.\nI know not but they were. I know not but they were innocent of the\ngreat wickedness of which I now believe them guilty. Whether they were\naccessory to my misfortunes--subtle and inhuman monsters in the shape\nof men--designedly luring me away from home and family, and liberty,\nfor the sake of gold--those who read these pages will have the same\nmeans of determining as myself. If they were innocent, my sudden\ndisappearance must have been unaccountable indeed; but revolving in\nmy mind all the attending circumstances, I never yet could indulge,\ntowards them, so charitable a supposition.\n\nAfter receiving the money from them, of which they appeared to have\nan abundance, they advised me not to go into the streets that night,\ninasmuch as I was unacquainted with the customs of the city. Promising\nto remember their advice, I left them together, and soon after was\nshown by a colored servant to a sleeping room in the back part of the\nhotel, on the ground floor. I laid down to rest, thinking of home and\nwife, and children, and the long distance that stretched between us,\nuntil I fell asleep. But no good angel of pity came to my bedside,\nbidding me to fly--no voice of mercy forewarned me in my dreams of the\ntrials that were just at hand.\n\nThe next day there was a great pageant in Washington. The roar of\ncannon and the tolling of bells filled the air, while many houses\nwere shrouded with crape, and the streets were black with people. As\nthe day advanced, the procession made its appearance, coming slowly\nthrough the Avenue, carriage after carriage, in long succession, while\nthousands upon thousands followed on foot--all moving to the sound of\nmelancholy music. They were bearing the dead body of Harrison to the\ngrave.\n\nFrom early in the morning, I was constantly in the company of Hamilton\nand Brown. They were the only persons I knew in Washington. We stood\ntogether as the funeral pomp passed by. I remember distinctly how the\nwindow glass would break and rattle to the ground, after each report\nof the cannon they were firing in the burial ground. We went to the\nCapitol, and walked a long time about the grounds. In the afternoon,\nthey strolled towards the President's House, all the time keeping me\nnear to them, and pointing out various places of interest. As yet,\nI had seen nothing of the circus. In fact, I had thought of it but\nlittle, if at all, amidst the excitement of the day.\n\nMy friends, several times during the afternoon, entered drinking\nsaloons, and called for liquor. They were by no means in the habit,\nhowever, so far as I knew them, of indulging to excess. On these\noccasions, after serving themselves, they would pour out a glass and\nhand it to me. I did not become intoxicated, as may be inferred from\nwhat subsequently occurred. Towards evening, and soon after partaking\nof one of these potations, I began to experience most unpleasant\nsensations. I felt extremely ill. My head commenced aching--a dull,\nheavy pain, inexpressibly disagreeable. At the supper table, I was\nwithout appetite; the sight and flavor of food was nauseous. About\ndark the same servant conducted me to the room I had occupied the\nprevious night. Brown and Hamilton advised me to retire, commiserating\nme kindly, and expressing hopes that I would be better in the morning.\nDivesting myself of coat and boots merely, I threw myself upon the\nbed. It was impossible to sleep. The pain in my head continued to\nincrease, until it became almost unbearable. In a short time I became\nthirsty. My lips were parched. I could think of nothing but water--of\nlakes and flowing rivers, of brooks where I had stooped to drink, and\nof the dripping bucket, rising with its cool and overflowing nectar,\nfrom the bottom of the well. Towards midnight, as near as I could\njudge, I arose, unable longer to bear such intensity of thirst. I was\na stranger in the house, and knew nothing of its apartments. There was\nno one up, as I could observe. Groping about at random, I knew not\nwhere, I found the way at last to a kitchen in the basement. Two or\nthree colored servants were moving through it, one of whom, a woman,\ngave me two glasses of water. It afforded momentary relief, but by the\ntime I had reached my room again, the same burning desire of drink,\nthe same tormenting thirst, had again returned. It was even more\ntorturing than before, as was also the wild pain in my head, if such a\nthing could be. I was in sore distress--in most excruciating agony! I\nseemed to stand on the brink of madness! The memory of that night of\nhorrible suffering will follow me to the grave.\n\nIn the course of an hour or more after my return from the kitchen,\nI was conscious of some one entering my room. There seemed to be\nseveral--a mingling of various voices,--but how many, or who they\nwere, I cannot tell. Whether Brown and Hamilton were among them, is\na mere matter of conjecture. I only remember, with any degree of\ndistinctness, that I was told it was necessary to go to a physician\nand procure medicine, and that pulling on my boots, without coat\nor hat, I followed them through a long passage-way, or alley, into\nthe open street. It ran out at right angles from Pennsylvania\nAvenue. On the opposite side there was a light burning in a window.\nMy impression is there were then three persons with me, but it is\naltogether indefinite and vague, and like the memory of a painful\ndream. Going towards the light, which I imagined proceeded from a\nphysician's office, and which seemed to recede as I advanced, is the\nlast glimmering recollection I can now recall. From that moment I was\ninsensible. How long I remained in that condition--whether only that\nnight, or many days and nights--I do not know; but when consciousness\nreturned, I found myself alone, in utter darkness, and in chains.\n\nThe pain in my head had subsided in a measure, but I was very faint\nand weak. I was sitting upon a low bench, made of rough boards, and\nwithout coat or hat. I was hand-cuffed. Around my ankles also were\na pair of heavy fetters. One end of a chain was fastened to a large\nring in the floor, the other to the fetters on my ankles. I tried in\nvain to stand upon my feet. Waking from such a painful trance, it\nwas some time before I could collect my thoughts. Where was I? What\nwas the meaning of these chains? Where were Brown and Hamilton? What\nhad I done to deserve imprisonment in such a dungeon? I could not\ncomprehend. There was a blank of some indefinite period, preceding\nmy awakening in that lonely place, the events of which the utmost\nstretch of memory was unable to recall. I listened intently for some\nsign or sound of life, but nothing broke the oppressive silence, save\nthe clinking of my chains, whenever I chanced to move. I spoke aloud,\nbut the sound of my voice startled me. I felt of my pockets, so far\nas the fetters would allow--far enough, indeed, to ascertain that I\nhad not only been robbed of liberty, but that my money and free papers\nwere also gone! Then did the idea begin to break upon my mind, at\nfirst dim and confused, that I had been kidnapped. But that I thought\nwas incredible. There must have been some misapprehension--some\nunfortunate mistake. It could not be that a free citizen of New-York,\nwho had wronged no man, nor violated any law, should be dealt with\nthus inhumanly. The more I contemplated my situation, however, the\nmore I became confirmed in my suspicions. It was a desolate thought,\nindeed. I felt there was no trust or mercy in unfeeling man; and\ncommending myself to the God of the oppressed, bowed my head upon my\nfettered hands, and wept most bitterly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n  PAINFUL MEDITATIONS--JAMES H. BURCH--WILLIAMS' SLAVE PEN IN\n  WASHINGTON--THE LACKEY, RADBURN--ASSERT MY FREEDOM--THE ANGER OF\n  THE TRADER--THE PADDLE AND CAT-O'-NINETAILS--THE WHIPPING--NEW\n  ACQUAINTANCES--RAY, WILLIAMS, AND RANDALL--ARRIVAL OF LITTLE EMILY\n  AND HER MOTHER IN THE PEN--MATERNAL SORROWS--THE STORY OF ELIZA.\n\n\nSome three hours elapsed, during which time I remained seated on the\nlow bench, absorbed in painful meditations. At length I heard the\ncrowing of a cock, and soon a distant rumbling sound, as of carriages\nhurrying through the streets, came to my ears, and I knew that it\nwas day. No ray of light, however, penetrated my prison. Finally,\nI heard footsteps immediately overhead, as of some one walking to\nand fro. It occurred to me then that I must be in an underground\napartment, and the damp, mouldy odors of the place confirmed the\nsupposition. The noise above continued for at least an hour, when,\nat last, I heard footsteps approaching from without. A key rattled\nin the lock--a strong door swung back upon its hinges, admitting a\nflood of light, and two men entered and stood before me. One of them\nwas a large, powerful man, forty years of age, perhaps, with dark,\nchestnut-colored hair, slightly interspersed with gray. His face was\nfull, his complexion flush, his features grossly coarse, expressive\nof nothing but cruelty and cunning. He was about five feet ten inches\nhigh, of full habit, and, without prejudice, I must be allowed to say,\nwas a man whose whole appearance was sinister and repugnant. His name\nwas James H. Burch, as I learned afterwards--a well-known slave-dealer\nin Washington; and then, or lately, connected in business, as a\npartner, with Theophilus Freeman, of New-Orleans. The person who\naccompanied him was a simple lackey, named Ebenezer Radburn, who acted\nmerely in the capacity of turnkey. Both of these men still live in\nWashington, or did, at the time of my return through that city from\nslavery in January last.\n\nThe light admitted through the open door enabled me to observe the\nroom in which I was confined. It was about twelve feet square--the\nwalls of solid masonry. The floor was of heavy plank. There was one\nsmall window, crossed with great iron bars, with an outside shutter,\nsecurely fastened.\n\nAn iron-bound door led into an adjoining cell, or vault, wholly\ndestitute of windows, or any means of admitting light. The furniture\nof the room in which I was, consisted of the wooden bench on which\nI sat, an old-fashioned, dirty box stove, and besides these, in\neither cell, there was neither bed, nor blanket, nor any other thing\nwhatever. The door, through which Burch and Radburn entered, led\nthrough a small passage, up a flight of steps into a yard, surrounded\nby a brick wall ten or twelve feet high, immediately in rear of a\nbuilding of the same width as itself. The yard extended rearward from\nthe house about thirty feet. In one part of the wall there was a\nstrongly ironed door, opening into a narrow, covered passage, leading\nalong one side of the house into the street. The doom of the colored\nman, upon whom the door leading out of that narrow passage closed,\nwas sealed. The top of the wall supported one end of a roof, which\nascended inwards, forming a kind of open shed. Underneath the roof\nthere was a crazy loft all round, where slaves, if so disposed, might\nsleep at night, or in inclement weather seek shelter from the storm.\nIt was like a farmer's barnyard in most respects, save it was so\nconstructed that the outside world could never see the human cattle\nthat were herded there.\n\nThe building to which the yard was attached, was two stories high,\nfronting on one of the public streets of Washington. Its outside\npresented only the appearance of a quiet private residence. A stranger\nlooking at it, would never have dreamed of its execrable uses. Strange\nas it may seem, within plain sight of this same house, looking down\nfrom its commanding height upon it, was the Capitol. The voices of\npatriotic representatives boasting of freedom and equality, and the\nrattling of the poor slave's chains, almost commingled. A slave pen\nwithin the very shadow of the Capitol!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch is a correct description as it was in 1841, of Williams' slave\npen in Washington, in one of the cellars of which I found myself so\nunaccountably confined.\n\n\"Well, my boy, how do you feel now?\" said Burch, as he entered through\nthe open door. I replied that I was sick, and inquired the cause of my\nimprisonment. He answered that I was his slave--that he had bought me,\nand that he was about to send me to New-Orleans. I asserted, aloud and\nboldly, that I was a free man--a resident of Saratoga, where I had a\nwife and children, who were also free, and that my name was Northup.\nI complained bitterly of the strange treatment I had received, and\nthreatened, upon my liberation, to have satisfaction for the wrong.\nHe denied that I was free, and with an emphatic oath, declared that I\ncame from Georgia. Again and again I asserted I was no man's slave,\nand insisted upon his taking off my chains at once. He endeavored to\nhush me, as if he feared my voice would be overheard. But I would not\nbe silent, and denounced the authors of my imprisonment, whoever they\nmight be, as unmitigated villains. Finding he could not quiet me, he\nflew into a towering passion. With blasphemous oaths, he called me\na black liar, a runaway from Georgia, and every other profane and\nvulgar epithet that the most indecent fancy could conceive.\n\nDuring this time Radburn was standing silently by. His business was,\nto oversee this human, or rather inhuman stable, receiving slaves,\nfeeding and whipping them, at the rate of two shillings a head per\nday. Turning to him, Burch ordered the paddle and cat-o'-ninetails\nto be brought in. He disappeared, and in a few moments returned\nwith these instruments of torture. The paddle, as it is termed in\nslave-beating parlance, or at least the one with which I first became\nacquainted, and of which I now speak, was a piece of hard-wood\nboard, eighteen or twenty inches long, moulded to the shape of an\nold-fashioned pudding stick, or ordinary oar. The flattened portion,\nwhich was about the size in circumference of two open hands, was bored\nwith a small auger in numerous places. The cat was a large rope of\nmany strands--the strands unraveled, and a knot tied at the extremity\nof each.\n\nAs soon as these formidable whips appeared, I was seized by both\nof them, and roughly divested of my clothing. My feet, as has been\nstated, were fastened to the floor. Drawing me over the bench, face\ndownwards, Radburn placed his heavy foot upon the fetters, between my\nwrists, holding them painfully to the floor. With the paddle, Burch\ncommenced beating me. Blow after blow was inflicted upon my naked\nbody. When his unrelenting arm grew tired, he stopped and asked\nif I still insisted I was a free man. I did insist upon it, and then\nthe blows were renewed, faster and more energetically, if possible,\nthan before. When again tired, he would repeat the same question, and\nreceiving the same answer, continue his cruel labor. All this time,\nthe incarnate devil was uttering most fiendish oaths. At length the\npaddle broke, leaving the useless handle in his hand. Still I would\nnot yield. All his brutal blows could not force from my lips the foul\nlie that I was a slave. Casting madly on the floor the handle of the\nbroken paddle, he seized the rope. This was far more painful than the\nother. I struggled with all my power, but it was in vain. I prayed\nfor mercy, but my prayer was only answered with imprecations and with\nstripes. I thought I must die beneath the lashes of the accursed\nbrute. Even now the flesh crawls upon my bones, as I recall the scene.\nI was all on fire. My sufferings I can compare to nothing else than\nthe burning agonies of hell!\n\n[Illustration: SCENE IN THE SLAVE PEN AT WASHINGTON.]\n\nAt last I became silent to his repeated questions. I would make no\nreply. In fact, I was becoming almost unable to speak. Still he plied\nthe lash without stint upon my poor body, until it seemed that the\nlacerated flesh was stripped from my bones at every stroke. A man with\na particle of mercy in his soul would not have beaten even a dog so\ncruelly. At length Radburn said that it was useless to whip me any\nmore--that I would be sore enough. Thereupon, Burch desisted, saying,\nwith an admonitory shake of his fist in my face, and hissing the\nwords through his firm-set teeth, that if ever I dared to utter again\nthat I was entitled to my freedom, that I had been kidnapped, or any\nthing whatever of the kind, the castigation I had just received was\nnothing in comparison with what would follow. He swore that he would\neither conquer or kill me. With these consolatory words, the fetters\nwere taken from my wrists, my feet still remaining fastened to the\nring; the shutter of the little barred window, which had been opened,\nwas again closed, and going out, locking the great door behind them, I\nwas left in darkness as before.\n\nIn an hour, perhaps two, my heart leaped to my throat, as the key\nrattled in the door again. I, who had been so lonely, and who had\nlonged so ardently to see some one, I cared not who, now shuddered\nat the thought of man's approach. A human face was fearful to me,\nespecially a white one. Radburn entered, bringing with him, on a tin\nplate, a piece of shriveled fried pork, a slice of bread and a cup\nof water. He asked me how I felt, and remarked that I had received a\npretty severe flogging. He remonstrated with me against the propriety\nof asserting my freedom. In rather a patronizing and confidential\nmanner, he gave it to me as his advice, that the less I said on that\nsubject the better it would be for me. The man evidently endeavored\nto appear kind--whether touched at the sight of my sad condition, or\nwith the view of silencing, on my part, any further expression of\nmy rights, it is not necessary now to conjecture. He unlocked the\nfetters from my ankles, opened the shutters of the little window, and\ndeparted, leaving me again alone.\n\nBy this time I had become stiff and sore; my body was covered with\nblisters, and it was with great pain and difficulty that I could\nmove. From the window I could observe nothing but the roof resting on\nthe adjacent wall. At night I laid down upon the damp, hard floor,\nwithout any pillow or covering whatever. Punctually, twice a day,\nRadburn came in, with his pork, and bread, and water. I had but\nlittle appetite, though I was tormented with continual thirst. My\nwounds would not permit me to remain but a few minutes in any one\nposition; so, sitting, or standing, or moving slowly round, I passed\nthe days and nights. I was heart sick and discouraged. Thoughts of\nmy family, of my wife and children, continually occupied my mind.\nWhen sleep overpowered me I dreamed of them--dreamed I was again in\nSaratoga--that I could see their faces, and hear their voices calling\nme. Awakening from the pleasant phantasms of sleep to the bitter\nrealities around me, I could but groan and weep. Still my spirit was\nnot broken. I indulged the anticipation of escape, and that speedily.\nIt was impossible, I reasoned, that men could be so unjust as to\ndetain me as a slave, when the truth of my case was known. Burch,\nascertaining I was no runaway from Georgia, would certainly let me\ngo. Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent, I\ncould not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to\nmy imprisonment. Surely they would seek me out--they would deliver\nme from thraldom. Alas! I had not then learned the measure of \"man's\ninhumanity to man,\" nor to what limitless extent of wickedness he will\ngo for the love of gain.\n\nIn the course of several days the outer door was thrown open, allowing\nme the liberty of the yard. There I found three slaves--one of\nthem a lad of ten years, the others young men of about twenty and\ntwenty-five. I was not long in forming an acquaintance, and learning\ntheir names and the particulars of their history.\n\nThe eldest was a colored man named Clemens Ray. He had lived in\nWashington; had driven a hack, and worked in a livery stable there\nfor a long time. He was very intelligent, and fully comprehended his\nsituation. The thought of going south overwhelmed him with grief.\nBurch had purchased him a few days before, and had placed him there\nuntil such time as he was ready to send him to the New-Orleans market.\nFrom him I learned for the first time that I was in William's Slave\nPen, a place I had never heard of previously. He described to me the\nuses for which it was designed. I repeated to him the particulars of\nmy unhappy story, but he could only give me the consolation of his\nsympathy. He also advised me to be silent henceforth on the subject\nof my freedom; for, knowing the character of Burch, he assured me\nthat it would only be attended with renewed whipping. The next\neldest was named John Williams. He was raised in Virginia, not far\nfrom Washington. Burch had taken him in payment of a debt, and he\nconstantly entertained the hope that his master would redeem him--a\nhope that was subsequently realized. The lad was a sprightly child,\nthat answered to the name of Randall. Most of the time he was playing\nabout the yard, but occasionally would cry, calling for his mother,\nand wondering when she would come. His mother's absence seemed to be\nthe great and only grief in his little heart. He was too young to\nrealize his condition, and when the memory of his mother was not in\nhis mind, he amused us with his pleasant pranks.\n\nAt night, Ray, Williams, and the boy, slept in the loft of the shed,\nwhile I was locked in the cell. Finally we were each provided with\nblankets, such as are used upon horses--the only bedding I was allowed\nto have for twelve years afterwards. Ray and Williams asked me many\nquestions about New-York--how colored people were treated there; how\nthey could have homes and families of their own, with none to disturb\nand oppress them; and Ray, especially, sighed continually for freedom.\nSuch conversations, however, were not in the hearing of Burch, or the\nkeeper Radburn. Aspirations such as these would have brought down the\nlash upon our backs.\n\nIt is necessary in this narrative, in order to present a full and\ntruthful statement of all the principal events in the history of my\nlife, and to portray the institution of Slavery as I have seen and\nknown it, to speak of well-known places, and of many persons who are\nyet living. I am, and always was, an entire stranger in Washington\nand its vicinity--aside from Burch and Radburn, knowing no man there,\nexcept as I have heard of them through my enslaved companions. What I\nam about to say, if false, can be easily contradicted.\n\nI remained in Williams' slave pen about two weeks. The night previous\nto my departure a woman was brought in, weeping bitterly, and\nleading by the hand a little child. They were Randall's mother and\nhalf-sister. On meeting them he was overjoyed, clinging to her dress,\nkissing the child, and exhibiting every demonstration of delight. The\nmother also clasped him in her arms, embraced him tenderly, and gazed\nat him fondly through her tears, calling him by many an endearing name.\n\nEmily, the child, was seven or eight years old, of light complexion,\nand with a face of admirable beauty. Her hair fell in curls around her\nneck, while the style and richness of her dress, and the neatness of\nher whole appearance indicated she had been brought up in the midst\nof wealth. She was a sweet child indeed. The woman also was arrayed\nin silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended\nfrom her ears. Her air and manners, the correctness and propriety\nof her language--all showed, evidently, that she had sometime stood\nabove the common level of a slave. She seemed to be amazed at\nfinding herself in such a place as that. It was plainly a sudden and\nunexpected turn of fortune that had brought her there. Filling the air\nwith her complainings, she was hustled, with the children and myself,\ninto the cell. Language can convey but an inadequate impression of the\nlamentations to which she gave incessant utterance. Throwing herself\nupon the floor, and encircling the children in her arms, she poured\nforth such touching words as only maternal love and kindness can\nsuggest. They nestled closely to her, as if _there_ only was there any\nsafety or protection. At last they slept, their heads resting upon\nher lap. While they slumbered, she smoothed the hair back from their\nlittle foreheads, and talked to them all night long. She called them\nher darlings--her sweet babes--poor innocent things, that knew not the\nmisery they were destined to endure. Soon they would have no mother\nto comfort them--they would be taken from her. What would become of\nthem? Oh! she could not live away from her little Emmy and her dear\nboy. They had always been good children, and had such loving ways. It\nwould break her heart, God knew, she said, if they were taken from\nher; and yet she knew they meant to sell them, and, may be, they would\nbe separated, and could never see each other any more. It was enough\nto melt a heart of stone to listen to the pitiful expressions of that\ndesolate and distracted mother. Her name was Eliza; and this was the\nstory of her life, as she afterwards related it:\n\nShe was the slave of Elisha Berry, a rich man, living in the\nneighborhood of Washington. She was born, I think she said, on his\nplantation. Years before, he had fallen into dissipated habits, and\nquarreled with his wife. In fact, soon after the birth of Randall,\nthey separated. Leaving his wife and daughter in the house they had\nalways occupied, he erected a new one near by, on the estate. Into\nthis house he brought Eliza; and, on condition of her living with\nhim, she and her children were to be emancipated. She resided with\nhim there nine years, with servants to attend upon her, and provided\nwith every comfort and luxury of life. Emily was his child! Finally,\nher young mistress, who had always remained with her mother at the\nhomestead, married a Mr. Jacob Brooks. At length, for some cause, (as\nI gathered from her relation,) beyond Berry's control, a division of\nhis property was made. She and her children fell to the share of Mr.\nBrooks. During the nine years she had lived with Berry, in consequence\nof the position she was compelled to occupy, she and Emily had become\nthe object of Mrs. Berry and her daughter's hatred and dislike. Berry\nhimself she represented as a man of naturally a kind heart, who always\npromised her that she should have her freedom, and who, she had no\ndoubt, would grant it to her then, if it were only in his power.\nAs soon as they thus came into the possession and control of the\ndaughter, it became very manifest they would not live long together.\nThe sight of Eliza seemed to be odious to Mrs. Brooks; neither could\nshe bear to look upon the child, half-sister, and beautiful as she was!\n\nThe day she was led into the pen, Brooks had brought her from the\nestate into the city, under pretence that the time had come when\nher free papers were to be executed, in fulfillment of her master's\npromise. Elated at the prospect of immediate liberty, she decked\nherself and little Emmy in their best apparel, and accompanied him\nwith a joyful heart. On their arrival in the city, instead of being\nbaptized into the family of freemen, she was delivered to the trader\nBurch. The paper that was executed was a bill of sale. The hope of\nyears was blasted in a moment. From the height of most exulting\nhappiness to the utmost depths of wretchedness, she had that day\ndescended. No wonder that she wept, and filled the pen with wailings\nand expressions of heart-rending woe.\n\nEliza is now dead. Far up the Red River, where it pours its waters\nsluggishly through the unhealthy low lands of Louisiana, she rests\nin the grave at last--the only resting place of the poor slave! How\nall her fears were realized--how she mourned day and night, and never\nwould be comforted--how, as she predicted, her heart did indeed break,\nwith the burden of maternal sorrow, will be seen as the narrative\nproceeds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n  ELIZA'S SORROWS--PREPARATION TO EMBARK--DRIVEN THROUGH THE STREETS\n  OF WASHINGTON--HAIL, COLUMBIA--THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON--CLEM\n  RAY--THE BREAKFAST ON THE STEAMER--THE HAPPY BIRDS--AQUIA\n  CREEK--FREDERICKSBURGH--ARRIVAL IN RICHMOND--GOODIN AND HIS\n  SLAVE PEN--ROBERT, OF CINCINNATI--DAVID AND HIS WIFE--MARY AND\n  LETHE--CLEM'S RETURN--HIS SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE TO CANADA--THE BRIG\n  ORLEANS--JAMES H. BURCH.\n\n\nAt intervals during the first night of Eliza's incarceration in the\npen, she complained bitterly of Jacob Brooks, her young mistress'\nhusband. She declared that had she been aware of the deception he\nintended to practice upon her, he never would have brought her there\nalive. They had chosen the opportunity of getting her away when\nMaster Berry was absent from the plantation. He had always been kind\nto her. She wished that she could see him; but she knew that even\nhe was unable now to rescue her. Then would she commence weeping\nagain--kissing the sleeping children--talking first to one, then to\nthe other, as they lay in their unconscious slumbers, with their\nheads upon her lap. So wore the long night away; and when the morning\ndawned, and night had come again, still she kept mourning on, and\nwould not be consoled.\n\nAbout midnight following, the cell door opened, and Burch and Radburn\nentered, with lanterns in their hands. Burch, with an oath, ordered us\nto roll up our blankets without delay, and get ready to go on board\nthe boat. He swore we would be left unless we hurried fast. He aroused\nthe children from their slumbers with a rough shake, and said they\nwere d--d sleepy, it appeared. Going out into the yard, he called Clem\nRay, ordering him to leave the loft and come into the cell, and bring\nhis blanket with him. When Clem appeared, he placed us side by side,\nand fastened us together with hand-cuffs--my left hand to his right.\nJohn Williams had been taken out a day or two before, his master\nhaving redeemed him, greatly to his delight. Clem and I were ordered\nto march, Eliza and the children following. We were conducted into\nthe yard, from thence into the covered passage, and up a flight of\nsteps through a side door into the upper room, where I had heard the\nwalking to and fro. Its furniture was a stove, a few old chairs, and a\nlong table, covered with papers. It was a white-washed room, without\nany carpet on the floor, and seemed a sort of office. By one of the\nwindows, I remember, hung a rusty sword, which attracted my attention.\nBurch's trunk was there. In obedience to his orders, I took hold of\none of its handles with my unfettered hand, while he taking hold of\nthe other, we proceeded out of the front door into the street in the\nsame order as we had left the cell.\n\nIt was a dark night. All was quiet. I could see lights, or the\nreflection of them, over towards Pennsylvania Avenue, but there was\nno one, not even a straggler, to be seen. I was almost resolved to\nattempt to break away. Had I not been hand-cuffed the attempt would\ncertainly have been made, whatever consequence might have followed.\nRadburn was in the rear, carrying a large stick, and hurrying up\nthe children as fast as the little ones could walk. So we passed,\nhand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington--through\nthe Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told,\nrests on the foundation of man's inalienable right to life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness! Hail! Columbia, happy land, indeed!\n\nReaching the steamboat, we were quickly hustled into the hold, among\nbarrels and boxes of freight. A colored servant brought a light, the\nbell rung, and soon the vessel started down the Potomac, carrying\nus we knew not where. The bell tolled as we passed the tomb of\nWashington! Burch, no doubt, with uncovered head, bowed reverently\nbefore the sacred ashes of the man who devoted his illustrious life to\nthe liberty of his country.\n\nNone of us slept that night but Randall and little Emmy. For the first\ntime Clem Ray was wholly overcome. To him the idea of going south was\nterrible in the extreme. He was leaving the friends and associations\nof his youth--every thing that was dear and precious to his heart--in\nall probability never to return. He and Eliza mingled their tears\ntogether, bemoaning their cruel fate. For my own part, difficult as\nit was, I endeavored to keep up my spirits. I resolved in my mind a\nhundred plans of escape, and fully determined to make the attempt\nthe first desperate chance that offered. I had by this time become\nsatisfied, however, that my true policy was to say nothing further on\nthe subject of my having been born a freeman. It would but expose me\nto mal-treatment, and diminish the chances of liberation.\n\nAfter sunrise in the morning we were called up on deck to breakfast.\nBurch took our hand-cuffs off, and we sat down to table. He asked\nEliza if she would take a dram. She declined, thanking him politely.\nDuring the meal we were all silent--not a word passed between us. A\nmulatto woman who served at table seemed to take an interest in our\nbehalf--told us to cheer up, and not to be so cast down. Breakfast\nover, the hand-cuffs were restored, and Burch ordered us out on the\nstern deck. We sat down together on some boxes, still saying nothing\nin Burch's presence. Occasionally a passenger would walk out to where\nwe were, look at us for a while, then silently return.\n\nIt was a very pleasant morning. The fields along the river were\ncovered with verdure, far in advance of what I had been accustomed to\nsee at that season of the year. The sun shone out warmly; the birds\nwere singing in the trees. The happy birds--I envied them. I wished\nfor wings like them, that I might cleave the air to where my birdlings\nwaited vainly for their father's coming, in the cooler region of the\nNorth.\n\nIn the forenoon the steamer reached Aquia Creek. There the passengers\ntook stages--Burch and his five slaves occupying one exclusively. He\nlaughed with the children, and at one stopping place went so far as to\npurchase them a piece of gingerbread. He told me to hold up my head\nand look smart. That I might, perhaps, get a good master if I behaved\nmyself. I made him no reply. His face was hateful to me, and I could\nnot bear to look upon it. I sat in the corner, cherishing in my heart\nthe hope, not yet extinct, of some day meeting the tyrant on the soil\nof my native State.\n\nAt Fredericksburgh we were transferred from the stage coach to a car,\nand before dark arrived in Richmond, the chief city of Virginia. At\nthis city we were taken from the cars, and driven through the street\nto a slave pen, between the railroad depot and the river, kept by a\nMr. Goodin. This pen is similar to Williams' in Washington, except it\nis somewhat larger; and besides, there were two small houses standing\nat opposite corners within the yard. These houses are usually found\nwithin slave yards, being used as rooms for the examination of human\nchattels by purchasers before concluding a bargain. Unsoundness in a\nslave, as well as in a horse, detracts materially from his value. If\nno warranty is given, a close examination is a matter of particular\nimportance to the negro jockey.\n\nWe were met at the door of Goodin's yard by that gentleman himself--a\nshort, fat man, with a round, plump face, black hair and whiskers,\nand a complexion almost as dark as some of his own negroes. He had a\nhard, stern look, and was perhaps about fifty years of age. Burch and\nhe met with great cordiality. They were evidently old friends. Shaking\neach other warmly by the hand, Burch remarked he had brought some\ncompany, inquired at what time the brig would leave, and was answered\nthat it would probably leave the next day at such an hour. Goodin then\nturned to me, took hold of my arm, turned me partly round, looked at\nme sharply with the air of one who considered himself a good judge of\nproperty, and as if estimating in his own mind about how much I was\nworth.\n\n\"Well, boy, where did you come from?\"\n\nForgetting myself, for a moment, I answered, \"From New-York.\"\n\n\"New-York! H--l! what have you been doing up there?\" was his\nastonished interrogatory.\n\nObserving Burch at this moment looking at me with an angry expression\nthat conveyed a meaning it was not difficult to understand, I\nimmediately said, \"O, I have only been up that way a piece,\" in a\nmanner intended to imply that although I might have been as far as\nNew-York, yet I wished it distinctly understood that I did not belong\nto that free State, nor to any other.\n\nGoodin then turned to Clem, and then to Eliza and the children,\nexamining them severally, and asking various questions. He was pleased\nwith Emily, as was every one who saw the child's sweet countenance.\nShe was not as tidy as when I first beheld her; her hair was now\nsomewhat disheveled; but through its unkempt and soft profusion\nthere still beamed a little face of most surpassing loveliness.\n\"Altogether we were a fair lot--a devilish good lot,\" he said,\nenforcing that opinion with more than one emphatic adjective not\nfound in the Christian vocabulary. Thereupon we passed into the yard.\nQuite a number of slaves, as many as thirty I should say, were moving\nabout, or sitting on benches under the shed. They were all cleanly\ndressed--the men with hats, the women with handkerchiefs tied about\ntheir heads.\n\nBurch and Goodin, after separating from us, walked up the steps at the\nback part of the main building, and sat down upon the door sill. They\nentered into conversation, but the subject of it I could not hear.\nPresently Burch came down into the yard, unfettered me, and led me\ninto one of the small houses.\n\n\"You told that man you came from New-York,\" said he.\n\nI replied, \"I told him I had been up as far as New-York, to be sure,\nbut did not tell him I belonged there, nor that I was a freeman. I\nmeant no harm at all, Master Burch. I would not have said it had I\nthought.\"\n\nHe looked at me a moment as if he was ready to devour me, then turning\nround went out. In a few minutes he returned. \"If ever I hear you say\na word about New-York, or about your freedom, I will be the death of\nyou--I will kill you; you may rely on that,\" he ejaculated fiercely.\n\nI doubt not he understood then better than I did, the danger and the\npenalty of selling a free man into slavery. He felt the necessity\nof closing my mouth against the crime he knew he was committing. Of\ncourse, my life would not have weighed a feather, in any emergency\nrequiring such a sacrifice. Undoubtedly, he meant precisely what he\nsaid.\n\nUnder the shed on one side of the yard, there was constructed a rough\ntable, while overhead were sleeping lofts--the same as in the pen\nat Washington. After partaking at this table of our supper of pork\nand bread, I was hand-cuffed to a large yellow man, quite stout and\nfleshy, with a countenance expressive of the utmost melancholy. He was\na man of intelligence and information. Chained together, it was not\nlong before we became acquainted with each other's history. His name\nwas Robert. Like myself, he had been born free, and had a wife and\ntwo children in Cincinnati. He said he had come south with two men,\nwho had hired him in the city of his residence. Without free papers,\nhe had been seized at Fredericksburgh, placed in confinement, and\nbeaten until he had learned, as I had, the necessity and the policy\nof silence. He had been in Goodin's pen about three weeks. To this\nman I became much attached. We could sympathize with, and understand\neach other. It was with tears and a heavy heart, not many days\nsubsequently, that I saw him die, and looked for the last time upon\nhis lifeless form!\n\nRobert and myself, with Clem, Eliza and her children, slept that night\nupon our blankets, in one of the small houses in the yard. There were\nfour others, all from the same plantation, who had been sold, and\nwere now on their way south, who also occupied it with us. David and\nhis wife, Caroline, both mulattoes, were exceedingly affected. They\ndreaded the thought of being put into the cane and cotton fields;\nbut their greatest source of anxiety was the apprehension of being\nseparated. Mary, a tall, lithe girl, of a most jetty black, was\nlistless and apparently indifferent. Like many of the class, she\nscarcely knew there was such a word as freedom. Brought up in the\nignorance of a brute, she possessed but little more than a brute's\nintelligence. She was one of those, and there are very many, who fear\nnothing but their master's lash, and know no further duty than to\nobey his voice. The other was Lethe. She was of an entirely different\ncharacter. She had long, straight hair, and bore more the appearance\nof an Indian than a negro woman. She had sharp and spiteful eyes, and\ncontinually gave utterance to the language of hatred and revenge.\nHer husband had been sold. She knew not where she was. An exchange\nof masters, she was sure, could not be for the worse. She cared not\nwhither they might carry her. Pointing to the scars upon her face, the\ndesperate creature wished that she might see the day when she could\nwipe them off in some man's blood!\n\nWhile we were thus learning the history of each other's wretchedness,\nEliza was seated in a corner by herself, singing hymns and praying\nfor her children. Wearied from the loss of so much sleep, I could\nno longer bear up against the advances of that \"sweet restorer,\"\nand laying down by the side of Robert, on the floor, soon forgot my\ntroubles, and slept until the dawn of day.\n\nIn the morning, having swept the yard, and washed ourselves, under\nGoodin's superintendence, we were ordered to roll up our blankets, and\nmake ready for the continuance of our journey. Clem Ray was informed\nthat he would go no further, Burch, for some cause, having concluded\nto carry him back to Washington. He was much rejoiced. Shaking hands,\nwe parted in the slave pen at Richmond, and I have not seen him\nsince. But, much to my surprise, since my return, I learned that he\nhad escaped from bondage, and on his way to the free soil of Canada,\nlodged one night at the house of my brother-in-law in Saratoga,\ninforming my family of the place and the condition in which he left me.\n\nIn the afternoon we were drawn up, two abreast, Robert and myself in\nadvance, and in this order, driven by Burch and Goodin from the yard,\nthrough the streets of Richmond to the brig Orleans. She was a vessel\nof respectable size, full rigged, and freighted principally with\ntobacco. We were all on board by five o'clock. Burch brought us each\na tin cup and a spoon. There were forty of us in the brig, being all,\nexcept Clem, that were in the pen.\n\nWith a small pocket knife that had not been taken from me, I began\ncutting the initials of my name upon the tin cup. The others\nimmediately flocked round me, requesting me to mark theirs in a\nsimilar manner. In time, I gratified them all, of which they did not\nappear to be forgetful.\n\nWe were all stowed away in the hold at night, and the hatch barred\ndown. We laid on boxes, or where-ever there was room enough to stretch\nour blankets on the floor.\n\nBurch accompanied us no farther than Richmond, returning from that\npoint to the capital with Clem. Not until the lapse of almost twelve\nyears, to wit, in January last, in the Washington police office, did I\nset my eyes upon his face again.\n\nJames H. Burch was a slave-trader--buying men, women and children\nat low prices, and selling them at an advance. He was a speculator\nin human flesh--a disreputable calling--and so considered at the\nSouth. For the present he disappears from the scenes recorded in\nthis narrative, but he will appear again before its close, not in\nthe character of a man-whipping tyrant, but as an arrested, cringing\ncriminal in a court of law, that failed to do him justice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n  ARRIVAL AT NORFOLK--FREDERICK AND MARIA--ARTHUR, THE\n  FREEMAN--APPOINTED STEWARD--JIM, CUFFEE, AND JENNY--THE STORM--BAHAMA\n  BANKS--THE CALM--THE CONSPIRACY--THE LONG BOAT--THE SMALL-POX--DEATH\n  OF ROBERT--MANNING, THE SAILOR--THE MEETING IN THE FORECASTLE--THE\n  LETTER--ARRIVAL AT NEW-ORLEANS--ARTHUR'S RESCUE--THEOPHILUS FREEMAN,\n  THE CONSIGNEE--PLATT--FIRST NIGHT IN THE NEW-ORLEANS SLAVE PEN.\n\n\nAfter we were all on board, the brig Orleans proceeded down James\nRiver. Passing into Chesapeake Bay, we arrived next day opposite the\ncity of Norfolk. While lying at anchor, a lighter approached us from\nthe town, bringing four more slaves. Frederick, a boy of eighteen,\nhad been born a slave, as also had Henry, who was some years older.\nThey had both been house servants in the city. Maria was a rather\ngenteel looking colored girl, with a faultless form, but ignorant\nand extremely vain. The idea of going to New-Orleans was pleasing\nto her. She entertained an extravagantly high opinion of her own\nattractions. Assuming a haughty mien, she declared to her companions,\nthat immediately on our arrival in New-Orleans, she had no doubt, some\nwealthy single gentleman of good taste would purchase her at once!\n\nBut the most prominent of the four, was a man named Arthur. As the\nlighter approached, he struggled stoutly with his keepers. It was\nwith main force that he was dragged aboard the brig. He protested, in\na loud voice, against the treatment he was receiving, and demanded\nto be released. His face was swollen, and covered with wounds and\nbruises, and, indeed, one side of it was a complete raw sore. He was\nforced, with all haste, down the hatchway into the hold. I caught\nan outline of his story as he was borne struggling along, of which\nhe afterwards gave me a more full relation, and it was as follows:\nHe had long resided in the city of Norfolk, and was a free man. He\nhad a family living there, and was a mason by trade. Having been\nunusually detained, he was returning late one night to his house in\nthe suburbs of the city, when he was attacked by a gang of persons\nin an unfrequented street. He fought until his strength failed him.\nOverpowered at last, he was gagged and bound with ropes, and beaten,\nuntil he became insensible. For several days they secreted him in the\nslave pen at Norfolk--a very common establishment, it appears, in\nthe cities of the South. The night before, he had been taken out and\nput on board the lighter, which, pushing out from shore, had awaited\nour arrival. For some time he continued his protestations, and was\naltogether irreconcilable. At length, however, he became silent. He\nsank into a gloomy and thoughtful mood, and appeared to be counseling\nwith himself. There was in the man's determined face, something that\nsuggested the thought of desperation.\n\nAfter leaving Norfolk the hand-cuffs were taken off, and during the\nday we were allowed to remain on deck. The captain selected Robert as\nhis waiter, and I was appointed to superintend the cooking department,\nand the distribution of food and water. I had three assistants, Jim,\nCuffee and Jenny. Jenny's business was to prepare the coffee, which\nconsisted of corn meal scorched in a kettle, boiled and sweetened with\nmolasses. Jim and Cuffee baked the hoe-cake and boiled the bacon.\n\nStanding by a table, formed of a wide board resting on the heads of\nthe barrels, I cut and handed to each a slice of meat and a \"dodger\"\nof the bread, and from Jenny's kettle also dipped out for each a\ncup of the coffee. The use of plates was dispensed with, and their\nsable fingers took the place of knives and forks. Jim and Cuffee were\nvery demure and attentive to business, somewhat inflated with their\nsituation as second cooks, and without doubt feeling that there was\na great responsibility resting on them. I was called steward--a name\ngiven me by the captain.\n\nThe slaves were fed twice a day, at ten and five o'clock--always\nreceiving the same kind and quantity of fare, and in the same manner\nas above described. At night we were driven into the hold, and\nsecurely fastened down.\n\nScarcely were we out of sight of land before we were overtaken by\na violent storm. The brig rolled and plunged until we feared she\nwould go down. Some were sea-sick, others on their knees praying,\nwhile some were fast holding to each other, paralyzed with fear. The\nsea-sickness rendered the place of our confinement loathsome and\ndisgusting. It would have been a happy thing for most of us--it would\nhave saved the agony of many hundred lashes, and miserable deaths at\nlast--had the compassionate sea snatched us that day from the clutches\nof remorseless men. The thought of Randall and little Emmy sinking\ndown among the monsters of the deep, is a more pleasant contemplation\nthan to think of them as they are now, perhaps, dragging out lives of\nunrequited toil.\n\nWhen in sight of the Bahama Banks, at a place called Old Point\nCompass, or the Hole in the Wall, we were becalmed three days. There\nwas scarcely a breath of air. The waters of the gulf presented a\nsingularly white appearance, like lime water.\n\nIn the order of events, I come now to the relation of an occurrence,\nwhich I never call to mind but with sensations of regret. I thank God,\nwho has since permitted me to escape from the thralldom of slavery,\nthat through his merciful interposition I was prevented from imbruing\nmy hands in the blood of his creatures. Let not those who have never\nbeen placed in like circumstances, judge me harshly. Until they have\nbeen chained and beaten--until they find themselves in the situation I\nwas, borne away from home and family towards a land of bondage--let\nthem refrain from saying what they would not do for liberty. How\nfar I should have been justified in the sight of God and man, it is\nunnecessary now to speculate upon. It is enough to say that I am able\nto congratulate myself upon the harmless termination of an affair\nwhich threatened, for a time, to be attended with serious results.\n\nTowards evening, on the first day of the calm, Arthur and myself were\nin the bow of the vessel, seated on the windlass. We were conversing\ntogether of the probable destiny that awaited us, and mourning\ntogether over our misfortunes. Arthur said, and I agreed with him,\nthat death was far less terrible than the living prospect that was\nbefore us. For a long time we talked of our children, our past lives,\nand of the probabilities of escape. Obtaining possession of the brig\nwas suggested by one of us. We discussed the possibility of our being\nable, in such an event, to make our way to the harbor of New-York. I\nknew little of the compass; but the idea of risking the experiment was\neagerly entertained. The chances, for and against us, in an encounter\nwith the crew, was canvassed. Who could be relied upon, and who could\nnot, the proper time and manner of the attack, were all talked over\nand over again. From the moment the plot suggested itself I began\nto hope. I revolved it constantly in my mind. As difficulty after\ndifficulty arose, some ready conceit was at hand, demonstrating how\nit could be overcome. While others slept, Arthur and I were maturing\nour plans. At length, with much caution, Robert was gradually made\nacquainted with our intentions. He approved of them at once, and\nentered into the conspiracy with a zealous spirit. There was not\nanother slave we dared to trust. Brought up in fear and ignorance as\nthey are, it can scarcely be conceived how servilely they will cringe\nbefore a white man's look. It was not safe to deposit so bold a secret\nwith any of them, and finally we three resolved to take upon ourselves\nalone the fearful responsibility of the attempt.\n\nAt night, as has been said, we were driven into the hold, and the\nhatch barred down. How to reach the deck was the first difficulty that\npresented itself. On the bow of the brig, however, I had observed the\nsmall boat lying bottom upwards. It occurred to me that by secreting\nourselves underneath it, we would not be missed from the crowd, as\nthey were hurried down into the hold at night. I was selected to make\nthe experiment, in order to satisfy ourselves of its feasibility. The\nnext evening, accordingly, after supper, watching my opportunity,\nI hastily concealed myself beneath it. Lying close upon the deck,\nI could see what was going on around me, while wholly unperceived\nmyself. In the morning, as they came up, I slipped from my hiding\nplace without being observed. The result was entirely satisfactory.\n\nThe captain and mate slept in the cabin of the former. From Robert,\nwho had frequent occasion, in his capacity of waiter, to make\nobservations in that quarter, we ascertained the exact position of\ntheir respective berths. He further informed us that there were always\ntwo pistols and a cutlass lying on the table. The crew's cook slept in\nthe cook galley on deck, a sort of vehicle on wheels, that could be\nmoved about as convenience required, while the sailors, numbering only\nsix, either slept in the forecastle, or in hammocks swung among the\nrigging.\n\nFinally our arrangements were all completed. Arthur and I were to\nsteal silently to the captain's cabin, seize the pistols and cutlass,\nand as quickly as possible despatch him and the mate. Robert,\nwith a club, was to stand by the door leading from the deck down\ninto the cabin, and, in case of necessity, beat back the sailors,\nuntil we could hurry to his assistance. We were to proceed then as\ncircumstances might require. Should the attack be so sudden and\nsuccessful as to prevent resistance, the hatch was to remain barred\ndown; otherwise the slaves were to be called up, and in the crowd, and\nhurry, and confusion of the time, we resolved to regain our liberty or\nlose our lives. I was then to assume the unaccustomed place of pilot,\nand, steering northward, we trusted that some lucky wind might bear us\nto the soil of freedom.\n\nThe mate's name was Biddee, the captain's I cannot now recall, though\nI rarely ever forget a name once heard. The captain was a small,\ngenteel man, erect and prompt, with a proud bearing, and looked the\npersonification of courage. If he is still living, and these pages\nshould chance to meet his eye, he will learn a fact connected with\nthe voyage of the brig, from Richmond to New-Orleans, in 1841, not\nentered on his log-book.\n\nWe were all prepared, and impatiently waiting an opportunity of\nputting our designs into execution, when they were frustrated by a\nsad and unforeseen event. Robert was taken ill. It was soon announced\nthat he had the small-pox. He continued to grow worse, and four days\nprevious to our arrival in New-Orleans he died. One of the sailors\nsewed him in his blanket, with a large stone from the ballast at his\nfeet, and then laying him on a hatchway, and elevating it with tackles\nabove the railing, the inanimate body of poor Robert was consigned to\nthe white waters of the gulf.\n\nWe were all panic-stricken by the appearance of the small-pox. The\ncaptain ordered lime to be scattered through the hold, and other\nprudent precautions to be taken. The death of Robert, however, and the\npresence of the malady, oppressed me sadly, and I gazed out over the\ngreat waste of waters with a spirit that was indeed disconsolate.\n\nAn evening or two after Robert's burial, I was leaning on the hatchway\nnear the forecastle, full of desponding thoughts, when a sailor in a\nkind voice asked me why I was so down-hearted. The tone and manner\nof the man assured me, and I answered, because I was a freeman, and\nhad been kidnapped. He remarked that it was enough to make any one\ndown-hearted, and continued to interrogate me until he learned the\nparticulars of my whole history. He was evidently much interested\nin my behalf, and, in the blunt speech of a sailor, swore he would\naid me all he could, if it \"split his timbers.\" I requested him to\nfurnish me pen, ink and paper, in order that I might write to some\nof my friends. He promised to obtain them--but how I could use them\nundiscovered was a difficulty. If I could only get into the forecastle\nwhile his watch was off, and the other sailors asleep, the thing could\nbe accomplished. The small boat instantly occurred to me. He thought\nwe were not far from the Balize, at the mouth of the Mississippi, and\nit was necessary that the letter be written soon, or the opportunity\nwould be lost. Accordingly, by arrangement, I managed the next night\nto secret myself again under the long-boat. His watch was off at\ntwelve. I saw him pass into the forecastle, and in about an hour\nfollowed him. He was nodding over a table, half asleep, on which a\nsickly light was flickering, and on which also was a pen and sheet\nof paper. As I entered he aroused, beckoned me to a seat beside him,\nand pointed to the paper. I directed the letter to Henry B. Northup,\nof Sandy Hill--stating that I had been kidnapped, was then on board\nthe brig Orleans, bound for New-Orleans; that it was then impossible\nfor me to conjecture my ultimate destination, and requesting he would\ntake measures to rescue me. The letter was sealed and directed, and\nManning, having read it, promised to deposit it in the New-Orleans\npost-office. I hastened back to my place under the long-boat, and in\nthe morning, as the slaves came up and were walking round, crept out\nunnoticed and mingled with them.\n\nMy good friend, whose name was John Manning, was an Englishman by\nbirth, and a noble-hearted, generous sailor as ever walked a deck. He\nhad lived in Boston--was a tall, well-built man, about twenty-four\nyears old, with a face somewhat pock-marked, but full of benevolent\nexpression.\n\nNothing to vary the monotony of our daily life occurred, until we\nreached New-Orleans. On coming to the levee, and before the vessel was\nmade fast, I saw Manning leap on shore and hurry away into the city.\nAs he started off he looked back over his shoulder significantly,\ngiving me to understand the object of his errand. Presently he\nreturned, and passing close by me, hunched me with his elbow, with a\npeculiar wink, as much as to say, \"it is all right.\"\n\nThe letter, as I have since learned, reached Sandy Hill. Mr. Northup\nvisited Albany and laid it before Governor Seward, but inasmuch as\nit gave no definite information as to my probable locality, it was\nnot, at that time, deemed advisable to institute measures for my\nliberation. It was concluded to delay, trusting that a knowledge of\nwhere I was might eventually be obtained.\n\nA happy and touching scene was witnessed immediately upon our\nreaching the levee. Just as Manning left the brig, on his way to the\npost-office, two men came up and called aloud for Arthur. The latter,\nas he recognized them, was almost crazy with delight. He could hardly\nbe restrained from leaping over the brig's side; and when they met\nsoon after, he grasped them by the hand, and clung to them a long,\nlong time. They were men from Norfolk, who had come on to New-Orleans\nto rescue him. His kidnappers, they informed him, had been arrested,\nand were then confined in the Norfolk prison. They conversed a few\nmoments with the captain, and then departed with the rejoicing Arthur.\n\nBut in all the crowd that thronged the wharf, there was no one who\nknew or cared for me. Not one. No familiar voice greeted my ears, nor\nwas there a single face that I had ever seen. Soon Arthur would rejoin\nhis family, and have the satisfaction of seeing his wrongs avenged:\nmy family, alas, should I ever see them more? There was a feeling\nof utter desolation in my heart, filling it with a despairing and\nregretful sense, that I had not gone down with Robert to the bottom of\nthe sea.\n\nVery soon traders and consignees came on board. One, a tall,\nthin-faced man, with light complexion and a little bent, made his\nappearance, with a paper in his hand. Burch's gang, consisting of\nmyself, Eliza and her children, Harry, Lethe, and some others, who had\njoined us at Richmond, were consigned to him. This gentleman was Mr.\nTheophilus Freeman. Reading from his paper, he called, \"Platt.\" No one\nanswered. The name was called again and again, but still there was no\nreply. Then Lethe was called, then Eliza, then Harry, until the list\nwas finished, each one stepping forward as his or her name was called.\n\n\"Captain, where's Platt?\" demanded Theophilus Freeman.\n\nThe captain was unable to inform him, no one being on board answering\nto that name.\n\n\"Who shipped _that_ nigger?\" he again inquired of the captain,\npointing to me.\n\n\"Burch,\" replied the captain.\n\n\"Your name is Platt--you answer my description. Why don't you come\nforward?\" he demanded of me, in an angry tone.\n\nI informed him that was not my name; that I had never been called by\nit, but that I had no objection to it as I knew of.\n\n\"Well, I will learn you your name,\" said he; \"and so you won't forget\nit either, by ----,\" he added.\n\nMr. Theophilus Freeman, by the way, was not a whit behind his partner,\nBurch, in the matter of blasphemy. On the vessel I had gone by the\nname of \"Steward,\" and this was the first time I had ever been\ndesignated as Platt--the name forwarded by Burch to his consignee.\nFrom the vessel I observed the chain-gang at work on the levee. We\npassed near them as we were driven to Freeman's slave pen. This pen is\nvery similar to Goodin's in Richmond, except the yard was enclosed by\nplank, standing upright, with ends sharpened, instead of brick walls.\n\nIncluding us, there were now at least fifty in this pen. Depositing\nour blankets in one of the small buildings in the yard, and having\nbeen called up and fed, we were allowed to saunter about the enclosure\nuntil night, when we wrapped our blankets round us and laid down\nunder the shed, or in the loft, or in the open yard, just as each one\npreferred.\n\nIt was but a short time I closed my eyes that night. Thought was\nbusy in my brain. Could it be possible that I was thousands of miles\nfrom home--that I had been driven through the streets like a dumb\nbeast--that I had been chained and beaten without mercy--that I was\neven then herded with a drove of slaves, a slave myself? Were the\nevents of the last few weeks realities indeed?--or was I passing only\nthrough the dismal phases of a long, protracted dream? It was no\nillusion. My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up\nmy hands to God, and in the still watches of the night, surrounded by\nthe sleeping forms of my companions, begged for mercy on the poor,\nforsaken captive. To the Almighty Father of us all--the freeman and\nthe slave--I poured forth the supplications of a broken spirit,\nimploring strength from on high to bear up against the burden of my\ntroubles, until the morning light aroused the slumberers, ushering in\nanother day of bondage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n  FREEMAN'S INDUSTRY--CLEANLINESS AND CLOTHES--EXERCISING IN THE SHOW\n  ROOM--THE DANCE--BOB, THE FIDDLER--ARRIVAL OF CUSTOMERS--SLAVES\n  EXAMINED--THE OLD GENTLEMAN OF NEW-ORLEANS--SALE OF DAVID,\n  CAROLINE AND LETHE--PARTING OF RANDALL AND ELIZA--SMALL POX--THE\n  HOSPITAL--RECOVERY AND RETURN TO FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN--THE PURCHASER\n  OF ELIZA, HARRY AND PLATT--ELIZA'S AGONY ON PARTING FROM LITTLE EMILY.\n\n\nThe very amiable, pious-hearted Mr. Theophilus Freeman, partner\nor consignee of James H. Burch, and keeper of the slave pen in\nNew-Orleans, was out among his animals early in the morning. With an\noccasional kick of the older men and women, and many a sharp crack of\nthe whip about the ears of the younger slaves, it was not long before\nthey were all astir, and wide awake. Mr. Theophilus Freeman bustled\nabout in a very industrious manner, getting his property ready for the\nsales-room, intending, no doubt, to do that day a rousing business.\n\nIn the first place we were required to wash thoroughly, and those with\nbeards, to shave. We were then furnished with a new suit each, cheap,\nbut clean. The men had hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes; the women\nfrocks of calico, and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads. We were\nnow conducted into a large room in the front part of the building\nto which the yard was attached, in order to be properly trained,\nbefore the admission of customers. The men were arranged on one side\nof the room, the women on the other. The tallest was placed at the\nhead of the row, then the next tallest, and so on in the order of\ntheir respective heights. Emily was at the foot of the line of women.\nFreeman charged us to remember our places; exhorted us to appear smart\nand lively,--sometimes threatening, and again, holding out various\ninducements. During the day he exercised us in the art of \"looking\nsmart,\" and of moving to our places with exact precision.\n\nAfter being fed, in the afternoon, we were again paraded and made to\ndance. Bob, a colored boy, who had some time belonged to Freeman,\nplayed on the violin. Standing near him, I made bold to inquire if he\ncould play the \"Virginia Reel.\" He answered he could not, and asked me\nif I could play. Replying in the affirmative, he handed me the violin.\nI struck up a tune, and finished it. Freeman ordered me to continue\nplaying, and seemed well pleased, telling Bob that I far excelled\nhim--a remark that seemed to grieve my musical companion very much.\n\nNext day many customers called to examine Freeman's \"new lot.\" The\nlatter gentleman was very loquacious, dwelling at much length upon our\nseveral good points and qualities. He would make us hold up our heads,\nwalk briskly back and forth, while customers would feel of our hands\nand arms and bodies, turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us\nopen our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey examines\na horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. Sometimes a man\nor woman was taken back to the small house in the yard, stripped, and\ninspected more minutely. Scars upon a slave's back were considered\nevidence of a rebellious or unruly spirit, and hurt his sale.\n\nOne old gentleman, who said he wanted a coachman, appeared to take\na fancy to me. From his conversation with Burch, I learned he was\na resident in the city. I very much desired that he would buy me,\nbecause I conceived it would not be difficult to make my escape from\nNew-Orleans on some northern vessel. Freeman asked him fifteen hundred\ndollars for me. The old gentleman insisted it was too much, as times\nwere very hard. Freeman, however, declared that I was sound and\nhealthy, of a good constitution, and intelligent. He made it a point\nto enlarge upon my musical attainments. The old gentleman argued quite\nadroitly that there was nothing extraordinary about the nigger, and\nfinally, to my regret, went out, saying he would call again. During\nthe day, however, a number of sales were made. David and Caroline\nwere purchased together by a Natchez planter. They left us, grinning\nbroadly, and in the most happy state of mind, caused by the fact of\ntheir not being separated. Lethe was sold to a planter of Baton Rouge,\nher eyes flashing with anger as she was led away.\n\nThe same man also purchased Randall. The little fellow was made\nto jump, and run across the floor, and perform many other feats,\nexhibiting his activity and condition. All the time the trade was\ngoing on, Eliza was crying aloud, and wringing her hands. She besought\nthe man not to buy him, unless he also bought herself and Emily.\nShe promised, in that case, to be the most faithful slave that ever\nlived. The man answered that he could not afford it, and then Eliza\nburst into a paroxysm of grief, weeping plaintively. Freeman turned\nround to her, savagely, with his whip in his uplifted hand, ordering\nher to stop her noise, or he would flog her. He would not have such\nwork--such snivelling; and unless she ceased that minute, he would\ntake her to the yard and give her a hundred lashes. Yes, he would\ntake the nonsense out of her pretty quick--if he didn't, might he be\nd--d. Eliza shrunk before him, and tried to wipe away her tears, but\nit was all in vain. She wanted to be with her children, she said, the\nlittle time she had to live. All the frowns and threats of Freeman,\ncould not wholly silence the afflicted mother. She kept on begging and\nbeseeching them, most piteously, not to separate the three. Over and\nover again she told them how she loved her boy. A great many times she\nrepeated her former promises--how very faithful and obedient she would\nbe; how hard she would labor day and night, to the last moment of her\nlife, if he would only buy them all together. But it was of no avail;\nthe man could not afford it. The bargain was agreed upon, and Randall\nmust go alone. Then Eliza ran to him; embraced him passionately;\nkissed him again and again; told him to remember her--all the while\nher tears falling in the boy's face like rain.\n\nFreeman damned her, calling her a blubbering, bawling wench, and\nordered her to go to her place, and behave herself, and be somebody.\nHe swore he wouldn't stand such stuff but a little longer. He would\nsoon give her something to cry about, if she was not mighty careful,\nand _that_ she might depend upon.\n\nThe planter from Baton Rouge, with his new purchases, was ready to\ndepart.\n\n\"Don't cry, mama. I will be a good boy. Don't cry,\" said Randall,\nlooking back, as they passed out of the door.\n\nWhat has become of the lad, God knows. It was a mournful scene indeed.\nI would have cried myself if I had dared.\n\nThat night, nearly all who came in on the brig Orleans, were taken\nill. They complained of violent pain in the head and back. Little\nEmily--a thing unusual with her--cried constantly. In the morning\na physician was called in, but was unable to determine the nature\nof our complaint. While examining me, and asking questions touching\nmy symptoms, I gave it as my opinion that it was an attack of\nsmall-pox--mentioning the fact of Robert's death as the reason of my\nbelief. It might be so indeed, he thought, and he would send for the\nhead physician of the hospital. Shortly, the head physician came--a\nsmall, light-haired man, whom they called Dr. Carr. He pronounced\nit small-pox, whereupon there was much alarm throughout the yard.\nSoon after Dr. Carr left, Eliza, Emmy, Harry and myself were put into\na hack and driven to the hospital--a large white marble building,\nstanding on the outskirts of the city. Harry and I were placed in a\nroom in one of the upper stories. I became very sick. For three days\nI was entirely blind. While lying in this state one day, Bob came in,\nsaying to Dr. Carr that Freeman had sent him over to inquire how we\nwere getting on. Tell him, said the doctor, that Platt is very bad,\nbut that if he survives until nine o'clock, he may recover.\n\nI expected to die. Though there was little in the prospect before\nme worth living for, the near approach of death appalled me. I\nthought I could have been resigned to yield up my life in the bosom\nof my family, but to expire in the midst of strangers, under such\ncircumstances, was a bitter reflection.\n\nThere were a great number in the hospital, of both sexes, and of all\nages. In the rear of the building coffins were manufactured. When one\ndied, the bell tolled--a signal to the undertaker to come and bear\naway the body to the potter's field. Many times, each day and night,\nthe tolling bell sent forth its melancholy voice, announcing another\ndeath. But my time had not yet come. The crisis having passed, I began\nto revive, and at the end of two weeks and two days, returned with\nHarry to the pen, bearing upon my face the effects of the malady,\nwhich to this day continues to disfigure it. Eliza and Emily were\nalso brought back next day in a hack, and again were we paraded in\nthe sales-room, for the inspection and examination of purchasers. I\nstill indulged the hope that the old gentleman in search of a coachman\nwould call again, as he had promised, and purchase me. In that event\nI felt an abiding confidence that I would soon regain my liberty.\nCustomer after customer entered, but the old gentleman never made his\nappearance.\n\nAt length, one day, while we were in the yard, Freeman came out and\nordered us to our places, in the great room. A gentleman was waiting\nfor us as we entered, and inasmuch as he will be often mentioned\nin the progress of this narrative, a description of his personal\nappearance, and my estimation of his character, at first sight, may\nnot be out of place.\n\nHe was a man above the ordinary height, somewhat bent and stooping\nforward. He was a good-looking man, and appeared to have reached about\nthe middle age of life. There was nothing repulsive in his presence;\nbut on the other hand, there was something cheerful and attractive in\nhis face, and in his tone of voice. The finer elements were all kindly\nmingled in his breast, as any one could see. He moved about among us,\nasking many questions, as to what we could do, and what labor we had\nbeen accustomed to; if we thought we would like to live with him, and\nwould be good boys if he would buy us, and other interrogatories of\nlike character.\n\nAfter some further inspection, and conversation touching prices, he\nfinally offered Freeman one thousand dollars for me, nine hundred\nfor Harry, and seven hundred for Eliza. Whether the small-pox had\ndepreciated our value, or from what cause Freeman had concluded\nto fall five hundred dollars from the price I was before held at,\nI cannot say. At any rate, after a little shrewd reflection, he\nannounced his acceptance of the offer.\n\nAs soon as Eliza heard it, she was in an agony again. By this time\nshe had become haggard and hollow-eyed with sickness and with sorrow.\nIt would be a relief if I could consistently pass over in silence\nthe scene that now ensued. It recalls memories more mournful and\naffecting than any language can portray. I have seen mothers kissing\nfor the last time the faces of their dead offspring; I have seen them\nlooking down into the grave, as the earth fell with a dull sound upon\ntheir coffins, hiding them from their eyes forever; but never have I\nseen such an exhibition of intense, unmeasured, and unbounded grief,\nas when Eliza was parted from her child. She broke from her place\nin the line of women, and rushing down where Emily was standing,\ncaught her in her arms. The child, sensible of some impending danger,\ninstinctively fastened her hands around her mother's neck, and nestled\nher little head upon her bosom. Freeman sternly ordered her to be\nquiet, but she did not heed him. He caught her by the arm and pulled\nher rudely, but she only clung the closer to the child. Then, with\na volley of great oaths, he struck her such a heartless blow, that\nshe staggered backward, and was like to fall. Oh! how piteously then\ndid she beseech and beg and pray that they might not be separated.\nWhy could they not be purchased together? Why not let her have one\nof her dear children? \"Mercy, mercy, master!\" she cried, falling on\nher knees. \"Please, master, buy Emily. I can never work any if she is\ntaken from me: I will die.\"\n\nFreeman interfered again, but, disregarding him, she still plead most\nearnestly, telling how Randall had been taken from her--how she never\nwould see him again, and now it was too bad--oh, God! it was too bad,\ntoo cruel, to take her away from Emily--her pride--her only darling,\nthat could not live, it was so young, without its mother!\n\nFinally, after much more of supplication, the purchaser of Eliza\nstepped forward, evidently affected, and said to Freeman he would buy\nEmily, and asked him what her price was.\n\n\"What is her _price_? _Buy_ her?\" was the responsive interrogatory of\nTheophilus Freeman. And instantly answering his own inquiry, he added,\n\"I won't sell her. She's not for sale.\"\n\nThe man remarked he was not in need of one so young--that it would be\nof no profit to him, but since the mother was so fond of her, rather\nthan see them separated, he would pay a reasonable price. But to this\nhumane proposal Freeman was entirely deaf. He would not sell her then\non any account whatever. There were heaps and piles of money to be\nmade of her, he said, when she was a few years older. There were men\nenough in New-Orleans who would give five thousand dollars for such\nan extra, handsome, fancy piece as Emily would be, rather than not\nget her. No, no, he would not sell her then. She was a beauty--a\npicture--a doll--one of the regular bloods--none of your thick-lipped,\nbullet-headed, cotton-picking niggers--if she was might he be d--d.\n\nWhen Eliza heard Freeman's determination not to part with Emily, she\nbecame absolutely frantic.\n\n\"I will _not_ go without her. They shall _not_ take her from me,\" she\nfairly shrieked, her shrieks commingling with the loud and angry voice\nof Freeman, commanding her to be silent.\n\nMeantime Harry and myself had been to the yard and returned with our\nblankets, and were at the front door ready to leave. Our purchaser\nstood near us, gazing at Eliza with an expression indicative of regret\nat having bought her at the expense of so much sorrow. We waited some\ntime, when, finally, Freeman, out of patience, tore Emily from her\nmother by main force, the two clinging to each other with all their\nmight.\n\n\"Don't leave me, mama--don't leave me,\" screamed the child, as its\nmother was pushed harshly forward; \"Don't leave me--come back, mama,\"\nshe still cried, stretching forth her little arms imploringly. But\nshe cried in vain. Out of the door and into the street we were\nquickly hurried. Still we could hear her calling to her mother,\n\"Come back--don't leave me--come back, mama,\" until her infant voice\ngrew faint and still more faint, and gradually died away, as distance\nintervened, and finally was wholly lost.\n\nEliza never after saw or heard of Emily or Randall. Day nor night,\nhowever, were they ever absent from her memory. In the cotton field,\nin the cabin, always and everywhere, she was talking of them--often\n_to_ them, as if they were actually present. Only when absorbed\nin that illusion, or asleep, did she ever have a moment's comfort\nafterwards.\n\nShe was no common slave, as has been said. To a large share of natural\nintelligence which she possessed, was added a general knowledge and\ninformation on most subjects. She had enjoyed opportunities such as\nare afforded to very few of her oppressed class. She had been lifted\nup into the regions of a higher life. Freedom--freedom for herself\nand for her offspring, for many years had been her cloud by day, her\npillar of fire by night. In her pilgrimage through the wilderness of\nbondage, with eyes fixed upon that hope-inspiring beacon, she had\nat length ascended to \"the top of Pisgah,\" and beheld \"the land of\npromise.\" In an unexpected moment she was utterly overwhelmed with\ndisappointment and despair. The glorious vision of liberty faded from\nher sight as they led her away into captivity. Now \"she weepeth sore\nin the night, and tears are on her cheeks: all her friends have dealt\ntreacherously with her: they have become her enemies.\"\n\n[Illustration: SEPERATION OF ELIZA AND HER LAST CHILD.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n  THE STEAMBOAT RODOLPH--DEPARTURE FROM NEW-ORLEANS--WILLIAM\n  FORD--ARRIVAL AT ALEXANDRIA, ON RED RIVER--RESOLUTIONS--THE GREAT\n  PINE WOODS--WILD CATTLE--MARTIN'S SUMMER RESIDENCE--THE TEXAS\n  ROAD--ARRIVAL AT MASTER FORD'S--ROSE--MISTRESS FORD--SALLY, AND\n  HER CHILDREN--JOHN, THE COOK--WALTER, SAM, AND ANTONY--THE MILLS\n  ON INDIAN CREEK--SABBATH DAYS--SAM'S CONVERSION--THE PROFIT OF\n  KINDNESS--RAFTING--ADAM TAYDEM, THE LITTLE WHITE MAN--CASCALLA AND\n  HIS TRIBE--THE INDIAN BALL--JOHN M. TIBEATS--THE STORM APPROACHING.\n\n\nOn leaving the New-Orleans slave pen, Harry and I followed our new\nmaster through the streets, while Eliza, crying and turning back, was\nforced along by Freeman and his minions, until we found ourselves on\nboard the steamboat Rodolph, then lying at the levee. In the course\nof half an hour we were moving briskly up the Mississippi, bound for\nsome point on Red River. There were quite a number of slaves on board\nbeside ourselves, just purchased in the New-Orleans market. I remember\na Mr. Kelsow, who was said to be a well known and extensive planter,\nhad in charge a gang of women.\n\nOur master's name was William Ford. He resided then in the \"Great Pine\nWoods,\" in the parish of Avoyelles, situated on the right bank of\nRed River, in the heart of Louisiana. He is now a Baptist preacher.\nThroughout the whole parish of Avoyelles, and especially along both\nshores of Bayou Boeuf, where he is more intimately known, he is\naccounted by his fellow-citizens as a worthy minister of God. In many\nnorthern minds, perhaps, the idea of a man holding his brother man\nin servitude, and the traffic in human flesh, may seem altogether\nincompatible with their conceptions of a moral or religious life. From\ndescriptions of such men as Burch and Freeman, and others hereinafter\nmentioned, they are led to despise and execrate the whole class of\nslaveholders, indiscriminately. But I was sometime his slave, and\nhad an opportunity of learning well his character and disposition,\nand it is but simple justice to him when I say, in my opinion, there\nnever was a more kind, noble, candid, Christian man than William\nFord. The influences and associations that had always surrounded him,\nblinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of\nSlavery. He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another\nin subjection. Looking through the same medium with his fathers\nbefore him, he saw things in the same light. Brought up under other\ncircumstances and other influences, his notions would undoubtedly\nhave been different. Nevertheless, he was a model master, walking\nuprightly, according to the light of his understanding, and fortunate\nwas the slave who came to his possession. Were all men such as he,\nSlavery would be deprived of more than half its bitterness.\n\nWe were two days and three nights on board the steamboat Rodolph,\nduring which time nothing of particular interest occurred. I was\nnow known as Platt, the name given me by Burch, and by which I was\ndesignated through the whole period of my servitude. Eliza was sold by\nthe name of \"Dradey.\" She was so distinguished in the conveyance to\nFord, now on record in the recorder's office in New-Orleans.\n\nOn our passage I was constantly reflecting on my situation, and\nconsulting with myself on the best course to pursue in order to\neffect my ultimate escape. Sometimes, not only then, but afterwards,\nI was almost on the point of disclosing fully to Ford the facts of my\nhistory. I am inclined now to the opinion it would have resulted in\nmy benefit. This course was often considered, but through fear of its\nmiscarriage, never put into execution, until eventually my transfer\nand his pecuniary embarrassments rendered it evidently unsafe.\nAfterwards, under other masters, unlike William Ford, I knew well\nenough the slightest knowledge of my real character would consign me\nat once to the remoter depths of Slavery. I was too costly a chattel\nto be lost, and was well aware that I would be taken farther on,\ninto some by-place, over the Texan border, perhaps, and sold; that I\nwould be disposed of as the thief disposes of his stolen horse, if\nmy right to freedom was even whispered. So I resolved to lock the\nsecret closely in my heart--never to utter one word or syllable as to\nwho or what I was--trusting in Providence and my own shrewdness for\ndeliverance.\n\nAt length we left the steamboat Rodolph at a place called Alexandria,\nseveral hundred miles from New-Orleans. It is a small town on the\nsouthern shore of Red River. Having remained there over night, we\nentered the morning train of cars, and were soon at Bayou Lamourie, a\nstill smaller place, distant eighteen miles from Alexandria. At that\ntime it was the termination of the railroad. Ford's plantation was\nsituated on the Texas road, twelve miles from Lamourie, in the Great\nPine Woods. This distance, it was announced to us, must be traveled on\nfoot, there being public conveyances no farther. Accordingly we all\nset out in the company of Ford. It was an excessively hot day. Harry,\nEliza, and myself were yet weak, and the bottoms of our feet were\nvery tender from the effects of the small-pox. We proceeded slowly,\nFord telling us to take our time and sit down and rest whenever we\ndesired--a privilege that was taken advantage of quite frequently.\nAfter leaving Lamourie and crossing two plantations, one belonging to\nMr. Carnell, the other to a Mr. Flint, we reached the Pine Woods, a\nwilderness that stretches to the Sabine River.\n\nThe whole country about Red River is low and marshy. The Pine Woods,\nas they are called, is comparatively upland, with frequent small\nintervals, however, running through them. This upland is covered with\nnumerous trees--the white oak, the chincopin, resembling chestnut,\nbut principally the yellow pine. They are of great size, running up\nsixty feet, and perfectly straight. The woods were full of cattle,\nvery shy and wild, dashing away in herds, with a loud snuff, at our\napproach. Some of them were marked or branded, the rest appeared\nto be in their wild and untamed state. They are much smaller than\nnorthern breeds, and the peculiarity about them that most attracted my\nattention was their horns. They stand out from the sides of the head\nprecisely straight, like two iron spikes.\n\nAt noon we reached a cleared piece of ground containing three or four\nacres. Upon it was a small, unpainted, wooden house, a corn crib, or,\nas we would say, a barn, and a log kitchen, standing about a rod from\nthe house. It was the summer residence of Mr. Martin. Rich planters,\nhaving large establishments on Bayou Boeuf, are accustomed to spend\nthe warmer season in these woods. Here they find clear water and\ndelightful shades. In fact, these retreats are to the planters of that\nsection of the country what Newport and Saratoga are to the wealthier\ninhabitants of northern cities.\n\nWe were sent around into the kitchen, and supplied with sweet\npotatoes, corn-bread, and bacon, while Master Ford dined with Martin\nin the house. There were several slaves about the premises. Martin\ncame out and took a look at us, asking Ford the price of each, if we\nwere green hands, and so forth, and making inquiries in relation to\nthe slave market generally.\n\nAfter a long rest we set forth again, following the Texas road, which\nhad the appearance of being very rarely traveled. For five miles we\npassed through continuous woods without observing a single habitation.\nAt length, just as the sun was sinking in the west, we entered another\nopening, containing some twelve or fifteen acres.\n\nIn this opening stood a house much larger than Mr. Martin's. It was\ntwo stories high, with a piazza in front. In the rear of it was also a\nlog kitchen, poultry house, corncribs, and several negro cabins. Near\nthe house was a peach orchard, and gardens of orange and pomegranate\ntrees. The space was entirely surrounded by woods, and covered with\na carpet of rich, rank verdure. It was a quiet, lonely, pleasant\nplace--literally a green spot in the wilderness. It was the residence\nof my master, William Ford.\n\nAs we approached, a yellow girl--her name was Rose--was standing on\nthe piazza. Going to the door, she called her mistress, who presently\ncame running out to meet her lord. She kissed him, and laughingly\ndemanded if he had bought \"those niggers.\" Ford said he had, and told\nus to go round to Sally's cabin and rest ourselves. Turning the corner\nof the house, we discovered Sally washing--her two baby children near\nher, rolling on the grass. They jumped up and toddled towards us,\nlooked at us a moment like a brace of rabbits, then ran back to their\nmother as if afraid of us.\n\nSally conducted us into the cabin, told us to lay down our bundles\nand be seated, for she was sure that we were tired. Just then John,\nthe cook, a boy some sixteen years of age, and blacker than any crow,\ncame running in, looked steadily in our faces, then turning round,\nwithout saying as much as \"how d'ye do,\" ran back to the kitchen,\nlaughing loudly, as if our coming was a great joke indeed.\n\nMuch wearied with our walk, as soon as it was dark, Harry and I\nwrapped our blankets round us, and laid down upon the cabin floor.\nMy thoughts, as usual, wandered back to my wife and children. The\nconsciousness of my real situation; the hopelessness of any effort to\nescape through the wide forests of Avoyelles, pressed heavily upon me,\nyet my heart was at home in Saratoga.\n\nI was awakened early in the morning by the voice of Master Ford,\ncalling Rose. She hastened into the house to dress the children, Sally\nto the field to milk the cows, while John was busy in the kitchen\npreparing breakfast. In the meantime Harry and I were strolling about\nthe yard, looking at our new quarters. Just after breakfast a colored\nman, driving three yoke of oxen, attached to a wagon load of lumber,\ndrove into the opening. He was a slave of Ford's, named Walton, the\nhusband of Rose. By the way, Rose was a native of Washington, and had\nbeen brought from thence five years before. She had never seen Eliza,\nbut she had heard of Berry, and they knew the same streets, and the\nsame people, either personally, or by reputation. They became fast\nfriends immediately, and talked a great deal together of old times,\nand of friends they had left behind.\n\nFord was at that time a wealthy man. Besides his seat in the Pine\nWoods, he owned a large lumbering establishment on Indian Creek, four\nmiles distant, and also, in his wife's right, an extensive plantation\nand many slaves on Bayou Boeuf.\n\nWalton had come with his load of lumber from the mills on Indian\nCreek. Ford directed us to return with him, saying he would follow\nus as soon as possible. Before leaving, Mistress Ford called me into\nthe store-room, and handed me, as it is there termed, a tin bucket of\nmolasses for Harry and myself.\n\nEliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the loss of her\nchildren. Ford tried as much as possible to console her--told her she\nneed not work very hard; that she might remain with Rose, and assist\nthe madam in the house affairs.\n\nRiding with Walton in the wagon, Harry and I became quite well\nacquainted with him long before reaching Indian Creek. He was a \"born\nthrall\" of Ford's, and spoke kindly and affectionately of him, as\na child would speak of his own father. In answer to his inquiries\nfrom whence I came, I told him from Washington. Of that city, he had\nheard much from his wife, Rose, and all the way plied me with many\nextravagant and absurd questions.\n\nOn reaching the mills at Indian Creek, we found two more of Ford's\nslaves, Sam and Antony. Sam, also, was a Washingtonian, having been\nbrought out in the same gang with Rose. He had worked on a farm near\nGeorgetown. Antony was a blacksmith, from Kentucky, who had been in\nhis present master's service about ten years. Sam knew Burch, and when\ninformed that he was the trader who had sent me on from Washington, it\nwas remarkable how well we agreed upon the subject of his superlative\nrascality. He had forwarded Sam, also.\n\nOn Ford's arrival at the mill, we were employed in piling lumber, and\nchopping logs, which occupation we continued during the remainder of\nthe summer.\n\nWe usually spent our Sabbaths at the opening, on which days our master\nwould gather all his slaves about him, and read and expound the\nScriptures. He sought to inculcate in our minds feelings of kindness\ntowards each other, of dependence upon God--setting forth the rewards\npromised unto those who lead an upright and prayerful life. Seated\nin the doorway of his house, surrounded by his man-servants and his\nmaid-servants, who looked earnestly into the good man's face, he spoke\nof the loving kindness of the Creator, and of the life that is to\ncome. Often did the voice of prayer ascend from his lips to heaven,\nthe only sound that broke the solitude of the place.\n\nIn the course of the summer Sam became deeply convicted, his mind\ndwelling intensely on the subject of religion. His mistress gave him\na Bible, which he carried with him to his work. Whatever leisure time\nwas allowed him, he spent in perusing it, though it was only with\ngreat difficulty that he could master any part of it. I often read to\nhim, a favor which he well repaid me by many expressions of gratitude.\nSam's piety was frequently observed by white men who came to the mill,\nand the remark it most generally provoked was, that a man like Ford,\nwho allowed his slaves to have Bibles, was \"not fit to own a nigger.\"\n\nHe, however, lost nothing by his kindness. It is a fact I have\nmore than once observed, that those who treated their slaves most\nleniently, were rewarded by the greatest amount of labor. I know\nit from my own experience. It was a source of pleasure to surprise\nMaster Ford with a greater day's work than was required, while, under\nsubsequent masters, there was no prompter to extra effort but the\noverseer's lash.\n\nIt was the desire of Ford's approving voice that suggested to me an\nidea that resulted to his profit. The lumber we were manufacturing\nwas contracted to be delivered at Lamourie. It had hitherto been\ntransported by land, and was an important item of expense. Indian\nCreek, upon which the mills were situated, was a narrow but deep\nstream emptying into Bayou Boeuf. In some places it was not more than\ntwelve feet wide, and much obstructed with trunks of trees. Bayou\nBoeuf was connected with Bayou Lamourie. I ascertained the distance\nfrom the mills to the point on the latter bayou, where our lumber\nwas to be delivered, was but a few miles less by land than by water.\nProvided the creek could be made navigable for rafts, it occurred to\nme that the expense of transportation would be materially diminished.\n\nAdam Taydem, a little white man, who had been a soldier in Florida,\nand had strolled into that distant region, was foreman and\nsuperintendent of the mills. He scouted the idea; but Ford, when I\nlaid it before him, received it favorably, and permitted me to try the\nexperiment.\n\nHaving removed the obstructions, I made up a narrow raft, consisting\nof twelve cribs. At this business I think I was quite skillful, not\nhaving forgotten my experience years before on the Champlain canal. I\nlabored hard, being extremely anxious to succeed, both from a desire\nto please my master, and to show Adam Taydem that my scheme was not\nsuch a visionary one as he incessantly pronounced it. One hand could\nmanage three cribs. I took charge of the forward three, and commenced\npoling down the creek. In due time we entered the first bayou, and\nfinally reached our destination in a shorter period of time than I had\nanticipated.\n\nThe arrival of the raft at Lamourie created a sensation, while Mr.\nFord loaded me with commendations. On all sides I heard Ford's Platt\npronounced the \"smartest nigger in the Pine Woods\"--in fact I was the\nFulton of Indian Creek. I was not insensible to the praise bestowed\nupon me, and enjoyed, especially, my triumph over Taydem, whose\nhalf-malicious ridicule had stung my pride. From this time the entire\ncontrol of bringing the lumber to Lamourie was placed in my hands\nuntil the contract was fulfilled.\n\nIndian Creek, in its whole length, flows through a magnificent\nforest. There dwells on its shore a tribe of Indians, a remnant of\nthe Chickasaws or Chickopees, if I remember rightly. They live in\nsimple huts, ten or twelve feet square, constructed of pine poles\nand covered with bark. They subsist principally on the flesh of the\ndeer, the coon, and opossum, all of which are plenty in these woods.\nSometimes they exchange venison for a little corn and whisky with\nthe planters on the bayous. Their usual dress is buckskin breeches\nand calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to\nchin. They wear brass rings on their wrists, and in their ears and\nnoses. The dress of the squaws is very similar. They are fond of dogs\nand horses--owning many of the latter, of a small, tough breed--and\nare skillful riders. Their bridles, girths and saddles were made\nof raw skins of animals; their stirrups of a certain kind of wood.\nMounted astride their ponies, men and women, I have seen them dash\nout into the woods at the utmost of their speed, following narrow\nwinding paths, and dodging trees, in a manner that eclipsed the most\nmiraculous feats of civilized equestrianism. Circling away in various\ndirections, the forest echoing and re-echoing with their whoops, they\nwould presently return at the same dashing, headlong speed with which\nthey started. Their village was on Indian Creek, known as Indian\nCastle, but their range extended to the Sabine River. Occasionally\na tribe from Texas would come over on a visit, and then there was\nindeed a carnival in the \"Great Pine Woods.\" Chief of the tribe was\nCascalla; second in rank, John Baltese, his son-in-law; with both of\nwhom, as with many others of the tribe, I became acquainted during\nmy frequent voyages down the creek with rafts. Sam and myself would\noften visit them when the day's task was done. They were obedient to\nthe chief; the word of Cascalla was their law. They were a rude but\nharmless people, and enjoyed their wild mode of life. They had little\nfancy for the open country, the cleared lands on the shores of the\nbayous, but preferred to hide themselves within the shadows of the\nforest. They worshiped the Great Spirit, loved whisky, and were happy.\n\nOn one occasion I was present at a dance, when a roving herd from\nTexas had encamped in their village. The entire carcass of a deer was\nroasting before a large fire, which threw its light a long distance\namong the trees under which they were assembled. When they had formed\nin a ring, men and squaws alternately, a sort of Indian fiddle set up\nan indescribable tune. It was a continuous, melancholy kind of wavy\nsound, with the slightest possible variation. At the first note, if\nindeed there was more than one note in the whole tune, they circled\naround, trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural,\nsing-song noise, equally as nondescript as the music of the fiddle.\nAt the end of the third circuit, they would stop suddenly, whoop as\nif their lungs would crack, then break from the ring, forming in\ncouples, man and squaw, each jumping backwards as far as possible from\nthe other, then forwards--which graceful feat having been twice or\nthrice accomplished, they would form in a ring, and go trotting round\nagain. The best dancer appeared to be considered the one who could\nwhoop the loudest, jump the farthest, and utter the most excruciating\nnoise. At intervals, one or more would leave the dancing circle, and\ngoing to the fire, cut from the roasting carcass a slice of venison.\n\nIn a hole, shaped like a mortar, cut in the trunk of a fallen tree,\nthey pounded corn with a wooden pestle, and of the meal made cake.\nAlternately they danced and ate. Thus were the visitors from Texas\nentertained by the dusky sons and daughters of the Chicopees, and such\nis a description, as I saw it, of an Indian ball in the Pine Woods of\nAvoyelles.\n\nIn the autumn, I left the mills, and was employed at the opening.\nOne day the mistress was urging Ford to procure a loom, in order\nthat Sally might commence weaving cloth for the winter garments of\nthe slaves. He could not imagine where one was to be found, when\nI suggested that the easiest way to get one would be to make it,\ninforming him at the same time, that I was a sort of \"Jack at all\ntrades,\" and would attempt it, with his permission. It was granted\nvery readily, and I was allowed to go to a neighboring planter's\nto inspect one before commencing the undertaking. At length it was\nfinished and pronounced by Sally to be perfect. She could easily\nweave her task of fourteen yards, milk the cows, and have leisure time\nbesides each day. It worked so well, I was continued in the employment\nof making looms, which were taken down to the plantation on the bayou.\n\nAt this time one John M. Tibeats, a carpenter, came to the opening to\ndo some work on master's house. I was directed to quit the looms and\nassist him. For two weeks I was in his company, planning and matching\nboards for ceiling, a plastered room being a rare thing in the parish\nof Avoyelles.\n\nJohn M. Tibeats was the opposite of Ford in all respects. He was\na small, crabbed, quick-tempered, spiteful man. He had no fixed\nresidence that I ever heard of, but passed from one plantation to\nanother, wherever he could find employment. He was without standing\nin the community, not esteemed by white men, nor even respected by\nslaves. He was ignorant, withal, and of a revengeful disposition. He\nleft the parish long before I did, and I know not whether he is at\npresent alive or dead. Certain it is, it was a most unlucky day for\nme that brought us together. During my residence with Master Ford\nI had seen only the bright side of slavery. His was no heavy hand\ncrushing us to the earth. _He_ pointed upwards, and with benign and\ncheering words addressed us as his fellow-mortals, accountable, like\nhimself, to the Maker of us all. I think of him with affection, and\nhad my family been with me, could have borne his gentle servitude,\nwithout murmuring, all my days. But clouds were gathering in the\nhorizon--forerunners of a pitiless storm that was soon to break over\nme. I was doomed to endure such bitter trials as the poor slave only\nknows, and to lead no more the comparatively happy life which I had\nled in the \"Great Pine Woods.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n  FORD'S EMBARRASSMENTS--THE SALE TO TIBEATS--THE CHATTEL\n  MORTGAGE--MISTRESS FORD'S PLANTATION ON BAYOU BOEUF--DESCRIPTION\n  OF THE LATTER--FORD'S BROTHER-IN-LAW, PETER TANNER--MEETING\n  WITH ELIZA--SHE STILL MOURNS FOR HER CHILDREN--FORD'S OVERSEER,\n  CHAPIN--TIBEAT'S ABUSE--THE KEG OF NAILS--THE FIRST FIGHT WITH\n  TIBEATS--HIS DISCOMFITURE AND CASTIGATION--THE ATTEMPT TO HANG\n  ME--CHAPIN'S INTERFERENCE AND SPEECH--UNHAPPY REFLECTIONS--ABRUPT\n  DEPARTURE OF TIBEATS, COOK AND RAMSAY--LAWSON AND THE BROWN\n  MULE--MESSAGE TO THE PINE WOODS.\n\n\nWilliam Ford unfortunately became embarrassed in his pecuniary\naffairs. A heavy judgment was rendered against him in consequence of\nhis having become security for his brother, Franklin Ford, residing\non Red River, above Alexandria, and who had failed to meet his\nliabilities. He was also indebted to John M. Tibeats to a considerable\namount in consideration of his services in building the mills on\nIndian Creek, and also a weaving-house, corn-mill and other erections\non the plantation at Bayou Boeuf, not yet completed. It was therefore\nnecessary, in order to meet these demands, to dispose of eighteen\nslaves, myself among the number. Seventeen of them, including Sam and\nHarry, were purchased by Peter Compton, a planter also residing on Red\nRiver.\n\nI was sold to Tibeats, in consequence, undoubtedly, of my slight skill\nas a carpenter. This was in the winter of 1842. The deed of myself\nfrom Freeman to Ford, as I ascertained from the public records in\nNew-Orleans on my return, was dated June 23d, 1841. At the time of my\nsale to Tibeats, the price agreed to be given for me being more than\nthe debt, Ford took a chattel mortgage of four hundred dollars. I am\nindebted for my life, as will hereafter be seen, to that mortgage.\n\nI bade farewell to my good friends at the opening, and departed with\nmy new master Tibeats. We went down to the plantation on Bayou Boeuf,\ndistant twenty-seven miles from the Pine Woods, to complete the\nunfinished contract. Bayou Boeuf is a sluggish, winding stream--one\nof those stagnant bodies of water common in that region, setting back\nfrom Red River. It stretches from a point not far from Alexandria, in\na south-easterly direction, and following its tortuous course, is more\nthan fifty miles in length. Large cotton and sugar plantations line\neach shore, extending back to the borders of interminable swamps. It\nis alive with alligators, rendering it unsafe for swine, or unthinking\nslave children to stroll along its banks. Upon a bend in this bayou, a\nshort distance from Cheneyville, was situated the plantation of Madam\nFord--her brother, Peter Tanner, a great landholder, living on the\nopposite side.\n\nOn my arrival at Bayou Boeuf, I had the pleasure of meeting Eliza,\nwhom I had not seen for several months. She had not pleased Mrs.\nFord, being more occupied in brooding over her sorrows than in\nattending to her business, and had, in consequence, been sent down\nto work in the field on the plantation. She had grown feeble and\nemaciated, and was still mourning for her children. She asked me if\nI had forgotten them, and a great many times inquired if I still\nremembered how handsome little Emily was--how much Randall loved\nher--and wondered if they were living still, and where the darlings\ncould then be. She had sunk beneath the weight of an excessive grief.\nHer drooping form and hollow cheeks too plainly indicated that she had\nwell nigh reached the end of her weary road.\n\nFord's overseer on this plantation, and who had the exclusive\ncharge of it, was a Mr. Chapin, a kindly-disposed man, and a native\nof Pennsylvania. In common with others, he held Tibeats in light\nestimation, which fact, in connection with the four hundred dollar\nmortgage, was fortunate for me.\n\nI was now compelled to labor very hard. From earliest dawn until late\nat night, I was not allowed to be a moment idle. Notwithstanding\nwhich, Tibeats was never satisfied. He was continually cursing and\ncomplaining. He never spoke to me a kind word. I was his faithful\nslave, and earned him large wages every day, and yet I went to my\ncabin nightly, loaded with abuse and stinging epithets.\n\nWe had completed the corn mill, the kitchen, and so forth, and were\nat work upon the weaving-house, when I was guilty of an act, in that\nState punishable with death. It was my first fight with Tibeats. The\nweaving-house we were erecting stood in the orchard a few rods from\nthe residence of Chapin, or the \"great house,\" as it was called. One\nnight, having worked until it was too dark to see, I was ordered by\nTibeats to rise very early in the morning, procure a keg of nails\nfrom Chapin, and commence putting on the clapboards. I retired to the\ncabin extremely tired, and having cooked a supper of bacon and corn\ncake, and conversed a while with Eliza, who occupied the same cabin,\nas also did Lawson and his wife Mary, and a slave named Bristol, laid\ndown upon the ground floor, little dreaming of the sufferings that\nawaited me on the morrow. Before daylight I was on the piazza of the\n\"great house,\" awaiting the appearance of overseer Chapin. To have\naroused him from his slumbers and stated my errand, would have been\nan unpardonable boldness. At length he came out. Taking off my hat,\nI informed him Master Tibeats had directed me to call upon him for\na keg of nails. Going into the store-room, he rolled it out, at the\nsame time saying, if Tibeats preferred a different size, he would\nendeavor to furnish them, but that I might use those until further\ndirected. Then mounting his horse, which stood saddled and bridled\nat the door, he rode away into the field, whither the slaves had\npreceded him, while I took the keg on my shoulder, and proceeding to\nthe weaving-house, broke in the head, and commenced nailing on the\nclapboards.\n\nAs the day began to open, Tibeats came out of the house to where I\nwas, hard at work. He seemed to be that morning even more morose and\ndisagreeable than usual. He was my master, entitled by law to my flesh\nand blood, and to exercise over me such tyrannical control as his mean\nnature prompted; but there was no law that could prevent my looking\nupon him with intense contempt. I despised both his disposition and\nhis intellect. I had just come round to the keg for a further supply\nof nails, as he reached the weaving-house.\n\n\"I thought I told you to commence putting on weather-boards this\nmorning,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yes, master, and I am about it,\" I replied.\n\n\"Where?\" he demanded.\n\n\"On the other side,\" was my answer.\n\nHe walked round to the other side, examined my work for a while,\nmuttering to himself in a fault-finding tone.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin?\" he\nbroke forth again.\n\n\"Yes, master, and so I did; and overseer said he would get another\nsize for you, if you wanted them, when he came back from the field.\"\n\nTibeats walked to the keg, looked a moment at the contents, then\nkicked it violently. Coming towards me in a great passion, he\nexclaimed,\n\n\"G--d d--n you! I thought you _knowed_ something.\"\n\nI made answer: \"I tried to do as you told me, master. I didn't mean\nanything wrong. Overseer said--\" But he interrupted me with such a\nflood of curses that I was unable to finish the sentence. At length he\nran towards the house, and going to the piazza, took down one of the\noverseer's whips. The whip had a short wooden stock, braided over with\nleather, and was loaded at the butt. The lash was three feet long, or\nthereabouts, and made of raw-hide strands.\n\nAt first I was somewhat frightened, and my impulse was to run. There\nwas no one about except Rachel, the cook, and Chapin's wife, and\nneither of them were to be seen. The rest were in the field. I knew he\nintended to whip me, and it was the first time any one had attempted\nit since my arrival at Avoyelles. I felt, moreover, that I had been\nfaithful--that I was guilty of no wrong whatever, and deserved\ncommendation rather than punishment. My fear changed to anger, and\nbefore he reached me I had made up my mind fully not to be whipped,\nlet the result be life or death.\n\nWinding the lash around his hand, and taking hold of the small end of\nthe stock, he walked up to me, and with a malignant look, ordered me\nto strip.\n\n\"Master Tibeats\" said I, looking him boldly in the face, \"I will\n_not_.\" I was about to say something further in justification, but\nwith concentrated vengeance, he sprang upon me, seizing me by the\nthroat with one hand, raising the whip with the other, in the act of\nstriking. Before the blow descended, however, I had caught him by\nthe collar of the coat, and drawn him closely to me. Reaching down,\nI seized him by the ankle, and pushing him back with the other hand,\nhe fell over on the ground. Putting one arm around his leg, and\nholding it to my breast, so that his head and shoulders only touched\nthe ground, I placed my foot upon his neck. He was completely in my\npower. My blood was up. It seemed to course through my veins like\nfire. In the frenzy of my madness I snatched the whip from his hand.\nHe struggled with all his power; swore that I should not live to see\nanother day; and that he would tear out my heart. But his struggles\nand his threats were alike in vain. I cannot tell how many times I\nstruck him. Blow after blow fell fast and heavy upon his wriggling\nform. At length he screamed--cried murder--and at last the blasphemous\ntyrant called on God for mercy. But he who had never shown mercy did\nnot receive it. The stiff stock of the whip warped round his cringing\nbody until my right arm ached.\n\nUntil this time I had been too busy to look about me. Desisting for a\nmoment, I saw Mrs. Chapin looking from the window, and Rachel standing\nin the kitchen door. Their attitudes expressed the utmost excitement\nand alarm. His screams had been heard in the field. Chapin was coming\nas fast as he could ride. I struck him a blow or two more, then pushed\nhim from me with such a well-directed kick that he went rolling over\non the ground.\n\nRising to his feet, and brushing the dirt from his hair, he stood\nlooking at me, pale with rage. We gazed at each other in silence. Not\na word was uttered until Chapin galloped up to us.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried out.\n\n\"Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me,\" I\nreplied.\n\n\"What is the matter with the nails?\" he inquired, turning to Tibeats.\n\nTibeats answered to the effect that they were too large, paying little\nheed, however, to Chapin's question, but still keeping his snakish\neyes fastened maliciously on me.\n\n\"I am overseer here,\" Chapin began. \"I told Platt to take them and\nuse them, and if they were not of the proper size I would get others\non returning from the field. It is not his fault. Besides, I shall\nfurnish such nails as I please. I hope you will understand _that_, Mr.\nTibeats.\"\n\nTibeats made no reply, but, grinding his teeth and shaking his fist,\nswore he would have satisfaction, and that it was not half over yet.\nThereupon he walked away, followed by the overseer, and entered the\nhouse, the latter talking to him all the while in a suppressed tone,\nand with earnest gestures.\n\nI remained where I was, doubting whether it was better to fly or abide\nthe result, whatever it might be. Presently Tibeats came out of the\nhouse, and, saddling his horse, the only property he possessed besides\nmyself, departed on the road to Cheneyville.\n\nWhen he was gone, Chapin came out, visibly excited, telling me not to\nstir, not to attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever.\nHe then went to the kitchen, and calling Rachel out, conversed with\nher some time. Coming back, he again charged me with great earnestness\nnot to run, saying my master was a rascal; that he had left on no\ngood errand, and that there might be trouble before night. But at all\nevents, he insisted upon it, I must not stir.\n\nAs I stood there, feelings of unutterable agony overwhelmed me. I was\nconscious that I had subjected myself to unimaginable punishment. The\nreaction that followed my extreme ebullition of anger produced the\nmost painful sensations of regret. An unfriended, helpless slave--what\ncould I _do_, what could I _say_, to justify, in the remotest manner,\nthe heinous act I had committed, of resenting a _white_ man's\ncontumely and abuse. I tried to pray--I tried to beseech my Heavenly\nFather to sustain me in my sore extremity, but emotion choked my\nutterance, and I could only bow my head upon my hands and weep. For\nat least an hour I remained in this situation, finding relief only\nin tears, when, looking up, I beheld Tibeats, accompanied by two\nhorsemen, coming down the bayou. They rode into the yard, jumped from\ntheir horses, and approached me with large whips, one of them also\ncarrying a coil of rope.\n\n\"Cross your hands,\" commanded Tibeats, with the addition of such a\nshuddering expression of blasphemy as is not decorous to repeat.\n\n\"You need not bind me, Master Tibeats, I am ready to go with you\nanywhere,\" said I.\n\nOne of his companions then stepped forward, swearing if I made the\nleast resistance he would break my head--he would tear me limb from\nlimb--he would cut my black throat--and giving wide scope to other\nsimilar expressions. Perceiving any importunity altogether vain, I\ncrossed my hands, submitting humbly to whatever disposition they might\nplease to make of me. Thereupon Tibeats tied my wrists, drawing the\nrope around them with his utmost strength. Then he bound my ankles\nin the same manner. In the meantime the other two had slipped a cord\nwithin my elbows, running it across my back, and tying it firmly. It\nwas utterly impossible to move hand or foot. With a remaining piece of\nrope Tibeats made an awkward noose, and placed it about my neck.\n\n\"Now, then,\" inquired one of Tibeats' companions, \"where shall we hang\nthe nigger?\"\n\nOne proposed such a limb, extending from the body of a peach tree,\nnear the spot where we were standing. His comrade objected to it,\nalleging it would break, and proposed another. Finally they fixed upon\nthe latter.\n\nDuring this conversation, and all the time they were binding me, I\nuttered not a word. Overseer Chapin, during the progress of the scene,\nwas walking hastily back and forth on the piazza. Rachel was crying\nby the kitchen door, and Mrs. Chapin was still looking from the\nwindow. Hope died within my heart. Surely my time had come. I should\nnever behold the light of another day--never behold the faces of my\nchildren--the sweet anticipation I had cherished with such fondness. I\nshould that hour struggle through the fearful agonies of death! None\nwould mourn for me--none revenge me. Soon my form would be mouldering\nin that distant soil, or, perhaps, be cast to the slimy reptiles\nthat filled the stagnant waters of the bayou! Tears flowed down my\ncheeks, but they only afforded a subject of insulting comment for my\nexecutioners.\n\n[Illustration: CHAPIN RESCUES SOLOMON FROM HANGING.]\n\nAt length, as they were dragging me towards the tree, Chapin, who had\nmomentarily disappeared from the piazza, came out of the house and\nwalked towards us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I can\nnow recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined manner, as follows:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had better listen to them.\nWhoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead\nman. In the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It is\na shame to murder him in this manner. I never knew a more faithful\nboy than Platt. You, Tibeats, are in the fault yourself. You are\npretty much of a scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the\nflogging you have received. In the next place, I have been overseer\non this plantation seven years, and, in the absence of William Ford,\nam master here. My duty is to protect his interests, and that duty I\nshall perform. You are not responsible--you are a worthless fellow.\nFord holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang\nhim he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to\ntake his life. You have no right to take it any way. There is a law\nfor the slave as well as for the white man. You are no better than a\nmurderer.\n\n\"As for you,\" addressing Cook and Ramsay, a couple of overseers from\nneighboring plantations, \"as for you--begone! If you have any regard\nfor your own safety, I say, begone.\"\n\nCook and Ramsay, without a further word, mounted their horses and rode\naway. Tibeats, in a few minutes, evidently in fear, and overawed by\nthe decided tone of Chapin, sneaked off like a coward, as he was, and\nmounting his horse, followed his companions.\n\nI remained standing where I was, still bound, with the rope around my\nneck. As soon as they were gone, Chapin called Rachel, ordering her to\nrun to the field, and tell Lawson to hurry to the house without delay,\nand bring the brown mule with him, an animal much prized for its\nunusual fleetness. Presently the boy appeared.\n\n\"Lawson,\" said Chapin, \"you must go to the Pine Woods. Tell your\nmaster Ford to come here at once--that he must not delay a single\nmoment. Tell him they are trying to murder Platt. Now hurry, boy. Be\nat the Pine Woods by noon if you kill the mule.\"\n\nChapin stepped into the house and wrote a pass. When he returned,\nLawson was at the door, mounted on his mule. Receiving the pass, he\nplied the whip right smartly to the beast, dashed out of the yard, and\nturning up the bayou on a hard gallop, in less time than it has taken\nme to describe the scene, was out of sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n  THE HOT SUN--YET BOUND--THE CORDS SINK INTO MY FLESH--CHAPIN'S\n  UNEASINESS--SPECULATION--RACHEL, AND HER CUP OF WATER--SUFFERING\n  INCREASES--THE HAPPINESS OF SLAVERY--ARRIVAL OF FORD--HE CUTS THE\n  CORDS WHICH BIND ME, AND TAKES THE ROPE FROM MY NECK--MISERY--THE\n  GATHERING OF THE SLAVES IN ELIZA'S CABIN--THEIR KINDNESS--RACHEL\n  REPEATS THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY--LAWSON ENTERTAINS HIS COMPANIONS\n  WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HIS RIDE--CHAPIN'S APPREHENSIONS OF TIBEATS--HIRED\n  TO PETER TANNER--PETER EXPOUNDS THE SCRIPTURES--DESCRIPTION OF THE\n  STOCKS.\n\n\nAs the sun approached the meridian that day it became insufferably\nwarm. Its hot rays scorched the ground. The earth almost blistered\nthe foot that stood upon it. I was without coat or hat, standing\nbare-headed, exposed to its burning blaze. Great drops of perspiration\nrolled down my face, drenching the scanty apparel wherewith I was\nclothed. Over the fence, a very little way off, the peach trees cast\ntheir cool, delicious shadows on the grass. I would gladly have\ngiven a long year of service to have been enabled to exchange the\nheated oven, as it were, wherein I stood, for a seat beneath their\nbranches. But I was yet bound, the rope still dangling from my neck,\nand standing in the same tracks where Tibeats and his comrades left\nme. I could not move an inch, so firmly had I been bound. To have been\nenabled to lean against the weaving house would have been a luxury\nindeed. But it was far beyond my reach, though distant less than\ntwenty feet. I wanted to lie down, but knew I could not rise again.\nThe ground was so parched and boiling hot I was aware it would but\nadd to the discomfort of my situation. If I could have only moved my\nposition, however slightly, it would have been relief unspeakable.\nBut the hot rays of a southern sun, beating all the long summer day\non my bare head, produced not half the suffering I experienced from\nmy aching limbs. My wrists and ankles, and the cords of my legs and\narms began to swell, burying the rope that bound them into the swollen\nflesh.\n\nAll day Chapin walked back and forth upon the stoop, but not once\napproached me. He appeared to be in a state of great uneasiness,\nlooking first towards me, and then up the road, as if expecting some\narrival every moment. He did not go to the field, as was his custom.\nIt was evident from his manner that he supposed Tibeats would return\nwith more and better armed assistance, perhaps, to renew the quarrel,\nand it was equally evident he had prepared his mind to defend my life\nat whatever hazard. Why he did not relieve me--why he suffered me to\nremain in agony the whole weary day, I never knew. It was not for\nwant of sympathy, I am certain. Perhaps he wished Ford to see the\nrope about my neck, and the brutal manner in which I had been bound;\nperhaps his interference with another's property in which he had no\nlegal interest might have been a trespass, which would have subjected\nhim to the penalty of the law. Why Tibeats was all day absent was\nanother mystery I never could divine. He knew well enough that Chapin\nwould not harm him unless he persisted in his design against me.\nLawson told me afterwards, that, as he passed the plantation of John\nDavid Cheney, he saw the three, and that they turned and looked after\nhim as he flew by. I think his supposition was, that Lawson had been\nsent out by Overseer Chapin to arouse the neighboring planters, and to\ncall on them to come to his assistance. He, therefore, undoubtedly,\nacted on the principle, that \"discretion is the better part of valor,\"\nand kept away.\n\nBut whatever motive may have governed the cowardly and malignant\ntyrant, it is of no importance. There I still stood in the noon-tide\nsun, groaning with pain. From long before daylight I had not eaten a\nmorsel. I was growing faint from pain, and thirst, and hunger. Once\nonly, in the very hottest portion of the day, Rachel, half fearful she\nwas acting contrary to the overseer's wishes, ventured to me, and held\na cup of water to my lips. The humble creature never knew, nor could\nshe comprehend if she had heard them, the blessings I invoked upon\nher, for that balmy draught. She could only say, \"Oh, Platt, how I do\npity you,\" and then hastened back to her labors in the kitchen.\n\nNever did the sun move so slowly through the heavens--never did it\nshower down such fervent and fiery rays, as it did that day. At\nleast, so it appeared to me. What my meditations were--the innumerable\nthoughts that thronged through my distracted brain--I will not attempt\nto give expression to. Suffice it to say, during the whole long day I\ncame not to the conclusion, even once, that the southern slave, fed,\nclothed, whipped and protected by his master, is happier than the\nfree colored citizen of the North. To that conclusion I have never\nsince arrived. There are many, however, even in the Northern States,\nbenevolent and well-disposed men, who will pronounce my opinion\nerroneous, and gravely proceed to substantiate the assertion with an\nargument. Alas! they have never drunk, as I have, from the bitter cup\nof slavery. Just at sunset my heart leaped with unbounded joy, as Ford\ncame riding into the yard, his horse covered with foam. Chapin met him\nat the door, and after conversing a short time, he walked directly to\nme.\n\n\"Poor Platt, you are in a bad state,\" was the only expression that\nescaped his lips.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said I, \"thank God, Master Ford, that you have come at\nlast.\"\n\nDrawing a knife from his pocket, he indignantly cut the cord from\nmy wrists, arms, and ankles, and slipped the noose from my neck.\nI attempted to walk, but staggered like a drunken man, and fell\npartially to the ground.\n\nFord returned immediately to the house, leaving me alone again. As\nhe reached the piazza, Tibeats and his two friends rode up. A long\ndialogue followed. I could hear the sound of their voices, the mild\ntones of Ford mingling with the angry accents of Tibeats, but was\nunable to distinguish what was said. Finally the three departed again,\napparently not well pleased.\n\nI endeavored to raise the hammer, thinking to show Ford how willing I\nwas to work, by proceeding with my labors on the weaving house, but\nit fell from my nerveless hand. At dark I crawled into the cabin, and\nlaid down. I was in great misery--all sore and swollen--the slightest\nmovement producing excruciating suffering. Soon the hands came in\nfrom the field. Rachel, when she went after Lawson, had told them\nwhat had happened. Eliza and Mary broiled me a piece of bacon, but my\nappetite was gone. Then they scorched some corn meal and made coffee.\nIt was all that I could take. Eliza consoled me and was very kind.\nIt was not long before the cabin was full of slaves. They gathered\nround me, asking many questions about the difficulty with Tibeats in\nthe morning--and the particulars of all the occurrences of the day.\nThen Rachel came in, and in her simple language, repeated it over\nagain--dwelling emphatically on the kick that sent Tibeats rolling\nover on the ground--whereupon there was a general titter throughout\nthe crowd. Then she described how Chapin walked out with his pistols\nand rescued me, and how Master Ford cut the ropes with his knife, just\nas if he was mad.\n\nBy this time Lawson had returned. He had to regale them with an\naccount of his trip to the Pine Woods--how the brown mule bore him\nfaster than a \"streak o'lightnin\"--how he astonished everybody as he\nflew along--how Master Ford started right away--how he said Platt was\na good nigger, and they shouldn't kill him, concluding with pretty\nstrong intimations that there was not another human being in the wide\nworld, who could have created such a universal sensation on the road,\nor performed such a marvelous John Gilpin feat, as he had done that\nday on the brown mule.\n\nThe kind creatures loaded me with the expression of their\nsympathy--saying, Tibeats was a hard, cruel man, and hoping \"Massa\nFord\" would get me back again. In this manner they passed the time,\ndiscussing, chatting, talking over and over again the exciting affair,\nuntil suddenly Chapin presented himself at the cabin door and called\nme.\n\n\"Platt,\" said he, \"you will sleep on the floor in the great house\nto-night; bring your blanket with you.\"\n\nI arose as quickly as I was able, took my blanket in my hand, and\nfollowed him. On the way he informed me that he should not wonder\nif Tibeats was back again before morning--that he intended to kill\nme--and that he did not mean he should do it without witnesses. Had he\nstabbed me to the heart in the presence of a hundred slaves, not one\nof them, by the laws of Louisiana, could have given evidence against\nhim. I laid down on the floor in the \"great house\"--the first and\nthe last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted me during\nmy twelve years of bondage--and tried to sleep. Near midnight the\ndog began to bark. Chapin arose, looked from the window, but could\ndiscover nothing. At length the dog was quiet. As he returned to his\nroom, he said,\n\n\"I believe, Platt, that scoundrel is skulking about the premises\nsomewhere. If the dog barks again, and I am sleeping, wake me.\"\n\nI promised to do so. After the lapse of an hour or more, the dog\nre-commenced his clamor, running towards the gate, then back again,\nall the while barking furiously.\n\nChapin was out of bed without waiting to be called. On this occasion,\nhe stepped forth upon the piazza, and remained standing there a\nconsiderable length of time. Nothing, however, was to be seen, and\nthe dog returned to his kennel. We were not disturbed again during\nthe night. The excessive pain that I suffered, and the dread of\nsome impending danger, prevented any rest whatever. Whether or not\nTibeats did actually return to the plantation that night, seeking an\nopportunity to wreak his vengeance upon me, is a secret known only\nto himself, perhaps. I thought then, however, and have the strong\nimpression still, that he was there. At all events, he had the\ndisposition of an assassin--cowering before a brave man's words, but\nready to strike his helpless or unsuspecting victim in the back, as I\nhad reason afterwards to know.\n\nAt daylight in the morning, I arose, sore and weary, having rested\nlittle. Nevertheless, after partaking breakfast, which Mary and Eliza\nhad prepared for me in the cabin, I proceeded to the weaving house\nand commenced the labors of another day. It was Chapin's practice, as\nit is the practice of overseers generally, immediately on arising,\nto bestride his horse, always saddled and bridled and ready for\nhim--the particular business of some slave--and ride into the field.\nThis morning, on the contrary, he came to the weaving house, asking\nif I had seen anything of Tibeats yet. Replying in the negative, he\nremarked there was something not right about the fellow--there was bad\nblood in him--that I must keep a sharp watch of him, or he would do me\nwrong some day when I least expected it.\n\nWhile he was yet speaking, Tibeats rode in, hitched his horse, and\nentered the house. I had little fear of him while Ford and Chapin were\nat hand, but they could not be near me always.\n\nOh! how heavily the weight of slavery pressed upon me then. I must\ntoil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on\nthe hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but\nlive the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand\nhenceforth in continued fear and dread. Why had I not died in my young\nyears--before God had given me children to love and live for? What\nunhappiness and suffering and sorrow it would have prevented. I sighed\nfor liberty; but the bondman's chain was round me, and could not be\nshaken off. I could only gaze wistfully towards the North, and think\nof the thousands of miles that stretched between me and the soil of\nfreedom, over which a _black_ freeman may not pass.\n\nTibeats, in the course of half an hour, walked over to the\nweaving-house, looked at me sharply, then returned without saying\nanything. Most of the forenoon he sat on the piazza, reading a\nnewspaper and conversing with Ford. After dinner, the latter left for\nthe Pine Woods, and it was indeed with regret that I beheld him depart\nfrom the plantation.\n\nOnce more during the day Tibeats came to me, gave me some order, and\nreturned.\n\nDuring the week the weaving-house was completed--Tibeats in the\nmeantime making no allusion whatever to the difficulty--when I was\ninformed he had hired me to Peter Tanner, to work under another\ncarpenter by the name of Myers. This announcement was received with\ngratification, as any place was desirable that would relieve me of his\nhateful presence.\n\nPeter Tanner, as the reader has already been informed, lived on the\nopposite shore, and was the brother of Mistress Ford. He is one of the\nmost extensive planters on Bayou Boeuf, and owns a large number of\nslaves.\n\nOver I went to Tanner's, joyfully enough. He had heard of my late\ndifficulties--in fact, I ascertained the flogging of Tibeats was\nsoon blazoned far and wide. This affair, together with my rafting\nexperiment, had rendered me somewhat notorious. More than once I\nheard it said that Platt Ford, now Platt Tibeats--a slave's name\nchanges with his change of master--was \"a devil of a nigger.\" But I\nwas destined to make a still further noise, as will presently be seen,\nthroughout the little world of Bayou Boeuf.\n\nPeter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the idea that he was quite\nsevere, though I could perceive there was a vein of good humor in the\nold fellow, after all.\n\n\"You're the nigger,\" he said to me on my arrival--\"You're the nigger\nthat flogged your master, eh? You're the nigger that kicks, and holds\ncarpenter Tibeats by the leg, and wallops him, are ye? I'd like to see\nyou hold me by the leg--I should. You're a 'portant character--you're\na great nigger--very remarkable nigger, ain't ye? _I'd_ lash\nyou--_I'd_ take the tantrums out of ye. Jest take hold of my leg, if\nyou please. None of your pranks here, my boy, remember _that_. Now\ngo to work, you _kickin'_ rascal,\" concluded Peter Tanner, unable to\nsuppress a half-comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm.\n\nAfter listening to this salutation, I was taken charge of by Myers,\nand labored under his direction for a month, to his and my own\nsatisfaction.\n\nLike William Ford, his brother-in-law, Tanner was in the habit of\nreading the Bible to his slaves on the Sabbath, but in a somewhat\ndifferent spirit. He was an impressive commentator on the New\nTestament. The first Sunday after my coming to the plantation, he\ncalled them together, and began to read the twelfth chapter of Luke.\nWhen he came to the 47th verse, he looked deliberately around him,\nand continued--\"And that servant which knew his lord's _will_,\"--here\nhe paused, looking around more deliberately than before, and again\nproceeded--\"which knew his lord's _will_, and _prepared_ not\nhimself\"--here was another pause--\"_prepared_ not himself, neither did\n_according_ to his will, shall be beaten with many _stripes_.\"\n\n\"D'ye hear that?\" demanded Peter, emphatically. \"_Stripes_,\"\nhe repeated, slowly and distinctly, taking off his spectacles,\npreparatory to making a few remarks.\n\n\"That nigger that don't take care--that don't obey his lord--that's\nhis master--d'ye see?--that _'ere_ nigger shall be beaten with many\nstripes. Now, 'many' signifies a _great_ many--forty, a hundred, a\nhundred and fifty lashes. _That's_ Scripter!\" and so Peter continued\nto elucidate the subject for a great length of time, much to the\nedification of his sable audience.\n\nAt the conclusion of the exercises, calling up three of his slaves,\nWarner, Will and Major, he cried out to me--\n\n\"Here, Platt, you held Tibeats by the legs; now I'll see if you can\nhold these rascals in the same way, till I get back from meetin'.\"\n\nThereupon he ordered them to the stocks--a common thing on plantations\nin the Red River country. The stocks are formed of two planks, the\nlower one made fast at the ends to two short posts, driven firmly\ninto the ground. At regular distances half circles are cut in the\nupper edge. The other plank is fastened to one of the posts by a\nhinge, so that it can be opened or shut down, in the same manner as\nthe blade of a pocket-knife is shut or opened. In the lower edge of\nthe upper plank corresponding half circles are also cut, so that when\nthey close, a row of holes is formed large enough to admit a negro's\nleg above the ankle, but not large enough to enable him to draw out\nhis foot. The other end of the upper plank, opposite the hinge, is\nfastened to its post by lock and key. The slave is made to sit upon\nthe ground, when the uppermost plank is elevated, his legs, just above\nthe ankles, placed in the sub-half circles, and shutting it down\nagain, and locking it, he is held secure and fast. Very often the neck\ninstead of the ankle is enclosed. In this manner they are held during\nthe operation of whipping.\n\nWarner, Will and Major, according to Tanner's account of them, were\nmelon-stealing, Sabbath-breaking niggers, and not approving of such\nwickedness, he felt it his duty to put them in the stocks. Handing\nme the key, himself, Myers, Mistress Tanner and the children entered\nthe carriage and drove away to church at Cheneyville. When they were\ngone, the boys begged me to let them out. I felt sorry to see them\nsitting on the hot ground, and remembered my own sufferings in the\nsun. Upon their promise to return to the stocks at any moment they\nwere required to do so, I consented to release them. Grateful for\nthe lenity shown them, and in order in some measure to repay it, they\ncould do no less, of course, than pilot me to the melon-patch. Shortly\nbefore Tanner's return, they were in the stocks again. Finally he\ndrove up, and looking at the boys, said, with a chuckle,--\n\n\"Aha! ye havn't been strolling about much to-day, any way. _I'll_\nteach you what's what. _I'll_ tire ye of eating water-melons on the\nLord's day, ye Sabbath-breaking niggers.\"\n\nPeter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious observances: he\nwas a deacon in the church.\n\nBut I have now reached a point in the progress of my narrative, when\nit becomes necessary to turn away from these light descriptions, to\nthe more grave and weighty matter of the second battle with Master\nTibeats, and the flight through the great Pacoudrie Swamp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n  RETURN TO TIBEATS--IMPOSSIBILITY OF PLEASING HIM--HE ATTACKS ME\n  WITH A HATCHET--THE STRUGGLE OVER THE BROAD AXE--THE TEMPTATION\n  TO MURDER HIM--ESCAPE ACROSS THE PLANTATION--OBSERVATIONS FROM\n  THE FENCE--TIBEATS APPROACHES, FOLLOWED BY THE HOUNDS--THEY TAKE\n  MY TRACK--THEIR LOUD YELLS--THEY ALMOST OVERTAKE ME--I REACH THE\n  WATER--THE HOUNDS CONFUSED--MOCCASIN SNAKES--ALLIGATORS--NIGHT\n  IN THE \"GREAT PACOUDRIE SWAMP\"--THE SOUNDS OF LIFE--NORTH-WEST\n  COURSE--EMERGE INTO THE PINE WOODS--THE SLAVE AND HIS YOUNG\n  MASTER--ARRIVAL AT FORD'S--FOOD AND REST.\n\n\nAt the end of a month, my services being no longer required at\nTanner's I was sent over the bayou again to my master, whom I found\nengaged in building the cotton press. This was situated at some\ndistance from the great house, in a rather retired place. I commenced\nworking once more in company with Tibeats, being entirely alone with\nhim most part of the time. I remembered the words of Chapin, his\nprecautions, his advice to beware, lest in some unsuspecting moment\nhe might injure me. They were always in my mind, so that I lived in a\nmost uneasy state of apprehension and fear. One eye was on my work,\nthe other on my master. I determined to give him no cause of offence,\nto work still more diligently, if possible, than I had done, to bear\nwhatever abuse he might heap upon me, save bodily injury, humbly and\npatiently, hoping thereby to soften in some degree his manner towards\nme, until the blessed time might come when I should be delivered from\nhis clutches.\n\nThe third morning after my return, Chapin left the plantation for\nCheneyville, to be absent until night. Tibeats, on that morning, was\nattacked with one of those periodical fits of spleen and ill-humor to\nwhich he was frequently subject, rendering him still more disagreeable\nand venomous than usual.\n\nIt was about nine o'clock in the forenoon, when I was busily employed\nwith the jack-plane on one of the sweeps. Tibeats was standing by the\nwork-bench, fitting a handle into the chisel, with which he had been\nengaged previously in cutting the thread of the screw.\n\n\"You are not planing that down enough,\" said he.\n\n\"It is just even with the line,\" I replied.\n\n\"You're a d--d liar,\" he exclaimed passionately.\n\n\"Oh, well, master,\" I said, mildly, \"I will plane it down more if you\nsay so,\" at the same time proceeding to do as I supposed he desired.\nBefore one shaving had been removed, however, he cried out, saying I\nhad now planed it too deep--it was too small--I had spoiled the sweep\nentirely. Then followed curses and imprecations. I had endeavored to\ndo exactly as he directed, but nothing would satisfy the unreasonable\nman. In silence and in dread I stood by the sweep, holding the\njack-plane in my hand, not knowing what to do, and not daring to be\nidle. His anger grew more and more violent, until, finally, with an\noath, such a bitter, frightful oath as only Tibeats could utter, he\nseized a hatchet from the work-bench and darted towards me, swearing\nhe would cut my head open.\n\nIt was a moment of life or death. The sharp, bright blade of the\nhatchet glittered in the sun. In another instant it would be buried in\nmy brain, and yet in that instant--so quick will a man's thoughts come\nto him in such a fearful strait--I reasoned with myself. If I stood\nstill, my doom was certain; if I fled, ten chances to one the hatchet,\nflying from his hand with a too-deadly and unerring aim, would strike\nme in the back. There was but one course to take. Springing towards\nhim with all my power, and meeting him full half-way, before he could\nbring down the blow, with one hand I caught his uplifted arm, with the\nother seized him by the throat. We stood looking each other in the\neyes. In his I could see murder. I felt as if I had a serpent by the\nneck, watching the slightest relaxation of my gripe, to coil itself\nround my body, crushing and stinging it to death. I thought to scream\naloud, trusting that some ear might catch the sound--but Chapin was\naway; the hands were in the field; there was no living soul in sight\nor hearing.\n\nThe good genius, which thus far through life has saved me from the\nhands of violence, at that moment suggested a lucky thought. With a\nvigorous and sudden kick, that brought him on one knee, with a groan,\nI released my hold upon his throat, snatched the hatchet, and cast it\nbeyond reach.\n\nFrantic with rage, maddened beyond control, he seized a white oak\nstick, five feet long, perhaps, and as large in circumference as his\nhand could grasp, which was lying on the ground. Again he rushed\ntowards me, and again I met him, seized him about the waist, and being\nthe stronger of the two, bore him to the earth. While in that position\nI obtained possession of the stick, and rising, cast it from me, also.\n\nHe likewise arose and ran for the broad-axe, on the work-bench.\nFortunately, there was a heavy plank lying upon its broad blade, in\nsuch a manner that he could not extricate it, before I had sprung upon\nhis back. Pressing him down closely and heavily on the plank, so that\nthe axe was held more firmly to its place, I endeavored, but in vain,\nto break his grasp upon the handle. In that position we remained some\nminutes.\n\nThere have been hours in my unhappy life, many of them, when the\ncontemplation of death as the end of earthly sorrow--of the grave as\na resting place for the tired and worn out body--has been pleasant to\ndwell upon. But such contemplations vanish in the hour of peril. No\nman, in his full strength, can stand undismayed, in the presence of\nthe \"king of terrors.\" Life is dear to every living thing; the worm\nthat crawls upon the ground will struggle for it. At that moment it\nwas dear to me, enslaved and treated as I was.\n\nNot able to unloose his hand, once more I seized him by the throat,\nand this time, with a vice-like gripe that soon relaxed his hold.\nHe became pliant and unstrung. His face, that had been white with\npassion, was now black from suffocation. Those small serpent eyes\nthat spat such venom, were now full of horror--two great white orbs\nstarting from their sockets!\n\nThere was \"a lurking devil\" in my heart that prompted me to kill the\nhuman blood-hound on the spot--to retain the grip on his accursed\nthroat till the breath of life was gone! I dared not murder him,\nand I dared not let him live. If I killed him, my life must pay the\nforfeit--if he lived, my life only would satisfy his vengeance. A\nvoice within whispered me to fly. To be a wanderer among the swamps,\na fugitive and a vagabond on the face of the earth, was preferable to\nthe life that I was leading.\n\nMy resolution was soon formed, and swinging him from the work-bench\nto the ground, I leaped a fence near by, and hurried across the\nplantation, passing the slaves at work in the cotton field. At the end\nof a quarter of a mile I reached the wood-pasture, and it was a short\ntime indeed that I had been running it. Climbing on to a high fence, I\ncould see the cotton press, the great house, and the space between.\nIt was a conspicuous position, from whence the whole plantation was\nin view. I saw Tibeats cross the field towards the house, and enter\nit--then he came out, carrying his saddle, and presently mounted his\nhorse and galloped away.\n\nI was desolate, but thankful. Thankful that my life was\nspared,--desolate and discouraged with the prospect before me. What\nwould become of me? Who would befriend me? Whither should I fly?\nOh, God! Thou who gavest me life, and implanted in my bosom the\nlove of life--who filled it with emotions such as other men, thy\ncreatures, have, do not forsake me. Have pity on the poor slave--let\nme not perish. If thou dost not protect me, I am lost--lost! Such\nsupplications, silently and unuttered, ascended from my inmost heart\nto Heaven. But there was no answering voice--no sweet, low tone,\ncoming down from on high, whispering to my soul, \"It is I, be not\nafraid.\" I was the forsaken of God, it seemed--the despised and hated\nof men!\n\nIn about three-fourths of an hour several of the slaves shouted and\nmade signs for me to run. Presently, looking up the bayou, I saw\nTibeats and two others on horse-back, coming at a fast gait, followed\nby a troop of dogs. There were as many as eight or ten. Distant as I\nwas, I knew them. They belonged on the adjoining plantation. The dogs\nused on Bayou Boeuf for hunting slaves are a kind of blood-hound,\nbut a far more savage breed than is found in the Northern States.\nThey will attack a negro, at their master's bidding, and cling\nto him as the common bull-dog will cling to a four footed animal.\nFrequently their loud bay is heard in the swamps, and then there is\nspeculation as to what point the runaway will be overhauled--the same\nas a New-York hunter stops to listen to the hounds coursing along the\nhillsides, and suggests to his companion that the fox will be taken\nat such a place. I never knew a slave escaping with his life from\nBayou Boeuf. One reason is, they are not allowed to learn the art\nof swimming, and are incapable of crossing the most inconsiderable\nstream. In their flight they can go in no direction but a little\nway without coming to a bayou, when the inevitable alternative is\npresented, of being drowned or overtaken by the dogs. In youth I had\npractised in the clear streams that flow through my native district,\nuntil I had become an expert swimmer, and felt at home in the watery\nelement.\n\nI stood upon the fence until the dogs had reached the cotton press. In\nan instant more, their long, savage yells announced they were on my\ntrack. Leaping down from my position, I ran towards the swamp. Fear\ngave me strength, and I exerted it to the utmost. Every few moments I\ncould hear the yelpings of the dogs. They were gaining upon me. Every\nhowl was nearer and nearer. Each moment I expected they would spring\nupon my back--expected to feel their long teeth sinking into my flesh.\nThere were so many of them, I knew they would tear me to pieces, that\nthey would worry me, at once, to death. I gasped for breath--gasped\nforth a half-uttered, choking prayer to the Almighty to save me--to\ngive me strength to reach some wide, deep bayou where I could throw\nthem off the track, or sink into its waters. Presently I reached\na thick palmetto bottom. As I fled through them they made a loud\nrustling noise, not loud enough, however, to drown the voices of the\ndogs.\n\nContinuing my course due south, as nearly as I can judge, I came at\nlength to water just over shoe. The hounds at that moment could not\nhave been five rods behind me. I could hear them crashing and plunging\nthrough the palmettoes, their loud, eager yells making the whole swamp\nclamorous with the sound. Hope revived a little as I reached the\nwater. If it were only deeper, they might lose the scent, and thus\ndisconcerted, afford me the opportunity of evading them. Luckily, it\ngrew deeper the farther I proceeded--now over my ankles--now half-way\nto my knees--now sinking a moment to my waist, and then emerging\npresently into more shallow places. The dogs had not gained upon me\nsince I struck the water. Evidently they were confused. Now their\nsavage intonations grew more and more distant, assuring me that I was\nleaving them. Finally I stopped to listen, but the long howl came\nbooming on the air again, telling me I was not yet safe. From bog to\nbog, where I had stepped, they could still keep upon the track, though\nimpeded by the water. At length, to my great joy, I came to a wide\nbayou, and plunging in, had soon stemmed its sluggish current to\nthe other side. There, certainly, the dogs would be confounded--the\ncurrent carrying down the stream all traces of that slight, mysterious\nscent, which enables the quick-smelling hound to follow in the track\nof the fugitive.\n\nAfter crossing this bayou the water became so deep I could not run. I\nwas now in what I afterwards learned was the \"Great Pacoudrie Swamp.\"\nIt was filled with immense trees--the sycamore, the gum, the cotton\nwood and cypress, and extends, I am informed, to the shore of the\nCalcasieu river. For thirty or forty miles it is without inhabitants,\nsave wild beasts--the bear, the wild-cat, the tiger, and great slimy\nreptiles, that are crawling through it everywhere. Long before I\nreached the bayou, in fact, from the time I struck the water until I\nemerged from the swamp on my return, these reptiles surrounded me. I\nsaw hundreds of moccasin snakes. Every log and bog--every trunk of a\nfallen tree, over which I was compelled to step or climb, was alive\nwith them. They crawled away at my approach, but sometimes in my\nhaste, I almost placed my hand or foot upon them. They are poisonous\nserpents--their bite more fatal than the rattlesnake's. Besides, I had\nlost one shoe, the sole having come entirely off, leaving the upper\nonly dangling to my ankle.\n\nI saw also many alligators, great and small, lying in the water, or\non pieces of floodwood. The noise I made usually startled them,\nwhen they moved off and plunged into the deepest places. Sometimes,\nhowever, I would come directly upon a monster before observing it. In\nsuch cases, I would start back, run a short way round, and in that\nmanner shun them. Straight forward, they will run a short distance\nrapidly, but do not possess the power of turning. In a crooked race,\nthere is no difficulty in evading them.\n\nAbout two o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the last of the hounds.\nProbably they did not cross the bayou. Wet and weary, but relieved\nfrom the sense of instant peril, I continued on, more cautious and\nafraid, however, of the snakes and alligators than I had been in the\nearlier portion of my flight. Now, before stepping into a muddy pool,\nI would strike the water with a stick. If the waters moved, I would go\naround it, if not, would venture through.\n\nAt length the sun went down, and gradually night's trailing mantle\nshrouded the great swamp in darkness. Still I staggered on, fearing\nevery instant I should feel the dreadful sting of the moccasin, or\nbe crushed within the jaws of some disturbed alligator. The dread of\nthem now almost equaled the fear of the pursuing hounds. The moon\narose after a time, its mild light creeping through the overspreading\nbranches, loaded with long, pendent moss. I kept traveling forwards\nuntil after midnight, hoping all the while that I would soon emerge\ninto some less desolate and dangerous region. But the water grew\ndeeper and the walking more difficult than ever. I perceived it\nwould be impossible to proceed much farther, and knew not, moreover,\nwhat hands I might fall into, should I succeed in reaching a human\nhabitation. Not provided with a pass, any white man would be at\nliberty to arrest me, and place me in prison until such time as my\nmaster should \"prove property, pay charges, and take me away.\" I was\nan estray, and if so unfortunate as to meet a law-abiding citizen of\nLouisiana, he would deem it his duty to his neighbor, perhaps, to put\nme forthwith in the pound. Really, it was difficult to determine which\nI had most reason to fear--dogs, alligators or men!\n\nAfter midnight, however, I came to a halt. Imagination cannot picture\nthe dreariness of the scene. The swamp was resonant with the quacking\nof innumerable ducks! Since the foundation of the earth, in all\nprobability, a human footstep had never before so far penetrated the\nrecesses of the swamp. It was not silent now--silent to a degree that\nrendered it oppressive,--as it was when the sun was shining in the\nheavens. My midnight intrusion had awakened the feathered tribes,\nwhich seemed to throng the morass in hundreds of thousands, and their\ngarrulous throats poured forth such multitudinous sounds--there was\nsuch a fluttering of wings--such sullen plunges in the water all\naround me--that I was affrighted and appalled. All the fowls of\nthe air, and all the creeping things of the earth appeared to have\nassembled together in that particular place, for the purpose of\nfilling it with clamor and confusion. Not by human dwellings--not in\ncrowded cities alone, are the sights and sounds of life. The wildest\nplaces of the earth are full of them. Even in the heart of that dismal\nswamp, God had provided a refuge and a dwelling place for millions of\nliving things.\n\nThe moon had now risen above the trees, when I resolved upon a new\nproject. Thus far I had endeavored to travel as nearly south as\npossible. Turning about I proceeded in a north-west direction, my\nobject being to strike the Pine Woods in the vicinity of Master\nFord's. Once within the shadow of his protection, I felt I would be\ncomparatively safe.\n\nMy clothes were in tatters, my hands, face, and body covered with\nscratches, received from the sharp knots of fallen trees, and in\nclimbing over piles of brush and floodwood. My bare foot was full of\nthorns. I was besmeared with muck and mud, and the green slime that\nhad collected on the surface of the dead water, in which I had been\nimmersed to the neck many times during the day and night. Hour after\nhour, and tiresome indeed had they become, I continued to plod along\non my north-west course. The water began to grow less deep, and the\nground more firm under my feet. At last I reached the Pacoudrie, the\nsame wide bayou I had swam while \"outward bound.\" I swam it again, and\nshortly after thought I heard a cock crow, but the sound was faint,\nand it might have been a mockery of the ear. The water receded from\nmy advancing footsteps--now I had left the bogs behind me--now I was\non dry land that gradually ascended to the plain, and I knew I was\nsomewhere in the \"Great Pine Woods.\"\n\nJust at day-break I came to an opening--a sort of small\nplantation--but one I had never seen before. In the edge of the woods\nI came upon two men, a slave and his young master, engaged in catching\nwild hogs. The white man I knew would demand my pass, and not able\nto give him one, would take me into possession. I was too wearied to\nrun again, and too desperate to be taken, and therefore adopted a\nruse that proved entirely successful. Assuming a fierce expression, I\nwalked directly towards him, looking him steadily in the face. As I\napproached, he moved backwards with an air of alarm. It was plain he\nwas much affrighted--that he looked upon me as some infernal goblin,\njust arisen from the bowels of the swamp!\n\n\"Where does William Ford live?\" I demanded, in no gentle tone.\n\n\"He lives seven miles from here,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Which is the way to his place?\" I again demanded, trying to look more\nfiercely than ever.\n\n\"Do you see those pine trees yonder?\" he asked, pointing to two, a\nmile distant, that rose far above their fellows, like a couple of tall\nsentinels, overlooking the broad expanse of forest.\n\n\"I see them,\" was the answer.\n\n\"At the feet of those pine trees,\" he continued, \"runs the Texas road.\nTurn to the left, and it will lead you to William Ford's.\"\n\nWithout farther parley, I hastened forward, happy as he was, no doubt,\nto place the widest possible distance between us. Striking the Texas\nroad, I turned to the left hand, as directed, and soon passed a great\nfire, where a pile of logs were burning. I went to it, thinking I\nwould dry my clothes; but the gray light of the morning was fast\nbreaking away,--some passing white man might observe me; besides, the\nheat overpowered me with the desire of sleep: so, lingering no longer,\nI continued my travels, and finally, about eight o'clock, reached the\nhouse of Master Ford.\n\nThe slaves were all absent from the quarters, at their work. Stepping\non to the piazza, I knocked at the door, which was soon opened by\nMistress Ford. My appearance was so changed--I was in such a wobegone\nand forlorn condition, she did not know me. Inquiring if Master Ford\nwas at home, that good man made his appearance, before the question\ncould be answered. I told him of my flight, and all the particulars\nconnected with it. He listened attentively, and when I had concluded,\nspoke to me kindly and sympathetically, and taking me to the kitchen,\ncalled John, and ordered him to prepare me food. I had tasted nothing\nsince daylight the previous morning.\n\nWhen John had set the meal before me, the madam came out with a bowl\nof milk, and many little delicious dainties, such as rarely please the\npalate of a slave. I was hungry, and I was weary, but neither food nor\nrest afforded half the pleasure as did the blessed voices speaking\nkindness and consolation. It was the oil and the wine which the Good\nSamaritan in the \"Great Pine Woods\" was ready to pour into the wounded\nspirit of the slave, who came to him, stripped of his raiment and\nhalf-dead.\n\nThey left me in the cabin, that I might rest. Blessed be sleep! It\nvisiteth all alike, descending as the dews of heaven on the bond and\nfree. Soon it nestled to my bosom, driving away the troubles that\noppressed it, and bearing me to that shadowy region, where I saw again\nthe faces, and listened to the voices of my children, who, alas, for\naught I knew in my waking hours, had fallen into the arms of that\n_other_ sleep, from which they _never_ would arouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n  THE MISTRESS' GARDEN--THE CRIMSON AND GOLDEN FRUIT--ORANGE AND\n  POMEGRANATE TREES--RETURN TO BAYOU BOEUF--MASTER FORD'S REMARKS ON\n  THE WAY--THE MEETING WITH TIBEATS--HIS ACCOUNT OF THE CHASE--FORD\n  CENSURES HIS BRUTALITY--ARRIVAL AT THE PLANTATION--ASTONISHMENT OF\n  THE SLAVES ON SEEING ME--THE ANTICIPATED FLOGGING--KENTUCKY JOHN--MR.\n  ELDRET, THE PLANTER--ELDRET'S SAM--TRIP TO THE \"BIG CANE BRAKE\"--THE\n  TRADITION OF \"SUTTON'S FIELD\"--FOREST TREES--GNATS AND MOSQUITOS--THE\n  ARRIVAL OF BLACK WOMEN IN THE BIG CANE--LUMBER WOMEN--SUDDEN\n  APPEARANCE OF TIBEATS--HIS PROVOKING TREATMENT--VISIT TO BAYOU\n  BOEUF--THE SLAVE PASS--SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY--THE LAST OF ELIZA--SALE\n  TO EDWIN EPPS.\n\n\nAfter a long sleep, sometime in the afternoon I awoke, refreshed, but\nvery sore and stiff. Sally came in and talked with me, while John\ncooked me some dinner. Sally was in great trouble, as well as myself,\none of her children being ill, and she feared it could not survive.\nDinner over, after walking about the quarters for a while, visiting\nSally's cabin and looking at the sick child, I strolled into the\nmadam's garden. Though it was a season of the year when the voices\nof the birds are silent, and the trees are stripped of their summer\nglories in more frigid climes, yet the whole variety of roses were\nthen blooming there, and the long, luxuriant vines creeping over\nthe frames. The crimson and golden fruit hung half hidden amidst the\nyounger and older blossoms of the peach, the orange, the plum, and\nthe pomegranate; for, in that region of almost perpetual warmth, the\nleaves are falling and the buds bursting into bloom the whole year\nlong.\n\nI indulged the most grateful feelings towards Master and Mistress\nFord, and wishing in some manner to repay their kindness, commenced\ntrimming the vines, and afterwards weeding out the grass from among\nthe orange and pomegranate trees. The latter grows eight or ten feet\nhigh, and its fruit, though larger, is similar in appearance to the\njelly-flower. It has the luscious flavor of the strawberry. Oranges,\npeaches, plums, and most other fruits are indigenous to the rich,\nwarm soil of Avoyelles; but the apple, the most common of them all in\ncolder latitudes, is rarely to be seen.\n\nMistress Ford came out presently, saying it was praise-worthy in me,\nbut I was not in a condition to labor, and might rest myself at the\nquarters until master should go down to Bayou Boeuf, which would not\nbe that day, and it might not be the next. I said to her--to be sure,\nI felt bad, and was stiff, and that my foot pained me, the stubs and\nthorns having so torn it, but thought such exercise would not hurt\nme, and that it was a great pleasure to work for so good a mistress.\nThereupon she returned to the great house, and for three days I was\ndiligent in the garden, cleaning the walks, weeding the flower beds,\nand pulling up the rank grass beneath the jessamine vines, which the\ngentle and generous hand of my protectress had taught to clamber along\nthe walls.\n\nThe fourth morning, having become recruited and refreshed, Master Ford\nordered me to make ready to accompany him to the bayou. There was but\none saddle horse at the opening, all the others with the mules having\nbeen sent down to the plantation. I said I could walk, and bidding\nSally and John goodbye, left the opening, trotting along by the\nhorse's side.\n\nThat little paradise in the Great Pine Woods was the oasis in the\ndesert, towards which my heart turned lovingly, during many years\nof bondage. I went forth from it now with regret and sorrow, not so\noverwhelming, however, as if it had then been given me to know that I\nshould never return to it again.\n\nMaster Ford urged me to take his place occasionally on the horse, to\nrest me; but I said no, I was not tired, and it was better for me to\nwalk than him. He said many kind and cheering things to me on the\nway, riding slowly, in order that I might keep pace with him. The\ngoodness of God was manifest, he declared, in my miraculous escape\nfrom the swamp. As Daniel came forth unharmed from the den of lions,\nand as Jonah had been preserved in the whale's belly, even so had\nI been delivered from evil by the Almighty. He interrogated me in\nregard to the various fears and emotions I had experienced during the\nday and night, and if I had felt, at any time, a desire to pray. I\nfelt forsaken of the whole world, I answered him, and was praying\nmentally all the while. At such times, said he, the heart of man turns\ninstinctively towards his Maker. In prosperity, and when there is\nnothing to injure or make him afraid, he remembers Him not, and is\nready to defy Him; but place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off\nfrom human aid, let the grave open before him--then it is, in the time\nof his tribulation, that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God\nfor help, feeling there is no other hope, or refuge, or safety, save\nin his protecting arm.\n\nSo did that benignant man speak to me of this life and of the life\nhereafter; of the goodness and power of God, and of the vanity of\nearthly things, as we journeyed along the solitary road towards Bayou\nBoeuf.\n\nWhen within some five miles of the plantation, we discovered a\nhorseman at a distance, galloping towards us. As he came near I saw\nthat it was Tibeats! He looked at me a moment, but did not address\nme, and turning about, rode along side by side with Ford. I trotted\nsilently at their horses' heels, listening to their conversation.\nFord informed him of my arrival in the Pine Woods three days before,\nof the sad plight I was in, and of the difficulties and dangers I had\nencountered.\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Tibeats, omitting his usual oaths in the presence\nof Ford, \"I never saw such running before. I'll bet him against a\nhundred dollars, he'll beat any nigger in Louisiana. I offered John\nDavid Cheney twenty-five dollars to catch him, dead or alive, but he\noutran his dogs in a fair race. Them Cheney dogs ain't much, after\nall. Dunwoodie's hounds would have had him down before he touched the\npalmettoes. Somehow the dogs got off the track, and we had to give\nup the hunt. We rode the horses as far as we could, and then kept on\nfoot till the water was three feet deep. The boys said he was drowned,\nsure. I allow I wanted a shot at him mightily. Ever since, I have\nbeen riding up and down the bayou, but had'nt much hope of catching\nhim--thought he was dead, _sartin_. Oh, he's a cuss to run--that\nnigger is!\"\n\nIn this way Tibeats ran on, describing his search in the swamp, the\nwonderful speed with which I had fled before the hounds, and when\nhe had finished, Master Ford responded by saying, I had always been\na willing and faithful boy with him; that he was sorry we had such\ntrouble; that, according to Platt's story, he had been inhumanly\ntreated, and that he, Tibeats, was himself in fault. Using hatchets\nand broad-axes upon slaves was shameful, and should not be allowed,\nhe remarked. \"This is no way of dealing with them, when first brought\ninto the country. It will have a pernicious influence, and set them\nall running away. The swamps will be full of them. A little kindness\nwould be far more effectual in restraining them, and rendering them\nobedient, than the use of such deadly weapons. Every planter on the\nbayou should frown upon such inhumanity. It is for the interest of\nall to do so. It is evident enough, Mr. Tibeats, that you and Platt\ncannot live together. You dislike him, and would not hesitate to\nkill him, and knowing it, he will run from you again through fear\nof his life. Now, Tibeats, you must sell him, or hire him out, at\nleast. Unless you do so, I shall take measures to get him out of your\npossession.\"\n\nIn this spirit Ford addressed him the remainder of the distance. I\nopened not my mouth. On reaching the plantation they entered the\ngreat house, while I repaired to Eliza's cabin. The slaves were\nastonished to find me there, on returning from the field, supposing\nI was drowned. That night, again, they gathered about the cabin to\nlisten to the story of my adventure. They took it for granted I would\nbe whipped, and that it would be severe, the well-known penalty of\nrunning away being five hundred lashes.\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" said Eliza, taking me by the hand, \"it would have been\nbetter for you if you had drowned. You have a cruel master, and he\nwill kill you yet, I am afraid.\"\n\nLawson suggested that it might be, overseer Chapin would be appointed\nto inflict the punishment, in which case it would not be severe,\nwhereupon Mary, Rachel, Bristol, and others hoped it would be Master\nFord, and then it would be no whipping at all. They all pitied me\nand tried to console me, and were sad in view of the castigation\nthat awaited me, except Kentucky John. There were no bounds to his\nlaughter; he filled the cabin with cachinnations, holding his sides\nto prevent an explosion, and the cause of his noisy mirth was the idea\nof my outstripping the hounds. Somehow, he looked at the subject in a\ncomical light. \"I _know'd_ dey would'nt cotch him, when he run cross\nde plantation. O, de lor', did'nt Platt pick his feet right up, tho',\nhey? When dem dogs got whar he was, he was'nt _dar_--haw, haw, haw! O,\nde lor' a' mity!\"--and then Kentucky John relapsed into another of his\nboisterous fits.\n\nEarly the next morning, Tibeats left the plantation. In the course\nof the forenoon, while sauntering about the gin-house, a tall,\ngood-looking man came to me, and inquired if I was Tibeats' boy, that\nyouthful appellation being applied indiscriminately to slaves even\nthough they may have passed the number of three score years and ten. I\ntook off my hat, and answered that I was.\n\n\"How would you like to work for me?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Oh, I would like to, very much,\" said I, inspired with a sudden hope\nof getting away from Tibeats.\n\n\"You worked under Myers at Peter Tanner's, didn't you?\"\n\nI replied I had, adding some complimentary remarks that Myers had made\nconcerning me.\n\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, \"I have hired you of your master to work for me\nin the \"Big Cane Brake,\" thirty-eight miles from here, down on Red\nRiver.\"\n\nThis man was Mr. Eldret, who lived below Ford's, on the same side of\nthe bayou. I accompanied him to his plantation, and in the morning\nstarted with his slave Sam, and a wagon-load of provisions, drawn by\nfour mules, for the Big Cane, Eldret and Myers having preceded us on\nhorseback. This Sam was a native of Charleston, where he had a mother,\nbrother and sisters. He \"allowed\"--a common word among both black and\nwhite--that Tibeats was a mean man, and hoped, as I most earnestly did\nalso, that his master would buy me.\n\nWe proceeded down the south shore of the bayou, crossing it at Carey's\nplantation; from thence to Huff Power, passing which, we came upon the\nBayou Rouge road, which runs towards Red River. After passing through\nBayou Rouge Swamp, and just at sunset, turning from the highway, we\nstruck off into the \"Big Cane Brake.\" We followed an unbeaten track,\nscarcely wide enough to admit the wagon. The cane, such as are used\nfor fishing-rods, were as thick as they could stand. A person could\nnot be seen through them the distance of a rod. The paths of wild\nbeasts run through them in various directions--the bear and the\nAmerican tiger abounding in these brakes, and wherever there is a\nbasin of stagnant water, it is full of alligators.\n\nWe kept on our lonely course through the \"Big Cane\" several miles,\nwhen we entered a clearing, known as \"Sutton's Field.\" Many years\nbefore, a man by the name of Sutton had penetrated the wilderness\nof cane to this solitary place. Tradition has it, that he fled\nthither, a fugitive, not from service, but from justice. Here he lived\nalone--recluse and hermit of the swamp--with his own hands planting\nthe seed and gathering in the harvest. One day a band of Indians\nstole upon his solitude, and after a bloody battle, overpowered and\nmassacred him. For miles the country round, in the slaves' quarters,\nand on the piazzas of \"great houses,\" where white children listen to\nsuperstitious tales, the story goes, that that spot, in the heart\nof the \"Big Cane,\" is a haunted place. For more than a quarter of\na century, human voices had rarely, if ever, disturbed the silence\nof the clearing. Rank and noxious weeds had overspread the once\ncultivated field--serpents sunned themselves on the doorway of the\ncrumbling cabin. It was indeed a dreary picture of desolation.\n\nPassing \"Sutton's Field,\" we followed a new-cut road two miles\nfarther, which brought us to its termination. We had now reached\nthe wild lands of Mr. Eldret, where he contemplated clearing up\nan extensive plantation. We went to work next morning with our\ncane-knives, and cleared a sufficient space to allow the erection of\ntwo cabins--one for Myers and Eldret, the other for Sam, myself, and\nthe slaves that were to join us. We were now in the midst of trees of\nenormous growth, whose wide-spreading branches almost shut out the\nlight of the sun, while the space between the trunks was an impervious\nmass of cane, with here and there an occasional palmetto.\n\nThe bay and the sycamore, the oak and the cypress, reach a growth\nunparalleled, in those fertile lowlands bordering the Red River. From\nevery tree, moreover, hang long, large masses of moss, presenting to\nthe eye unaccustomed to them, a striking and singular appearance.\nThis moss, in large quantities, is sent north, and there used for\nmanufacturing purposes.\n\nWe cut down oaks, split them into rails, and with these erected\ntemporary cabins. We covered the roofs with the broad palmetto leaf,\nan excellent substitute for shingles, as long as they last.\n\nThe greatest annoyance I met with here were small flies, gnats and\nmosquitoes. They swarmed the air. They penetrated the porches of the\near, the nose, the eyes, the mouth. They sucked themselves beneath the\nskin. It was impossible to brush or beat them off. It seemed, indeed,\nas if they would devour us--carry us away piecemeal, in their small\ntormenting mouths.\n\nA lonelier spot, or one more disagreeable, than the centre of the \"Big\nCane Brake,\" it would be difficult to conceive; yet to me it was a\nparadise, in comparison with any other place in the company of Master\nTibeats. I labored hard, and oft-times was weary and fatigued, yet I\ncould lie down at night in peace, and arise in the morning without\nfear.\n\nIn the course of a fortnight, four black girls came down from Eldret's\nplantation--Charlotte, Fanny, Cresia and Nelly. They were all large\nand stout. Axes were put into their hands, and they were sent out\nwith Sam and myself to cut trees. They were excellent choppers, the\nlargest oak or sycamore standing but a brief season before their\nheavy and well-directed blows. At piling logs, they were equal to any\nman. There are lumberwomen as well as lumbermen in the forests of the\nSouth. In fact, in the region of the Bayou Boeuf they perform their\nshare of all the labor required on the plantation. They plough, drag,\ndrive team, clear wild lands, work on the highway, and so forth. Some\nplanters, owning large cotton and sugar plantations, have none other\nthan the labor of slave women. Such a one is Jim Burns, who lives on\nthe north shore of the bayou, opposite the plantation of John Fogaman.\n\nOn our arrival in the brake, Eldret promised me, if I worked well, I\nmight go up to visit my friends at Ford's in four weeks. On Saturday\nnight of the fifth week, I reminded him of his promise, when he told\nme I had done so well, that I might go. I had set my heart upon it,\nand Eldret's announcement thrilled me with pleasure. I was to return\nin time to commence the labors of the day on Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile indulging the pleasant anticipation of so soon meeting my old\nfriends again, suddenly the hateful form of Tibeats appeared among us.\nHe inquired how Myers and Platt got along together, and was told, very\nwell, and that Platt was going up to Ford's plantation in the morning\non a visit.\n\n\"Poh, poh!\" sneered Tibeats; \"it isn't worth while--the nigger will\nget unsteady. He can't go.\"\n\nBut Eldret insisted I had worked faithfully--that he had given me\nhis promise, and that, under the circumstances, I ought not to be\ndisappointed. They then, it being about dark, entered one cabin\nand I the other. I could not give up the idea of going; it was a\nsore disappointment. Before morning I resolved, if Eldret made no\nobjection, to leave at all hazards. At daylight I was at his door,\nwith my blanket rolled up into a bundle, and hanging on a stick over\nmy shoulder, waiting for a pass. Tibeats came out presently in one\nof his disagreeable moods, washed his face, and going to a stump\nnear by, sat down upon it, apparently busily thinking with himself.\nAfter standing there a long time, impelled by a sudden impulse of\nimpatience, I started off.\n\n\"Are you going without a pass?\" he cried out to me.\n\n\"Yes, master, I thought I would,\" I answered.\n\n\"How do you think you'll get there?\" demanded he.\n\n\"Don't know,\" was all the reply I made him.\n\n\"You'd be taken and sent to jail, where you ought to be, before you\ngot half-way there,\" he added, passing into the cabin as he said it.\nHe came out soon with the pass in his hand, and calling me a \"d--d\nnigger that deserved a hundred lashes,\" threw it on the ground. I\npicked it up, and hurried away right speedily.\n\nA slave caught off his master's plantation without a pass, may be\nseized and whipped by any white man whom he meets. The one I now\nreceived was dated, and read as follows:\n\n\"Platt has permission to go to Ford's plantation, on Bayou Boeuf, and\nreturn by Tuesday morning.\n\n                                             JOHN M. TIBEATS.\"\n\nThis is the usual form. On the way, a great many demanded it, read it,\nand passed on. Those having the air and appearance of gentlemen, whose\ndress indicated the possession of wealth, frequently took no notice of\nme whatever; but a shabby fellow, an unmistakable loafer, never failed\nto hail me, and to scrutinize and examine me in the most thorough\nmanner. Catching runaways is sometimes a money-making business. If,\nafter advertising, no owner appears, they may be sold to the highest\nbidder; and certain fees are allowed the finder for his services, at\nall events, even if reclaimed. \"A mean white,\" therefore,--a name\napplied to the species loafer--considers it a god-send to meet an\nunknown negro without a pass.\n\nThere are no inns along the highways in that portion of the State\nwhere I sojourned. I was wholly destitute of money, neither did I\ncarry any provisions, on my journey from the Big Cane to Bayou Boeuf;\nnevertheless, with his pass in his hand, a slave need never suffer\nfrom hunger or from thirst. It is only necessary to present it to the\nmaster or overseer of a plantation, and state his wants, when he will\nbe sent round to the kitchen and provided with food or shelter, as\nthe case may require. The traveler stops at any house and calls for\na meal with as much freedom as if it was a public tavern. It is the\ngeneral custom of the country. Whatever their faults may be, it is\ncertain the inhabitants along Red River, and around the bayous in the\ninterior of Louisiana are not wanting in hospitality.\n\nI arrived at Ford's plantation towards the close of the afternoon,\npassing the evening in Eliza's cabin, with Lawson, Rachel, and others\nof my acquaintance. When we left Washington Eliza's form was round\nand plump. She stood erect, and in her silks and jewels, presented\na picture of graceful strength and elegance. Now she was but a thin\nshadow of her former self. Her face had become ghastly haggard, and\nthe once straight and active form was bowed down, as if bearing the\nweight of a hundred years. Crouching on her cabin floor, and clad\nin the coarse garments of a slave, old Elisha Berry would not have\nrecognized the mother of his child. I never saw her afterwards. Having\nbecome useless in the cotton-field, she was bartered for a trifle, to\nsome man residing in the vicinity of Peter Compton's. Grief had gnawed\nremorselessly at her heart, until her strength was gone; and for that,\nher last master, it is said, lashed and abused her most unmercifully.\nBut he could not whip back the departed vigor of her youth, nor\nstraighten up that bended body to its full height, such as it was when\nher children were around her, and the light of freedom was shining on\nher path.\n\nI learned the particulars relative to her departure from this world,\nfrom some of Compton's slaves, who had come over Red River to the\nbayou, to assist young Madam Tanner during the \"busy season.\" She\nbecame at length, they said, utterly helpless, for several weeks lying\non the ground floor in a dilapidated cabin, dependent upon the mercy\nof her fellow-thralls for an occasional drop of water, and a morsel of\nfood. Her master did not \"knock her on the head,\" as is sometimes done\nto put a suffering animal out of misery, but left her unprovided for,\nand unprotected, to linger through a life of pain and wretchedness to\nits natural close. When the hands returned from the field one night\nthey found her dead! During the day, the Angel of the Lord, who moveth\ninvisibly over all the earth, gathering in his harvest of departing\nsouls, had silently entered the cabin of the dying woman, and taken\nher from thence. She was _free_ at last!\n\nNext day, rolling up my blanket, I started on my return to the Big\nCane. After traveling five miles, at a place called Huff Power, the\never-present Tibeats met me in the road. He inquired why I was going\nback so soon, and when informed I was anxious to return by the time I\nwas directed, he said I need go no farther than the next plantation,\nas he had that day sold me to Edwin Epps. We walked down into the\nyard, where we met the latter gentleman, who examined me, and asked\nme the usual questions propounded by purchasers. Having been duly\ndelivered over, I was ordered to the quarters, and at the same time\ndirected to make a hoe and axe handle for myself.\n\nI was now no longer the property of Tibeats--his dog, his brute,\ndreading his wrath and cruelty day and night; and whoever or whatever\nmy new master might prove to be, I could not, certainly, regret the\nchange. So it was good news when the sale was announced, and with a\nsigh of relief I sat down for the first time in my new abode.\n\nTibeats soon after disappeared from that section of the country.\nOnce afterwards, and only once, I caught a glimpse of him. It was\nmany miles from Bayou Boeuf. He was seated in the doorway of a low\ngroggery. I was passing, in a drove of slaves, through St. Mary's\nparish.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n  PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF EPPS--EPPS, DRUNK AND SOBER--A GLIMPSE\n  OF HIS HISTORY--COTTON GROWING--THE MODE OF PLOUGHING AND\n  PREPARING GROUND--OF PLANTING--OF HOEING, OF PICKING, OF\n  TREATING RAW HANDS--THE DIFFERENCE IN COTTON PICKERS--PATSEY\n  A REMARKABLE ONE--TASKED ACCORDING TO ABILITY--BEAUTY OF A\n  COTTON FIELD--THE SLAVE'S LABORS--FEAR ON APPROACHING THE\n  GIN-HOUSE--WEIGHING--\"CHORES\"--CABIN LIFE--THE CORN MILL--THE USES\n  OF THE GOURD--FEAR OF OVERSLEEPING--FEAR CONTINUALLY--MODE OF\n  CULTIVATING CORN--SWEET POTATOES--FERTILITY OF THE SOIL--FATTENING\n  HOGS--PRESERVING BACON--RAISING CATTLE--SHOOTING-MATCHES--GARDEN\n  PRODUCTS--FLOWERS AND VERDURE.\n\n\nEdwin Epps, of whom much will be said during the remainder of this\nhistory, is a large, portly, heavy-bodied man with light hair, high\ncheek bones, and a Roman nose of extraordinary dimensions. He has\nblue eyes, a fair complexion, and is, as I should say, full six feet\nhigh. He has the sharp, inquisitive expression of a jockey. His\nmanners are repulsive and coarse, and his language gives speedy and\nunequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an\neducation. He has the faculty of saying most provoking things, in that\nrespect even excelling old Peter Tanner. At the time I came into his\npossession, Edwin Epps was fond of the bottle, his \"sprees\" sometimes\nextending over the space of two whole weeks. Latterly, however,\nhe had reformed his habits, and when I left him, was as strict a\nspecimen of temperance as could be found on Bayou Boeuf. When \"in his\ncups,\" Master Epps was a roystering, blustering, noisy fellow, whose\nchief delight was in dancing with his \"niggers,\" or lashing them\nabout the yard with his long whip, just for the pleasure of hearing\nthem screech and scream, as the great welts were planted on their\nbacks. When sober, he was silent, reserved and cunning, not beating\nus indiscriminately, as in his drunken moments, but sending the end\nof his rawhide to some tender spot of a lagging slave, with a sly\ndexterity peculiar to himself.\n\nHe had been a driver and overseer in his younger years, but at this\ntime was in possession of a plantation on Bayou Huff Power, two and\na half miles from Holmesville, eighteen from Marksville, and twelve\nfrom Cheneyville. It belonged to Joseph B. Roberts, his wife's uncle,\nand was leased by Epps. His principal business was raising cotton,\nand inasmuch as some may read this book who have never seen a cotton\nfield, a description of the manner of its culture may not be out of\nplace.\n\nThe ground is prepared by throwing up beds or ridges, with the\nplough--back-furrowing, it is called. Oxen and mules, the latter\nalmost exclusively, are used in ploughing. The women as frequently\nas the men perform this labor, feeding, currying, and taking care of\ntheir teams, and in all respects doing the field and stable work,\nprecisely as do the ploughboys of the North.\n\nThe beds, or ridges, are six feet wide, that is, from water furrow\nto water furrow. A plough drawn by one mule is then run along the\ntop of the ridge or center of the bed, making the drill, into which\na girl usually drops the seed, which she carries in a bag hung round\nher neck. Behind her comes a mule and harrow, covering up the seed,\nso that two mules, three slaves, a plough and harrow, are employed\nin planting a row of cotton. This is done in the months of March and\nApril. Corn is planted in February. When there are no cold rains,\nthe cotton usually makes its appearance in a week. In the course of\neight or ten days afterwards the first hoeing is commenced. This is\nperformed in part, also, by the aid of the plough and mule. The plough\npasses as near as possible to the cotton on both sides, throwing the\nfurrow from it. Slaves follow with their hoes, cutting up the grass\nand cotton, leaving hills two feet and a half apart. This is called\nscraping cotton. In two weeks more commences the second hoeing. This\ntime the furrow is thrown towards the cotton. Only one stalk, the\nlargest, is now left standing in each hill. In another fortnight it\nis hoed the third time, throwing the furrow towards the cotton in the\nsame manner as before, and killing all the grass between the rows.\nAbout the first of July, when it is a foot high or thereabouts, it is\nhoed the fourth and last time. Now the whole space between the rows\nis ploughed, leaving a deep water furrow in the center. During all\nthese hoeings the overseer or driver follows the slaves on horseback\nwith a whip, such as has been described. The fastest hoer takes the\nlead row. He is usually about a rod in advance of his companions. If\none of them passes him, he is whipped. If one falls behind or is a\nmoment idle, he is whipped. In fact, the lash is flying from morning\nuntil night, the whole day long. The hoeing season thus continues from\nApril until July, a field having no sooner been finished once, than it\nis commenced again.\n\nIn the latter part of August begins the cotton picking season. At\nthis time each slave is presented with a sack. A strap is fastened to\nit, which goes over the neck, holding the mouth of the sack breast\nhigh, while the bottom reaches nearly to the ground. Each one is also\npresented with a large basket that will hold about two barrels. This\nis to put the cotton in when the sack is filled. The baskets are\ncarried to the field and placed at the beginning of the rows.\n\nWhen a new hand, one unaccustomed to the business, is sent for the\nfirst time into the field, he is whipped up smartly, and made for that\nday to pick as fast as he can possibly. At night it is weighed, so\nthat his capability in cotton picking is known. He must bring in the\nsame weight each night following. If it falls short, it is considered\nevidence that he has been laggard, and a greater or less number of\nlashes is the penalty.\n\nAn ordinary day's work is two hundred pounds. A slave who is\naccustomed to picking, is punished, if he or she brings in a less\nquantity than that. There is a great difference among them as regards\nthis kind of labor. Some of them seem to have a natural knack, or\nquickness, which enables them to pick with great celerity, and with\nboth hands, while others, with whatever practice or industry, are\nutterly unable to come up to the ordinary standard. Such hands are\ntaken from the cotton field and employed in other business. Patsey,\nof whom I shall have more to say, was known as the most remarkable\ncotton picker on Bayou Boeuf. She picked with both hands and with such\nsurprising rapidity, that five hundred pounds a day was not unusual\nfor her.\n\nEach one is tasked, therefore, according to his picking abilities,\nnone, however, to come short of two hundred weight. I, being\nunskillful always in that business, would have satisfied my master by\nbringing in the latter quantity, while on the other hand, Patsey would\nsurely have been beaten if she failed to produce twice as much.\n\nThe cotton grows from five to seven feet high, each stalk having a\ngreat many branches, shooting out in all directions, and lapping each\nother above the water furrow.\n\nThere are few sights more pleasant to the eye, than a wide cotton\nfield when it is in the bloom. It presents an appearance of purity,\nlike an immaculate expanse of light, new-fallen snow.\n\nSometimes the slave picks down one side of a row, and back upon the\nother, but more usually, there is one on either side, gathering all\nthat has blossomed, leaving the unopened bolls for a succeeding\npicking. When the sack is filled, it is emptied into the basket and\ntrodden down. It is necessary to be extremely careful the first time\ngoing through the field, in order not to break the branches off the\nstalks. The cotton will not bloom upon a broken branch. Epps never\nfailed to inflict the severest chastisement on the unlucky servant\nwho, either carelessly or unavoidably, was guilty in the least degree\nin this respect.\n\nThe hands are required to be in the cotton field as soon as it is\nlight in the morning, and, with the exception of ten or fifteen\nminutes, which is given them at noon to swallow their allowance of\ncold bacon, they are not permitted to be a moment idle until it is too\ndark to see, and when the moon is full, they often times labor till\nthe middle of the night. They do not dare to stop even at dinner time,\nnor return to the quarters, however late it be, until the order to\nhalt is given by the driver.\n\nThe day's work over in the field, the baskets are \"toted,\" or in other\nwords, carried to the gin-house, where the cotton is weighed. No\nmatter how fatigued and weary he may be--no matter how much he longs\nfor sleep and rest--a slave never approaches the gin-house with his\nbasket of cotton but with fear. If it falls short in weight--if he\nhas not performed the full task appointed him, he knows that he must\nsuffer. And if he has exceeded it by ten or twenty pounds, in all\nprobability his master will measure the next day's task accordingly.\nSo, whether he has too little or too much, his approach to the\ngin-house is always with, fear and trembling. Most frequently they\nhave too little, and therefore it is they are not anxious to leave\nthe field. After weighing, follow the whippings; and then the baskets\nare carried to the cotton house, and their contents stored away like\nhay, all hands being sent in to tramp it down. If the cotton is not\ndry, instead of taking it to the gin-house at once, it is laid upon\nplatforms, two feet high, and some three times as wide, covered with\nboards or plank, with narrow walks running between them.\n\nThis done, the labor of the day is not yet ended, by any means. Each\none must then attend to his respective chores. One feeds the mules,\nanother the swine--another cuts the wood, and so forth; besides, the\npacking is all done by candle light. Finally, at a late hour, they\nreach the quarters, sleepy and overcome with the long day's toil. Then\na fire must be kindled in the cabin, the corn ground in the small\nhand-mill, and supper, and dinner for the next day in the field,\nprepared. All that is allowed them is corn and bacon, which is given\nout at the corncrib and smoke-house every Sunday morning. Each one\nreceives, as his weekly, allowance, three and a half pounds of bacon,\nand corn enough to make a peck of meal. That is all--no tea, coffee,\nsugar, and with the exception of a very scanty sprinkling now and\nthen, no salt. I can say, from a ten years' residence with Master\nEpps, that no slave of his is ever likely to suffer from the gout,\nsuperinduced by excessive high living. Master Epps' hogs were fed on\n_shelled_ corn--it was thrown out to his \"niggers\" in the ear. The\nformer, he thought, would fatten faster by shelling, and soaking it in\nthe water--the latter, perhaps, if treated in the same manner, might\ngrow too fat to labor. Master Epps was a shrewd calculator, and knew\nhow to manage his own animals, drunk or sober.\n\nThe corn mill stands in the yard beneath a shelter. It is like a\ncommon coffee mill, the hopper holding about six quarts. There was\none privilege which Master Epps granted freely to every slave he had.\nThey might grind their corn nightly, in such small quantities as their\ndaily wants required, or they might grind the whole week's allowance\nat one time, on Sundays, just as they preferred. A very generous man\nwas Master Epps!\n\nI kept my corn in a small wooden box, the meal in a gourd; and, by the\nway, the gourd is one of the most convenient and necessary utensils on\na plantation. Besides supplying the place of all kinds of crockery in\na slave cabin, it is used for carrying water to the fields. Another,\nalso, contains the dinner. It dispenses with the necessity of pails,\ndippers, basins, and such tin and wooden superfluities altogether.\n\nWhen the corn is ground, and fire is made, the bacon is taken down\nfrom the nail on which it hangs, a slice cut off and thrown upon the\ncoals to broil. The majority of slaves have no knife, much less a\nfork. They cut their bacon with the axe at the wood-pile. The corn\nmeal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire, and baked. When\nit is \"done brown,\" the ashes are scraped off, and being placed upon a\nchip, which answers for a table, the tenant of the slave hut is ready\nto sit down upon the ground to supper. By this time it is usually\nmidnight. The same fear of punishment with which they approach the\ngin-house, possesses them again on lying down to get a snatch of rest.\nIt is the fear of oversleeping in the morning. Such an offence would\ncertainly be attended with not less than twenty lashes. With a prayer\nthat he may be on his feet and wide awake at the first sound of the\nhorn, he sinks to his slumbers nightly.\n\nThe softest couches in the world are not to be found in the log\nmansion of the slave. The one whereon I reclined year after year, was\na plank twelve inches wide and ten feet long. My pillow was a stick of\nwood. The bedding was a coarse blanket, and not a rag or shred beside.\nMoss might be used, were it not that it directly breeds a swarm of\nfleas.\n\nThe cabin is constructed of logs, without floor or window. The latter\nis altogether unnecessary, the crevices between the logs admitting\nsufficient light. In stormy weather the rain drives through them,\nrendering it comfortless and extremely disagreeable. The rude door\nhangs on great wooden hinges. In one end is constructed an awkward\nfire-place.\n\nAn hour before day light the horn is blown. Then the slaves arouse,\nprepare their breakfast, fill a gourd with water, in another deposit\ntheir dinner of cold bacon and corn cake, and hurry to the field\nagain. It is an offence invariably followed by a flogging, to be found\nat the quarters after daybreak. Then the fears and labors of another\nday begin; and until its close there is no such thing as rest. He\nfears he will be caught lagging through the day; he fears to approach\nthe gin-house with his basket-load of cotton at night; he fears, when\nhe lies down, that he will oversleep himself in the morning. Such is a\ntrue, faithful, unexaggerated picture and description of the slave's\ndaily life, during the time of cotton-picking, on the shores of Bayou\nBoeuf.\n\nIn the month of January, generally, the fourth and last picking is\ncompleted. Then commences the harvesting of corn. This is considered\na secondary crop, and receives far less attention than the cotton. It\nis planted, as already mentioned, in February. Corn is grown in that\nregion for the purpose of fattening hogs and feeding slaves; very\nlittle, if any, being sent to market. It is the white variety, the\near of great size, and the stalk growing to the height of eight, and\noften times ten feet. In August the leaves are stripped off, dried in\nthe sun, bound in small bundles, and stored away as provender for the\nmules and oxen. After this the slaves go through the field, turning\ndown the ear, for the purpose of keeping the rains from penetrating to\nthe grain. It is left in this condition until after cotton-picking is\nover, whether earlier or later. Then the ears are separated from the\nstalks, and deposited in the corncrib with the husks on; otherwise,\nstripped of the husks, the weevil would destroy it. The stalks are\nleft standing in the field.\n\nThe Carolina, or sweet potato, is also grown in that region to\nsome extent. They are not fed, however, to hogs or cattle, and are\nconsidered but of small importance. They are preserved by placing them\nupon the surface of the ground, with a slight covering of earth or\ncornstalks. There is not a cellar on Bayou Boeuf. The ground is so low\nit would fill with water. Potatoes are worth from two to three \"bits,\"\nor shillings a barrel; corn, except when there is an unusual scarcity,\ncan be purchased at the same rate.\n\nAs soon as the cotton and corn crops are secured, the stalks are\npulled up, thrown into piles and burned. The ploughs are started at\nthe same time, throwing up the beds again, preparatory to another\nplanting. The soil, in the parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles, and\nthroughout the whole country, so far as my observation extended, is\nof exceeding richness and fertility. It is a kind of marl, of a brown\nor reddish color. It does not require those invigorating composts\nnecessary to more barren lands, and on the same field the same crop is\ngrown for many successive years.\n\nPloughing, planting, picking cotton, gathering the corn, and pulling\nand burning stalks, occupies the whole of the four seasons of the\nyear. Drawing and cutting wood, pressing cotton, fattening and killing\nhogs, are but incidental labors.\n\nIn the month of September or October, the hogs are run out of the\nswamps by dogs, and confined in pens. On a cold morning, generally\nabout New Year's day, they are slaughtered. Each carcass is cut into\nsix parts, and piled one above the other in salt, upon large tables\nin the smoke-house. In this condition it remains a fortnight, when it\nis hung up, and a fire built, and continued more than half the time\nduring the remainder of the year. This thorough smoking is necessary\nto prevent the bacon from becoming infested with worms. In so warm a\nclimate it is difficult to preserve it, and very many times myself and\nmy companions have received our weekly allowance of three pounds and a\nhalf, when it was full of these disgusting vermin.\n\nAlthough the swamps are overrun with cattle, they are never made\nthe source of profit, to any considerable extent. The planter\ncuts his mark upon the ear, or brands his initials upon the side,\nand turns them into the swamps, to roam unrestricted within their\nalmost limitless confines. They are the Spanish breed, small and\nspike-horned. I have known of droves being taken from Bayou Boeuf, but\nit is of very rare occurrence. The value of the best cows is about\nfive dollars each. Two quarts at one milking, would be considered\nan unusual large quantity. They furnish little tallow, and that of\na soft, inferior quality. Notwithstanding the great number of cows\nthat throng the swamps, the planters are indebted to the North for\ntheir cheese and butter, which is purchased in the New-Orleans market.\nSalted beef is not an article of food either in the great house, or in\nthe cabin.\n\nMaster Epps was accustomed to attend shooting matches for the purpose\nof obtaining what fresh beef he required. These sports occurred\nweekly at the neighboring village of Holmesville. Fat beeves are\ndriven thither and shot at, a stipulated price being demanded for the\nprivilege. The lucky marksman divides the flesh among his fellows, and\nin this manner the attending planters are supplied.\n\nThe great number of tame and untamed cattle which swarm the woods and\nswamps of Bayou Boeuf, most probably suggested that appellation to the\nFrench, inasmuch as the term, translated, signifies the creek or river\nof the wild ox.\n\nGarden products, such as cabbages, turnips and the like, are\ncultivated for the use of the master and his family. They have greens\nand vegetables at all times and seasons of the year. \"The grass\nwithereth and the flower fadeth\" before the desolating winds of autumn\nin the chill northern latitudes, but perpetual verdure overspreads the\nhot lowlands, and flowers bloom in the heart of winter, in the region\nof Bayou Boeuf.\n\nThere are no meadows appropriated to the cultivation of the grasses.\nThe leaves of the corn supply a sufficiency of food for the laboring\ncattle, while the rest provide for themselves all the year in the\never-growing pasture.\n\nThere are many other peculiarities of climate, habit, custom, and of\nthe manner of living and laboring at the South, but the foregoing, it\nis supposed, will give the reader an insight and general idea of life\non a cotton plantation in Louisiana. The mode of cultivating cane,\nand the process of sugar manufacturing, will be mentioned in another\nplace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n  THE CURIOUS AXE-HELVE--SYMPTOMS OF APPROACHING ILLNESS--CONTINUE\n  TO DECLINE--THE WHIP INEFFECTUAL--CONFINED TO THE CABIN--VISIT BY\n  DR.

The\nhandles in use there are simply a round, straight stick. I made a\ncrooked one, shaped like those to which I had been accustomed at the\nNorth. When finished, and presented to Epps, he looked at it with\nastonishment, unable to determine exactly what it was. He had never\nbefore seen such a handle, and when I explained its conveniences, he\nwas forcibly struck with the novelty of the idea. He kept it in the\nhouse a long time, and when his friends called, was wont to exhibit it\nas a curiosity.\n\nIt was now the season of hoeing. I was first sent into the\ncorn-field, and afterwards set to scraping cotton. In this employment\nI remained until hoeing time was nearly passed, when I began to\nexperience the symptoms of approaching illness. I was attacked with\nchills, which were succeeded by a burning fever. I became weak and\nemaciated, and frequently so dizzy that it caused me to reel and\nstagger like a drunken man. Nevertheless, I was compelled to keep up\nmy row. When in health I found little difficulty in keeping pace with\nmy fellow-laborers, but now it seemed to be an utter impossibility.\nOften I fell behind, when the driver's lash was sure to greet my back,\ninfusing into my sick and drooping body a little temporary energy.\nI continued to decline until at length the whip became entirely\nineffectual. The sharpest sting of the rawhide could not arouse me.\nFinally, in September, when the busy season of cotton picking was at\nhand, I was unable to leave my cabin. Up to this time I had received\nno medicine, nor any attention from my master or mistress. The old\ncook visited me occasionally, preparing me corn-coffee, and sometimes\nboiling a bit of bacon, when I had grown too feeble to accomplish it\nmyself.\n\nWhen it was said that I would die, Master Epps, unwilling to bear\nthe loss, which the death of an animal worth a thousand dollars\nwould bring upon him, concluded to incur the expense of sending to\nHolmesville for Dr. Wines. He announced to Epps that it was the\neffect of the climate, and there was a probability of his losing me.\nHe directed me to eat no meat, and to partake of no more food than\nwas absolutely necessary to sustain life. Several weeks elapsed,\nduring which time, under the scanty diet to which I was subjected, I\nhad partially recovered. One morning, long before I was in a proper\ncondition to labor, Epps appeared at the cabin door, and, presenting\nme a sack, ordered me to the cotton field. At this time I had had no\nexperience whatever in cotton picking. It was an awkward business\nindeed. While others used both hands, snatching the cotton and\ndepositing it in the mouth of the sack, with a precision and dexterity\nthat was incomprehensible to me, I had to seize the boll with one\nhand, and deliberately draw out the white, gushing blossom with the\nother.\n\nDepositing the cotton in the sack, moreover, was a difficulty that\ndemanded the exercise of both hands and eyes. I was compelled to pick\nit from the ground where it would fall, nearly as often as from the\nstalk where it had grown. I made havoc also with the branches, loaded\nwith the yet unbroken bolls, the long, cumbersome sack swinging from\nside to side in a manner not allowable in the cotton field. After a\nmost laborious day I arrived at the gin-house with my load. When the\nscale determined its weight to be only ninety-five pounds, not half\nthe quantity required of the poorest picker, Epps threatened the\nseverest flogging, but in consideration of my being a \"raw hand,\"\nconcluded to pardon me on that occasion. The following day, and\nmany days succeeding, I returned at night with no better success--I\nwas evidently not designed for that kind of labor. I had not the\ngift--the dexterous fingers and quick motion of Patsey, who could\nfly along one side of a row of cotton, stripping it of its undefiled\nand fleecy whiteness miraculously fast. Practice and whipping were\nalike unavailing, and Epps, satisfied of it at last, swore I was\na disgrace--that I was not fit to associate with a cotton-picking\n\"nigger\"--that I could not pick enough in a day to pay the trouble\nof weighing it, and that I should go into the cotton field no more.\nI was now employed in cutting and hauling wood, drawing cotton from\nthe field to the gin-house, and performed whatever other service was\nrequired. Suffice to say, I was never permitted to be idle.\n\nIt was rarely that a day passed by without one or more whippings. This\noccurred at the time the cotton was weighed. The delinquent, whose\nweight had fallen short, was taken out, stripped, made to lie upon the\nground, face downwards, when he received a punishment proportioned to\nhis offence. It is the literal, unvarnished truth, that the crack of\nthe lash, and the shrieking of the slaves, can be heard from dark till\nbed time, on Epps' plantation, any day almost during the entire period\nof the cotton-picking season.\n\nThe number of lashes is graduated according to the nature of the case.\nTwenty-five are deemed a mere brush, inflicted, for instance, when a\ndry leaf or piece of boll is found in the cotton, or when a branch\nis broken in the field; fifty is the ordinary penalty following all\ndelinquencies of the next higher grade; one hundred is called severe:\nit is the punishment inflicted for the serious offence of standing\nidle in the field; from one hundred and fifty to two hundred is\nbestowed upon him who quarrels with his cabin-mates, and five hundred,\nwell laid on, besides the mangling of the dogs, perhaps, is certain to\nconsign the poor, unpitied runaway to weeks of pain and agony.\n\nDuring the two years Epps remained on the plantation at Bayou Huff\nPower, he was in the habit, as often as once in a fortnight at least,\nof coming home intoxicated from Holmesville. The shooting-matches\nalmost invariably concluded with a debauch. At such times he was\nboisterous and half-crazy. Often he would break the dishes, chairs,\nand whatever furniture he could lay his hands on. When satisfied\nwith his amusement in the house, he would seize the whip and walk\nforth into the yard. Then it behooved the slaves to be watchful and\nexceeding wary. The first one who came within reach felt the smart\nof his lash. Sometimes for hours he would keep them running in all\ndirections, dodging around the corners of the cabins. Occasionally\nhe would come upon one unawares, and if he succeeded in inflicting a\nfair, round blow, it was a feat that much delighted him. The younger\nchildren, and the aged, who had become inactive, suffered then. In the\nmidst of the confusion he would slily take his stand behind a cabin,\nwaiting with raised whip, to dash it into the first black face that\npeeped cautiously around the corner.\n\nAt other times he would come home in a less brutal humor. Then there\nmust be a merry-making. Then all must move to the measure of a tune.\nThen Master Epps must needs regale his melodious ears with the music\nof a fiddle. Then did he become buoyant, elastic, gaily \"tripping the\nlight fantastic toe\" around the piazza and all through the house.\n\nTibeats, at the time of my sale, had informed him I could play on\nthe violin. He had received his information from Ford. Through the\nimportunities of Mistress Epps, her husband had been induced to\npurchase me one during a visit to New-Orleans. Frequently I was called\ninto the house to play before the family, mistress being passionately\nfond of music.\n\nAll of us would be assembled in the large room of the great house,\nwhenever Epps came home in one of his dancing moods. No matter how\nworn out and tired we were, there must be a general dance. When\nproperly stationed on the floor, I would strike up a tune.\n\n\"Dance, you d--d niggers, dance,\" Epps would shout.\n\nThen there must be no halting or delay, no slow or languid movements;\nall must be brisk, and lively, and alert. \"Up and down, heel and toe,\nand away we go,\" was the order of the hour. Epps' portly form mingled\nwith those of his dusky slaves, moving rapidly through all the mazes\nof the dance.\n\nUsually his whip was in his hand, ready to fall about the ears of\nthe presumptuous thrall, who dared to rest a moment, or even stop to\ncatch his breath. When he was himself exhausted, there would be a\nbrief cessation, but it would be very brief. With a slash, and crack,\nand flourish of the whip, he would shout again, \"Dance, niggers,\ndance,\" and away they would go once more, pell-mell, while I spurred\nby an occasional sharp touch of the lash, sat in a corner, extracting\nfrom my violin a marvelous quick-stepping tune. The mistress often\nupbraided him, declaring she would return to her father's house at\nCheneyville; nevertheless, there were times she could not restrain a\nburst of laughter, on witnessing his uproarious pranks. Frequently,\nwe were thus detained until almost morning. Bent with excessive\ntoil--actually suffering for a little refreshing rest, and feeling\nrather as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep, many a\nnight in the house of Edwin Epps have his unhappy slaves been made to\ndance and laugh.\n\nNotwithstanding these deprivations in order to gratify the whim of\nan unreasonable master, we had to be in the field as soon as it was\nlight, and during the day perform the ordinary and accustomed task.\nSuch deprivations could not be urged at the scales in extenuation of\nany lack of weight, or in the cornfield for not hoeing with the usual\nrapidity. The whippings were just as severe as if we had gone forth\nin the morning, strengthened and invigorated by a night's repose.\nIndeed, after such frantic revels, he was always more sour and savage\nthan before, punishing for slighter causes, and using the whip with\nincreased and more vindictive energy.\n\nTen years I toiled for that man without reward. Ten years of\nmy incessant labor has contributed to increase the bulk of his\npossessions. Ten years I was compelled to address him with down-cast\neyes and uncovered head--in the attitude and language of a slave. I am\nindebted to him for nothing, save undeserved abuse and stripes.\n\nBeyond the reach of his inhuman thong, and standing on the soil of\nthe free State where I was born, thanks be to Heaven, I can raise my\nhead once more among men. I can speak of the wrongs I have suffered,\nand of those who inflicted them, with upraised eyes. But I have no\ndesire to speak of him or any other one otherwise than truthfully.\nYet to speak truthfully of Edwin Epps would be to say--he is a man\nin whose heart the quality of kindness or of justice is not found. A\nrough, rude energy, united with an uncultivated mind and an avaricious\nspirit, are his prominent characteristics. He is known as a \"nigger\nbreaker,\" distinguished for his faculty of subduing the spirit of the\nslave, and priding himself upon his reputation in this respect, as a\njockey boasts of his skill in managing a refractory horse. He looked\nupon a colored man, not as a human being, responsible to his Creator\nfor the small talent entrusted to him, but as a \"chattel personal,\" as\nmere live property, no better, except in value, than his mule or dog.\nWhen the evidence, clear and indisputable, was laid before him that I\nwas a free man, and as much entitled to my liberty as he--when, on the\nday I left, he was informed that I had a wife and children, as dear\nto me as his own babes to him, he only raved and swore, denouncing the\nlaw that tore me from him, and declaring he would find out the man who\nhad forwarded the letter that disclosed the place of my captivity, if\nthere was any virtue or power in money, and would take his life. He\nthought of nothing but his loss, and cursed me for having been born\nfree. He could have stood unmoved and seen the tongues of his poor\nslaves torn out by the roots--he could have seen them burned to ashes\nover a slow fire, or gnawed to death by dogs, if it only brought him\nprofit. Such a hard, cruel, unjust man is Edwin Epps.\n\nThere was but one greater savage on Bayou Boeuf than he. Jim Burns'\nplantation was cultivated, as already mentioned, exclusively by women.\nThat barbarian kept their backs so sore and raw, that they could not\nperform the customary labor demanded daily of the slave. He boasted of\nhis cruelty, and through all the country round was accounted a more\nthorough-going, energetic man than even Epps. A brute himself, Jim\nBurns had not a particle of mercy for his subject brutes, and like a\nfool, whipped and scourged away the very strength upon which depended\nhis amount of gain.\n\nEpps remained on Huff Power two years, when, having accumulated a\nconsiderable sum of money, he expended it in the purchase of the\nplantation on the east bank of Bayou Boeuf, where he still continues\nto reside. He took possession of it in 1845, after the holidays\nwere passed. He carried thither with him nine slaves, all of whom,\nexcept myself, and Susan, who has since died, remain there yet. He\nmade no addition to this force, and for eight years the following\nwere my companions in his quarters, viz: Abram, Wiley, Phebe, Bob,\nHenry, Edward, and Patsey. All these, except Edward, born since, were\npurchased out of a drove by Epps during the time he was overseer for\nArchy B. Williams, whose plantation is situated on the shore of Red\nRiver, not far from Alexandria.\n\nAbram was tall, standing a full head above any common man. He is\nsixty years of age, and was born in Tennessee. Twenty years ago, he\nwas purchased by a trader, carried into South Carolina, and sold to\nJames Buford, of Williamsburgh county, in that State. In his youth\nhe was renowned for his great strength, but age and unremitting toil\nhave somewhat shattered his powerful frame and enfeebled his mental\nfaculties.\n\nWiley is forty-eight. He was born on the estate of William Tassle,\nand for many years took charge of that gentleman's ferry over the Big\nBlack River, in South Carolina.\n\nPhebe was a slave of Buford, Tassle's neighbor, and having married\nWiley, he bought the latter, at her instigation. Buford was a kind\nmaster, sheriff of the county, and in those days a man of wealth.\n\nBob and Henry are Phebe's children, by a former husband, their father\nhaving been abandoned to give place to Wiley. That seductive youth\nhad insinuated himself into Phebe's affections, and therefore the\nfaithless spouse had gently kicked her first husband out of her cabin\ndoor. Edward had been born to them on Bayou Huff Power.\n\nPatsey is twenty-three--also from Buford's plantation. She is in no\nwise connected with the others, but glories in the fact that she is\nthe offspring of a \"Guinea nigger,\" brought over to Cuba in a slave\nship, and in the course of trade transferred to Buford, who was her\nmother's owner.\n\nThis, as I learned from them, is a genealogical account of my master's\nslaves. For years they had been together. Often they recalled the\nmemories of other days, and sighed to retrace their steps to the\nold home in Carolina. Troubles came upon their master Buford, which\nbrought far greater troubles upon them. He became involved in debt,\nand unable to bear up against his failing fortunes, was compelled\nto sell these, and others of his slaves. In a chain gang they had\nbeen driven from beyond the Mississippi to the plantation of Archy\nB. Williams. Edwin Epps, who, for a long while had been his driver\nand overseer, was about establishing himself in business on his own\naccount, at the time of their arrival, and accepted them in payment of\nhis wages.\n\nOld Abram was a kind-hearted being--a sort of patriarch among us,\nfond of entertaining his younger brethren with grave and serious\ndiscourse. He was deeply versed in such philosophy as is taught in\nthe cabin of the slave; but the great absorbing hobby of Uncle Abram\nwas General Jackson, whom his young master in Tennessee had followed\nto the wars. He loved to wander back, in imagination, to the place\nwhere he was born, and to recount the scenes of his youth during those\nstirring times when the nation was in arms. He had been athletic,\nand more keen and powerful than the generality of his race, but now\nhis eye had become dim, and his natural force abated. Very often,\nindeed, while discussing the best method of baking the hoe-cake, or\nexpatiating at large upon the glory of Jackson, he would forget where\nhe left his hat, or his hoe, or his basket; and then would the old man\nbe laughed at, if Epps was absent, and whipped if he was present. So\nwas he perplexed continually, and sighed to think that he was growing\naged and going to decay. Philosophy and Jackson and forgetfulness had\nplayed the mischief with him, and it was evident that all of them\ncombined were fast bringing down the gray hairs of Uncle Abram to the\ngrave.\n\nAunt Phebe had been an excellent field hand, but latterly was put\ninto the kitchen, where she remained, except occasionally, in a time\nof uncommon hurry. She was a sly old creature, and when not in the\npresence of her mistress or her master, was garrulous in the extreme.\n\nWiley, on the contrary, was silent. He performed his task without\nmurmur or complaint, seldom indulging in the luxury of speech, except\nto utter a wish, that he was away from Epps, and back once more in\nSouth Carolina.\n\nBob and Henry had reached the ages of twenty and twenty-three, and\nwere distinguished for nothing extraordinary or unusual, while Edward,\na lad of thirteen, not yet able to maintain his row in the corn or\nthe cotton field, was kept in the great house, to wait on the little\nEppses.\n\nPatsey was slim and straight. She stood erect as the human form is\ncapable of standing. There was an air of loftiness in her movement,\nthat neither labor, nor weariness, nor punishment could destroy.\nTruly, Patsey was a splendid animal, and were it not that bondage had\nenshrouded her intellect in utter and everlasting darkness, would\nhave been chief among ten thousand of her people. She could leap the\nhighest fences, and a fleet hound it was indeed, that could outstrip\nher in a race. No horse could fling her from his back. She was a\nskillful teamster. She turned as true a furrow as the best, and at\nsplitting rails there were none who could excel her. When the order\nto halt was heard at night, she would have her mules at the crib,\nunharnessed, fed and curried, before uncle Abram had found his hat.\nNot, however, for all or any of these, was she chiefly famous. Such\nlightning-like motion was in her fingers as no other fingers ever\npossessed, and therefore it was, that in cotton picking time, Patsey\nwas queen of the field.\n\nShe had a genial and pleasant temper, and was faithful and obedient.\nNaturally, she was a joyous creature, a laughing, light-hearted girl,\nrejoicing in the mere sense of existence. Yet Patsey wept oftener,\nand suffered more, than any of her companions. She had been literally\nexcoriated. Her back bore the scars of a thousand stripes; not because\nshe was backward in her work, nor because she was of an unmindful and\nrebellious spirit, but because it had fallen to her lot to be the\nslave of a licentious master and a jealous mistress. She shrank before\nthe lustful eye of the one, and was in danger even of her life at the\nhands of the other, and between the two, she was indeed accursed. In\nthe great house, for days together, there were high and angry words,\npoutings and estrangement, whereof she was the innocent cause. Nothing\ndelighted the mistress so much as to see her suffer, and more than\nonce, when Epps had refused to sell her, has she tempted me with\nbribes to put her secretly to death, and bury her body in some lonely\nplace in the margin of the swamp. Gladly would Patsey have appeased\nthis unforgiving spirit, if it had been in her power, but not like\nJoseph, dared she escape from Master Epps, leaving her garment in his\nhand. Patsey walked under a cloud. If she uttered a word in opposition\nto her master's will, the lash was resorted to at once, to bring her\nto subjection; if she was not watchful when about her cabin, or when\nwalking in the yard, a billet of wood, or a broken bottle perhaps,\nhurled from her mistress' hand, would smite her unexpectedly in the\nface. The enslaved victim of lust and hate, Patsey had no comfort of\nher life.\n\nThese were my companions and fellow-slaves, with whom I was accustomed\nto be driven to the field, and with whom it has been my lot to dwell\nfor ten years in the log cabins of Edwin Epps. They, if living, are\nyet toiling on the banks of Bayou Boeuf, never destined to breathe,\nas I now do, the blessed air of liberty, nor to shake off the heavy\nshackles that enthrall them, until they shall lie down forever in the\ndust.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n  DESTRUCTION OF THE COTTON CROP IN 1845--DEMAND FOR LABORERS IN ST.\n  MARY'S PARISH--SENT THITHER IN A DROVE--THE ORDER OF THE MARCH--THE\n  GRAND COTEAU--HIRED TO JUDGE TURNER ON BAYOU SALLE--APPOINTED\n  DRIVER IN HIS SUGAR HOUSE--SUNDAY SERVICES SLAVE FURNITURE, HOW\n  OBTAINED--THE PARTY AT YARNEY'S IN CENTREVILLE--GOOD FORTUNE--THE\n  CAPTAIN OF THE STEAMER--HIS REFUSAL TO SECRETE ME--RETURN TO\n  BAYOU BOEUF--SIGHT OF TIBEATS--PATSEY'S SORROWS--TUMULT AND\n  CONTENTION--HUNTING THE COON AND OPOSSUM--THE CUNNING OF THE\n  LATTER--THE LEAN CONDITION OF THE SLAVE--DESCRIPTION OF THE FISH\n  TRAP--THE MURDER OF THE MAN FROM NATCHEZ--EPPS CHALLENGED BY\n  MARSHALL--THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY--THE LOVE OF FREEDOM.\n\n\nThe first year of Epps' residence on the bayou, 1845, the caterpillars\nalmost totally destroyed the cotton crop throughout that region.\nThere was little to be done, so that the slaves were necessarily idle\nhalf the time. However, there came a rumor to Bayou Boeuf that wages\nwere high, and laborers in great demand on the sugar plantations in\nSt. Mary's parish. This parish is situated on the coast of the Gulf\nof Mexico, about one hundred and forty miles from Avoyelles. The Rio\nTeche, a considerable stream, flows through St. Mary's to the gulf.\n\nIt was determined by the planters, on the receipt of this\nintelligence, to make up a drove of slaves to be sent down to Tuckapaw\nin St. Mary's, for the purpose of hiring them out in the cane fields.\nAccordingly, in the month of September, there were one hundred and\nforty-seven collected at Holmesville, Abram, Bob and myself among the\nnumber. Of these about one-half were women. Epps, Alonson Pierce,\nHenry Toler, and Addison Roberts, were the white men, selected to\naccompany, and take charge of the drove. They had a two-horse carriage\nand two saddle horses for their use. A large wagon, drawn by four\nhorses, and driven by John, a boy belonging to Mr. Roberts, carried\nthe blankets and provisions.\n\nAbout 2 o'clock in the afternoon, having been fed, preparations were\nmade to depart. The duty assigned me was, to take charge of the\nblankets and provisions, and see that none were lost by the way. The\ncarriage proceeded in advance, the wagon following; behind this the\nslaves were arranged, while the two horsemen brought up the rear, and\nin this order the procession moved out of Holmesville.\n\nThat night we reached a Mr. McCrow's plantation, a distance of ten or\nfifteen miles, when we were ordered to halt. Large fires were built,\nand each one spreading his blanket on the ground, laid down upon it.\nThe white men lodged in the great house. An hour before day we were\naroused by the drivers coming among us, cracking their whips and\nordering us to arise. Then the blankets were rolled up, and being\nseverally delivered to me and deposited in the wagon, the procession\nset forth again.\n\nThe following night it rained violently. We were all drenched, our\nclothes saturated with mud and water. Reaching an open shed, formerly\na gin-house, we found beneath it such shelter as it afforded. There\nwas not room for all of us to lay down. There we remained, huddled\ntogether, through the night, continuing our march, as usual, in the\nmorning. During the journey we were fed twice a day, boiling our\nbacon and baking our corn-cake at the fires in the same manner as in\nour huts. We passed through Lafayetteville, Mountsville, New-Town,\nto Centreville, where Bob and Uncle Abram were hired. Our number\ndecreased as we advanced--nearly every sugar plantation requiring the\nservices of one or more.\n\nOn our route we passed the Grand Coteau or prairie, a vast space of\nlevel, monotonous country, without a tree, except an occasional one\nwhich had been transplanted near some dilapidated dwelling. It was\nonce thickly populated, and under cultivation, but for some cause\nhad been abandoned. The business of the scattered inhabitants that\nnow dwell upon it is principally raising cattle. Immense herds were\nfeeding upon it as we passed. In the centre of the Grand Coteau one\nfeels as if he were on the ocean, out of sight of land. As far as the\neye can see, in all directions, it is but a ruined and deserted waste.\n\nI was hired to Judge Turner, a distinguished man and extensive\nplanter, whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle, within a few\nmiles of the gulf. Bay on Salle is a small stream flowing into the bay\nof Atchafalaya. For some days I was employed at Turner's in repairing\nhis sugar house, when a cane knife was put into my hand, and with\nthirty or forty others, I was sent into the field. I found no such\ndifficulty in learning the art of cutting cane that I had in picking\ncotton. It came to me naturally and intuitively, and in a short time\nI was able to keep up with the fastest knife. Before the cutting was\nover, however, Judge Turner transferred me from the field to the sugar\nhouse, to act there in the capacity of driver. From the time of the\ncommencement of sugar making to the close, the grinding and boiling\ndoes not cease day or night. The whip was given me with directions to\nuse it upon any one who was caught standing idle. If I failed to obey\nthem to the letter, there was another one for my own back. In addition\nto this my duty was to call on and off the different gangs at the\nproper time. I had no regular periods of rest, and could never snatch\nbut a few moments of sleep at a time.\n\nIt is the custom in Louisiana, as I presume it is in other slave\nStates, to allow the slave to retain whatever compensation he may\nobtain for services performed on Sundays. In this way, only, are they\nable to provide themselves with any luxury or convenience whatever.\nWhen a slave, purchased, or kidnapped in the North, is transported to\na cabin on Bayou Boeuf he is furnished with neither knife, nor fork,\nnor dish, nor kettle, nor any other thing in the shape of crockery, or\nfurniture of any nature or description. He is furnished with a blanket\nbefore he reaches there, and wrapping that around him, he can either\nstand up, or lie down upon the ground, or on a board, if his master\nhas no use for it. He is at liberty to find a gourd in which to keep\nhis meal, or he can eat his corn from the cob, just as he pleases.\nTo ask the master for a knife, or skillet, or any small convenience\nof the kind, would be answered with a kick, or laughed at as a joke.\nWhatever necessary article of this nature is found in a cabin has been\npurchased with Sunday money. However injurious to the morals, it is\ncertainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave, to be\npermitted to break the Sabbath. Otherwise there would be no way to\nprovide himself with any utensils, which seem to be indispensable to\nhim who is compelled to be his own cook.\n\nOn cane plantations in sugar time, there is no distinction as to\nthe days of the week. It is well understood that all hands must\nlabor on the Sabbath, and it is equally well understood that those\nespecially who are hired, as I was to Judge Turner, and others in\nsucceeding years, shall receive remuneration for it. It is usual,\nalso, in the most hurrying time of cotton-picking, to require the\nsame extra service. From this source, slaves generally are afforded\nan opportunity of earning sufficient to purchase a knife, a kettle,\ntobacco and so forth. The females, discarding the latter luxury, are\napt to expend their little revenue in the purchase of gaudy ribbons,\nwherewithal to deck their hair in the merry season of the holidays.\n\nI remained in St. Mary's until the first of January, during which\ntime my Sunday money amounted to ten dollars. I met with other\ngood fortune, for which I was indebted to my violin, my constant\ncompanion, the source of profit, and soother of my sorrows during\nyears of servitude. There was a grand party of whites assembled at\nMr. Yarney's, in Centreville, a hamlet in the vicinity of Turner's\nplantation. I was employed to play for them, and so well pleased were\nthe merry-makers with my performance, that a contribution was taken\nfor my benefit, which amounted to seventeen dollars.\n\nWith this sum in possession, I was looked upon by my fellows as a\nmillionaire. It afforded me great pleasure to look at it--to count\nit over and over again, day after day. Visions of cabin furniture,\nof water pails, of pocket knives, new shoes and coats and hats,\nfloated through my fancy, and up through all rose the triumphant\ncontemplation, that I was the wealthiest \"nigger\" on Bayou Boeuf.\n\nVessels run up the Rio Teche to Centreville. While there, I was bold\nenough one day to present myself before the captain of a steamer, and\nbeg permission to hide myself among the freight. I was emboldened to\nrisk the hazard of such a step, from overhearing a conversation, in\nthe course of which I ascertained he was a native of the North. I did\nnot relate to him the particulars of my history, but only expressed\nan ardent desire to escape from slavery to a free State. He pitied\nme, but said it would be impossible to avoid the vigilant custom\nhouse officers in New-Orleans, and that detection would subject him\nto punishment, and his vessel to confiscation. My earnest entreaties\nevidently excited his sympathies, and doubtless he would have yielded\nto them, could he have done so with any kind of safety. I was\ncompelled to smother the sudden flame that lighted up my bosom with\nsweet hopes of liberation, and turn my steps once more towards the\nincreasing darkness of despair.\n\nImmediately after this event the drove assembled at Centreville, and\nseveral of the owners having arrived and collected the monies due\nfor our services, we were driven back to Bayou Boeuf. It was on our\nreturn, while passing through a small village, that I caught sight of\nTibeats, seated in the door of a dirty grocery, looking somewhat seedy\nand out of repair. Passion and poor whisky, I doubt not, have ere this\nlaid him on the shelf.\n\nDuring our absence, I learned from Aunt Phebe and Patsey, that the\nlatter had been getting deeper and deeper into trouble. The poor\ngirl was truly an object of pity. \"Old Hogjaw,\" the name by which\nEpps was called, when the slaves were by themselves, had beaten her\nmore severely and frequently than ever. As surely as he came from\nHolmesville, elated with liquor--and it was often in those days--he\nwould whip her, merely to gratify the mistress; would punish her to\nan extent almost beyond endurance, for an offence of which he himself\nwas the sole and irresistible cause. In his sober moments he could not\nalways be prevailed upon to indulge his wife's insatiable thirst for\nvengeance.\n\nTo be rid of Patsey--to place her beyond sight or reach, by sale, or\ndeath, or in any other manner, of late years, seemed to be the ruling\nthought and passion of my mistress. Patsey had been a favorite when a\nchild, even in the great house. She had been petted and admired for\nher uncommon sprightliness and pleasant disposition. She had been\nfed many a time, so Uncle Abram said, even on biscuit and milk, when\nthe madam, in her younger days, was wont to call her to the piazza,\nand fondle her as she would a playful Kitten. But a sad change had\ncome over the spirit of the woman. Now, only black and angry fiends\nministered in the temple of her heart, until she could look on Patsey\nbut with concentrated venom.\n\nMistress Epps was not naturally such an evil woman, after all. She was\npossessed of the devil, jealousy, it is true, but aside from that,\nthere was much in her character to admire. Her father, Mr. Roberts,\nresided in Cheneyville, an influential and honorable man, and as\nmuch respected throughout the parish as any other citizen. She had\nbeen well educated at some institution this side the Mississippi;\nwas beautiful, accomplished, and usually good-humored. She was kind\nto all of us but Patsey--frequently, in the absence of her husband,\nsending out to us some little dainty from her own table. In other\nsituations--in a different society from that which exists on the\nshores of Bayou Boeuf, she would have been pronounced an elegant and\nfascinating woman. An ill wind it was that blew her into the arms of\nEpps.\n\nHe respected and loved his wife as much as a coarse nature like his\nis capable of loving, but supreme selfishness always overmastered\nconjugal affection.\n\n  \"He loved as well as baser natures can,\n  But a mean heart and soul were in that man.\"\n\nHe was ready to gratify any whim--to grant any request she made,\nprovided it did not cost too much. Patsey was equal to any two of his\nslaves in the cotton field. He could not replace her with the same\nmoney she would bring. The idea of disposing of her, therefore, could\nnot be entertained. The mistress did not regard her at all in that\nlight. The pride of the haughty woman was aroused; the blood of the\nfiery southern boiled at the sight of Patsey, and nothing less than\ntrampling out the life of the helpless bondwoman would satisfy her.\n\nSometimes the current of her wrath turned upon him whom she had\njust cause to hate. But the storm of angry words would pass over at\nlength, and there would be a season of calm again. At such times\nPatsey trembled with fear, and cried as if her heart would break,\nfor she knew from painful experience, that if mistress should work\nherself to the red-hot pitch of rage, Epps would quiet her at last\nwith a promise that Patsey should be flogged--a promise he was sure\nto keep. Thus did pride, and jealousy, and vengeance war with\navarice and brute-passion in the mansion of my master, filling it\nwith daily tumult and contention. Thus, upon the head of Patsey--the\nsimple-minded slave, in whose heart God had implanted the seeds of\nvirtue--the force of all these domestic tempests spent itself at last.\n\nDuring the summer succeeding my return from St. Mary's parish, I\nconceived a plan of providing myself with food, which, though simple,\nsucceeded beyond expectation. It has been followed by many others\nin my condition, up and down the bayou, and of such benefit has it\nbecome that I am almost persuaded to look upon myself as a benefactor.\nThat summer the worms got into the bacon. Nothing but ravenous hunger\ncould induce us to swallow it. The weekly allowance of meal scarcely\nsufficed to satisfy us. It was customary with us, as it is with all in\nthat region, where the allowance is exhausted before Saturday night,\nor is in such a state as to render it nauseous and disgusting, to\nhunt in the swamps for coon and opossum. This, however, must be done\nat night, after the day's work is accomplished. There are planters\nwhose slaves, for months at a time, have no other meat than such as is\nobtained in this manner. No objections are made to hunting, inasmuch\nas it dispenses with drafts upon the smoke-house, and because every\nmarauding coon that is killed is so much saved from the standing corn.\nThey are hunted with dogs and clubs, slaves not being allowed the use\nof fire-arms.\n\nThe flesh of the coon is palatable, but verily there is nothing in\nall butcherdom so delicious as a roasted 'possum. They are a round,\nrather long-bodied, little animal, of a whitish color, with nose like\na pig, and caudal extremity like a rat. They burrow among the roots\nand in the hollows of the gum tree, and are clumsy and slow of motion.\nThey are deceitful and cunning creatures. On receiving the slightest\ntap of a stick, they will roll over on the ground and feign death. If\nthe hunter leaves him, in pursuit of another, without first taking\nparticular pains to break his neck, the chances are, on his return, he\nis not to be found. The little animal has out witted the enemy--has\n\"played 'possum\"--and is off. But after a long and hard day's work,\nthe weary slave feels little like going to the swamp for his supper,\nand half the time prefers throwing himself on the cabin floor without\nit. It is for the interest of the master that the servant should not\nsuffer in health from starvation, and it is also for his interest that\nhe should not become gross from over-feeding. In the estimation of the\nowner, a slave is the most serviceable when in rather a lean and lank\ncondition, such a condition as the race-horse is in, when fitted for\nthe course, and in that condition they are generally to be found on\nthe sugar and cotton plantations along Red River.\n\nMy cabin was within a few rods of the bayou bank, and necessity\nbeing indeed the mother of invention, I resolved upon a mode of\nobtaining the requisite amount of food, without the trouble of\nresorting nightly to the woods. This was to construct a fish trap.\nHaving, in my mind, conceived the manner in which it could be done,\nthe next Sunday I set about putting it into practical execution. It\nmay be impossible for me to convey to the reader a full and correct\nidea of its construction, but the following will serve as a general\ndescription:\n\nA frame between two and three feet square is made, and of a greater\nor less height, according to the depth of water. Boards or slats are\nnailed on three sides of this frame, not so closely, however, as to\nprevent the water circulating freely through it. A door is fitted\ninto the fourth side, in such manner that it will slide easily up\nand down in the grooves cut in the two posts. A movable bottom is\nthen so fitted that it can be raised to the top of the frame without\ndifficulty. In the centre of the movable bottom an auger hole is\nbored, and into this one end of a handle or round stick is fastened\non the under side so loosely that it will turn. The handle ascends\nfrom the centre of the movable bottom to the top of the frame, or as\nmuch higher as is desirable. Up and down this handle, in a great many\nplaces, are gimlet holes, through which small sticks are inserted,\nextending to opposite sides of the frame. So many of these small\nsticks are running out from the handle in all directions, that a fish\nof any considerable dimensions cannot pass through without hitting one\nof them. The frame is then placed in the water and made stationary.\n\nThe trap is \"set\" by sliding or drawing up the door, and kept in that\nposition by another stick, one end of which rests in a notch on the\ninner side, the other end in a notch made in the handle, running up\nfrom the centre of the movable bottom. The trap is baited by rolling\na handful of wet meal and cotton together until it becomes hard, and\ndepositing it in the back part of the frame. A fish swimming through\nthe upraised door towards the bait, necessarily strikes one of the\nsmall sticks turning the handle, which displacing the stick supporting\nthe door, the latter falls, securing the fish within the frame. Taking\nhold of the top of the handle, the movable bottom is then drawn up to\nthe surface of the water, and the fish taken out. There may have been\nother such traps in use before mine was constructed, but if there were\nI had never happened to see one. Bayou Boeuf abounds in fish of large\nsize and excellent quality, and after this time I was very rarely in\nwant of one for myself, or for my comrades. Thus a mine was opened--a\nnew resource was developed, hitherto unthought of by the enslaved\nchildren of Africa, who toil and hunger along the shores of that\nsluggish, but prolific stream.\n\nAbout the time of which I am now writing, an event occurred in our\nimmediate neighborhood, which made a deep impression upon me, and\nwhich shows the state of society existing there, and the manner in\nwhich affronts are oftentimes avenged. Directly opposite our quarters,\non the other side of the bayou, was situated the plantation of\nMr. Marshall. He belonged to a family among the most wealthy and\naristocratic in the country. A gentleman from the vicinity of Natchez\nhad been negotiating with him for the purchase of the estate. One\nday a messenger came in great haste to our plantation, saying that a\nbloody and fearful battle was going on at Marshall's--that blood had\nbeen spilled--and unless the combatants were forthwith separated, the\nresult would be disastrous.\n\nOn repairing to Marshall's house, a scene presented itself that\nbeggars description. On the floor of one of the rooms lay the ghastly\ncorpse of the man from Natchez, while Marshall, enraged and covered\nwith wounds and blood, was stalking back and forth, \"breathing out\nthreatenings and slaughter.\" A difficulty had arisen in the course of\ntheir negotiation, high words ensued, when drawing their weapons, the\ndeadly strife began that ended so unfortunately. Marshall was never\nplaced in confinement. A sort of trial or investigation was had at\nMarksville, when he was acquitted, and returned to his plantation,\nrather more respected, as I thought, than ever, from the fact that the\nblood of a fellow being was on his soul.\n\nEpps interested himself in his behalf, accompanying him to Marksville,\nand on all occasions loudly justifying him, but his services in this\nrespect did not afterwards deter a kinsman of this same Marshall\nfrom seeking his life also. A brawl occurred between them over a\ngambling-table, which terminated in a deadly feud. Riding up on\nhorseback in front of the house one day, armed with pistols and\nbowie knife, Marshall challenged him to come forth and make a final\nsettlement of the quarrel, or he would brand him as a coward, and\nshoot him like a dog the first opportunity. Not through cowardice,\nnor from any conscientious scruples, in my opinion, but through the\ninfluence of his wife, he was restrained from accepting the challenge\nof his enemy. A reconciliation, however, was effected afterward, since\nwhich time they have been on terms of the closest intimacy.\n\nSuch occurrences, which would bring upon the parties concerned in them\nmerited and condign punishment in the Northern States, are frequent on\nthe bayou, and pass without notice, and almost without comment. Every\nman carries his bowie knife, and when two fall out, they set to work\nhacking and thrusting at each other, more like savages than civilized\nand enlightened beings.\n\nThe existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them, has a\ntendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature.\nDaily witnesses of human suffering--listening to the agonizing\nscreeches of the slave--beholding him writhing beneath the merciless\nlash--bitten and torn by dogs--dying without attention, and buried\nwithout shroud or coffin--it cannot otherwise be expected, than\nthat they should become brutified and reckless of human life. It\nis true there are many kind-hearted and good men in the parish of\nAvoyelles--such men as William Ford--who can look with pity upon\nthe sufferings of a slave, just as there are, over all the world,\nsensitive and sympathetic spirits, who cannot look with indifference\nupon the sufferings of any creature which the Almighty has endowed\nwith life. It is not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel, so\nmuch as it is the fault of the system under which he lives. He cannot\nwithstand the influence of habit and associations that surround him.\nTaught from earliest childhood, by all that he sees and hears, that\nthe rod is for the slave's back, he will not be apt to change his\nopinions in maturer years.\n\nThere may be humane masters, as there certainly are inhuman\nones--there may be slaves well-clothed, well-fed, and happy, as there\nsurely are those half-clad, half-starved and miserable; nevertheless,\nthe institution that tolerates such wrong and inhumanity as I have\nwitnessed, is a cruel, unjust, and barbarous one. Men may write\nfictions portraying lowly life as it is, or as it is not--may\nexpatiate with owlish gravity upon the bliss of ignorance--discourse\nflippantly from arm chairs of the pleasures of slave life; but let\nthem toil with him in the field--sleep with him in the cabin--feed\nwith him on husks; let them behold him scourged, hunted, trampled\non, and they will come back with another story in their mouths.\nLet them know the _heart_ of the poor slave--learn his secret\nthoughts--thoughts he dare not utter in the hearing of the white man;\nlet them sit by him in the silent watches of the night--converse with\nhim in trustful confidence, of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness,\" and they will find that ninety-nine out of every hundred\nare intelligent enough to understand their situation, and to cherish\nin their bosoms the love of freedom, as passionately as themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n  LABORS ON SUGAR PLANTATIONS--THE MODE OF PLANTING CANE--OF\n  HOEING CANE--CANE RICKS--CUTTING CANE--DESCRIPTION OF THE CANE\n  KNIFE--WINROWING--PREPARING FOR SUCCEEDING CROPS--DESCRIPTION OF\n  HAWKINS' SUGAR MILL ON BAYOU BOEUF--THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS--THE\n  CARNIVAL SEASON OF THE CHILDREN OF BONDAGE--THE CHRISTMAS\n  SUPPER--RED, THE FAVORITE COLOR--THE VIOLIN, AND THE CONSOLATION IT\n  AFFORDED--THE CHRISTMAS DANCE--LIVELY, THE COQUETTE--SAM ROBERTS, AND\n  HIS RIVALS--SLAVE SONGS--SOUTHERN LIFE AS IT IS--THREE DAYS IN THE\n  YEAR--THE SYSTEM OF MARRIAGE--UNCLE ABRAM'S CONTEMPT OF MATRIMONY.\n\n\nIn consequence of my inability in cotton-picking, Epps was in the\nhabit of hiring me out on sugar plantations during the season of\ncane-cutting and sugar-making. He received for my services a dollar\na day, with the money supplying my place on his cotton plantation.\nCutting cane was an employment that suited me, and for three\nsuccessive years I held the lead row at Hawkins', leading a gang of\nfrom fifty to an hundred hands.\n\nIn a previous chapter the mode of cultivating cotton is described.\nThis may be the proper place to speak of the manner of cultivating\ncane.\n\nThe ground is prepared in beds, the same as it is prepared for the\nreception of the cotton seed, except it is ploughed deeper. Drills\nare made in the same manner. Planting commences in January, and\ncontinues until April. It is necessary to plant a sugar field only\nonce in three years. Three crops are taken before the seed or plant is\nexhausted.\n\nThree gangs are employed in the operation. One draws the cane from the\nrick, or stack, cutting the top and flags from the stalk, leaving only\nthat part which is sound and healthy. Each joint of the cane has an\neye, like the eye of a potato, which sends forth a sprout when buried\nin the soil. Another gang lays the cane in the drill, placing two\nstalks side by side in such manner that joints will occur once in four\nor six inches. The third gang follows with hoes, drawing earth upon\nthe stalks, and covering them to the depth, of three inches.\n\nIn four weeks, at the farthest, the sprouts appear above the ground,\nand from this time forward grow with great rapidity. A sugar field is\nhoed three times, the same as cotton, save that a greater quantity of\nearth is drawn to the roots. By the first of August hoeing is usually\nover. About the middle of September, whatever is required for seed is\ncut and stacked in ricks, as they are termed. In October it is ready\nfor the mill or sugar-house, and then the general cutting begins. The\nblade of a cane-knife is fifteen inches long, three inches wide in the\nmiddle, and tapering towards the point and handle. The blade is thin,\nand in order to be at all serviceable must be kept very sharp. Every\nthird hand takes the lead of two others, one of whom is on each side\nof him. The lead hand, in the first place, with a blow of his knife\nshears the flags from the stalk. He next cuts off the top down as far\nas it is green. He must be careful to sever all the green from the\nripe part, inasmuch as the juice of the former sours the molasses, and\nrenders it unsalable. Then he severs the stalk at the root, and lays\nit directly behind him. His right and left hand companions lay their\nstalks, when cut in the same manner, upon his. To every three hands\nthere is a cart, which follows, and the stalks are thrown into it by\nthe younger slaves, when it is drawn to the sugar-house and ground.\n\nIf the planter apprehends a frost, the cane is winrowed. Winrowing is\nthe cutting the stalks at an early period and throwing them lengthwise\nin the water furrow in such a manner that the tops will cover the\nbutts of the stalks. They will remain in this condition three weeks or\na month without souring, and secure from frost. When the proper time\narrives, they are taken up, trimmed and carted to the sugar-house.\n\nIn the month of January the slaves enter the field again to prepare\nfor another crop. The ground is now strewn with the tops, and flags\ncut from the past year's cane. On a dry day fire is set to this\ncombustible refuse, which sweeps over the field, leaving it bare and\nclean, and ready for the hoes. The earth is loosened about the roots\nof the old stubble, and in process of time another crop springs up\nfrom the last year's seed. It is the same the year following; but the\nthird year the seed has exhausted its strength, and the field must be\nploughed and planted again. The second year the cane is sweeter and\nyields more than the first, and the third year more than the second.\n\nDuring the three seasons I labored on Hawkins' plantation, I was\nemployed a considerable portion of the time in the sugar-house. He is\ncelebrated as the producer of the finest variety of white sugar. The\nfollowing is a general description of his sugar-house and the process\nof manufacture:\n\nThe mill is an immense brick building, standing on the shore of the\nbayou. Running out from the building is an open shed, at least an\nhundred feet in length and forty or fifty feet in width. The boiler in\nwhich the steam is generated is situated outside the main building;\nthe machinery and engine rest on a brick pier, fifteen feet above\nthe floor, within the body of the building. The machinery turns two\ngreat iron rollers, between two and three feet in diameter and six\nor eight feet in length. They are elevated above the brick pier, and\nroll in towards each other. An endless carrier, made of chain and\nwood, like leathern belts used in small mills, extends from the iron\nrollers out of the main building and through the entire length of the\nopen shed. The carts in which the cane is brought from the field as\nfast as it is cut, are unloaded at the sides of the shed. All along\nthe endless carrier are ranged slave children, whose business it is\nto place the cane upon it, when it is conveyed through the shed into\nthe main building, where it falls between the rollers, is crushed, and\ndrops upon another carrier that conveys it out of the main building\nin an opposite direction, depositing it in the top of a chimney upon\na fire beneath, which consumes it. It is necessary to burn it in\nthis manner, because otherwise it would soon fill the building, and\nmore especially because it would soon sour and engender disease. The\njuice of the cane falls into a conductor underneath the iron rollers,\nand is carried into a reservoir. Pipes convey it from thence into\nfive filterers, holding several hogsheads each. These filterers are\nfilled with bone-black, a substance resembling pulverized charcoal.\nIt is made of bones calcinated in close vessels, and is used for the\npurpose of decolorizing, by filtration, the cane juice before boiling.\nThrough these five filterers it passes in succession, and then runs\ninto a large reservoir underneath the ground floor, from whence it is\ncarried up, by means of a steam pump, into a clarifier made of sheet\niron, where it is heated by steam until it boils. From the first\nclarifier it is carried in pipes to a second and a third, and thence\ninto close iron pans, through which tubes pass, filled with steam.\nWhile in a boiling state it flows through three pans in succession,\nand is then carried in other pipes down to the coolers on the ground\nfloor. Coolers are wooden boxes with sieve bottoms made of the finest\nwire. As soon as the syrup passes into the coolers, and is met by the\nair, it grains, and the molasses at once escapes through the sieves\ninto a cistern below. It is then white or loaf sugar of the finest\nkind--clear, clean, and as white as snow. When cool, it is taken out,\npacked in hogsheads, and is ready for market. The molasses is then\ncarried from the cistern into the upper story again, and by another\nprocess converted into brown sugar.\n\nThere are larger mills, and those constructed differently from the one\nthus imperfectly described, but none, perhaps, more celebrated than\nthis anywhere on Bayou Boeuf. Lambert, of New-Orleans, is a partner of\nHawkins. He is a man of vast wealth, holding, as I have been told, an\ninterest in over forty different sugar plantations in Louisiana.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe only respite from constant labor the slave has through the whole\nyear, is during the Christmas holidays. Epps allowed us three--others\nallow four, five and six days, according to the measure of their\ngenerosity. It is the only time to which they look forward with any\ninterest or pleasure. They are glad when night comes, not only because\nit brings them a few hours repose, but because it brings them one day\nnearer Christmas. It is hailed with equal delight by the old and the\nyoung; even Uncle Abram ceases to glorify Andrew Jackson, and Patsey\nforgets her many sorrows, amid the general hilarity of the holidays.\nIt is the time of feasting, and frolicking, and fiddling--the carnival\nseason with the children of bondage. They are the only days when they\nare allowed a little restricted liberty, and heartily indeed do they\nenjoy it.\n\nIt is the custom for one planter to give a \"Christmas supper,\"\ninviting the slaves from neighboring plantations to join his own on\nthe occasion; for instance, one year it is given by Epps, the next\nby Marshall, the next by Hawkins, and so on. Usually from three to\nfive hundred are assembled, coming together on foot, in carts, on\nhorseback, on mules, riding double and triple, sometimes a boy and\ngirl, at others a girl and two boys, and at others again a boy, a girl\nand an old woman. Uncle Abram astride a mule, with Aunt Phebe and\nPatsey behind him, trotting towards a Christmas supper, would be no\nuncommon sight on Bayou Boeuf.\n\nThen, too, \"of all days i' the year,\" they array themselves in their\nbest attire. The cotton coat has been washed clean, the stump of a\ntallow candle has been applied to the shoes, and if so fortunate as\nto possess a rimless or a crownless hat, it is placed jauntily on the\nhead. They are welcomed with equal cordiality, however, if they come\nbare-headed and barefooted to the feast. As a general thing, the women\nwear handkerchiefs tied about their heads, but if chance has thrown in\ntheir way a fiery red ribbon, or a cast-off bonnet of their mistress'\ngrandmother, it is sure to be worn on such occasions. Red--the deep\nblood red--is decidedly the favorite color among the enslaved damsels\nof my acquaintance. If a red ribbon does not encircle the neck, you\nwill be certain to find all the hair of their woolly heads tied up\nwith red strings of one sort or another.\n\nThe table is spread in the open air, and loaded with varieties of\nmeat and piles of vegetables. Bacon and corn meal at such times are\ndispensed with. Sometimes the cooking is performed in the kitchen on\nthe plantation, at others in the shade of wide branching trees. In\nthe latter case, a ditch is dug in the ground, and wood laid in and\nburned until it is filled with glowing coals, over which chickens,\nducks, turkeys, pigs, and not unfrequently the entire body of a wild\nox, are roasted. They are furnished also with flour, of which biscuits\nare made, and often with peach and other preserves, with tarts, and\nevery manner and description of pies, except the mince, that being an\narticle of pastry as yet unknown among them. Only the slave who has\nlived all the years on his scanty allowance of meal and bacon, can\nappreciate such suppers. White people in great numbers assemble to\nwitness the gastronomical enjoyments.\n\nThey seat themselves at the rustic table--the males on one side, the\nfemales on the other. The two between whom there may have been an\nexchange of tenderness, invariably manage to sit opposite; for the\nomnipresent Cupid disdains not to hurl his arrows into the simple\nhearts of slaves. Unalloyed and exulting happiness lights up the dark\nfaces of them all. The ivory teeth, contrasting with their black\ncomplexions, exhibit two long, white streaks the whole extent of\nthe table. All round the bountiful board a multitude of eyes roll\nin ecstacy. Giggling and laughter and the clattering of cutlery\nand crockery succeed. Cuffee's elbow hunches his neighbor's side,\nimpelled by an involuntary impulse of delight; Nelly shakes her finger\nat Sambo and laughs, she knows not why, and so the fun and merriment\nflows on.\n\nWhen the viands have disappeared, and the hungry maws of the children\nof toil are satisfied, then, next in the order of amusement, is\nthe Christmas dance. My business on these gala days always was\nto play on the violin. The African race is a music-loving one,\nproverbially; and many there were among my fellow-bondsmen whose\norgans of tune were strikingly developed, and who could thumb the\nbanjo with dexterity; but at the expense of appearing egotistical,\nI must, nevertheless, declare, that I was considered the Ole Bull\nof Bayou Boeuf. My master often received letters, sometimes from a\ndistance of ten miles, requesting him to send me to play at a ball or\nfestival of the whites. He received his compensation, and usually I\nalso returned with many picayunes jingling in my pockets--the extra\ncontributions of those to whose delight I had administered. In this\nmanner I became more acquainted than I otherwise would, up and down\nthe bayou. The young men and maidens of Holmesville always knew there\nwas to be a jollification somewhere, whenever Platt Epps was seen\npassing through the town with his fiddle in his hand. \"Where are you\ngoing now, Platt?\" and \"What is coming off to-night, Platt?\" would be\ninterrogatories issuing from every door and window, and many a time\nwhen there was no special hurry, yielding to pressing importunities,\nPlatt would draw his bow, and sitting astride his mule, perhaps,\ndiscourse musically to a crowd of delighted children, gathered around\nhim in the street.\n\nAlas! had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can\nconceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It\nintroduced me to great houses--relieved me of many days' labor in the\nfield--supplied me with conveniences for my cabin--with pipes and\ntobacco, and extra pairs of shoes, and oftentimes led me away from the\npresence of a hard master, to witness scenes of jollity and mirth. It\nwas my companion--the friend of my bosom--triumphing loudly when I was\njoyful, and uttering its soft, melodious consolations when I was sad.\nOften, at midnight, when sleep had fled affrighted from the cabin, and\nmy soul was disturbed and troubled with the contemplation of my fate,\nit would sing me a song of peace. On holy Sabbath days, when an hour\nor two of leisure was allowed, it would accompany me to some quiet\nplace on the bayou bank, and, lifting up its voice, discourse kindly\nand pleasantly indeed. It heralded my name round the country--made me\nfriends, who, otherwise would not have noticed me--gave me an honored\nseat at the yearly feasts, and secured the loudest and heartiest\nwelcome of them all at the Christmas dance. The Christmas dance! Oh,\nye pleasure-seeking sons and daughters of idleness, who move with\nmeasured step, listless and snail-like, through the slow-winding\ncotillon, if ye wish to look upon the celerity, if not the \"poetry of\nmotion\"--upon genuine happiness, rampant and unrestrained--go down to\nLouisiana, and see the slaves dancing in the starlight of a Christmas\nnight.\n\nOn that particular Christmas I have now in my mind, a description\nwhereof will serve as a description of the day generally, Miss Lively\nand Mr. Sam, the first belonging to Stewart, the latter to Roberts,\nstarted the ball. It was well known that Sam cherished an ardent\npassion for Lively, as also did one of Marshall's and another of\nCarey's boys; for Lively was _lively_ indeed, and a heart-breaking\ncoquette withal. It was a victory for Sam Roberts, when, rising from\nthe repast, she gave him her hand for the first \"figure\" in preference\nto either of his rivals. They were somewhat crest-fallen, and, shaking\ntheir heads angrily, rather intimated they would like to pitch into\nMr. Sam and hurt him badly. But not an emotion of wrath ruffled the\nplacid bosom of Samuel, as his legs flew like drum-sticks down the\noutside and up the middle, by the side of his bewitching partner.\nThe whole company cheered them vociferously, and, excited with the\napplause, they continued \"tearing down\" after all the others had\nbecome exhausted and halted a moment to recover breath. But Sam's\nsuperhuman exertions overcame him finally, leaving Lively alone, yet\nwhirling like a top. Thereupon one of Sam's rivals, Pete Marshall,\ndashed in, and, with might and main, leaped and shuffled and threw\nhimself into every conceivable shape, as if determined to show Miss\nLively and all the world that Sam Roberts was of no account.\n\nPete's affection, however, was greater than his discretion. Such\nviolent exercise took the breath out of him directly, and he dropped\nlike an empty bag. Then was the time for Harry Carey to try his hand;\nbut Lively also soon out-winded him, amidst hurrahs and shouts, fully\nsustaining her well-earned reputation of being the \"fastest gal\" on\nthe bayou.\n\nOne \"set\" off, another takes its place, he or she remaining longest\non the floor receiving the most uproarious commendation, and so the\ndancing continues until broad daylight. It does not cease with the\nsound of the fiddle, but in that case they set up a music peculiar to\nthemselves. This is called \"patting,\" accompanied with one of those\nunmeaning songs, composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune\nor measure, than for the purpose of expressing any distinct idea. The\npatting is performed by striking the hands on the knees, then striking\nthe hands together, then striking the right shoulder with one hand,\nthe left with the other--all the while keeping time with the feet, and\nsinging, perhaps, this song:\n\n        \"Harper's creek and roarin' ribber,\n        Thar, my dear, we'll live forebber;\n        Den we'll go to de Ingin nation,\n        All I want in dis creation,\n        Is pretty little wife and big plantation.\n\n    _Chorus._ Up dat oak and down dat ribber,\n                     Two overseers and one little nigger.\"\n\nOr, if these words are not adapted to the tune called for, it may be\nthat \"Old Hog Eye\" _is_--a rather solemn and startling specimen of\nversification, not, however, to be appreciated unless heard at the\nSouth. It runneth as follows:\n\n    \"Who's been here since I've been gone?\n    Pretty little gal wid a josey on.\n\n                            Hog Eye!\n                            Old Hog Eye,\n                            And Hosey too!\n\n    Never see de like since I was born,\n    Here come a little gal wid a josey on.\n\n                            Hog Eye!\n                            Old Hog Eye!\n                            And Hosey too!\"\n\nOr, may be the following, perhaps, equally nonsensical, but full of\nmelody, nevertheless, as it flows from the negro's mouth:\n\n    \"Ebo Dick and Jurdan's Jo,\n    Them two niggers stole my yo'.\n\n        _Chorus._ Hop Jim along,\n                        Walk Jim along,\n                        Talk Jim along,\" &c.\n\n    Old black Dan, as black as tar,\n    He dam glad he was not dar.\n\n                        Hop Jim along,\" &c.\n\nDuring the remaining holidays succeeding Christmas, they are provided\nwith passes, and permitted to go where they please within a limited\ndistance, or they may remain and labor on the plantation, in which\ncase they are paid for it. It is very rarely, however, that the latter\nalternative is accepted. They may be seen at these times hurrying in\nall directions, as happy looking mortals as can be found on the face\nof the earth. They are different beings from what they are in the\nfield; the temporary relaxation, the brief deliverance from fear, and\nfrom the lash, producing an entire metamorphosis in their appearance\nand demeanor. In visiting, riding, renewing old friendships, or,\nperchance, reviving some old attachment, or pursuing whatever pleasure\nmay suggest itself, the time is occupied. Such is \"southern life as it\nis,\" _three days in the year_, as I found it--the other three hundred\nand sixty-two being days of weariness, and fear, and suffering, and\nunremitting labor.\n\nMarriage is frequently contracted during the holidays, if such an\ninstitution may be said to exist among them. The only ceremony\nrequired before entering into that \"holy estate,\" is to obtain the\nconsent of the respective owners. It is usually encouraged by the\nmasters of female slaves. Either party can have as many husbands or\nwives as the owner will permit, and either is at liberty to discard\nthe other at pleasure. The law in relation to divorce, or to bigamy,\nand so forth, is not applicable to property, of course. If the wife\ndoes not belong on the same plantation with the husband, the latter\nis permitted to visit her on Saturday nights, if the distance is not\ntoo far. Uncle Abram's wife lived seven miles from Epps', on Bayou\nHuff Power. He had permission to visit her once a fortnight, but he\nwas growing old, as has been said, and truth to say, had latterly\nwell nigh forgotten her. Uncle Abram had no time to spare from his\nmeditations on General Jackson--connubial dalliance being well enough\nfor the young and thoughtless, but unbecoming a grave and solemn\nphilosopher like himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n  OVERSEERS--HOW THEY ARE ARMED AND ACCOMPANIED--THE HOMICIDE--HIS\n  EXECUTION AT MARKSVILLE--SLAVE-DRIVERS--APPOINTED DRIVER ON REMOVING\n  TO BAYOU BOEUF--PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT--EPPS' ATTEMPT TO CUT PLATT'S\n  THROAT--THE ESCAPE FROM HIM--PROTECTED BY THE MISTRESS--FORBIDS\n  READING AND WRITING--OBTAIN A SHEET OF PAPER AFTER NINE YEARS'\n  EFFORT--THE LETTER--ARMSBY, THE MEAN WHITE--PARTIALLY CONFIDE IN\n  HIM--HIS TREACHERY--EPPS' SUSPICIONS--HOW THEY WERE QUIETED--BURNING\n  THE LETTER--ARMSBY LEAVES THE BAYOU--DISAPPOINTMENT AND DESPAIR.\n\n\nWith the exception of my trip to St. Mary's parish, and my absence\nduring the cane-cutting seasons, I was constantly employed on the\nplantation of Master Epps. He was considered but a small planter,\nnot having a sufficient number of hands to require the services of\nan overseer, acting in the latter capacity himself. Not able to\nincrease his force, it was his custom to hire during the hurry of\ncotton-picking.\n\nOn larger estates, employing fifty or a hundred, or perhaps two\nhundred hands, an overseer is deemed indispensable. These gentlemen\nride into the field on horseback, without an exception, to my\nknowledge, armed with pistols, bowie knife, whip, and accompanied\nby several dogs. They follow, equipped in this fashion, in rear of\nthe slaves, keeping a sharp lookout upon them all. The requisite\nqualifications in an overseer are utter heartlessness, brutality and\ncruelty. It is his business to produce large crops, and if that is\naccomplished, no matter what amount of suffering it may have cost.\nThe presence of the dogs are necessary to overhaul a fugitive who may\ntake to his heels, as is sometimes the case, when faint or sick, he is\nunable to maintain his row, and unable, also, to endure the whip. The\npistols are reserved for any dangerous emergency, there having been\ninstances when such weapons were necessary. Goaded into uncontrollable\nmadness, even the slave will sometimes turn upon his oppressor. The\ngallows were standing at Marksville last January, upon which one was\nexecuted a year ago for killing his overseer. It occurred not many\nmiles from Epps' plantation on Red River. The slave was given his task\nat splitting rails. In the course of the day the overseer sent him on\nan errand, which occupied so much time that it was not possible for\nhim to perform the task. The next day he was called to an account, but\nthe loss of time occasioned by the errand was no excuse, and he was\nordered to kneel and bare his back for the reception of the lash. They\nwere in the woods alone--beyond the reach of sight or hearing. The boy\nsubmitted until maddened at such injustice, and insane with pain, he\nsprang to his feet, and seizing an axe, literally chopped the overseer\nin pieces. He made no attempt whatever at concealment, but hastening\nto his master, related the whole affair, and declared himself ready\nto expiate the wrong by the sacrifice of his life. He was led to\nthe scaffold, and while the rope was around his neck, maintained an\nundismayed and fearless bearing, and with his last words justified the\nact.\n\nBesides the overseer, there are drivers under him, the number being in\nproportion to the number of hands in the field. The drivers are black,\nwho, in addition to the performance of their equal share of work, are\ncompelled to do the whipping of their several gangs. Whips hang around\ntheir necks, and if they fail to use them thoroughly, are whipped\nthemselves. They have a few privileges, however; for example, in\ncane-cutting the hands are not allowed to sit down long enough to eat\ntheir dinners. Carts filled with corn cake, cooked at the kitchen, are\ndriven into the field at noon. The cake is distributed by the drivers,\nand must be eaten with the least possible delay.\n\nWhen the slave ceases to perspire, as he often does when taxed beyond\nhis strength, he falls to the ground and becomes entirely helpless.\nIt is then the duty of the driver to drag him into the shade of the\nstanding cotton or cane, or of a neighboring tree, where he dashes\nbuckets of water upon him, and uses other means of bringing out\nperspiration again, when he is ordered to his place, and compelled to\ncontinue his labor.\n\nAt Huff Power, when I first came to Epps', Tom, one of Roberts'\nnegroes, was driver. He was a burly fellow, and severe in the\nextreme. After Epps' removal to Bayou Boeuf, that distinguished\nhonor was conferred upon myself. Up to the time of my departure I\nhad to wear a whip about my neck in the field. If Epps was present,\nI dared not show any lenity, not having the Christian fortitude of\na certain well-known Uncle Tom sufficiently to brave his wrath, by\nrefusing to perform the office. In that way, only, I escaped the\nimmediate martyrdom he suffered, and, withal, saved my companions\nmuch suffering, as it proved in the end. Epps, I soon found, whether\nactually in the field or not, had his eyes pretty generally upon us.\nFrom the piazza, from behind some adjacent tree, or other concealed\npoint of observation, he was perpetually on the watch. If one of us\nhad been backward or idle through the day, we were apt to be told\nall about it on returning to the quarters, and as it was a matter of\nprinciple with him to reprove every offence of that kind that came\nwithin his knowledge, the offender not only was certain of receiving\na castigation for his tardiness, but I likewise was punished for\npermitting it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he had seen me use the lash freely, the man\nwas satisfied. \"Practice makes perfect,\" truly; and during my eight\nyears' experience as a driver, I learned to handle the whip with\nmarvelous dexterity and precision, throwing the lash within a hair's\nbreadth of the back, the ear, the nose, without, however, touching\neither of them. If Epps was observed at a distance, or we had reason\nto apprehend he was sneaking somewhere in the vicinity, I would\ncommence plying the lash vigorously, when, according to arrangement,\nthey would squirm and screech as if in agony, although not one of them\nhad in fact been even grazed. Patsey would take occasion, if he made\nhis appearance presently, to mumble in his hearing some complaints\nthat Platt was lashing them the whole time, and Uncle Abram, with an\nappearance of honesty peculiar to himself, would declare roundly I\nhad just whipped them worse than General Jackson whipped the enemy at\nNew-Orleans. If Epps was not drunk, and in one of his beastly humors,\nthis was, in general, satisfactory. If he was, some one or more of us\nmust suffer, as a matter of course. Sometimes his violence assumed a\ndangerous form, placing the lives of his human stock in jeopardy. On\none occasion the drunken madman thought to amuse himself by cutting my\nthroat.\n\nHe had been absent at Holmesville, in attendance at a shooting-match,\nand none of us were aware of his return. While hoeing by the side of\nPatsey, she exclaimed, in a low voice, suddenly, \"Platt, d'ye see old\nHog-Jaw beckoning me to come to him?\"\n\nGlancing sideways, I discovered him in the edge of the field,\nmotioning and grimacing, as was his habit when half-intoxicated. Aware\nof his lewd intentions, Patsey began to cry. I whispered her not to\nlook up, and to continue at her work, as if she had not observed him.\nSuspecting the truth of the matter, however, he soon staggered up to\nme in a great rage.\n\n\"What did you say to Pats?\" he demanded, with an oath. I made him some\nevasive answer, which only had the effect of increasing his violence.\n\n\"How long have you owned this plantation, _say_, you d----d nigger?\"\nhe inquired, with a malicious sneer, at the same time taking hold\nof my shirt collar with one hand, and thrusting the other into his\npocket. \"Now I'll cut your black throat; that's what I'll do,\" drawing\nhis knife from his pocket as he said it. But with one hand he was\nunable to open it, until finally seizing the blade in his teeth, I\nsaw he was about to succeed, and felt the necessity of escaping from\nhim, for in his present reckless state, it was evident he was not\njoking, by any means. My shirt was open in front, and as I turned\nround quickly and sprang from him, while he still retained his gripe,\nit was stripped entirely from my back. There was no difficulty now\nin eluding him. He would chase me until out of breath, then stop\nuntil it was recovered, swear, and renew the chase again. Now he\nwould command me to come to him, now endeavor to coax me, but I was\ncareful to keep at a respectful distance. In this manner we made the\ncircuit of the field several times, he making desperate plunges, and\nI always dodging them, more amused than frightened, well knowing that\nwhen his sober senses returned, he would laugh at his own drunken\nfolly. At length I observed the mistress standing by the yard fence,\nwatching our half-serious, half-comical manoeuvres. Shooting past him,\nI ran directly to her. Epps, on discovering her, did not follow. He\nremained about the field an hour or more, during which time I stood\nby the mistress, having related the particulars of what had taken\nplace. Now, _she_ was aroused again, denouncing her husband and Patsey\nabout equally. Finally, Epps came towards the house, by this time\nnearly sober, walking demurely, with his hands behind his back, and\nattempting to look as innocent as a child.\n\nAs he approached, nevertheless, Mistress Epps began to berate him\nroundly, heaping upon him many rather disrespectful epithets, and\ndemanding for what reason he had attempted to cut my throat. Epps\nmade wondrous strange of it all, and to my surprise, swore by all the\nsaints in the calendar he had not spoken to me that day.\n\n\"Platt, you lying nigger, _have_ I?\" was his brazen appeal to me.\n\nIt is not safe to contradict a master, even by the assertion of a\ntruth. So I was silent, and when he entered the house I returned to\nthe field, and the affair was never after alluded to.\n\nShortly after this time a circumstance occurred that came nigh\ndivulging the secret of my real name and history, which I had so long\nand carefully concealed, and upon which I was convinced depended my\nfinal escape. Soon after he purchased me, Epps asked me if I could\nwrite and read, and on being informed that I had received some\ninstruction in those branches of education, he assured me, with\nemphasis, if he ever caught me with a book, or with pen and ink, he\nwould give me a hundred lashes. He said he wanted me to understand\nthat he bought \"niggers\" to work and not to educate. He never inquired\na word of my past life, or from whence I came. The mistress, however,\ncross-examined me frequently about Washington, which she supposed was\nmy native city, and more than once remarked that I did not talk nor\nact like the other \"niggers,\" and she was sure I had seen more of the\nworld than I admitted.\n\nMy great object always was to invent means of getting a letter\nsecretly into the post-office, directed to some of my friends or\nfamily at the North. The difficulty of such an achievement cannot be\ncomprehended by one unacquainted with the severe restrictions imposed\nupon me. In the first place, I was deprived of pen, ink, and paper.\nIn the second place, a slave cannot leave his plantation without a\npass, nor will a post-master mail a letter for one without written\ninstructions from his owner. I was in slavery nine years, and always\nwatchful and on the alert, before I met with the good fortune of\nobtaining a sheet of paper. While Epps was in New-Orleans, one winter,\ndisposing of his cotton, the mistress sent me to Holmesville, with an\norder for several articles, and among the rest a quantity of foolscap.\nI appropriated a sheet, concealing it in the cabin, under the board on\nwhich I slept.\n\nAfter various experiments I succeeded in making ink, by boiling white\nmaple bark, and with a feather plucked from the wing of a duck,\nmanufactured a pen. When all were asleep in the cabin, by the light\nof the coals, lying upon my plank couch, I managed to complete a\nsomewhat lengthy epistle. It was directed to an old acquaintance at\nSandy Hill, stating my condition, and urging him to take measures to\nrestore me to liberty. This letter I kept a long time, contriving\nmeasures by which it could be safely deposited in the post-office. At\nlength, a low fellow, by the name of Armsby, hitherto a stranger, came\ninto the neighborhood, seeking a situation as overseer. He applied\nto Epps, and was about the plantation for several days. He next went\nover to Shaw's, near by, and remained with him several weeks. Shaw\nwas generally surrounded by such worthless characters, being himself\nnoted as a gambler and unprincipled man. He had made a wife of his\nslave Charlotte, and a brood of young mulattoes were growing up in his\nhouse. Armsby became so much reduced at last, that he was compelled\nto labor with the slaves. A white man working in the field is a rare\nand unusual spectacle on Bayou Boeuf. I improved every opportunity\nof cultivating his acquaintance privately, desiring to obtain his\nconfidence so far as to be willing to intrust the letter to his\nkeeping. He visited Marksville repeatedly, he informed me, a town some\ntwenty miles distant, and there, I proposed to myself, the letter\nshould be mailed.\n\nCarefully deliberating on the most proper manner of approaching him\non the subject, I concluded finally to ask him simply if he would\ndeposit a letter for me in the Marksville post-office the next time\nhe visited that place, without disclosing to him that the letter was\nwritten, or any of the particulars it contained; for I had fears that\nhe might betray me, and knew that some inducement must be held out to\nhim of a pecuniary nature, before it would be safe to confide in him.\nAs late as one o'clock one night I stole noiselessly from my cabin,\nand, crossing the field to Shaw's, found him sleeping on the piazza.\nI had but a few picayunes--the proceeds of my fiddling performances,\nbut all I had in the world I promised him if he would do me the\nfavor required. I begged him not to expose me if he could not grant\nthe request. He assured me, upon his honor, he would deposit it in\nthe Marksville post-office, and that he would keep it an inviolable\nsecret forever. Though the letter was in my pocket at the time, I\ndared not then deliver it to him, but stating I would have it written\nin a day or two, bade him good night, and returned to my cabin. It\nwas impossible for me to expel the suspicions I entertained, and all\nnight I lay awake, revolving in my mind the safest course to pursue. I\nwas willing to risk a great deal to accomplish my purpose, but should\nthe letter by any means fall into the hands of Epps, it would be a\ndeath-blow to my aspirations. I was \"perplexed in the extreme.\"\n\nMy suspicions were well-founded, as the sequel demonstrated. The next\nday but one, while scraping cotton in the field, Epps seated himself\non the line fence between Shaw's plantation and his own, in such a\nposition as to overlook the scene of our labors. Presently Armsby made\nhis appearance, and, mounting the fence, took a seat beside him. They\nremained two or three hours, all of which time I was in an agony of\napprehension.\n\nThat night, while broiling my bacon, Epps entered the cabin with his\nrawhide in his hand.\n\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, \"I understand I've got a larned nigger, that\nwrites letters, and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em. Wonder if\nyou know who he is?\"\n\nMy worst fears were realized, and although it may not be considered\nentirely creditable, even under the circumstances, yet a resort to\nduplicity and downright falsehood was the only refuge that presented\nitself.\n\n\"Don't know nothing about it, Master Epps,\" I answered him, assuming\nan air of ignorance and surprise; \"Don't know nothing at all about it,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Wan't you over to Shaw's night before last?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No, master,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Hav'nt you asked that fellow, Armsby, to mail a letter for you at\nMarksville?\"\n\n\"Why, Lord, master, I never spoke three words to him in all my life. I\ndon't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he continued, \"Armsby told me to-day the devil was among my\nniggers; that I had one that needed close watching or he would run\naway; and when I axed him why, he said you come over to Shaw's,\nand waked him up in the night, and wanted him to carry a letter to\nMarksville. What have you got to say to that, ha?\"\n\n\"All I've got to say, master,\" I replied, \"is, there is no truth in\nit. How could I write a letter without any ink or paper? There is\nnobody I want to write to, 'cause I haint got no friends living as I\nknow of. That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow, they say, and nobody\nbelieves him anyway. You know I always tell the truth, and that I\nnever go off the plantation without a pass. Now, master, I can see\nwhat that Armsby is after, plain enough. Did'nt he want you to hire\nhim for an overseer?\"\n\n\"Yes, he wanted me to hire him,\" answered Epps.\n\n\"That's it,\" said I, \"he wants to make you believe we're all going\nto run away, and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us.\nHe just made that story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a\nsituation. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't.\"\n\nEpps mused awhile, evidently impressed with the plausibility of my\ntheory, and exclaimed,\n\n\"I'm d--d, Platt, if I don't believe you tell the truth. He must\ntake me for a soft, to think he can come it over me with them kind\nof yarns, musn't he? Maybe he thinks he can fool me; maybe he thinks\nI don't know nothing--can't take care of my own niggers, eh! Soft\nsoap old Epps, eh! Ha, ha, ha! D--n Armsby! Set the dogs on him,\nPlatt,\" and with many other comments descriptive of Armsby's general\ncharacter, and his capability of taking care of his own business, and\nattending to his own \"niggers,\" Master Epps left the cabin. As soon as\nhe was gone I threw the letter in the fire, and, with a desponding and\ndespairing heart, beheld the epistle which had cost me so much anxiety\nand thought, and which I fondly hoped would have been my forerunner\nto the land of freedom, writhe and shrivel on its bed of coals, and\ndissolve into smoke and ashes. Armsby, the treacherous wretch, was\ndriven from Shaw's plantation not long subsequently, much to my\nrelief, for I feared he might renew his conversation, and perhaps\ninduce Epps to credit him.\n\nI knew not now whither to look for deliverance. Hopes sprang up in\nmy heart only to be crushed and blighted. The summer of my life was\npassing away; I felt I was growing prematurely old; that a few years\nmore, and toil, and grief, and the poisonous miasmas of the swamps\nwould accomplish their work upon me--would consign me to the grave's\nembrace, to moulder and be forgotten. Repelled, betrayed, cut off from\nthe hope of succor, I could only prostrate myself upon the earth and\ngroan in unutterable anguish. The hope of rescue was the only light\nthat cast a ray of comfort on my heart. That was now flickering,\nfaint and low; another breath of disappointment would extinguish it\naltogether, leaving me to grope in midnight darkness to the end of\nlife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n  WILEY DISREGARDS THE COUNSELS OF AUNT PHEBE AND UNCLE ABRAM,\n  AND IS CAUGHT BY THE PATROLLERS--THE ORGANIZATION AND DUTIES OF\n  THE LATTER--WILEY RUNS AWAY--SPECULATIONS IN REGARD TO HIM--HIS\n  UNEXPECTED RETURN--HIS CAPTURE ON RED RIVER, AND CONFINEMENT\n  IN ALEXANDRIA JAIL--DISCOVERED BY JOSEPH B.

Notwithstanding Wiley\nseldom opened his mouth, and revolved in his obscure and unpretending\norbit without a grumble, nevertheless the warm elements of sociality\nwere strong in the bosom of that silent \"nigger.\" In the exuberance\nof his self-reliance, disregarding the philosophy of Uncle Abram,\nand setting the counsels of Aunt Phebe utterly at naught, he had the\nfool-hardiness to essay a nocturnal visit to a neighboring cabin\nwithout a pass.\n\nSo attractive was the society in which he found himself, that Wiley\ntook little note of the passing hours, and the light began to break in\nthe east before he was aware. Speeding homeward as fast as he could\nrun, he hoped to reach the quarters before the horn would sound; but,\nunhappily, he was spied on the way by a company of patrollers.\n\nHow it is in other dark places of slavery, I do not know, but on\nBayou Boeuf there is an organization of patrollers, as they are\nstyled, whose business it is to seize and whip any slave they may find\nwandering from the plantation. They ride on horseback, headed by a\ncaptain, armed, and accompanied by dogs. They have the right, either\nby law, or by general consent, to inflict discretionary chastisement\nupon a black man caught beyond the boundaries of his master's estate\nwithout a pass, and even to shoot him, if he attempts to escape. Each\ncompany has a certain distance to ride up and down the bayou. They\nare compensated by the planters, who contribute in proportion to the\nnumber of slaves they own. The clatter of their horses' hoofs dashing\nby can be heard at all hours of the night, and frequently they may be\nseen driving a slave before them, or leading him by a rope fastened\naround his neck, to his owner's plantation.\n\nWiley fled before one of these companies, thinking he could reach\nhis cabin before they could overtake him; but one of their dogs, a\ngreat ravenous hound, griped him by the leg, and held him fast. The\npatrollers whipped him severely, and brought him, a prisoner, to\nEpps. From him he received another flagellation still more severe,\nso that the cuts of the lash and the bites of the dog rendered him\nsore, stiff and miserable, insomuch he was scarcely able to move. It\nwas impossible in such a state to keep up his row, and consequently\nthere was not an hour in the day but Wiley felt the sting of his\nmaster's rawhide on his raw and bleeding back. His sufferings became\nintolerable, and finally he resolved to run away. Without disclosing\nhis intentions to run away even to his wife Phebe, he proceeded to\nmake arrangements for carrying his plan into execution. Having cooked\nhis whole week's allowance, he cautiously left the cabin on a Sunday\nnight, after the inmates of the quarters were asleep. When the horn\nsounded in the morning, Wiley did not make his appearance. Search was\nmade for him in the cabins, in the corn-crib, in the cotton-house, and\nin every nook and corner of the premises. Each of us was examined,\ntouching any knowledge we might have that could throw light upon his\nsudden disappearance or present whereabouts. Epps raved and stormed,\nand mounting his horse, galloped to neighboring plantations, making\ninquiries in all directions. The search was fruitless. Nothing\nwhatever was elicited, going to show what had become of the missing\nman. The dogs were led to the swamp, but were unable to strike his\ntrail. They would circle away through the forest, their noses to the\nground, but invariably returned in a short time to the spot from\nwhence they started.\n\nWiley had escaped, and so secretly and cautiously as to elude and\nbaffle all pursuit. Days and even weeks passed away, and nothing could\nbe heard of him. Epps did nothing but curse and swear. It was the only\ntopic of conversation among us when alone. We indulged in a great deal\nof speculation in regard to him, one suggesting he might have been\ndrowned in some bayou, inasmuch as he was a poor swimmer; another,\nthat perhaps he might have been devoured by alligators, or stung by\nthe venomous moccasin, whose bite is certain and sudden death. The\nwarm and hearty sympathies of us all, however, were with poor Wiley,\nwherever he might be. Many an earnest prayer ascended from the lips of\nUncle Abram, beseeching safety for the wanderer.\n\nIn about three weeks, when all hope of ever seeing him again was\ndismissed, to our surprise, he one day appeared among us. On leaving\nthe plantation, he informed us, it was his intention to make his way\nback to South Carolina--to the old quarters of Master Buford. During\nthe day he remained secreted, sometimes in the branches of a tree, and\nat night pressed forward through the swamps. Finally, one morning,\njust at dawn, he reached the shore of Red River. While standing on\nthe bank, considering how he could cross it, a white man accosted\nhim, and demanded a pass. Without one, and evidently a runaway, he\nwas taken to Alexandria, the shire town of the parish of Rapides,\nand confined in prison. It happened several days after that Joseph\nB. Roberts, uncle of Mistress Epps, was in Alexandria, and going\ninto the jail, recognized him. Wiley had worked on his plantation,\nwhen Epps resided at Huff Power. Paying the jail fee, and writing him\na pass, underneath which was a note to Epps, requesting him not to\nwhip him on his return, Wiley was sent back to Bayou Boeuf. It was\nthe hope that hung upon this request, and which Roberts assured him\nwould be respected by his master, that sustained him as he approached\nthe house. The request, however, as may be readily supposed, was\nentirely disregarded. After being kept in suspense three days, Wiley\nwas stripped, and compelled to endure one of those inhuman floggings\nto which the poor slave is so often subjected. It was the first and\nlast attempt of Wiley to run away. The long scars upon his back, which\nhe will carry with him to the grave, perpetually remind him of the\ndangers of such a step.\n\nThere was not a day throughout the ten years I belonged to Epps that I\ndid not consult with myself upon the prospect of escape. I laid many\nplans, which at the time I considered excellent ones, but one after\nthe other they were all abandoned. No man who has never been placed\nin such a situation, can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in\nthe way of the flying slave. Every white man's hand is raised against\nhim--the patrollers are watching for him--the hounds are ready to\nfollow on his track, and the nature of the country is such as renders\nit impossible to pass through it with any safety. I thought, however,\nthat the time might come, perhaps, when I should be running through\nthe swamps again. I concluded, in that case, to be prepared for Epps'\ndogs, should they pursue me. He possessed several, one of which was\na notorious slave-hunter, and the most fierce and savage of his\nbreed. While out hunting the coon or the opossum, I never allowed an\nopportunity to escape, when alone, of whipping them severely. In this\nmanner I succeeded at length in subduing them completely. They feared\nme, obeying my voice at once when others had no control over them\nwhatever. Had they followed and overtaken me, I doubt not they would\nhave shrank from attacking me.\n\nNotwithstanding the certainty of being captured, the woods and swamps\nare, nevertheless, continually filled with runaways. Many of them,\nwhen sick, or so worn out as to be unable to perform their tasks,\nescape into the swamps, willing to suffer the punishment inflicted for\nsuch offences, in order to obtain a day or two of rest.\n\nWhile I belonged to Ford, I was unwittingly the means of disclosing\nthe hiding-place of six or eight, who had taken up their residence in\nthe \"Great Pine Woods.\" Adam Taydem frequently sent me from the mills\nover to the opening after provisions. The whole distance was then a\nthick pine forest. About ten o'clock of a beautiful moonlight night,\nwhile walking along the Texas road, returning to the mills, carrying\na dressed pig in a bag swung over my shoulder, I heard footsteps\nbehind me, and turning round, beheld two black men in the dress of\nslaves approaching at a rapid pace. When within a short distance,\none of them raised a club, as if intending to strike me; the other\nsnatched at the bag. I managed to dodge them both, and seizing a pine\nknot, hurled it with such force against the head of one of them that\nhe was prostrated apparently senseless to the ground. Just then two\nmore made their appearance from one side of the road. Before they\ncould grapple me, however, I succeeded in passing them, and taking\nto my heels, fled, much affrighted, towards the mills. When Adam was\ninformed of the adventure, he hastened straightway to the Indian\nvillage, and arousing Cascalla and several of his tribe, started in\npursuit of the highwaymen. I accompanied them to the scene of attack,\nwhen we discovered a puddle of blood in the road, where the man whom I\nhad smitten with the pine knot had fallen. After searching carefully\nthrough the woods a long time, one of Cascalla's men discovered a\nsmoke curling up through the branches of several prostrate pines,\nwhose tops had fallen together. The rendezvous was cautiously\nsurrounded, and all of them taken prisoners. They had escaped from a\nplantation in the vicinity of Lamourie, and had been secreted there\nthree weeks. They had no evil design upon me, except to frighten me\nout of my pig. Having observed me passing towards Ford's just at\nnight-fall, and suspecting the nature of my errand, they had followed\nme, seen me butcher and dress the porker, and start on my return.\nThey had been pinched for food, and were driven to this extremity by\nnecessity. Adam conveyed them to the parish jail, and was liberally\nrewarded.\n\nNot unfrequently the runaway loses his life in the attempt to escape.\nEpps' premises were bounded on one side by Carey's, a very extensive\nsugar plantation. He cultivates annually at least fifteen hundred\nacres of cane, manufacturing twenty-two or twenty-three hundred\nhogsheads of sugar; an hogshead and a half being the usual yield of\nan acre. Besides this he also cultivates five or six hundred acres\nof corn and cotton. He owned last year one hundred and fifty three\nfield hands, besides nearly as many children, and yearly hires a drove\nduring the busy season from this side the Mississippi.\n\nOne of his negro drivers, a pleasant, intelligent boy, was named\nAugustus. During the holidays, and occasionally while at work in\nadjoining fields, I had an opportunity of making his acquaintance,\nwhich eventually ripened into a warm and mutual attachment. Summer\nbefore last he was so unfortunate as to incur the displeasure of the\noverseer, a coarse, heartless brute, who whipped him most cruelly.\nAugustus ran away. Reaching a cane rick on Hawkins' plantation, he\nsecreted himself in the top of it. All Carey's dogs were put upon\nhis track--some fifteen of them--and soon scented his footsteps to\nthe hiding place. They surrounded the rick, baying and scratching,\nbut could not reach him. Presently, guided by the clamor of the\nhounds, the pursuers rode up, when the overseer, mounting on to the\nrick, drew him forth. As he rolled down to the ground the whole pack\nplunged upon him, and before they could be beaten off, had gnawed and\nmutilated his body in the most shocking manner, their teeth having\npenetrated to the bone in an hundred places. He was taken up, tied\nupon a mule, and carried home. But this was Augustus' last trouble. He\nlingered until the next day, when death sought the unhappy boy, and\nkindly relieved him from his agony.\n\nIt was not unusual for slave women as well as slave men to endeavor\nto escape. Nelly, Eldret's girl, with whom I lumbered for a time in\nthe \"Big Cane Brake,\" lay concealed in Epps' corn crib three days. At\nnight, when his family were asleep, she would steal into the quarters\nfor food, and return to the crib again. We concluded it would no\nlonger be safe for us to allow her to remain, and accordingly she\nretraced her steps to her own cabin.\n\nBut the most remarkable instance of a successful evasion of dogs and\nhunters was the following: Among Carey's girls was one by the name of\nCeleste. She was nineteen or twenty, and far whiter than her owner, or\nany of his offspring. It required a close inspection to distinguish\nin her features the slightest trace of African blood. A stranger\nwould never have dreamed that she was the descendant of slaves. I was\nsitting in my cabin late at night, playing a low air on my violin,\nwhen the door opened carefully, and Celeste stood before me. She was\npale and haggard. Had an apparition arisen from the earth, I could\nnot have been more startled.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded, after gazing at her a moment.\n\n\"I'm hungry; give me some bacon,\" was her reply.\n\nMy first impression was that she was some deranged young mistress,\nwho, escaping from home, was wandering, she knew not whither, and\nhad been attracted to my cabin by the sound of the violin. The\ncoarse cotton slave dress she wore, however, soon dispelled such a\nsupposition.\n\n\"What is your name?\" I again interrogated.\n\n\"My name is Celeste,\" she answered. \"I belong to Carey, and have been\ntwo days among the palmettoes. I am sick and can't work, and would\nrather die in the swamp than be whipped to death by the overseer.\nCarey's dogs won't follow me. They have tried to set them on. There's\na secret between them and Celeste, and they wont mind the devilish\norders of the overseer. Give me some meat--I'm starving.\"\n\nI divided my scanty allowance with her, and while partaking of it,\nshe related how she had managed to escape, and described the place\nof her concealment. In the edge of the swamp, not half a mile from\nEpps' house, was a large space, thousands of acres in extent, thickly\ncovered with palmetto. Tall trees, whose long arms interlocked each\nother, formed a canopy above them, so dense as to exclude the beams\nof the sun. It was like twilight always, even in the middle of the\nbrightest day. In the centre of this great space, which nothing but\nserpents very often explore--a sombre and solitary spot--Celeste had\nerected a rude hut of dead branches that had fallen to the ground,\nand covered it with the leaves of the palmetto. This was the abode\nshe had selected. She had no fear of Carey's dogs, any more than I\nhad of Epps'. It is a fact, which I have never been able to explain,\nthat there are those whose tracks the hounds will absolutely refuse to\nfollow. Celeste was one of them.\n\nFor several nights she came to my cabin for food. On one occasion our\ndogs barked as she approached, which aroused Epps, and induced him\nto reconnoitre the premises. He did not discover her, but after that\nit was not deemed prudent for her to come to the yard. When all was\nsilent I carried provisions to a certain spot agreed upon, where she\nwould find them.\n\nIn this manner Celeste passed the greater part of the summer. She\nregained her health, and became strong and hearty. At all seasons of\nthe year the howlings of wild animals can be heard at night along the\nborders of the swamps. Several times they had made her a midnight\ncall, awakening her from slumber with a growl. Terrified by such\nunpleasant salutations, she finally concluded to abandon her lonely\ndwelling; and, accordingly, returning to her master, was scourged, her\nneck meanwhile being fastened in the stocks, and sent into the field\nagain.\n\nThe year before my arrival in the country there was a concerted\nmovement among a number of slaves on Bayou Boeuf, that terminated\ntragically indeed. It was, I presume, a matter of newspaper notoriety\nat the time, but all the knowledge I have of it, has been derived from\nthe relation of those living at that period in the immediate vicinity\nof the excitement. It has become a subject of general and unfailing\ninterest in every slave-hut on the bayou, and will doubtless go down\nto succeeding generations as their chief tradition. Lew Cheney, with\nwhom I became acquainted--a shrewd, cunning negro, more intelligent\nthan the generality of his race, but unscrupulous and full of\ntreachery--conceived the project of organizing a company sufficiently\nstrong to fight their way against all opposition, to the neighboring\nterritory of Mexico.\n\nA remote spot, far within the depths of the swamp, back of Hawkins'\nplantation, was selected as the rallying point. Lew flitted from one\nplantation to another, in the dead of night, preaching a crusade to\nMexico, and, like Peter the Hermit, creating a furor of excitement\nwherever he appeared. At length a large number of runaways were\nassembled; stolen mules, and corn gathered from the fields, and bacon\nfilched from smoke-houses, had been conveyed into the woods. The\nexpedition was about ready to proceed, when their hiding place was\ndiscovered. Lew Cheney, becoming convinced of the ultimate failure of\nhis project, in order to curry favor with his master, and avoid the\nconsequences which he foresaw would follow, deliberately determined to\nsacrifice all his companions. Departing secretly from the encampment,\nhe proclaimed among the planters the number collected in the swamp,\nand, instead of stating truly the object they had in view, asserted\ntheir intention was to emerge from their seclusion the first favorable\nopportunity, and murder every white person along the bayou.\n\nSuch an announcement, exaggerated as it passed from mouth to mouth,\nfilled the whole country with terror. The fugitives were surrounded\nand taken prisoners, carried in chains to Alexandria, and hung by\nthe populace. Not only those, but many who were suspected, though\nentirely innocent, were taken from the field and from the cabin,\nand without the shadow of process or form of trial, hurried to the\nscaffold. The planters on Bayou Boeuf finally rebelled against such\nreckless destruction of property, but it was not until a regiment of\nsoldiers had arrived from some fort on the Texan frontier, demolished\nthe gallows, and opened the doors of the Alexandria prison, that the\nindiscriminate slaughter was stayed. Lew Cheney escaped, and was\neven rewarded for his treachery. He is still living, but his name is\ndespised and execrated by all his race throughout the parishes of\nRapides and Avoyelles.\n\nSuch an idea as insurrection, however, is not new among the enslaved\npopulation of Bayou Boeuf. More than once I have joined in serious\nconsultation, when the subject has been discussed, and there have\nbeen times when a word from me would have placed hundreds of my\nfellow-bondsmen in an attitude of defiance. Without arms or\nammunition, or even with them, I saw such a step would result in\ncertain defeat, disaster and death, and always raised my voice against\nit.\n\nDuring the Mexican war I well remember the extravagant hopes that were\nexcited. The news of victory filled the great house with rejoicing,\nbut produced only sorrow and disappointment in the cabin. In my\nopinion--and I have had opportunity to know something of the feeling\nof which I speak--there are not fifty slaves on the shores of Bayou\nBoeuf, but would hail with unmeasured delight the approach of an\ninvading army.\n\nThey are deceived who flatter themselves that the ignorant and\ndebased slave has no conception of the magnitude of his wrongs. They\nare deceived who imagine that he arises from his knees, with back\nlacerated and bleeding, cherishing only a spirit of meekness and\nforgiveness. A day may come--it _will_ come, if his prayer is heard--a\nterrible day of vengeance, when the master in his turn will cry in\nvain for mercy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n  O'NIEL, THE TANNER--CONVERSATION WITH AUNT PHEBE OVERHEARD--EPPS IN\n  THE TANNING BUSINESS--STABBING OF UNCLE ABRAM--THE UGLY WOUND--EPPS\n  IS JEALOUS--PATSEY IS MISSING--HER RETURN FROM SHAW'S--HARRIET,\n  SHAW'S BLACK WIFE--EPPS ENRAGED--PATSEY DENIES HIS CHARGES--SHE IS\n  TIED DOWN NAKED TO FOUR STAKES--THE INHUMAN FLOGGING--FLAYING OF\n  PATSEY--THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY--THE BUCKET OF SALT WATER--THE DRESS\n  STIFF WITH BLOOD--PATSEY GROWS MELANCHOLY--HER IDEA OF GOD AND\n  ETERNITY--OF HEAVEN AND FREEDOM--THE EFFECT OF SLAVE-WHIPPING--EPPS'\n  OLDEST SON--\"THE CHILD IS FATHER TO THE MAN.\"\n\n\nWiley suffered severely at the hands of Master Epps, as has been\nrelated in the preceding chapter, but in this respect he fared no\nworse than his unfortunate companions. \"Spare the rod,\" was an idea\nscouted by our master. He was constitutionally subject to periods of\nill-humor, and at such times, however little provocation there might\nbe, a certain amount of punishment was inflicted. The circumstances\nattending the last flogging but one that I received, will show how\ntrivial a cause was sufficient with him for resorting to the whip.\n\nA Mr. O'Niel, residing in the vicinity of the Big Pine Woods, called\nupon Epps for the purpose of purchasing me. He was a tanner and\ncurrier by occupation, transacting an extensive business, and intended\nto place me at service in some department of his establishment,\nprovided he bought me. Aunt Phebe, while preparing the dinner-table\nin the great house, overheard their conversation. On returning to the\nyard at night, the old woman ran to meet me, designing, of course,\nto overwhelm me with the news. She entered into a minute repetition\nof all she had heard, and Aunt Phebe was one whose ears never failed\nto drink in every word of conversation uttered in her hearing. She\nenlarged upon the fact that \"Massa Epps was g'wine to sell me to a\ntanner ober in de Pine Woods,\" so long and loudly as to attract the\nattention of the mistress, who, standing unobserved on the piazza at\nthe time, was listening to our conversation.\n\n\"Well, Aunt Phebe,\" said I, \"I'm glad of it. I'm tired of scraping\ncotton, and would rather be a tanner. I hope he'll buy me.\"\n\nO'Niel did not effect a purchase, however, the parties differing as\nto price, and the morning following his arrival, departed homewards.\nHe had been gone but a short time, when Epps made his appearance in\nthe field. Now nothing will more violently enrage a master, especially\nEpps, than the intimation of one of his servants that he would like to\nleave him. Mistress Epps had repeated to him my expressions to Aunt\nPhebe the evening previous, as I learned from the latter afterwards,\nthe mistress having mentioned to her that she had overheard us. On\nentering the field, Epps walked directly to me.\n\n\"So, Platt, you're tired of scraping cotton, are you? You\nwould like to change your master, eh? You're fond of moving\nround--traveler--ain't ye? Ah, yes--like to travel for your health,\nmay be? Feel above cotton-scraping, I 'spose. So you're going into the\ntanning business? Good business--devilish fine business. Enterprising\nnigger! B'lieve I'll go into that business myself. Down on your knees,\nand strip that rag off your back! I'll try my hand at tanning.\"\n\nI begged earnestly, and endeavored to soften him with excuses, but in\nvain. There was no other alternative; so kneeling down, I presented my\nbare back for the application of the lash.\n\n\"How do you like _tanning_?\" he exclaimed, as the rawhide descended\nupon my flesh. \"How do you like _tanning_?\" he repeated at every\nblow. In this manner he gave me twenty or thirty lashes, incessantly\ngiving utterance to the word \"tanning,\" in one form of expression or\nanother. When sufficiently \"tanned,\" he allowed me to arise, and with\na half-malicious laugh assured me, if I still fancied the business, he\nwould give me further instruction in it whenever I desired. This time,\nhe remarked, he had only given me a short lesson in \"_tanning_\"--the\nnext time he would \"curry me down.\"\n\nUncle Abram, also, was frequently treated with great brutality,\nalthough he was one of the kindest and most faithful creatures in\nthe world. He was my cabin-mate for years. There was a benevolent\nexpression in the old man's face, pleasant to behold. He regarded us\nwith a kind of parental feeling, always counseling us with remarkable\ngravity and deliberation.\n\nReturning from Marshall's plantation one afternoon, whither I had been\nsent on some errand of the mistress, I found him lying on the cabin\nfloor, his clothes saturated with blood. He informed me that he had\nbeen stabbed! While spreading cotton on the scaffold, Epps came home\nintoxicated from Holmesville. He found fault with every thing, giving\nmany orders so directly contrary that it was impossible to execute\nany of them. Uncle Abram, whose faculties were growing dull, became\nconfused, and committed some blunder of no particular consequence.\nEpps was so enraged thereat, that, with drunken recklessness, he flew\nupon the old man, and stabbed him in the back. It was a long, ugly\nwound, but did not happen to penetrate far enough to result fatally.\nIt was sewed up by the mistress, who censured her husband with extreme\nseverity, not only denouncing his inhumanity, but declaring that\nshe expected nothing else than that he would bring the family to\npoverty--that he would kill all the slaves on the plantation in some\nof his drunken fits.\n\nIt was no uncommon thing with him to prostrate Aunt Phebe with a chair\nor stick of wood; but the most cruel whipping that ever I was doomed\nto witness--one I can never recall with any other emotion than that\nof horror--was inflicted on the unfortunate Patsey.\n\nIt has been seen that the jealousy and hatred of Mistress Epps made\nthe daily life of her young and agile slave completely miserable. I\nam happy in the belief that on numerous occasions I was the means\nof averting punishment from the inoffensive girl. In Epps' absence\nthe mistress often ordered me to whip her without the remotest\nprovocation. I would refuse, saying that I feared my master's\ndispleasure, and several times ventured to remonstrate with her\nagainst the treatment Patsey received. I endeavored to impress her\nwith the truth that the latter was not responsible for the acts of\nwhich she complained, but that she being a slave, and subject entirely\nto her master's will, he alone was answerable.\n\nAt length \"the green-eyed monster\" crept into the soul of Epps also,\nand then it was that he joined with his wrathful wife in an infernal\njubilee over the girl's miseries.\n\nOn a Sabbath day in hoeing time, not long ago, we were on the bayou\nbank, washing our clothes, as was our usual custom. Presently Patsey\nwas missing. Epps called aloud, but there was no answer. No one had\nobserved her leaving the yard, and it was a wonder with us whither she\nhad gone. In the course of a couple of hours she was seen approaching\nfrom the direction of Shaw's. This man, as has been intimated, was\na notorious profligate, and withal not on the most friendly terms\nwith Epps. Harriet, his black wife, knowing Patsey's troubles, was\nkind to her, in consequence of which the latter was in the habit of\ngoing over to see her every opportunity. Her visits were prompted by\nfriendship merely, but the suspicion gradually entered the brain of\nEpps, that another and a baser passion led her thither--that it was\nnot Harriet she desired to meet, but rather the unblushing libertine,\nhis neighbor. Patsey found her master in a fearful rage on her return.\nHis violence so alarmed her that at first she attempted to evade\ndirect answers to his questions, which only served to increase his\nsuspicions. She finally, however, drew herself up proudly, and in a\nspirit of indignation boldly denied his charges.\n\n\"Missus don't give me soap to wash with, as she does the rest,\" said\nPatsey, \"and you know why. I went over to Harriet's to get a piece,\"\nand saying this, she drew it forth from a pocket in her dress and\nexhibited it to him. \"That's what I went to Shaw's for, Massa Epps,\"\ncontinued she; \"the Lord knows that was all.\"\n\n\"You lie, you black wench!\" shouted Epps.\n\n\"I _don't_ lie, massa. If you kill me, I'll stick to that.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'll fetch you down. I'll learn you to go to Shaw's. I'll take\nthe starch out of ye,\" he muttered fiercely through his shut teeth.\n\nThen turning to me, he ordered four stakes to be driven into the\nground, pointing with the toe of his boot to the places where he\nwanted them. When the stakes were driven down, he ordered her to be\nstripped of every article of dress. Ropes were then brought, and\nthe naked girl was laid upon her face, her wrists and feet each tied\nfirmly to a stake. Stepping to the piazza, he took down a heavy whip,\nand placing it in my hands, commanded me to lash her. Unpleasant as it\nwas, I was compelled to obey him. Nowhere that day, on the face of the\nwhole earth, I venture to say, was there such a demoniac exhibition\nwitnessed as then ensued.\n\nMistress Epps stood on the piazza among her children, gazing on the\nscene with an air of heartless satisfaction. The slaves were huddled\ntogether at a little distance, their countenances indicating the\nsorrow of their hearts. Poor Patsey prayed piteously for mercy, but\nher prayers were vain. Epps ground his teeth, and stamped upon the\nground, screaming at me, like a mad fiend, to strike _harder_.\n\n\"Strike harder, or _your_ turn will come next, you scoundrel,\" he\nyelled.\n\n\"Oh, mercy, massa!--oh! have mercy, _do_. Oh, God! pity me,\" Patsey\nexclaimed continually, struggling fruitlessly, and the flesh quivering\nat every stroke.\n\nWhen I had struck her as many as thirty times, I stopped, and turned\nround toward Epps, hoping he was satisfied; but with bitter oaths and\nthreats, he ordered me to continue. I inflicted ten or fifteen blows\nmore. By this time her back was covered with long welts, intersecting\neach other like net work. Epps was yet furious and savage as ever,\ndemanding if she would like to go to Shaw's again, and swearing he\nwould flog her until she wished she was in h--l. Throwing down the\nwhip, I declared I could punish her no more. He ordered me to go on,\nthreatening me with a severer flogging than she had received, in case\nof refusal. My heart revolted at the inhuman scene, and risking the\nconsequences, I absolutely refused to raise the whip. He then seized\nit himself, and applied it with ten-fold greater force than I had.\nThe painful cries and shrieks of the tortured Patsey, mingling with\nthe loud and angry curses of Epps, loaded the air. She was terribly\nlacerated--I may say, without exaggeration, literally flayed. The lash\nwas wet with blood, which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the\nground. At length she ceased struggling. Her head sank listlessly on\nthe ground. Her screams and supplications gradually decreased and died\naway into a low moan. She no longer writhed and shrank beneath the\nlash when it bit out small pieces of her flesh. I thought that she was\ndying!\n\n[Illustration: THE STAKING OUT AND FLOGGING OF THE GIRL PATSEY.]\n\nIt was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm\nsunlight--the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the\ntrees--peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the\nbosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around\nhim. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in\nharmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on\nEpps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and thought\nwithin myself--\"Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course\nof eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!\"\n\nFinally, he ceased whipping from mere exhaustion, and ordered Phebe\nto bring a bucket of salt and water. After washing her thoroughly\nwith this, I was told to take her to her cabin. Untying the ropes, I\nraised her in my arms. She was unable to stand, and as her head rested\non my shoulder, she repeated many times, in a faint voice scarcely\nperceptible, \"Oh, Platt--oh, Platt!\" but nothing further. Her dress\nwas replaced, but it clung to her back, and was soon stiff with blood.\nWe laid her on some boards in the hut, where she remained a long time,\nwith eyes closed and groaning in agony. At night Phebe applied melted\ntallow to her wounds, and so far as we were able, all endeavored to\nassist and console her. Day after day she lay in her cabin upon her\nface, the sores preventing her resting in any other position.\n\nA blessed thing it would have been for her--days and weeks and months\nof misery it would have saved her--had she never lifted up her head in\nlife again. Indeed, from that time forward she was not what she had\nbeen. The burden of a deep melancholy weighed heavily on her spirits.\nShe no longer moved with that buoyant and elastic step--there was\nnot that mirthful sparkle in her eyes that formerly distinguished\nher. The bounding vigor--the sprightly, laughter-loving spirit of her\nyouth, were gone. She fell into a mournful and desponding mood, and\noftentimes would start up in her sleep, and with raised hands, plead\nfor mercy. She became more silent than she was, toiling all day in our\nmidst, not uttering a word. A care-worn, pitiful expression settled on\nher face, and it was her humor now to weep, rather than rejoice. If\never there was a broken heart--one crushed and blighted by the rude\ngrasp of suffering and misfortune--it was Patsey's.\n\nShe had been reared no better than her master's beast--looked upon\nmerely as a valuable and handsome animal--and consequently possessed\nbut a limited amount of knowledge. And yet a faint light cast its rays\nover her intellect, so that it was not wholly dark. She had a dim\nperception of God and of eternity, and a still more dim perception\nof a Saviour who had died even for such as her. She entertained but\nconfused notions of a future life--not comprehending the distinction\nbetween the corporeal and spiritual existence. Happiness, in her mind,\nwas exemption from stripes--from labor--from the cruelty of masters\nand overseers. Her idea of the joy of heaven was simply _rest_, and is\nfully expressed in these lines of a melancholy bard:\n\n    \"I ask no paradise on high,\n      With cares on earth oppressed,\n    The only heaven for which I sigh,\n      Is rest, eternal rest.\"\n\nIt is a mistaken opinion that prevails in some quarters, that the\nslave does not understand the term--does not comprehend the idea of\nfreedom. Even on Bayou Boeuf, where I conceive slavery exists in its\nmost abject and cruel form--where it exhibits features altogether\nunknown in more northern States--the most ignorant of them generally\nknow full well its meaning. They understand the privileges and\nexemptions that belong to it--that it would bestow upon them the\nfruits of their own labors, and that it would secure to them the\nenjoyment of domestic happiness. They do not fail to observe the\ndifference between their own condition and the meanest white man's,\nand to realize the injustice of the laws which place it in his power\nnot only to appropriate the profits of their industry, but to subject\nthem to unmerited and unprovoked punishment, without remedy, or the\nright to resist, or to remonstrate.\n\nPatsey's life, especially after her whipping, was one long dream of\nliberty. Far away, to her fancy an immeasurable distance, she knew\nthere was a land of freedom. A thousand times she had heard that\nsomewhere in the distant North there were no slaves--no masters. In\nher imagination it was an enchanted region, the Paradise of the earth.\nTo dwell where the black man may work for himself--live in his own\ncabin--till his own soil, was a blissful dream of Patsey's--a dream,\nalas! the fulfillment of which she can never realize.\n\nThe effect of these exhibitions of brutality on the household of the\nslave-holder, is apparent. Epps' oldest son is an intelligent lad of\nten or twelve years of age. It is pitiable, sometimes, to see him\nchastising, for instance, the venerable Uncle Abram. He will call the\nold man to account, and if in his childish judgment it is necessary,\nsentence him to a certain number of lashes, which he proceeds to\ninflict with much gravity and deliberation. Mounted on his pony,\nhe often rides into the field with his whip, playing the overseer,\ngreatly to his father's delight. Without discrimination, at such\ntimes, he applies the rawhide, urging the slaves forward with shouts,\nand occasional expressions of profanity, while the old man laughs, and\ncommends him as a thorough-going boy.\n\n\"The child is father to the man,\" and with such training, whatever may\nbe his natural disposition, it cannot well be otherwise than that, on\narriving at maturity, the sufferings and miseries of the slave will be\nlooked upon with entire indifference. The influence of the iniquitous\nsystem necessarily fosters an unfeeling and cruel spirit, even in the\nbosoms of those who, among their equals, are regarded as humane and\ngenerous.\n\nYoung Master Epps possessed some noble qualities, yet no process\nof reasoning could lead him to comprehend, that in the eye of the\nAlmighty there is no distinction of color. He looked upon the black\nman simply as an animal, differing in no respect from any other\nanimal, save in the gift of speech and the possession of somewhat\nhigher instincts, and, therefore, the more valuable. To work like his\nfather's mules--to be whipped and kicked and scourged through life--to\naddress the white man with hat in hand, and eyes bent servilely on\nthe earth, in his mind, was the natural and proper destiny of the\nslave. Brought up with such ideas--in the notion that we stand without\nthe pale of humanity--no wonder the oppressors of my people are a\npitiless and unrelenting race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n  AVERY, OF BAYOU ROUGE--PECULIARITY OF DWELLINGS--EPPS BUILDS\n  A NEW HOUSE--BASS, THE CARPENTER--HIS NOBLE QUALITIES--HIS\n  PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND ECCENTRICITIES--BASS AND EPPS DISCUSS\n  THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY--EPPS' OPINION OF BASS--I MAKE MYSELF\n  KNOWN TO HIM--OUR CONVERSATION--HIS SURPRISE--THE MIDNIGHT\n  MEETING ON THE BAYOU BANK--BASS' ASSURANCES--DECLARES WAR\n  AGAINST SLAVERY--WHY I DID NOT DISCLOSE MY HISTORY--BASS WRITES\n  LETTERS--COPY OF HIS LETTER TO MESSRS. PARKER AND PERRY--THE FEVER OF\n  SUSPENSE--DISAPPOINTMENTS--BASS ENDEAVORS TO CHEER ME--MY FAITH IN\n  HIM.\n\n\nIn the month of June, 1852, in pursuance of a previous contract, Mr.\nAvery, a carpenter of Bayou Rouge, commenced the erection of a house\nfor Master Epps. It has previously been stated that there are no\ncellars on Bayou Boeuf; on the other hand, such is the low and swampy\nnature of the ground, the great houses are usually built upon spiles.\nAnother peculiarity is, the rooms are not plastered, but the ceiling\nand sides are covered with matched cypress boards, painted such color\nas most pleases the owner's taste. Generally the plank and boards are\nsawed by slaves with whip-saws, there being no waterpower upon which\nmills might be built within many miles. When the planter erects for\nhimself a dwelling, therefore, there is plenty of extra work for his\nslaves. Having had some experience under Tibeats as a carpenter, I was\ntaken from the field altogether, on the arrival of Avery and his hands.\n\nAmong them was one to whom I owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude.\nOnly for him, in all probability, I should have ended my days in\nslavery. He was my deliverer--a man whose true heart overflowed with\nnoble and generous emotions. To the last moment of my existence I\nshall remember him with feelings of thankfulness. His name was Bass,\nand at that time he resided in Marksville. It will be difficult to\nconvey a correct impression of his appearance or character. He was a\nlarge man, between forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and\nlight hair. He was very cool and self-possessed, fond of argument, but\nalways speaking with extreme deliberation. He was that kind of person\nwhose peculiarity of manner was such that nothing he uttered ever gave\noffence. What would be intolerable, coming from the lips of another,\ncould be said by him with impunity. There was not a man on Red River,\nperhaps, that agreed with him on the subject of politics or religion,\nand not a man, I venture to say, who discussed either of those\nsubjects half as much. It seemed to be taken for granted that he would\nespouse the unpopular side of every local question, and it always\ncreated amusement rather than displeasure among his auditors, to\nlisten to the ingenious and original manner in which he maintained the\ncontroversy. He was a bachelor--an \"old bachelor,\" according to the\ntrue acceptation of the term--having no kindred living, as he knew of,\nin the world. Neither had he any permanent abiding place--wandering\nfrom one State to another, as his fancy dictated. He had lived in\nMarksville three or four years, and in the prosecution of his business\nas a carpenter; and in consequence, likewise, of his peculiarities,\nwas quite extensively known throughout the parish of Avoyelles. He\nwas liberal to a fault; and his many acts of kindness and transparent\ngoodness of heart rendered him popular in the community, the sentiment\nof which he unceasingly combated.\n\nHe was a native of Canada, from whence he had wandered in early life,\nand after visiting all the principal localities in the northern and\nwestern States, in the course of his peregrinations, arrived in\nthe unhealthy region of the Red River. His last removal was from\nIllinois. Whither he has now gone, I regret to be obliged to say, is\nunknown to me. He gathered up his effects and departed quietly from\nMarksville the day before I did, the suspicions of his instrumentality\nin procuring my liberation rendering such a step necessary. For the\ncommission of a just and righteous act he would undoubtedly have\nsuffered death, had he remained within reach of the slave-whipping\ntribe on Bayou Boeuf.\n\nOne day, while working on the new house, Bass and Epps became engaged\nin a controversy, to which, as will be readily supposed, I listened\nwith absorbing interest. They were discussing the subject of Slavery.\n\n\"I tell you what it is Epps,\" said Bass, \"it's all wrong--all wrong,\nsir--there's no justice nor righteousness in it. I wouldn't own a\nslave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well\nunderstood, more particularly among my creditors. _There's_ another\nhumbug--the credit system--humbug, sir; no credit--no debt. Credit\nleads a man into temptation. Cash down is the only thing that will\ndeliver him from evil. But this question of _Slavery_; what _right_\nhave you to your niggers when you come down to the point?\"\n\n\"What right!\" said Epps, laughing; \"why, I bought 'em, and paid for\n'em.\"\n\n\"Of _course_ you did; the law says you have the right to hold a\nnigger, but begging the law's pardon, it _lies_. Yes, Epps, when the\nlaw says that it's a _liar_, and the truth is not in it. Is every\nthing right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law\ntaking away your liberty and making you a slave?\"\n\n\"Oh, that ain't a supposable case,\" said Epps, still laughing; \"hope\nyou don't compare me to a nigger, Bass.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Bass answered gravely, \"no, not exactly. But I have seen\nniggers before now as good as I am, and I have no acquaintance with\nany white man in these parts that I consider a whit better than\nmyself. Now, in the sight of God, what is the difference, Epps,\nbetween a white man and a black one?\"\n\n\"All the difference in the world,\" replied Epps. \"You might as well\nask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. Now,\nI've seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as\nany nigger I've got. You'd call them feller citizens, I s'pose?\"--and\nEpps indulged in a loud laugh at his own wit.\n\n\"Look here, Epps,\" continued his companion; \"you can't laugh me down\nin that way. Some men are witty, and some ain't so witty as they think\nthey are. Now let me ask you a question. Are all men created free and\nequal as the Declaration of Independence holds they are?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded Epps, \"but all men, niggers, and monkeys _ain't_;\"\nand hereupon he broke forth into a more boisterous laugh than before.\n\n\"There are monkeys among white people as well as black, when you\ncome to that,\" coolly remarked Bass. \"I know some white men that use\narguments no sensible monkey would. But let that pass. These niggers\nare human beings. If they don't know as much as their masters, whose\nfault is it? They are not _allowed_ to know anything. You have books\nand papers, and can go where you please, and gather intelligence\nin a thousand ways. But your slaves have no privileges. You'd whip\none of them if caught reading a book. They are held in bondage,\ngeneration after generation, deprived of mental improvement, and who\ncan expect them to possess much knowledge? If they are not brought\ndown to a level with the brute creation, you slaveholders will never\nbe blamed for it. If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the\nscale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will\nhave to answer for it. There's a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this\nnation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning\nyet--yes, Epps, there's a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may\nbe sooner or it may be later, but it's a coming as sure as the Lord is\njust.\"\n\n\"If you lived up among the Yankees in New-England,\" said Epps, \"I\nexpect you'd be one of them cursed fanatics that know more than the\nconstitution, and go about peddling clocks and coaxing niggers to run\naway.\"\n\n\"If I was in New-England,\" returned Bass, \"I would be just what I\nam here. I would say that Slavery was an iniquity, and ought to be\nabolished. I would say there was no reason nor justice in the law, or\nthe constitution that allows one man to hold another man in bondage.\nIt would be hard for you to lose your property, to be sure, but it\nwouldn't be half as hard as it would be to lose your liberty. You\nhave no more right to your freedom, in exact justice, than Uncle\nAbram yonder. Talk about black skin, and black blood; why, how many\nslaves are there on this bayou as white as either of us? And what\ndifference is there in the color of the soul? Pshaw! the whole system\nis as absurd as it is cruel. You may own niggers and behanged, but I\nwouldn't own one for the best plantation in Louisiana.\"\n\n\"You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of.\nYou would argue that black was white, or white black, if any body\nwould contradict you. Nothing suits you in this world, and I don't\nbelieve you will be satisfied with the next, if you should have your\nchoice in them.\"\n\nConversations substantially like the foregoing were not unusual\nbetween the two after this; Epps drawing him out more for the purpose\nof creating a laugh at his expense, than with a view of fairly\ndiscussing the merits of the question. He looked upon Bass, as a man\nready to say anything merely for the pleasure of hearing his own\nvoice; as somewhat self-conceited, perhaps, contending against his\nfaith and judgment, in order, simply, to exhibit his dexterity in\nargumentation.\n\nHe remained at Epps' through the summer, visiting Marksville generally\nonce a fortnight. The more I saw of him, the more I became convinced\nhe was a man in whom I could confide. Nevertheless, my previous\nill-fortune had taught me to be extremely cautious. It was not my\nplace to speak to a white man except when spoken to, but I omitted no\nopportunity of throwing myself in his way, and endeavored constantly\nin every possible manner to attract his attention. In the early part\nof August he and myself were at work alone in the house, the other\ncarpenters having left, and Epps being absent in the field. Now was\nthe time, if ever, to broach the subject, and I resolved to do it, and\nsubmit to whatever consequences might ensue. We were busily at work in\nthe afternoon, when I stopped suddenly and said--\n\n\"Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Why, Platt, what put that into your head?\" he answered. \"You wouldn't\nknow if I should tell you.\" After a moment or two he added--\"I was\nborn in Canada; now guess where that is.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know where Canada is,\" said I, \"I have been there myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I expect you are well acquainted all through that country,\" he\nremarked, laughing incredulously.\n\n\"As sure as I live, Master Bass,\" I replied, \"I have been there. I\nhave been in Montreal and Kingston, and Queenston, and a great many\nplaces in Canada, and I have been in York State, too--in Buffalo, and\nRochester, and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on\nthe Erie canal and the Champlain canal.\"\n\nBass turned round and gazed at me a long time without uttering a\nsyllable.\n\n\"How came you here?\" he inquired, at length. \"Master Bass,\" I\nanswered, \"if justice had been done, I never would have been here.\"\n\n\"Well, how's this?\" said he. \"Who are you? You have been in Canada\nsure enough; I know all the places you mention. How did you happen to\nget here? Come, tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"I have no friends here,\" was my reply, \"that I can put confidence in.\nI am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master\nEpps if I should.\"\n\nHe assured me earnestly he would keep every word I might speak to\nhim a profound secret, and his curiosity was evidently strongly\nexcited. It was a long story, I informed him, and would take some\ntime to relate it. Master Epps would be back soon, but if he would\nsee me that night after all were asleep, I would repeat it to him. He\nconsented readily to the arrangement, and directed me to come into\nthe building where we were then at work, and I would find him there.\nAbout midnight, when all was still and quiet, I crept cautiously from\nmy cabin, and silently entering the unfinished building, found him\nawaiting me.\n\nAfter further assurances on his part that I should not be betrayed,\nI began a relation of the history of my life and misfortunes. He\nwas deeply interested, asking numerous questions in reference to\nlocalities and events. Having ended my story I besought him to\nwrite to some of my friends at the North, acquainting them with my\nsituation, and begging them to forward free papers, or take such steps\nas they might consider proper to secure my release. He promised to do\nso, but dwelt upon the danger of such an act in case of detection,\nand now impressed upon me the great necessity of strict silence and\nsecresy. Before we parted our plan of operation was arranged.\n\nWe agreed to meet the next night at a specified place among the high\nweeds on the bank of the bayou, some distance from master's dwelling.\nThere he was to write down on paper the names and address of several\npersons, old friends in the North, to whom he would direct letters\nduring his next visit to Marksville. It was not deemed prudent to\nmeet in the new house, inasmuch as the light it would be necessary to\nuse might possibly be discovered. In the course of the day I managed\nto obtain a few matches and a piece of candle, unperceived, from the\nkitchen, during a temporary absence of Aunt Phebe. Bass had pencil and\npaper in his tool chest.\n\nAt the appointed hour we met on the bayou bank, and creeping among\nthe high weeds, I lighted the candle, while he drew forth pencil and\npaper and prepared for business. I gave him the names of William\nPerry, Cephas Parker and Judge Marvin, all of Saratoga Springs,\nSaratoga county, New-York. I had been employed by the latter in the\nUnited States Hotel, and had transacted business with the former to a\nconsiderable extent, and trusted that at least one of them would be\nstill living at that place. He carefully wrote the names, and then\nremarked, thoughtfully--\n\n\"It is so many years since you left Saratoga, all these men may be\ndead, or may have removed. You say you obtained papers at the custom\nhouse in New-York. Probably there is a record of them there, and I\nthink it would be well to write and ascertain.\"\n\nI agreed with him, and again repeated the circumstances related\nheretofore, connected with my visit to the custom house with Brown\nand Hamilton. We lingered on the bank of the bayou an hour or more,\nconversing upon the subject which now engrossed our thoughts. I\ncould no longer doubt his fidelity, and freely spoke to him of the\nmany sorrows I had borne in silence, and so long. I spoke of my wife\nand children, mentioning their names and ages, and dwelling upon the\nunspeakable happiness it would be to clasp them to my heart once\nmore before I died. I caught him by the hand, and with tears and\npassionate entreaties implored him to befriend me--to restore me to my\nkindred and to liberty--promising I would weary Heaven the remainder\nof my life with prayers that it would bless and prosper him. In the\nenjoyment of freedom--surrounded by the associations of youth, and\nrestored to the bosom of my family--that promise is not yet forgotten,\nnor shall it ever be so long as I have strength to raise my imploring\neyes on high.\n\n    \"Oh, blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair,\n    And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there.\"\n\nHe overwhelmed me with assurances of friendship and faithfulness,\nsaying he had never before taken so deep an interest in the fate of\nany one. He spoke of himself in a somewhat mournful tone, as a lonely\nman, a wanderer about the world--that he was growing old, and must\nsoon reach the end of his earthly journey, and lie down to his final\nrest without kith or kin to mourn for him, or to remember him--that\nhis life was of little value to himself, and henceforth should be\ndevoted to the accomplishment of my liberty, and to an unceasing\nwarfare against the accursed shame of Slavery.\n\nAfter this time we seldom spoke to, or recognized each other. He was,\nmoreover, less free in his conversation with Epps on the subject\nof Slavery. The remotest suspicion that there was any unusual\nintimacy--any secret understanding between us--never once entered the\nmind of Epps, or any other person, white or black, on the plantation.\n\nI am often asked, with an air of incredulity, how I succeeded so many\nyears in keeping from my daily and constant companions the knowledge\nof my true name and history. The terrible lesson Burch taught me,\nimpressed indelibly upon my mind the danger and uselessness of\nasserting I was a freeman. There was no possibility of any slave being\nable to assist me, while, on the other hand, there _was_ a possibility\nof his exposing me. When it is recollected the whole current of my\nthoughts, for twelve years, turned to the contemplation of escape, it\nwill not be wondered at, that I was always cautious and on my guard.\nIt would have been an act of folly to have proclaimed my _right_ to\nfreedom; it would only have subjected me to severer scrutiny--probably\nhave consigned me to some more distant and inaccessible region than\neven Bayou Boeuf. Edwin Epps was a person utterly regardless of a\nblack man's rights or wrongs--utterly destitute of any natural sense\nof justice, as I well knew. It was important, therefore, not only as\nregarded my hope of deliverance, but also as regarded the few personal\nprivileges I was permitted to enjoy, to keep from him the history of\nmy life.\n\nThe Saturday night subsequent to our interview at the water's edge,\nBass went home to Marksville. The next day, being Sunday, he employed\nhimself in his own room writing letters. One he directed to the\nCollector of Customs at New-York, another to Judge Marvin, and another\nto Messrs. Parker and Perry jointly. The latter was the one which led\nto my recovery. He subscribed my true name, but in the postscript\nintimated I was not the writer. The letter itself shows that he\nconsidered himself engaged in a dangerous undertaking--no less than\nrunning \"the risk of his life, if detected.\" I did not see the letter\nbefore it was mailed, but have since obtained a copy, which is here\ninserted:\n\n                                   \"Bayou Boeuf, August 15, 1852.\n\n     \"Mr. WILLIAM PERRY or Mr. CEPHAS PARKER:\n\n     \"Gentlemen--It having been a long time since I have seen or\n     heard from you, and not knowing that you are living, it is with\n     uncertainty that I write to you, but the necessity of the case\n     must be my excuse.\n\n     \"Having been born free, just across the river from you, I am\n     certain you must know me, and I am here now a slave. I wish you to\n     obtain free papers for me, and forward them to me at Marksville,\n     Louisiana, Parish of Avoyelles, and oblige\n\n                                   \"Yours, SOLOMON NORTHUP.\n\n     \"The way I came to be a slave, I was taken sick in Washington\n     City, and was insensible for some time. When I recovered my\n     reason, I was robbed of my free-papers, and in irons on my way to\n     this State, and have never been able to get any one to write for\n     me until now; and he that is writing for me runs the risk of his\n     life if detected.\"\n\nThe allusion to myself in the work recently issued, entitled \"A Key to\nUncle Tom's Cabin,\" contains the first part of this letter, omitting\nthe postscript. Neither are the full names of the gentlemen to whom\nit is directed correctly stated, there being a slight discrepancy,\nprobably a typographical error. To the postscript more than to the\nbody of the communication am I indebted for my liberation, as will\npresently be seen.\n\nWhen Bass returned from Marksville he informed me of what he had done.\nWe continued our midnight consultations, never speaking to each other\nthrough the day, excepting as it was necessary about the work. As\nnearly as he was able to ascertain, it would require two weeks for the\nletter to reach Saratoga in due course of mail, and the same length of\ntime for an answer to return. Within six weeks, at the farthest, we\nconcluded, an answer would arrive, if it arrived at all. A great many\nsuggestions were now made, and a great deal of conversation took place\nbetween us, as to the most safe and proper course to pursue on receipt\nof the free papers. They would stand between him and harm, in case we\nwere overtaken and arrested leaving the country altogether. It would\nbe no infringement of law, however much it might provoke individual\nhostility, to assist a freeman to regain his freedom.\n\nAt the end of four weeks he was again at Marksville, but no answer\nhad arrived. I was sorely disappointed, but still reconciled myself\nwith the reflection that sufficient length of time had not yet\nelapsed--that there might have been delays--and that I could not\nreasonably expect one so soon. Six, seven, eight, and ten weeks passed\nby, however, and nothing came. I was in a fever of suspense whenever\nBass visited Marksville, and could scarcely close my eyes until his\nreturn. Finally my master's house was finished, and the time came when\nBass must leave me. The night before his departure I was wholly given\nup to despair. I had clung to him as a drowning man clings to the\nfloating spar, knowing if it slips from his grasp he must forever sink\nbeneath the waves. The all-glorious hope, upon which I had laid such\neager hold, was crumbling to ashes in my hands. I felt as if sinking\ndown, down, amidst the bitter waters of Slavery, from the unfathomable\ndepths of which I should never rise again.\n\nThe generous heart of my friend and benefactor was touched with pity\nat the sight of my distress. He endeavored to cheer me up, promising\nto return the day before Christmas, and if no intelligence was\nreceived in the meantime, some further step would be undertaken to\neffect our design. He exhorted me to keep up my spirits--to rely upon\nhis continued efforts in my behalf, assuring me, in most earnest and\nimpressive language, that my liberation should, from thenceforth, be\nthe chief object of his thoughts.\n\nIn his absence the time passed slowly indeed. I looked forward to\nChristmas with intense anxiety and impatience. I had about given up\nthe expectation of receiving any answer to the letters. They might\nhave miscarried, or might have been misdirected. Perhaps those at\nSaratoga, to whom they had been addressed, were all dead; perhaps,\nengaged in their pursuits, they did not consider the fate of an\nobscure, unhappy black man of sufficient importance to be noticed. My\nwhole reliance was in Bass. The faith I had in him was continually\nre-assuring me, and enabled me to stand up against the tide of\ndisappointment that had overwhelmed me.\n\nSo wholly was I absorbed in reflecting upon my situation and\nprospects, that the hands with whom I labored in the field often\nobserved it. Patsey would ask me if I was sick, and Uncle Abram, and\nBob, and Wiley frequently expressed a curiosity to know what I could\nbe thinking about so steadily. But I evaded their inquiries with some\nlight remark, and kept my thoughts locked closely in my breast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n  BASS FAITHFUL TO HIS WORD--HIS ARRIVAL ON CHRISTMAS EVE--THE\n  DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW--THE MEETING IN THE\n  CABIN--NON-ARRIVAL OF THE LETTER--BASS ANNOUNCES HIS INTENTION TO\n  PROCEED NORTH--CHRISTMAS--CONVERSATION BETWEEN EPPS AND BASS--YOUNG\n  MISTRESS M'COY, THE BEAUTY OF BAYOU BOEUF--THE \"NE PLUS ULTRA\"\n  OF DINNERS--MUSIC AND DANCING--PRESENCE OF THE MISTRESS--HER\n  EXCEEDING BEAUTY--THE LAST SLAVE DANCE--WILLIAM PIERCE--OVERSLEEP\n  MYSELF--THE LAST WHIPPING--DESPONDENCY--THE COLD MORNING--EPPS'\n  THREATS--THE PASSING CARRIAGE--STRANGERS APPROACHING THROUGH THE\n  COTTON-FIELD--LAST HOUR ON BAYOU BOEUF.\n\n\nFaithful to his word, the day before Christmas, just at night-fall,\nBass came riding into the yard.\n\n\"How are you,\" said Epps, shaking him by the hand, \"glad to see you.\"\n\nHe would not have been _very_ glad had he known the object of his\nerrand.\n\n\"Quite well, quite well,\" answered Bass. \"Had some business out on the\nbayou, and concluded to call and see you, and stay over night.\"\n\nEpps ordered one of the slaves to take charge of his horse, and with\nmuch talk and laughter they passed into the house together; not,\nhowever, until Bass had looked at me significantly, as much as to\nsay, \"Keep dark, we understand each other.\" It was ten o'clock at\nnight before the labors of the day were performed, when I entered the\ncabin. At that time Uncle Abram and Bob occupied it with me. I laid\ndown upon my board and feigned I was asleep. When my companions had\nfallen into a profound slumber, I moved stealthily out of the door,\nand watched, and listened attentively for some sign or sound from\nBass. There I stood until long after midnight, but nothing could be\nseen or heard. As I suspected, he dared not leave the house, through\nfear of exciting the suspicion of some of the family. I judged,\ncorrectly, he would rise earlier than was his custom, and take the\nopportunity of seeing me before Epps was up. Accordingly I aroused\nUncle Abram an hour sooner than usual, and sent him into the house to\nbuild a fire, which, at that season of the year, is a part of Uncle\nAbram's duties.\n\nI also gave Bob a violent shake, and asked him if he intended to sleep\ntill noon, saying master would be up before the mules were fed. He\nknew right well the consequence that would follow such an event, and,\njumping to his feet, was at the horse-pasture in a twinkling.\n\nPresently, when both were gone, Bass slipped into the cabin.\n\n\"No letter yet, Platt,\" said he. The announcement fell upon my heart\nlike lead.\n\n\"Oh, _do_ write again, Master Bass,\" I cried; \"I will give you the\nnames of a great many I know. Surely they are not all dead. Surely\nsome one will pity me.\"\n\n\"No use,\" Bass replied, \"no use. I have made up my mind to that.\nI fear the Marksville post-master will mistrust something, I have\ninquired so often at his office. Too uncertain--too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Then it is all over,\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, my God, how can I end my days\nhere!\"\n\n\"You're not going to end them here,\" he said, \"unless you die\nvery soon. I've thought this matter all over, and have come to a\ndetermination. There are more ways than one to manage this business,\nand a better and surer way than writing letters. I have a job or two\non hand which can be completed by March or April. By that time I shall\nhave a considerable sum of money, and then, Platt, I am going to\nSaratoga myself.\"\n\nI could scarcely credit my own senses as the words fell from his lips.\nBut he assured me, in a manner that left no doubt of the sincerity of\nhis intention, that if his life was spared until spring, he should\ncertainly undertake the journey.\n\n\"I have lived in this region long enough,\" he continued; \"I may as\nwell be in one place as another. For a long time I have been thinking\nof going back once more to the place where I was born. I'm tired of\nSlavery as well as you. If I can succeed in getting you away from\nhere, it will be a good act that I shall like to think of all my life.\nAnd I _shall_ succeed, Platt; I'm _bound_ to do it. Now let me tell\nyou what I want. Epps will be up soon, and it won't do to be caught\nhere. Think of a great many men at Saratoga and Sandy Hill, and in\nthat neighborhood, who once knew you. I shall make excuse to come here\nagain in the course of the winter, when I will write down their names.\nI will then know who to call on when I go north. Think of all you can.\nCheer up! Don't be discouraged. I'm with you, life or death. Good-bye.\nGod bless you,\" and saying this he left the cabin quickly, and entered\nthe great house.\n\nIt was Christmas morning--the happiest day in the whole year for the\nslave. That morning he need not hurry to the field, with his gourd\nand cotton-bag. Happiness sparkled in the eyes and overspread the\ncountenances of all. The time of feasting and dancing had come. The\ncane and cotton fields were deserted. That day the clean dress was\nto be donned--the red ribbon displayed; there were to be re-unions,\nand joy and laughter, and hurrying to and fro. It was to be a day of\n_liberty_ among the children of Slavery. Wherefore they were happy,\nand rejoiced.\n\nAfter breakfast Epps and Bass sauntered about the yard, conversing\nupon the price of cotton, and various other topics.\n\n\"Where do your niggers hold Christmas?\" Bass inquired.\n\n\"Platt is going to Tanners to-day. His fiddle is in great demand.\nThey want him at Marshall's Monday, and Miss Mary McCoy, on the old\nNorwood plantation, writes me a note that she wants him to play for\nher niggers Tuesday.\"\n\n\"He is rather a smart boy, ain't he?\" said Bass. \"Come here, Platt,\"\nhe added, looking at me as I walked up to them, as if he had never\nthought before to take any special notice of me.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Epps, taking hold of my arm and feeling it, \"there\nisn't a bad joint in him. There ain't a boy on the bayou worth more\nthan he is--perfectly sound, and no bad tricks. D--n him, he isn't\nlike other niggers; doesn't look like 'em--don't act like 'em. I was\noffered seventeen hundred dollars for him last week.\"\n\n\"And didn't take it?\" Bass inquired, with an air of surprise.\n\n\"Take it--no; devilish clear of it. Why, he's a reg'lar genius; can\nmake a plough beam, wagon tongue--anything, as well as you can.\nMarshall wanted to put up one of his niggers agin him and raffle for\nthem, but I told him I would see the devil have him first.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything remarkable about him,\" Bass observed.\n\n\"Why, just feel of him, now,\" Epps rejoined. \"You don't see a boy very\noften put together any closer than he is. He's a thin-skin'd cuss, and\nwon't bear as much whipping as some; but he's got the muscle in him,\nand no mistake.\"\n\nBass felt of me, turned me round, and made a thorough examination,\nEpps all the while dwelling on my good points. But his visitor seemed\nto take but little interest finally in the subject, and consequently\nit was dropped. Bass soon departed, giving me another sly look of\nrecognition and significance, as he trotted out of the yard.\n\nWhen he was gone I obtained a pass, and started for Tanner's--not\nPeter Tanner's, of whom mention has previously been made, but a\nrelative of his. I played during the day and most of the night,\nspending the next day, Sunday, in my cabin. Monday I crossed the\nbayou to Douglas Marshall's, all Epps' slaves accompanying me, and on\nTuesday went to the old Norwood place, which is the third plantation\nabove Marshall's, on the same side of the water.\n\nThis estate is now owned by Miss Mary McCoy, a lovely girl, some\ntwenty years of age. She is the beauty and the glory of Bayou Boeuf.\nShe owns about a hundred working hands, besides a great many house\nservants, yard boys, and young children. Her brother-in-law, who\nresides on the adjoining estate, is her general agent. She is beloved\nby all her slaves, and good reason indeed have they to be thankful\nthat they have fallen into such gentle hands. Nowhere on the bayou\nare there such feasts, such merrymaking, as at young Madam McCoy's.\nThither, more than to any other place, do the old and the young for\nmiles around love to repair in the time of the Christmas holidays; for\nnowhere else can they find such delicious repasts; nowhere else can\nthey hear a voice speaking to them so pleasantly. No one is so well\nbeloved--no one fills so large a space in the hearts of a thousand\nslaves, as young Madam McCoy, the orphan mistress of the old Norwood\nestate.\n\nOn my arrival at her place, I found two or three hundred had\nassembled. The table was prepared in a long building, which she had\nerected expressly for her slaves to dance in. It was covered with\nevery variety of food the country afforded, and was pronounced by\ngeneral acclamation to be the rarest of dinners. Roast turkey, pig,\nchicken, duck, and all kinds of meat, baked, boiled, and broiled,\nformed a line the whole length of the extended table, while the vacant\nspaces were filled with tarts, jellies, and frosted cake, and pastry\nof many kinds. The young mistress walked around the table, smiling\nand saying a kind word to each one, and seemed to enjoy the scene\nexceedingly.\n\nWhen the dinner was over the tables were removed to make room for the\ndancers. I tuned my violin and struck up a lively air; while some\njoined in a nimble reel, others patted and sang their simple but\nmelodious songs, filling the great room with music mingled with the\nsound of human voices and the clatter of many feet.\n\nIn the evening the mistress returned, and stood in the door a long\ntime, looking at us. She was magnificently arrayed. Her dark hair and\neyes contrasted strongly with her clear and delicate complexion. Her\nform was slender but commanding, and her movement was a combination\nof unaffected dignity and grace. As she stood there, clad in her\nrich apparel, her face animated with pleasure, I thought I had never\nlooked upon a human being half so beautiful. I dwell with delight upon\nthe description of this fair and gentle lady, not only because she\ninspired me with emotions of gratitude and admiration, but because I\nwould have the reader understand that all slave-owners on Bayou Boeuf\nare not like Epps, or Tibeats, or Jim Burns. Occasionally can be\nfound, rarely it may be, indeed, a good man like William Ford, or an\nangel of kindness like young Mistress McCoy.\n\nTuesday concluded the three holidays Epps yearly allowed us. On my\nway home, Wednesday morning, while passing the plantation of William\nPierce, that gentleman hailed me, saying he had received a line from\nEpps, brought down by William Varnell, permitting him to detain me\nfor the purpose of playing for his slaves that night. It was the last\ntime I was destined to witness a slave dance on the shores of Bayou\nBoeuf. The party at Pierce's continued their jollification until broad\ndaylight, when I returned to my master's house, somewhat wearied with\nthe loss of rest, but rejoicing in the possession of numerous bits\nand picayunes, which the whites, who were pleased with my musical\nperformances, had contributed.\n\nOn Saturday morning, for the first time in years, I overslept myself.\nI was frightened on coming out of the cabin to find the slaves were\nalready in the field. They had preceded me some fifteen minutes.\nLeaving my dinner and water-gourd, I hurried after them as fast as I\ncould move. It was not yet sunrise, but Epps was on the piazza as I\nleft the hut, and cried out to me that it was a pretty time of day\nto be getting up. By extra exertion my row was up when he came out\nafter breakfast. This, however, was no excuse for the offence of\noversleeping. Bidding me strip and lie down, he gave me ten or fifteen\nlashes, at the conclusion of which he inquired if I thought, after\nthat, I could get up sometime in the _morning_. I expressed myself\nquite positively that I _could_, and, with back stinging with pain,\nwent about my work.\n\nThe following day, Sunday, my thoughts were upon Bass, and the\nprobabilities and hopes which hung upon his action and determination.\nI considered the uncertainty of life; that if it should be the will\nof God that he should die, my prospect of deliverance, and all\nexpectation of happiness in this world, would be wholly ended and\ndestroyed. My sore back, perhaps, did not have a tendency to render me\nunusually cheerful. I felt down-hearted and unhappy all day long, and\nwhen I laid down upon the hard board at night, my heart was oppressed\nwith such a load of grief, it seemed that it must break.\n\nMonday morning, the third of January, 1853, we were in the field\nbetimes. It was a raw, cold morning, such as is unusual in that\nregion. I was in advance, Uncle Abram next to me, behind him Bob,\nPatsey and Wiley, with our cotton-bags about our necks. Epps happened\n(a rare thing, indeed,) to come out that morning without his whip.\nHe swore, in a manner that would shame a pirate, that we were doing\nnothing. Bob ventured to say that his fingers were so numb with cold\nhe couldn't pick fast. Epps cursed himself for not having brought his\nrawhide, and declared that when he came out again he would warm us\nwell; yes, he would make us all hotter than that fiery realm in which\nI am sometimes compelled to believe he will himself eventually reside.\n\nWith these fervent expressions, he left us. When out of hearing,\nwe commenced talking to each other, saying how hard it was to be\ncompelled to keep up our tasks with numb fingers; how unreasonable\nmaster was, and speaking of him generally in no flattering terms. Our\nconversation was interrupted by a carriage passing rapidly towards\nthe house. Looking up, we saw two men approaching us through the\ncotton-field.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHaving now brought down this narrative to the last hour I was to spend\non Bayou Boeuf--having gotten through my last cotton picking, and\nabout to bid Master Epps farewell--I must beg the reader to go back\nwith me to the month of August; to follow Bass' letter on its long\njourney to Saratoga; to learn the effect it produced--and that, while\nI was repining and despairing in the slave hut of Edwin Epps, through\nthe friendship of Bass and the goodness of Providence, all things were\nworking together for my deliverance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n  THE LETTER REACHES SARATOGA--IS FORWARDED TO ANNE--IS LAID\n  BEFORE HENRY B. NORTHUP--THE STATUTE OF MAY 14, 1840--ITS\n  PROVISIONS--ANNE'S MEMORIAL TO THE GOVERNOR--THE AFFIDAVITS\n  ACCOMPANYING IT--SENATOR SOULE'S LETTER--DEPARTURE OF THE AGENT\n  APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR--ARRIVAL AT MARKSVILLE--THE HON. JOHN\n  P. WADDILL--THE CONVERSATION ON NEW-YORK POLITICS--IT SUGGESTS\n  A FORTUNATE IDEA--THE MEETING WITH BASS--THE SECRET OUT--LEGAL\n  PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED--DEPARTURE OF NORTHUP AND THE SHERIFF FROM\n  MARKSVILLE FOR BAYOU BOEUF--ARRANGEMENTS ON THE WAY--REACH EPPS'\n  PLANTATION--DISCOVER HIS SLAVES IN THE COTTON FIELD--THE MEETING--THE\n  FAREWELL.\n\n\nI am indebted to Mr. Henry B. Northup and others for many of the\nparticulars contained in this chapter.\n\nThe letter written by Bass, directed to Parker and Perry, and which\nwas deposited in the post-office in Marksville on the 15th day of\nAugust, 1852, arrived at Saratoga in the early part of September.\nSome time previous to this, Anne had removed to Glens Falls, Warren\ncounty, where she had charge of the kitchen in Carpenter's Hotel. She\nkept house, however, lodging with our children, and was only absent\nfrom them during such time as the discharge of her duties in the hotel\nrequired.\n\nMessrs. Parker and Perry, on receipt of the letter, forwarded it\nimmediately to Anne. On reading it the children were all excitement,\nand without delay hastened to the neighboring village of Sandy Hill,\nto consult Henry B. Northup, and obtain his advice and assistance in\nthe matter.\n\nUpon examination, that gentleman found among the statutes of the State\nan act providing for the recovery of free citizens from slavery. It\nwas passed May 14, 1840, and is entitled \"An act more effectually\nto protect the free citizens of this State from being kidnapped or\nreduced to slavery.\" It provides that it shall be the duty of the\nGovernor, upon the receipt of satisfactory information that any free\ncitizen or inhabitant of this State, is wrongfully held in another\nState or Territory of the United States, upon the allegation or\npretence that such person is a slave, or by color of any usage or\nrule of law is deemed or taken to be a slave, to take such measures\nto procure the restoration of such person to liberty, as he shall\ndeem necessary. And to that end, he is authorized to appoint and\nemploy an agent, and directed to furnish him with such credentials\nand instructions as will be likely to accomplish the object of his\nappointment. It requires the agent so appointed to proceed to collect\nthe proper proof to establish the right of such person to his freedom;\nto perform such journeys, take such measures, institute such legal\nproceedings, &c., as may be necessary to return such person to this\nState, and charges all expenses incurred in carrying the act into\neffect, upon moneys not otherwise appropriated in the treasury.[1]\n\nIt was necessary to establish two facts to the satisfaction of the\nGovernor: First, that I was a free citizen of New-York; and secondly,\nthat I was wrongfully held in bondage. As to the first point, there\nwas no difficulty, all the older inhabitants in the vicinity being\nready to testify to it. The second point rested entirely upon the\nletter to Parker and Perry, written in an unknown hand, and upon the\nletter penned on board the brig Orleans, which, unfortunately, had\nbeen mislaid or lost.\n\nA memorial was prepared, directed to his excellency, Governor Hunt,\nsetting forth her marriage, my departure to Washington city; the\nreceipt of the letters; that I was a free citizen, and such other\nfacts as were deemed important, and was signed and verified by Anne.\nAccompanying this memorial were several affidavits of prominent\ncitizens of Sandy Hill and Fort Edward, corroborating fully the\nstatements it contained, and also a request of several well known\ngentlemen to the Governor, that Henry B. Northup be appointed agent\nunder the legislative act.\n\nOn reading the memorial and affidavits, his excellency took a lively\ninterest in the matter, and on the 23d day of November, 1852, under\nthe seal of the State, \"constituted, appointed and employed Henry B.\nNorthup, Esq., an agent, with full power to effect\" my restoration,\nand to take such measures as would be most likely to accomplish\nit, and instructing him to proceed to Louisiana with all convenient\ndispatch.[2]\n\nThe pressing nature of Mr. Northup's professional and political\nengagements delayed his departure until December. On the fourteenth\nday of that month he left Sandy Hill, and proceeded to Washington.\nThe Hon. Pierre Soule, Senator in Congress from Louisiana, Hon. Mr.\nConrad, Secretary of War, and Judge Nelson, of the Supreme Court\nof the United States, upon hearing a statement of the facts, and\nexamining his commission, and certified copies of the memorial and\naffidavits, furnished him with open letters to gentlemen in Louisiana,\nstrongly urging their assistance in accomplishing the object of his\nappointment.\n\nSenator Soule especially interested himself in the matter, insisting,\nin forcible language, that it was the duty and interest of every\nplanter in his State to aid in restoring me to freedom, and trusted\nthe sentiments of honor and justice in the bosom of every citizen\nof the commonwealth would enlist him at once in my behalf. Having\nobtained these valuable letters, Mr. Northup returned to Baltimore,\nand proceeded from thence to Pittsburgh. It was his original\nintention, under advice of friends at Washington, to go directly to\nNew Orleans, and consult the authorities of that city. Providentially,\nhowever, on arriving at the mouth of Red River, he changed his mind.\nHad he continued on, he would not have met with Bass, in which case\nthe search for me would probably have been fruitless.\n\nTaking passage on the first steamer that arrived, he pursued his\njourney up Red River, a sluggish, winding stream, flowing through\na vast region of primitive forests and impenetrable swamps, almost\nwholly destitute of inhabitants. About nine o'clock in the forenoon,\nJanuary 1st, 1853, he left the steamboat at Marksville, and proceeded\ndirectly to Marksville Court House, a small village four miles in the\ninterior.\n\nFrom the fact that the letter to Messrs. Parker and Perry was\npost-marked at Marksville, it was supposed by him that I was in\nthat place or its immediate vicinity. On reaching this town, he at\nonce laid his business before the Hon. John P. Waddill, a legal\ngentleman of distinction, and a man of fine genius and most noble\nimpulses. After reading the letters and documents presented him, and\nlistening to a representation of the circumstances under which I had\nbeen carried away into captivity, Mr. Waddill at once proffered his\nservices, and entered into the affair with great zeal and earnestness.\nHe, in common with others of like elevated character, looked upon the\nkidnapper with abhorrence. The title of his fellow parishioners and\nclients to the property which constituted the larger proportion of\ntheir wealth, not only depended upon the good faith in which slave\nsales were transacted, but he was a man in whose honorable heart\nemotions of indignation were aroused by such an instance of injustice.\n\nMarksville, although occupying a prominent position, and standing out\nin impressive italics on the map of Louisiana, is, in fact, but a\nsmall and insignificant hamlet. Aside from the tavern, kept by a jolly\nand generous boniface, the court house, inhabited by lawless cows\nand swine in the seasons of vacation, and a high gallows, with its\ndissevered rope dangling in the air, there is little to attract the\nattention of the stranger.\n\nSolomon Northup was a name Mr. Waddill had never heard, but he was\nconfident that if there was a slave bearing that appellation in\nMarksville or vicinity, his black boy Tom would know him. Tom was\naccordingly called, but in all his extensive circle of acquaintances\nthere was no such personage.\n\nThe letter to Parker and Perry was dated at Bayou Boeuf. At this\nplace, therefore, the conclusion was, I must be sought. But here a\ndifficulty suggested itself, of a very grave character indeed. Bayou\nBoeuf, at its nearest point, was twenty-three miles distant, and was\nthe name applied to the section of country extending between fifty\nand a hundred miles, on both sides of that stream. Thousands and\nthousands of slaves resided upon its shores, the remarkable richness\nand fertility of the soil having attracted thither a great number of\nplanters. The information in the letter was so vague and indefinite\nas to render it difficult to conclude upon any specific course of\nproceeding. It was finally determined, however, as the only plan that\npresented any prospect of success, that Northup and the brother of\nWaddill, a student in the office of the latter, should repair to the\nBayou, and traveling up one side and down the other its whole length,\ninquire at each plantation for me. Mr. Waddill tendered the use of his\ncarriage, and it was definitely arranged that they should start upon\nthe excursion early Monday morning.\n\nIt will be seen at once that this course, in all probability, would\nhave resulted unsuccessfully. It would have been impossible for them\nto have gone into the fields and examine all the gangs at work. They\nwere not aware that I was known only as Platt; and had they inquired\nof Epps himself, he would have stated truly that he knew nothing of\nSolomon Northup.\n\nThe arrangement being adopted, however, there was nothing further to\nbe done until Sunday had elapsed. The conversation between Messrs.\nNorthup and Waddill, in the course of the afternoon, turned upon\nNew-York politics.\n\n\"I can scarcely comprehend the nice distinctions and shades of\npolitical parties in your State,\" observed Mr. Waddill. \"I read of\nsoft-shells and hard-shells, hunkers and barnburners, woolly-heads\nand silver-grays, and am unable to understand the precise difference\nbetween them. Pray, what is it?\"\n\nMr. Northup, re-filling his pipe, entered into quite an elaborate\nnarrative of the origin of the various sections of parties, and\nconcluded by saying there was another party in New-York, known as\nfree-soilers or abolitionists. \"You have seen none of those in this\npart of the country, I presume?\" Mr. Northup remarked.\n\n\"Never, but one,\" answered Waddill, laughingly. \"We have one here\nin Marksville, an eccentric creature, who preaches abolitionism as\nvehemently as any fanatic at the North. He is a generous, inoffensive\nman, but always maintaining the wrong side of an argument. It affords\nus a deal of amusement. He is an excellent mechanic, and almost\nindispensable in this community. He is a carpenter. His name is Bass.\"\n\nSome further good-natured conversation was had at the expense of Bass'\npeculiarities, when Waddill all at once fell into a reflective mood,\nand asked for the mysterious letter again.\n\n\"Let me see--l-e-t m-e s-e-e!\" he repeated, thoughtfully to himself,\nrunning his eyes over the letter once more. \"'Bayou Boeuf, August 15.'\nAugust 15--post-marked here. 'He that is writing for me--' Where did\nBass work last summer?\" he inquired, turning suddenly to his brother.\nHis brother was unable to inform him, but rising, left the office,\nand soon returned with the intelligence that \"Bass worked last summer\nsomewhere on Bayou Boeuf.\"\n\n\"He is the man,\" bringing down his hand emphatically on the table,\n\"who can tell us all about Solomon Northup,\" exclaimed Waddill.\n\nBass was immediately searched for, but could not be found. After some\ninquiry, it was ascertained he was at the landing on Red River.\nProcuring a conveyance, young Waddill and Northup were not long in\ntraversing the few miles to the latter place. On their arrival, Bass\nwas found, just on the point of leaving, to be absent a fortnight or\nmore. After an introduction, Northup begged the privilege of speaking\nto him privately a moment. They walked together towards the river,\nwhen the following conversation ensued:\n\n\"Mr. Bass,\" said Northup, \"allow me to ask you if you were on Bayou\nBoeuf last August?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was there in August,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Did you write a letter for a colored man at that place to some\ngentleman in Saratoga Springs?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, if I say that is none of your business,\" answered\nBass, stopping and looking his interrogator searchingly in the face.\n\n\"Perhaps I am rather hasty, Mr. Bass; I beg your pardon; but I have\ncome from the State of New-York to accomplish the purpose the writer\nof a letter dated the 15th of August, post-marked at Marksville, had\nin view. Circumstances have led me to think that you are perhaps the\nman who wrote it. I am in search of Solomon Northup. If you know him,\nI beg you to inform me frankly where he is, and I assure you the\nsource of any information you may give me shall not be divulged, if\nyou desire it not to be.\"\n\nA long time Bass looked his new acquaintance steadily in the eyes,\nwithout opening his lips. He seemed to be doubting in his own mind if\nthere was not an attempt to practice some deception upon him. Finally\nhe said, deliberately--\n\n\"I have done nothing to be ashamed of. I am the man who wrote the\nletter. If you have come to rescue Solomon Northup, I am glad to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"When did you last see him, and where is he?\" Northup inquired.\n\n\"I last saw him Christmas, a week ago to-day. He is the slave of Edwin\nEpps, a planter on Bayou Boeuf, near Holmesville. He is not known as\nSolomon Northup; he is called Platt.\"\n\nThe secret was out--the mystery was unraveled. Through the thick,\nblack cloud, amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve\nyears, broke the star that was to light me back to liberty. All\nmistrust and hesitation were soon thrown aside, and the two men\nconversed long and freely upon the subject uppermost in their\nthoughts. Bass expressed the interest he had taken in my behalf--his\nintention of going north in the Spring, and declaring that he had\nresolved to accomplish my emancipation, if it were in his power. He\ndescribed the commencement and progress of his acquaintance with me,\nand listened with eager curiosity to the account given him of my\nfamily, and the history of my early life. Before separating, he drew\na map of the bayou on a strip of paper with a piece of red chalk,\nshowing the locality of Epps' plantation, and the road leading most\ndirectly to it.\n\nNorthup and his young companion returned to Marksville, where it\nwas determined to commence legal proceedings to test the question\nof my right to freedom. I was made plaintiff, Mr. Northup acting as\nmy guardian, and Edwin Epps defendant. The process to be issued was\nin the nature of replevin, directed to the sheriff of the parish,\ncommanding him to take me into custody, and detain me until the\ndecision of the court. By the time the papers were duly drawn up,\nit was twelve o'clock at night--too late to obtain the necessary\nsignature of the Judge, who resided some distance out of town. Further\nbusiness was therefore suspended until Monday morning.\n\nEverything, apparently, was moving along swimmingly, until Sunday\nafternoon, when Waddill called at Northup's room to express his\napprehension of difficulties they had not expected to encounter. Bass\nhad become alarmed, and had placed his affairs in the hands of a\nperson at the landing, communicating to him his intention of leaving\nthe State. This person had betrayed the confidence reposed in him to\na certain extent, and a rumor began to float about the town, that\nthe stranger at the hotel, who had been observed in the company of\nlawyer Waddill, was after one of old Epps' slaves, over on the bayou.\nEpps was known at Marksville, having frequent occasion to visit that\nplace during the session of the courts, and the fear entertained by\nMr. Northup's adviser was, that intelligence would be conveyed to him\nin the night, giving him an opportunity of secreting me before the\narrival of the sheriff.\n\nThis apprehension had the effect of expediting matters considerably.\nThe sheriff, who lived in one direction from the village, was\nrequested to hold himself in readiness immediately after midnight,\nwhile the Judge was informed he would be called upon at the same\ntime. It is but justice to say, that the authorities at Marksville\ncheerfully rendered all the assistance in their power.\n\nAs soon after midnight as bail could be perfected, and the Judge's\nsignature obtained, a carriage, containing Mr. Northup and the\nsheriff, driven by the landlord's son, rolled rapidly out of the\nvillage of Marksville, on the road towards Bayou Boeuf.\n\nIt was supposed that Epps would contest the issue involving my right\nto liberty, and it therefore suggested itself to Mr. Northup, that\nthe testimony of the sheriff, describing my first meeting with the\nformer, might perhaps become material on the trial. It was accordingly\narranged during the ride, that, before I had an opportunity of\nspeaking to Mr. Northup, the sheriff should propound to me certain\nquestions agreed upon, such as the number and names of my children,\nthe name of my wife before marriage, of places I knew at the North,\nand so forth. If my answers corresponded with the statements given\nhim, the evidence must necessarily be considered conclusive.\n\nAt length, shortly after Epps had left the field, with the consoling\nassurance that he would soon return and _warm_ us, as was stated\nin the conclusion of the preceding chapter, they came in sight of\nthe plantation, and discovered us at work. Alighting from the\ncarriage, and directing the driver to proceed to the great house, with\ninstructions not to mention to any one the object of their errand\nuntil they met again, Northup and the sheriff turned from the highway,\nand came towards us across the cotton field. We observed them, on\nlooking up at the carriage--one several rods in advance of the other.\nIt was a singular and unusual thing to see white men approaching us\nin that manner, and especially at that early hour in the morning,\nand Uncle Abram and Patsey made some remarks, expressive of their\nastonishment. Walking up to Bob, the sheriff inquired:\n\n\"Where's the boy they call Platt?\"\n\n\"Thar he is, massa,\" answered Bob, pointing to me, and twitching off\nhis hat.\n\nI wondered to myself what business he could possibly have with me, and\nturning round, gazed at him until he had approached within a step.\nDuring my long residence on the bayou, I had become familiar with the\nface of every planter within many miles; but this man was an utter\nstranger--certainly I had never seen him before.\n\n\"Your name is Platt, is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, master,\" I responded.\n\nPointing towards Northup, standing a few rods distant, he\ndemanded--\"Do you know that man?\"\n\nI looked in the direction indicated, and as my eyes rested on his\ncountenance, a world of images thronged my brain; a multitude of\nwell-known faces--Anne's, and the dear children's, and my old dead\nfather's; all the scenes and associations of childhood and youth;\nall the friends of other and happier days, appeared and disappeared,\nflitting and floating like dissolving shadows before the vision of my\nimagination, until at last the perfect memory of the man recurred to\nme, and throwing up my hands towards Heaven, I exclaimed, in a voice\nlouder than I could utter in a less exciting moment--\n\n\"_Henry B. Northup!_ Thank God--thank God!\"\n\nIn an instant I comprehended the nature of his business, and felt that\nthe hour of my deliverance was at hand. I started towards him, but the\nsheriff stepped before me.\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" said he; \"have you any other name than Platt?\"\n\n\"Solomon Northup is my name, master,\" I replied.\n\n\"Have you a family?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I _had_ a wife and three children.\"\n\n\"What were your children's names?\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, Margaret and Alonzo.\"\n\n\"And your wife's name before her marriage?\"\n\n\"Anne Hampton.\"\n\n\"Who married you?\"\n\n\"Timothy Eddy, of Fort Edward.\"\n\n\"Where does that gentleman live?\" again pointing to Northup, who\nremained standing in the same place where I had first recognized him.\n\n\"He lives in Sandy Hill, Washington county, New-York,\" was the reply.\n\nHe was proceeding to ask further questions, but I pushed past him,\nunable longer to restrain myself. I seized my old acquaintance by both\nhands. I could not speak. I could not refrain from tears.\n\n\"Sol,\" he said at length, \"I'm glad to see you.\"\n\nI essayed to make some answer, but emotion choked all utterance, and\nI was silent. The slaves, utterly confounded, stood gazing upon the\nscene, their open mouths and rolling eyes indicating the utmost wonder\nand astonishment. For ten years I had dwelt among them, in the field\nand in the cabin, borne the same hardships, partaken the same fare,\nmingled my griefs with theirs, participated in the same scanty joys;\nnevertheless, not until this hour, the last I was to remain among\nthem, had the remotest suspicion of my true name, or the slightest\nknowledge of my real history, been entertained by any one of them.\n\nNot a word was spoken for several minutes, during which time I clung\nfast to Northup, looking up into his face, fearful I should awake and\nfind it all a dream.\n\n\"Throw down that sack,\" Northup added, finally; \"your cotton-picking\ndays are over. Come with us to the man you live with.\"\n\nI obeyed him, and walking between him and the sheriff, we moved\ntowards the great house. It was not until we had proceeded some\ndistance that I had recovered my voice sufficiently to ask if my\nfamily were all living. He informed me he had seen Anne, Margaret\nand Elizabeth but a short time previously; that Alonzo was also\nliving, and all were well. My mother, however, I could never see\nagain. As I began to recover in some measure from the sudden and great\nexcitement which so overwhelmed me, I grew faint and weak, insomuch\nit was with difficulty I could walk. The sheriff took hold of my arm\nand assisted me, or I think I should have fallen. As we entered the\nyard, Epps stood by the gate, conversing with the driver. That young\nman, faithful to his instructions, was entirely unable to give him\nthe least information in answer to his repeated inquiries of what was\ngoing on. By the time we reached him he was almost as much amazed and\npuzzled as Bob or Uncle Abram.\n\nShaking hands with the sheriff, and receiving an introduction to Mr.\nNorthup, he invited them into the house, ordering me, at the same\ntime, to bring in some wood. It was some time before I succeeded in\ncutting an armful, having, somehow, unaccountably lost the power of\nwielding the axe with any manner of precision. When I entered with it\nat last, the table was strewn with papers, from one of which Northup\nwas reading. I was probably longer than necessity required, in placing\nthe sticks upon the fire, being particular as to the exact position\nof each individual one of them. I heard the words, \"the said Solomon\nNorthup,\" and \"the deponent further says,\" and \"free citizen of\nNew-York,\" repeated frequently, and from these expressions understood\nthat the secret I had so long retained from Master and Mistress Epps,\nwas finally developing. I lingered as long as prudence permitted,\nand was about leaving the room, when Epps inquired,\n\n[Illustration: SCENE IN THE COTTON FIELD, SOLOMON DELIVERED UP.]\n\n\"Platt, do you know this gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, master,\" I replied, \"I have known him as long as I can remember.\"\n\n\"Where does he live?\"\n\n\"He lives in New-York.\"\n\n\"Did you ever live there?\"\n\n\"Yes, master--born and bred there.\"\n\n\"You was free, then. Now you d----d nigger,\" he exclaimed, \"why did\nyou not tell me that when I bought you?\"\n\n\"Master Epps,\" I answered, in a somewhat different tone than the one\nin which I had been accustomed to address him--\"Master Epps, you did\nnot take the trouble to ask me; besides, I told one of my owners--the\nman that kidnapped me--that I was free, and was whipped almost to\ndeath for it.\"\n\n\"It seems there has been a letter written for you by somebody. Now,\nwho is it?\" he demanded, authoritatively. I made no reply.\n\n\"I say, who wrote that letter?\" he demanded again.\n\n\"Perhaps I wrote it myself,\" I said.\n\n\"You haven't been to Marksville post-office and back before light, I\nknow.\"\n\nHe insisted upon my informing him, and I insisted I would not. He\nmade many vehement threats against the man, whoever he might be, and\nintimated the bloody and savage vengeance he would wreak upon him,\nwhen he found him out. His whole manner and language exhibited a\nfeeling of anger towards the unknown person who had written for me,\nand of fretfulness at the idea of losing so much property. Addressing\nMr. Northup, he swore if he had only had an hour's notice of his\ncoming, he would have saved him the trouble of taking me back to\nNew-York; that he would have run me into the swamp, or some other\nplace out of the way, where all the sheriffs on earth couldn't have\nfound me.\n\nI walked out into the yard, and was entering the kitchen door, when\nsomething struck me in the back. Aunt Phebe, emerging from the back\ndoor of the great house with a pan of potatoes, had thrown one of them\nwith unnecessary violence, thereby giving me to understand that she\nwished to speak to me a moment confidentially. Running up to me, she\nwhispered in my ear with great earnestness,\n\n\"Lor a' mity, Platt! what d'ye think? Dem two men come after ye. Heard\n'em tell massa you free--got wife and tree children back thar whar you\ncome from. Goin' wid 'em? Fool if ye don't--wish I could go,\" and Aunt\nPhebe ran on in this manner at a rapid rate.\n\nPresently Mistress Epps made her appearance in the kitchen. She said\nmany things to me, and wondered why I had not told her who I was.\nShe expressed her regret, complimenting me by saying she had rather\nlose any other servant on the plantation. Had Patsey that day stood\nin my place, the measure of my mistress' joy would have overflowed.\nNow there was no one left who could mend a chair or a piece of\nfurniture--no one who was of any use about the house--no one who could\nplay for her on the violin--and Mistress Epps was actually affected to\ntears.\n\nEpps had called to Bob to bring up his saddle horse. The other slaves,\nalso, overcoming their fear of the penalty, had left their work and\ncome to the yard. They were standing behind the cabins, out of sight\nof Epps. They beckoned me to come to them, and with all the eagerness\nof curiosity, excited to the highest pitch, conversed with and\nquestioned me. If I could repeat the exact words they uttered, with\nthe same emphasis--if I could paint their several attitudes, and the\nexpression of their countenances--it would be indeed an interesting\npicture. In their estimation, I had suddenly arisen to an immeasurable\nheight--had become a being of immense importance.\n\nThe legal papers having been served, and arrangements made with Epps\nto meet them the next day at Marksville, Northup and the sheriff\nentered the carriage to return to the latter place. As I was about\nmounting to the driver's seat, the sheriff said I ought to bid Mr. and\nMrs. Epps good bye. I ran back to the piazza where they were standing,\nand taking off my hat, said,\n\n\"Good-bye, missis.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Platt,\" said Mrs. Epps, kindly.\n\n\"Good-bye, master.\"\n\n\"Ah! you d--d nigger,\" muttered Epps, in a surly, malicious tone of\nvoice, \"you needn't feel so cussed tickled--you ain't gone yet--I'll\nsee about this business at Marksville to-morrow.\"\n\nI was only a \"_nigger_\" and knew my place, but felt as strongly as if\nI had been a white man, that it would have been an inward comfort,\nhad I dared to have given him a parting kick. On my way back to the\ncarriage, Patsey ran from behind a cabin and threw her arms about my\nneck.\n\n\"Oh! Platt,\" she cried, tears streaming down her face, \"you're goin'\nto be free--you're goin' way off yonder where we'll neber see ye any\nmore. You've saved me a good many whippins, Platt; I'm glad you're\ngoin' to be free--but oh! de Lord, de Lord! what'll become of me?\"\n\nI disengaged myself from her, and entered the carriage. The driver\ncracked his whip and away we rolled. I looked back and saw Patsey,\nwith drooping head, half reclining on the ground; Mrs. Epps was on the\npiazza; Uncle Abram, and Bob, and Wiley, and Aunt Phebe stood by the\ngate, gazing after me. I waved my hand, but the carriage turned a bend\nof the bayou, hiding them from my eyes forever.\n\nWe stopped a moment at Carey's sugar house, where a great number of\nslaves were at work, such an establishment being a curiosity to a\nNorthern man. Epps dashed by us on horseback at full speed--on the\nway, as we learned next day, to the \"Pine Woods,\" to see William Ford,\nwho had brought me into the country.\n\nTuesday, the fourth of January, Epps and his counsel, the Hon. H.\nTaylor, Northup, Waddill, the Judge and sheriff of Avoyelles, and\nmyself, met in a room in the village of Marksville. Mr. Northup stated\nthe facts in regard to me, and presented his commission, and the\naffidavits accompanying it. The sheriff described the scene in the\ncotton field. I was also interrogated at great length. Finally, Mr.\nTaylor assured his client that he was satisfied, and that litigation\nwould not only be expensive, but utterly useless. In accordance with\nhis advice, a paper was drawn up and signed by the proper parties,\nwherein Epps acknowledged he was satisfied of my right to freedom, and\nformally surrendered me to the authorities of New-York. It was also\nstipulated that it be entered of record in the recorder's office of\nAvoyelles.[3]\n\nMr. Northup and myself immediately hastened to the landing, and taking\npassage on the first steamer that arrived, were soon floating down\nRed River, up which, with such desponding thoughts, I had been borne\ntwelve years before.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] See Appendix A.\n\n[2] See Appendix B.\n\n[3] See Appendix C.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n  ARRIVAL IN NEW-ORLEANS--GLIMPSE OF FREEMAN--GENOIS, THE\n  RECORDER--HIS DESCRIPTION OF SOLOMON--REACH CHARLESTON--INTERRUPTED\n  BY CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS--PASS THROUGH RICHMOND--ARRIVAL IN\n  WASHINGTON--BURCH ARRESTED--SHEKELS AND THORN--THEIR TESTIMONY--BURCH\n  ACQUITTED--ARREST OF SOLOMON--BURCH WITHDRAWS THE COMPLAINT--THE\n  HIGHER TRIBUNAL--DEPARTURE FROM WASHINGTON--ARRIVAL AT SANDY\n  HILL--OLD FRIENDS AND FAMILIAR SCENES--PROCEED TO GLENS\n  FALLS--MEETING WITH ANNE, MARGARET AND ELIZABETH--SOLOMON NORTHUP\n  STAUNTON--INCIDENTS--CONCLUSION.\n\n\nAs the steamer glided on its way towards New-Orleans, _perhaps_ I was\nnot happy--_perhaps_ there was no difficulty in restraining myself\nfrom dancing round the deck--perhaps I did not feel grateful to the\nman who had come so many hundred miles for me--perhaps I did not\nlight his pipe, and wait and watch his word, and run at his slightest\nbidding. If I didn't--well, no matter.\n\nWe tarried at New-Orleans two days. During that time I pointed out the\nlocality of Freeman's slave pen, and the room in which Ford purchased\nme. We happened to meet Theophilus in the street, but I did not think\nit worth while to renew acquaintance with him. From respectable\ncitizens we ascertained he had become a low, miserable rowdy--a\nbroken-down, disreputable man.\n\nWe also visited the recorder, Mr. Genois, to whom Senator Soule's\nletter was directed, and found him a man well deserving the wide and\nhonorable reputation that he bears. He very generously furnished us\nwith a sort of legal pass, over his signature and seal of office, and\nas it contains the recorder's description of my personal appearance,\nit may not be amiss to insert it here. The following is a copy:\n\n                         \"_State of Louisiana_--_City of New-Orleans_:\n                         Recorder's Office, Second District.\n\n     \"To all to whom these presents shall come:--\n\n     \"This is to certify that Henry B. Northup, Esquire, of the county\n     of Washington, New-York, has produced before me due evidence\n     of the freedom of Solomon, a mulatto man, aged about forty-two\n     years, five feet, seven inches and six lines, woolly hair, and\n     chestnut eyes, who is a native born of the State of New-York. That\n     the said Northup, being about bringing the said Solomon to his\n     native place, through the southern routes, the civil authorities\n     are requested to let the aforesaid colored man Solomon pass\n     unmolested, he demeaning well and properly.\n\n     \"Given under my hand and the seal of the city of New-Orleans this\n     7th January, 1853.\n\n     [L. S.]                                 \"TH. GENOIS, Recorder.\"\n\nOn the 8th we came to Lake Pontchartrain, by railroad, and, in due\ntime, following the usual route, reached Charleston. After going on\nboard the steamboat, and paying our passage at this city, Mr. Northup\nwas called upon by a custom-house officer to explain why he had not\nregistered his servant. He replied that he had no servant--that, as\nthe agent of New-York, he was accompanying a free citizen of that\nState from slavery to freedom, and did not desire nor intend to make\nany registry whatever. I conceived from his conversation and manner,\nthough I may perhaps be entirely mistaken, that no great pains would\nbe taken to avoid whatever difficulty the Charleston officials might\ndeem proper to create. At length, however, we were permitted to\nproceed, and, passing through Richmond, where I caught a glimpse of\nGoodin's pen, arrived in Washington January 17th, 1853.\n\nWe ascertained that both Burch and Radburn were still residing in that\ncity. Immediately a complaint was entered with a police magistrate\nof Washington, against James H. Burch, for kidnapping and selling\nme into slavery. He was arrested upon a warrant issued by Justice\nGoddard, and returned before Justice Mansel, and held to bail in the\nsum of three thousand dollars. When first arrested, Burch was much\nexcited, exhibiting the utmost fear and alarm, and before reaching the\njustice's office on Louisiana Avenue, and before knowing the precise\nnature of the complaint, begged the police to permit him to consult\nBenjamin O. Shekels, a slave trader of seventeen years' standing, and\nhis former partner. The latter became his bail.\n\nAt ten o'clock, the 18th of January, both parties appeared before the\nmagistrate. Senator Chase, of Ohio, Hon. Orville Clark, of Sandy Hill,\nand Mr. Northup acted as counsel for the prosecution, and Joseph H.\nBradley for the defence.\n\nGen. Orville Clark was called and sworn as a witness, and testified\nthat he had known me from childhood, and that I was a free man, as\nwas my father before me. Mr. Northup then testified to the same, and\nproved the facts connected with his mission to Avoyelles.\n\nEbenezer Radburn was then sworn for the prosecution, and testified\nhe was forty-eight years old; that he was a resident of Washington,\nand had known Burch fourteen years; that in 1841 he was keeper of\nWilliams' slave pen; that he remembered the fact of my confinement in\nthe pen that year. At this point it was admitted by the defendant's\ncounsel, that I had been placed in the pen by Burch in the spring of\n1841, and hereupon the prosecution rested.\n\nBenjamin O. Shekels was then offered as a witness by the prisoner.\nBenjamin is a large, coarse-featured man, and the reader may perhaps\nget a somewhat correct conception of him by reading the exact language\nhe used in answer to the first question of defendant's lawyer. He was\nasked the place of his nativity, and his reply, uttered in a sort of\nrowdyish way, was in these very words--\n\n\"I was born in Ontario county, New-York, and _weighed fourteen\npounds_!\"\n\nBenjamin was a prodigious baby! He further testified that he kept the\nSteamboat Hotel in Washington in 1841, and saw me there in the spring\nof that year. He was proceeding to state what he had heard two men\nsay, when Senator Chase raised a legal objection, to wit, that the\nsayings of third persons, being hearsay, was improper evidence. The\nobjection was overruled by the Justice, and Shekels continued, stating\nthat two men came to his hotel and represented they had a colored man\nfor sale; that they had an interview with Burch; that they stated they\ncame from Georgia, but he did not remember the county; that they gave\na full history of the boy, saying he was a bricklayer, and played\non the violin; that Burch remarked he would purchase if they could\nagree; that they went out and brought the boy in, and that I was the\nsame person. He further testified, with as much unconcern as if it\nwas the truth, that I represented I was born and bred in Georgia;\nthat one of the young men with me was my master; that I exhibited a\ngreat deal of regret at parting with him, and he believed \"got into\ntears!\"--nevertheless, that I insisted my master had a right to sell\nme; that he _ought_ to sell me; and the remarkable reason I gave was,\naccording to Shekels, because he, my master, \"had been gambling and on\na spree!\"\n\nHe continued, in these words, copied from the minutes taken on the\nexamination: \"Burch interrogated the boy in the usual manner, told him\nif he purchased him he should send him south. The boy said he had no\nobjection, that in fact he would like to go south. Burch paid $650 for\nhim, to my knowledge. I don't know what name was given him, but think\nit was not Solomon. Did not know the name of either of the two men.\nThey were in my tavern two or three hours, during which time the boy\nplayed on the violin. The bill of sale was signed in my bar-room. It\nwas a _printed blank, filled up by Burch_. Before 1838 Burch was my\npartner. Our business was buying and selling slaves. After that time\nhe was a partner of Theophilus Freeman, of New-Orleans. Burch bought\nhere--Freeman sold there!\"\n\nShekels, before testifying, had heard my relation of the circumstances\nconnected with the visit to Washington with Brown and Hamilton, and\ntherefore, it was, undoubtedly, he spoke of \"two men,\" and of my\nplaying on the violin. Such was his fabrication, utterly untrue, and\nyet there was found in Washington a man who endeavored to corroborate\nhim.\n\nBenjamin A. Thorn testified he was at Shekels' in 1841, and saw a\ncolored boy playing on a fiddle. \"Shekels said he was for sale. Heard\nhis master tell him he should sell him. The boy acknowledged to me he\nwas a slave. I was not present when the money was paid. Will not swear\npositively this is the boy. The master _came near shedding tears: I\nthink the boy did_! I have been engaged in the business of taking\nslaves south, off and on, for twenty years. When I can't do that I do\nsomething else.\"\n\nI was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court\ndecided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground\nthat I was a colored man--the fact of my being a free citizen of\nNew-York not being disputed.\n\nShekels having testified there was a bill of sale executed, Burch\nwas called upon by the prosecution to produce it, inasmuch as such\na paper would corroborate the testimony of Thorn and Shekels. The\nprisoner's counsel saw the necessity of exhibiting it, or giving some\nreasonable explanation for its non-production. To effect the latter,\nBurch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was\ncontended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be\nallowed--that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and\nif permitted would defeat the ends of justice. His testimony, however,\nwas received by the court! He made oath that such a bill of sale had\nbeen drawn up and signed, _but he had lost it, and did not know what\nhad become of it_! Thereupon the magistrate was requested to dispatch\na police officer to Burch's residence, with directions to bring his\nbooks, containing his bills of sales for the year 1841. The request\nwas granted, and before any measure could be taken to prevent it, the\nofficer had obtained possession of the books, and brought them into\ncourt. The sales for the year 1841 were found, and carefully examined,\nbut no sale of myself, by any name, was discovered!\n\nUpon this testimony the court held the fact to be established, that\nBurch came innocently and honestly by me, and accordingly he was\ndischarged.\n\nAn attempt was then made by Burch and his satellites, to fasten\nupon me the charge that I had conspired with the two white men to\ndefraud him--with what success, appears in an extract taken from an\narticle in the New-York Times, published a day or two subsequent to\nthe trial: \"The counsel for the defendant had drawn up, before the\ndefendant was discharged, an affidavit, signed by Burch, and had a\nwarrant out against the colored man for a conspiracy with the two\nwhite men before referred to, to defraud Burch out of six hundred\nand twenty-five dollars. The warrant was served, and the colored man\narrested and brought before officer Goddard. Burch and his witnesses\nappeared in court, and H. B. Northup appeared as counsel for the\ncolored man, stating he was ready to proceed as counsel on the part of\nthe defendant, and asking no delay whatever. Burch, after consulting\nprivately a short time with Shekels, stated to the magistrate that\nhe wished him to dismiss the complaint, as he would not proceed\nfarther with it. Defendant's counsel stated to the magistrate that\nif the complaint was withdrawn, it must be without the request or\nconsent of the defendant. Burch then asked the magistrate to let him\nhave the complaint and the warrant, and he took them. The counsel\nfor the defendant objected to his receiving them, and insisted they\nshould remain as part of the records of the court, and that the court\nshould endorse the proceedings which had been had under the process.\nBurch delivered them up, and the court rendered a judgment of\ndiscontinuance by the request of the prosecutor, and filed it in his\noffice.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere may be those who will affect to believe the statement of the\nslave-trader--those, in whose minds his allegations will weigh heavier\nthan mine. I am a poor colored man--one of a down-trodden and degraded\nrace, whose humble voice may not be heeded by the oppressor--but\n_knowing_ the truth, and with a full sense of my accountability, I\ndo solemnly declare before men, and before God, that any charge or\nassertion, that I conspired directly or indirectly with any person\nor persons to sell myself; that any other account of my visit to\nWashington, my capture and imprisonment in Williams' slave pen, than\nis contained in these pages, is utterly and absolutely false. I never\nplayed on the violin in Washington. I never was in the Steamboat\nHotel, and never saw Thorn or Shekels, to my knowledge, in my life,\nuntil last January. The story of the trio of slave-traders is a\nfabrication as absurd as it is base and unfounded. Were it true, I\nshould not have turned aside on my way back to liberty for the purpose\nof prosecuting Burch. I should have _avoided_ rather than sought him.\nI should have known that such a step would have resulted in rendering\nme infamous. Under the circumstances--longing as I did to behold my\nfamily, and elated with the prospect of returning home--it is an\noutrage upon probability to suppose I would have run the hazard, not\nonly of exposure, but of a criminal prosecution and conviction, by\nvoluntarily placing myself in the position I did, if the statements of\nBurch and his confederates contain a particle of truth. I took pains\nto seek him out, to confront him in a court of law, charging him with\nthe crime of kidnapping; and the only motive that impelled me to this\nstep, was a burning sense of the wrong he had inflicted upon me, and a\ndesire to bring him to justice. He was acquitted, in the manner, and\nby such means as have been described. A human tribunal has permitted\nhim to escape; but there is another and a higher tribunal, where false\ntestimony will not prevail, and where I am willing, so far at least as\nthese statements are concerned, to be judged at last.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe left Washington on the 20th of January, and proceeding by the way\nof Philadelphia, New-York, and Albany, reached Sandy Hill in the night\nof the 21st. My heart overflowed with happiness as I looked around\nupon old familiar scenes, and found myself in the midst of friends of\nother days. The following morning I started, in company with several\nacquaintances, for Glens Falls, the residence of Anne and our children.\n\nAs I entered their comfortable cottage, Margaret was the first that\nmet me. She did not recognize me. When I left her, she was but seven\nyears old, a little prattling girl, playing with her toys. Now she was\ngrown to womanhood--was married, with a bright-eyed boy standing by\nher side. Not forgetful of his enslaved, unfortunate grand-father,\nshe had named the child Solomon Northup Staunton. When told who I\nwas, she was overcome with emotion, and unable to speak. Presently\nElizabeth entered the room, and Anne came running from the hotel,\nhaving been informed of my arrival. They embraced me, and with tears\nflowing down their cheeks, hung upon my neck. But I draw a veil over a\nscene which can better be imagined than described.\n\nWhen the violence of our emotions had subsided to a sacred joy--when\nthe household gathered round the fire, that sent out its warm and\ncrackling comfort through the room, we conversed of the thousand\nevents that had occurred--the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows,\nthe trials and troubles we had each experienced during the long\nseparation. Alonzo was absent in the western part of the State. The\nboy had written to his mother a short time previous, of the prospect\nof his obtaining sufficient money to purchase my freedom. From his\nearliest years, that had been the chief object of his thoughts and his\nambition. They knew I was in bondage. The letter written on board the\nbrig, and Clem Ray himself, had given them that information. But where\nI was, until the arrival of Bass' letter, was a matter of conjecture.\nElizabeth and Margaret once returned from school--so Anne informed\nme--weeping bitterly. On inquiring the cause of the children's sorrow,\nit was found that, while studying geography, their attention had been\nattracted to the picture of slaves working in the cotton-field,\nand an overseer following them with his whip. It reminded them of\nthe sufferings their father might be, and, as it happened, actually\n_was_, enduring in the South. Numerous incidents, such as these, were\nrelated--incidents showing they still held me in constant remembrance,\nbut not, perhaps, of sufficient interest to the reader, to be\nrecounted.\n\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL HOME, AND FIRST MEETING WITH HIS WIFE AND\nCHILDREN]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy narrative is at an end. I have no comments to make upon the subject\nof Slavery. Those who read this book may form their own opinions of\nthe \"peculiar institution.\" What it may be in other States, I do not\nprofess to know; what it is in the region of Red River, is truly\nand faithfully delineated in these pages. This is no fiction, no\nexaggeration. If I have failed in anything, it has been in presenting\nto the reader too prominently the bright side of the picture. I doubt\nnot hundreds have been as unfortunate as myself; that hundreds of free\ncitizens have been kidnapped and sold into slavery, and are at this\nmoment wearing out their lives on plantations in Texas and Louisiana.\nBut I forbear.

That\nthe said Solomon Northup is a free citizen of the State of New-York,\nand is now wrongfully held in slavery, in or near Marksville, in the\nparish of Avoyelles, in the State of Louisiana, one of the United\nStates of America, on the allegation or pretence that the said Solomon\nis a slave.\n\nAnd your memorialist further states that Mintus Northup was the\nreputed father of said Solomon, and was a negro, and died at Fort\nEdward, on the 22d day of November, 1829; that the mother of said\nSolomon was a mulatto, or three quarters white, and died in the county\nof Oswego, New-York, some five or six years ago, as your memorialist\nwas informed and believes, and never was a slave.\n\nThat your memorialist and her family are poor and wholly unable to pay\nor sustain any portion of the expenses of restoring the said Solomon\nto his freedom.\n\nYour excellency is entreated to employ such agent or agents as shall\nbe deemed necessary to effect the restoration and return of said\nSolomon Northup, in pursuance of an act of the Legislature of the\nState of New-York, passed May 14th, 1840, entitled \"An act more\neffectually to protect the free citizens of this State from being\nkidnappd or reduced to slavery.\" And your memorialist will ever pray.\n\n                                   (Signed,)     ANNE NORTHUP.\n\nDated November 19, 1852.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  STATE OF NEW-YORK:\n  Washington county, ss.\n\nAnne Northup, of the village of Glens Falls, in the county of Warren,\nin said State, being duly sworn, doth depose and say that she signed\nthe above memorial, and that the statements therein contained are true.\n\n                                   (Signed,) ANNE NORTHUP.\n\n  Subscribed and sworn before me this\n  19th November, 1852.\n  CHARLES HUGHES, Justice Peace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe recommend that the Governor appoint Henry B.
