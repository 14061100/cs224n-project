{"summary": "\nThe full modern English title for the work commonly known as Pantagruel is The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua and in French, Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua. The original title of the work was Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables. Although most modern editions of Rabelais's work place Pantagruel as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the pen name \"Alcofribas Nasier\", an anagram of François Rabelais.\nPantagruel was a sequel to an anonymous book entitled The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua (in French, Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua). This early Gargantua text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of Gulliver's Travels, but vary in size from chapter to chapter to enable a series of astonishing images as though these were tall tales. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom to argue a case, but in another the narrator resides inside Pantagruel's mouth for 6 months and discovers an entire nation living around his teeth.\nAt the beginning of this book, Gargantua's wife dies giving birth to Pantagruel, who grows to be as giant and scholarly as his father. Rabelais gives a catalog of his reading, mostly humorously-titled books, and judgements in nonsensical legal cases. \"The lion’s share of Pantagruel’s seventh chapter consists of a concluding catalog attributed to the Abbey of Saint-Victor\", states Bodemer in his essay, \"Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited.\" \nHe befriends hard-partying jokester Panurge. Together with a group of friends, they intoxicate an army of invading giants, burn their camp, and drown survivors in urine. Epistemon, decapitated in the fray, recovers when Panurge sews his head back to his body. He reports that souls in hell are poorly paid and work bad jobs, but that's the extent of their torments. Another battle is missed by the narrator, who is exploring the civilization in Pantagruel's mouth at the time.\n\n\nAfter the success of Pantagruel, Rabelais revisited and revised his source material. He produced an improved narrative of the life and acts of Pantagruel's father in The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel (in French, La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel), commonly known as Gargantua. This volume begins with the miraculous birth of Gargantua after an 11-month pregnancy.\nThe labor is so difficult, his mother threatens to castrate his father, Lord Grandgousier. The giant Gargantua emerges at his mother's left ear, calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were required for the provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose \"exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard\", its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it. After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed \"Par Ris\").\nHe steals the bells of St. Anthony, but gives them back after a sophist makes ludicrously self-centered appeals for their return. While he studies diligently in Paris, the neighboring Lord Picrochole's bakers insult and are attacked by Grandgousier's grape-growers. A massive retaliatory strike against Grandgousier's lands is finally halted at Seville by the merciless Friar John. Grandgousier sues for peace, but Picrochole arrogantly rebuffs him. Gargantua and Friar John rally the troops and (after Gargantua nearly swallows 6 pilgrims who accidentally fell in his salad) they win a great battle, drive Picrochole back to his city, then overthrow it.\nAs a reward, Friar John is given funds to establish the \"anti-church\" Abbey of Thélème, which has become one of the most notable parables in Western philosophy. It can be considered a point-by-point critique of the educational practices of the age, or a call for free schooling, or a defense of all sorts of notions on human nature.\n\nRabelais then returned to the story of Pantagruel himself in the last three books. In The Third Book of Pantagruel (in French, Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel; the original title is Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel), the narrative style changes to a parody of the philosophical dialogue, where the earthy Panurge gets the last word. He sermonizes against moral restraint and in favor of indebtedness, yet accepts Pantagruel's offer to repay all of his creditors.\nNow financially solvent for the first time, Panurge stops wearing his long codpiece and seeks advice about whom to marry. Various auguries (opening Virgil to a random page, inducing prophetic dream through half-hearted fasting) and councillors - the Sibyl of Panzoust, the mute Goatnose, the old poet Raminagrobis, Friar John, a group of learned doctors and lawyers, and a fool - all agree that if he marries, his wife will cheat on him, beat him, and rob him. But he egregiously reinterprets their prophecies in a more favorable light.\nIn a brief interlude, Pantagruel defends Judge Brindlegoose, who has pronounced sentence by rolling dice for 40 years, on the grounds that he is an old idiot and therefore favored by Fortune. As a last attempt to settle the question of marriage, Pantagruel and Panurge take a sea voyage to consult the Oracle of Bacbuc (\"Divine Bottle\"). Their ship is well-provisioned with the phallic herb Pantagruelion, for which Rabelais gives a ribald natural history.\n\nThe sea voyage continues for the whole of The Fourth Book of Pantagruel (in French, Le quart-livre de Pantagruel; the original title is Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel). The whole book can be seen as a comical retelling of the Odyssey, or of the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In The Fourth Book, perhaps his most satirical, Rabelais criticizes what he perceived as the arrogance and wealth of the Roman Catholic Church, the political figures of the time, and popular superstitions, and he addresses several religious, political, linguistic, and philosophical issues.\nThe group sail to East Asia, and buy many exotic animals. Panurge quarrels with the sheep merchant Dingdong, and takes his revenge by drowning him and his flock. They pass by the islands of the Bailiffs, whose peasants charge to be beaten. During a terrible storm at sea, Panurge is paralyzed with fear, but feigns insufferable bravura afterwards. After slaying a sea-monster, and being informed of the death of the giant Lent, they arrive at Wild Island, where the half-sausage inhabitants (called Chitterlings) mistake Pantagruel for their enemy Lent and attack.\nThe battle is stopped by a divine winged pig, who excretes mustard on the battlefield. They proceed to Ruach, whose people eat air, to barren Pope-Figland where a farmer and his wife outwit the devil, and to the arrogantly Catholic Papimania, where the people worship the Pope and his Decretals. After sailing through a cloud of frozen words and sounds, they come to an island that worships Gaster, the god of food. The book ends when Pantagruel fires a salute at the island of the Muses, and Panurge befouls himself for fear of the sound, and of the \"celebrated cat Rodilardus\".\n\nThe Fifth Book of Pantagruel (in French, Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel; the original title is Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel), was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic church.\nOn Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.\nPassing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word \"trinc\". After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.\nThe last volume's attribution to Rabelais is debatable. The Fifth Book was not published until nine years after his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from Lucian's True History and Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili) or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of Gargantua and Pantagruel, Donald M. Frame proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in \"Rabelais Grammairien\", the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter.\nJ.M.Cohen, in his Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition, states that chapters 17-48 were written by another hand using notes left by Rabelais and the general drift of what Rabelais had written of the Fifth Book.\n\n", "full_text": "MASTER FRANCIS RABELAIS\n\n\nFIVE BOOKS OF THE LIVES, HEROIC DEEDS AND SAYINGS OF\n\nGARGANTUA AND HIS SON PANTAGRUEL\n\n\n\nTranslated into English by\n\nSir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty\n\nand\n\nPeter Antony Motteux\n\n\n\n\nThe text of the first Two Books of Rabelais has been reprinted from the\nfirst edition (1653) of Urquhart's translation.

It stands outside\nother things--a mixture of mad mirth and gravity, of folly and reason, of\nchildishness and grandeur, of the commonplace and the out-of-the-way, of\npopular verve and polished humanism, of mother-wit and learning, of\nbaseness and nobility, of personalities and broad generalization, of the\ncomic and the serious, of the impossible and the familiar.  Throughout the\nwhole there is such a force of life and thought, such a power of good\nsense, a kind of assurance so authoritative, that he takes rank with the\ngreatest; and his peers are not many.  You may like him or not, may attack\nhim or sing his praises, but you cannot ignore him.  He is of those that\ndie hard.  Be as fastidious as you will; make up your mind to recognize\nonly those who are, without any manner of doubt, beyond and above all\nothers; however few the names you keep, Rabelais' will always remain.\n\nWe may know his work, may know it well, and admire it more every time we\nread it.  After being amused by it, after having enjoyed it, we may return\nagain to study it and to enter more fully into its meaning.  Yet there is\nno possibility of knowing his own life in the same fashion.  In spite of\nall the efforts, often successful, that have been made to throw light on\nit, to bring forward a fresh document, or some obscure mention in a\nforgotten book, to add some little fact, to fix a date more precisely, it\nremains nevertheless full of uncertainty and of gaps.  Besides, it has been\nburdened and sullied by all kinds of wearisome stories and foolish\nanecdotes, so that really there is more to weed out than to add.\n\nThis injustice, at first wilful, had its rise in the sixteenth century, in\nthe furious attacks of a monk of Fontevrault, Gabriel de Puy-Herbault, who\nseems to have drawn his conclusions concerning the author from the book,\nand, more especially, in the regrettable satirical epitaph of Ronsard,\npiqued, it is said, that the Guises had given him only a little pavillon in\nthe Forest of Meudon, whereas the presbytery was close to the chateau.\nFrom that time legend has fastened on Rabelais, has completely travestied\nhim, till, bit by bit, it has made of him a buffoon, a veritable clown, a\nvagrant, a glutton, and a drunkard.\n\nThe likeness of his person has undergone a similar metamorphosis.  He has\nbeen credited with a full moon of a face, the rubicund nose of an\nincorrigible toper, and thick coarse lips always apart because always\nlaughing.  The picture would have surprised his friends no less than\nhimself.  There have been portraits painted of Rabelais; I have seen many\nsuch.  They are all of the seventeenth century, and the greater number are\nconceived in this jovial and popular style.\n\nAs a matter of fact there is only one portrait of him that counts, that has\nmore than the merest chance of being authentic, the one in the Chronologie\ncollee or coupee.  Under this double name is known and cited a large sheet\ndivided by lines and cross lines into little squares, containing about a\nhundred heads of illustrious Frenchmen.  This sheet was stuck on pasteboard\nfor hanging on the wall, and was cut in little pieces, so that the\nportraits might be sold separately.  The majority of the portraits are of\nknown persons and can therefore be verified.  Now it can be seen that these\nhave been selected with care, and taken from the most authentic sources;\nfrom statues, busts, medals, even stained glass, for the persons of most\ndistinction, from earlier engravings for the others.  Moreover, those of\nwhich no other copies exist, and which are therefore the most valuable,\nhave each an individuality very distinct, in the features, the hair, the\nbeard, as well as in the costume.  Not one of them is like another.  There\nhas been no tampering with them, no forgery.  On the contrary, there is in\neach a difference, a very marked personality.  Leonard Gaultier, who\npublished this engraving towards the end of the sixteenth century,\nreproduced a great many portraits besides from chalk drawings, in the style\nof his master, Thomas de Leu.  It must have been such drawings that were\nthe originals of those portraits which he alone has issued, and which may\ntherefore be as authentic and reliable as the others whose correctness we\nare in a position to verify.\n\nNow Rabelais has here nothing of the Roger Bontemps of low degree about\nhim.  His features are strong, vigorously cut, and furrowed with deep\nwrinkles; his beard is short and scanty; his cheeks are thin and already\nworn-looking.  On his head he wears the square cap of the doctors and the\nclerks, and his dominant expression, somewhat rigid and severe, is that of\na physician and a scholar.  And this is the only portrait to which we need\nattach any importance.\n\nThis is not the place for a detailed biography, nor for an exhaustive\nstudy.  At most this introduction will serve as a framework on which to fix\na few certain dates, to hang some general observations.  The date of\nRabelais' birth is very doubtful.  For long it was placed as far back as\n1483:  now scholars are disposed to put it forward to about 1495.  The\nreason, a good one, is that all those whom he has mentioned as his friends,\nor in any real sense his contemporaries, were born at the very end of the\nfifteenth century.  And, indeed, it is in the references in his romance to\nnames, persons, and places, that the most certain and valuable evidence is\nto be found of his intercourse, his patrons, his friendships, his\nsojournings, and his travels:  his own work is the best and richest mine in\nwhich to search for the details of his life.\n\nLike Descartes and Balzac, he was a native of Touraine, and Tours and\nChinon have only done their duty in each of them erecting in recent years a\nstatue to his honour, a twofold homage reflecting credit both on the\nprovince and on the town.  But the precise facts about his birth are\nnevertheless vague.  Huet speaks of the village of Benais, near Bourgeuil,\nof whose vineyards Rabelais makes mention.  As the little vineyard of La\nDeviniere, near Chinon, and familiar to all his readers, is supposed to\nhave belonged to his father, Thomas Rabelais, some would have him born\nthere.  It is better to hold to the earlier general opinion that Chinon was\nhis native town; Chinon, whose praises he sang with such heartiness and\naffection.  There he might well have been born in the Lamproie house, which\nbelonged to his father, who, to judge from this circumstance, must have\nbeen in easy circumstances, with the position of a well-to-do citizen.  As\nLa Lamproie in the seventeenth century was a hostelry, the father of\nRabelais has been set down as an innkeeper.  More probably he was an\napothecary, which would fit in with the medical profession adopted by his\nson in after years.  Rabelais had brothers, all older than himself.\nPerhaps because he was the youngest, his father destined him for the\nChurch.\n\nThe time he spent while a child with the Benedictine monks at Seuille is\nuncertain.  There he might have made the acquaintance of the prototype of\nhis Friar John, a brother of the name of Buinart, afterwards Prior of\nSermaize.  He was longer at the Abbey of the Cordeliers at La Baumette,\nhalf a mile from Angers, where he became a novice.  As the brothers Du\nBellay, who were later his Maecenases, were then studying at the University\nof Angers, where it is certain he was not a student, it is doubtless from\nthis youthful period that his acquaintance and alliance with them should\ndate.  Voluntarily, or induced by his family, Rabelais now embraced the\necclesiastical profession, and entered the monastery of the Franciscan\nCordeliers at Fontenay-le-Comte, in Lower Poitou, which was honoured by his\nlong sojourn at the vital period of his life when his powers were ripening.\nThere it was he began to study and to think, and there also began his\ntroubles.\n\nIn spite of the wide-spread ignorance among the monks of that age, the\nencyclopaedic movement of the Renaissance was attracting all the lofty\nminds.  Rabelais threw himself into it with enthusiasm, and Latin antiquity\nwas not enough for him.  Greek, a study discountenanced by the Church,\nwhich looked on it as dangerous and tending to freethought and heresy, took\npossession of him.  To it he owed the warm friendship of Pierre Amy and of\nthe celebrated Guillaume Bude.  In fact, the Greek letters of the latter\nare the best source of information concerning this period of Rabelais'\nlife.  It was at Fontenay-le-Comte also that he became acquainted with the\nBrissons and the great jurist Andre Tiraqueau, whom he never mentions but\nwith admiration and deep affection.  Tiraqueau's treatise, De legibus\nconnubialibus, published for the first time in 1513, has an important\nbearing on the life of Rabelais.  There we learn that, dissatisfied with\nthe incomplete translation of Herodotus by Laurent Valla, Rabelais had\nretranslated into Latin the first book of the History.  That translation\nunfortunately is lost, as so many other of his scattered works.  It is\nprobably in this direction that the hazard of fortune has most discoveries\nand surprises in store for the lucky searcher.  Moreover, as in this law\ntreatise Tiraqueau attacked women in a merciless fashion, President Amaury\nBouchard published in 1522 a book in their defence, and Rabelais, who was a\nfriend of both the antagonists, took the side of Tiraqueau.  It should be\nobserved also in passing, that there are several pages of such audacious\nplain-speaking, that Rabelais, though he did not copy these in his Marriage\nof Panurge, has there been, in his own fashion, as out spoken as Tiraqueau.\nIf such freedom of language could be permitted in a grave treatise of law,\nsimilar liberties were certainly, in the same century, more natural in a\nbook which was meant to amuse.\n\nThe great reproach always brought against Rabelais is not the want of\nreserve of his language merely, but his occasional studied coarseness,\nwhich is enough to spoil his whole work, and which lowers its value.  La\nBruyere, in the chapter Des ouvrages de l'esprit, not in the first edition\nof the Caracteres, but in the fifth, that is to say in 1690, at the end of\nthe great century, gives us on this subject his own opinion and that of his\nage:\n\n'Marot and Rabelais are inexcusable in their habit of scattering filth\nabout their writings.  Both of them had genius enough and wit enough to do\nwithout any such expedient, even for the amusement of those persons who\nlook more to the laugh to be got out of a book than to what is admirable in\nit.  Rabelais especially is incomprehensible.  His book is an enigma,--one\nmay say inexplicable.  It is a Chimera; it is like the face of a lovely\nwoman with the feet and the tail of a reptile, or of some creature still\nmore loathsome.  It is a monstrous confusion of fine and rare morality with\nfilthy corruption.  Where it is bad, it goes beyond the worst; it is the\ndelight of the basest of men.  Where it is good, it reaches the exquisite,\nthe very best; it ministers to the most delicate tastes.'\n\nPutting aside the rather slight connection established between two men of\nwhom one is of very little importance compared with the other, this is\notherwise very admirably said, and the judgment is a very just one, except\nwith regard to one point--the misunderstanding of the atmosphere in which\nthe book was created, and the ignoring of the examples of a similar\ntendency furnished by literature as well as by the popular taste.  Was it\nnot the Ancients that began it?  Aristophanes, Catullus, Petronius,\nMartial, flew in the face of decency in their ideas as well as in the words\nthey used, and they dragged after them in this direction not a few of the\nLatin poets of the Renaissance, who believed themselves bound to imitate\nthem.  Is Italy without fault in this respect?  Her story-tellers in prose\nlie open to easy accusation.  Her Capitoli in verse go to incredible\nlengths; and the astonishing success of Aretino must not be forgotten, nor\nthe licence of the whole Italian comic theatre of the sixteenth century.\nThe Calandra of Bibbiena, who was afterwards a Cardinal, and the Mandragola\nof Machiavelli, are evidence enough, and these were played before Popes,\nwho were not a whit embarrassed.  Even in England the drama went very far\nfor a time, and the comic authors of the reign of Charles II., evidently\nfrom a reaction, and to shake off the excess and the wearisomeness of\nPuritan prudery and affectation, which sent them to the opposite extreme,\nare not exactly noted for their reserve.  But we need not go beyond France.\nSlight indications, very easily verified, are all that may be set down\nhere; a formal and detailed proof would be altogether too dangerous.\n\nThus, for instance, the old Fabliaux--the Farces of the fifteenth century,\nthe story-tellers of the sixteenth--reveal one of the sides, one of the\nveins, so to speak, of our literature.  The art that addresses itself to\nthe eye had likewise its share of this coarseness.  Think of the sculptures\non the capitals and the modillions of churches, and the crude frankness of\ncertain painted windows of the fifteenth century.  Queen Anne was, without\nany doubt, one of the most virtuous women in the world.  Yet she used to go\nup the staircase of her chateau at Blois, and her eyes were not offended at\nseeing at the foot of a bracket a not very decent carving of a monk and a\nnun.  Neither did she tear out of her book of Hours the large miniature of\nthe winter month, in which, careless of her neighbours' eyes, the mistress\nof the house, sitting before her great fireplace, warms herself in a\nfashion which it is not advisable that dames of our age should imitate.\nThe statue of Cybele by the Tribolo, executed for Francis I., and placed,\nnot against a wall, but in the middle of Queen Claude's chamber at\nFontainebleau, has behind it an attribute which would have been more in\nplace on a statue of Priapus, and which was the symbol of generativeness.\nThe tone of the conversations was ordinarily of a surprising coarseness,\nand the Precieuses, in spite of their absurdities, did a very good work in\nsetting themselves in opposition to it.  The worthy Chevalier de\nLa-Tour-Landry, in his Instructions to his own daughters, without a thought\nof harm, gives examples which are singular indeed, and in Caxton's\ntranslation these are not omitted.  The Adevineaux Amoureux, printed at\nBruges by Colard Mansion, are astonishing indeed when one considers that\nthey were the little society diversions of the Duchesses of Burgundy and of\nthe great ladies of a court more luxurious and more refined than the French\ncourt, which revelled in the Cent Nouvelles of good King Louis XI.\nRabelais' pleasantry about the woman folle a la messe is exactly in the\nstyle of the Adevineaux.\n\nA later work than any of his, the Novelle of Bandello, should be kept in\nmind--for the writer was Bishop of Agen, and his work was translated into\nFrench--as also the Dames Galantes of Brantome.  Read the Journal of\nHeroard, that honest doctor, who day by day wrote down the details\nconcerning the health of Louis XIII. from his birth, and you will\nunderstand the tone of the conversation of Henry IV.  The jokes at a\ncountry wedding are trifles compared with this royal coarseness.  Le Moyen\nde Parvenir is nothing but a tissue and a mass of filth, and the too\ncelebrated Cabinet Satyrique proves what, under Louis XIII., could be\nwritten, printed, and read.  The collection of songs formed by Clairambault\nshows that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were no purer than the\nsixteenth.  Some of the most ribald songs are actually the work of\nPrincesses of the royal House.\n\nIt is, therefore, altogether unjust to make Rabelais the scapegoat, to\ncharge him alone with the sins of everybody else.  He spoke as those of his\ntime used to speak; when amusing them he used their language to make\nhimself understood, and to slip in his asides, which without this sauce\nwould never have been accepted, would have found neither eyes nor ears.\nLet us blame not him, therefore, but the manners of his time.\n\nBesides, his gaiety, however coarse it may appear to us--and how rare a\nthing is gaiety!--has, after all, nothing unwholesome about it; and this is\ntoo often overlooked.  Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?  Where,\neven indirectly, does he give pernicious advice?  Whom has he led to evil\nways?  Does he ever inspire feelings that breed misconduct and vice, or is\nhe ever the apologist of these?  Many poets and romance writers, under\ncover of a fastidious style, without one coarse expression, have been\nreally and actively hurtful; and of that it is impossible to accuse\nRabelais.  Women in particular quickly revolt from him, and turn away\nrepulsed at once by the archaic form of the language and by the\noutspokenness of the words.  But if he be read aloud to them, omitting the\nrougher parts and modernizing the pronunciation, it will be seen that they\ntoo are impressed by his lively wit as by the loftiness of his thought.  It\nwould be possible, too, to extract, for young persons, without\nmodification, admirable passages of incomparable force.  But those who have\nbrought out expurgated editions of him, or who have thought to improve him\nby trying to rewrite him in modern French, have been fools for their pains,\nand their insulting attempts have had, and always will have, the success\nthey deserve.\n\nHis dedications prove to what extent his whole work was accepted.  Not to\nspeak of his epistolary relations with Bude, with the Cardinal d'Armagnac\nand with Pellissier, the ambassador of Francis I. and Bishop of Maguelonne,\nor of his dedication to Tiraqueau of his Lyons edition of the Epistolae\nMedicinales of Giovanni Manardi of Ferrara, of the one addressed to the\nPresident Amaury Bouchard of the two legal texts which he believed antique,\nthere is still the evidence of his other and more important dedications.\nIn 1532 he dedicated his Hippocrates and his Galen to Geoffroy d'Estissac,\nBishop of Maillezais, to whom in 1535 and 1536 he addressed from Rome the\nthree news letters, which alone have been preserved; and in 1534 he\ndedicated from Lyons his edition of the Latin book of Marliani on the\ntopography of Rome to Jean du Bellay (at that time Bishop of Paris) who was\nraised to the Cardinalate in 1535.  Beside these dedications we must set\nthe privilege of Francis I. of September, 1545, and the new privilege\ngranted by Henry II. on August 6th, 1550, Cardinal de Chatillon present,\nfor the third book, which was dedicated, in an eight-lined stanza, to the\nSpirit of the Queen of Navarre.  These privileges, from the praises and\neulogies they express in terms very personal and very exceptional, are as\nimportant in Rabelais' life as were, in connection with other matters, the\nApostolic Pastorals in his favour.  Of course, in these the popes had not\nto introduce his books of diversions, which, nevertheless, would have\nseemed in their eyes but very venial sins.  The Sciomachie of 1549, an\naccount of the festivities arranged at Rome by Cardinal du Bellay in honour\nof the birth of the second son of Henry II., was addressed to Cardinal de\nGuise, and in 1552 the fourth book was dedicated, in a new prologue, to\nCardinal de Chatillon, the brother of Admiral de Coligny.\n\nThese are no unknown or insignificant personages, but the greatest lords\nand princes of the Church.  They loved and admired and protected Rabelais,\nand put no restrictions in his way.  Why should we be more fastidious and\nsevere than they were?  Their high contemporary appreciation gives much\nfood for thought.\n\nThere are few translations of Rabelais in foreign tongues; and certainly\nthe task is no light one, and demands more than a familiarity with ordinary\nFrench.  It would have been easier in Italy than anywhere else.  Italian,\nfrom its flexibility and its analogy to French, would have lent itself\nadmirably to the purpose; the instrument was ready, but the hand was not\nforthcoming.  Neither is there any Spanish translation, a fact which can be\nmore easily understood.  The Inquisition would have been a far more serious\nopponent than the Paris' Sorbonne, and no one ventured on the experiment.\nYet Rabelais forces comparison with Cervantes, whose precursor he was in\nreality, though the two books and the two minds are very different.  They\nhave only one point in common, their attack and ridicule of the romances of\nchivalry and of the wildly improbable adventures of knight-errants.  But in\nDon Quixote there is not a single detail which would suggest that Cervantes\nknew Rabelais' book or owed anything to it whatsoever, even the\nstarting-point of his subject.  Perhaps it was better he should not have\nbeen influenced by him, in however slight a degree; his originality is the\nmore intact and the more genial.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabelais has been several times translated into German.\nIn the present century Regis published at Leipsic, from 1831 to 1841, with\ncopious notes, a close and faithful translation.  The first one cannot be\nso described, that of Johann Fischart, a native of Mainz or Strasburg, who\ndied in 1614.  He was a Protestant controversialist, and a satirist of\nfantastic and abundant imagination.  In 1575 appeared his translation of\nRabelais' first book, and in 1590 he published the comic catalogue of the\nlibrary of Saint Victor, borrowed from the second book.  It is not a\ntranslation, but a recast in the boldest style, full of alterations and of\nexaggerations, both as regards the coarse expressions which he took upon\nhimself to develop and to add to, and in the attacks on the Roman Catholic\nChurch.  According to Jean Paul Richter, Fischart is much superior to\nRabelais in style and in the fruitfulness of his ideas, and his equal in\nerudition and in the invention of new expressions after the manner of\nAristophanes.  He is sure that his work was successful, because it was\noften reprinted during his lifetime; but this enthusiasm of Jean Paul would\nhardly carry conviction in France.  Who treads in another's footprints must\nfollow in the rear.  Instead of a creator, he is but an imitator.  Those\nwho take the ideas of others to modify them, and make of them creations of\ntheir own, like Shakespeare in England, Moliere and La Fontaine in France,\nmay be superior to those who have served them with suggestions; but then\nthe new works must be altogether different, must exist by themselves.\nShakespeare and the others, when they imitated, may be said always to have\ndestroyed their models.  These copyists, if we call them so, created such\nworks of genius that the only pity is they are so rare.  This is not the\ncase with Fischart, but it would be none the less curious were some one\nthoroughly familiar with German to translate Fischart for us, or at least,\nby long extracts from him, give an idea of the vagaries of German taste\nwhen it thought it could do better than Rabelais.  It is dangerous to\ntamper with so great a work, and he who does so runs a great risk of\nburning his fingers.\n\nEngland has been less daring, and her modesty and discretion have brought\nher success.  But, before speaking of Urquhart's translation, it is but\nright to mention the English-French Dictionary of Randle Cotgrave, the\nfirst edition of which dates from 1611.  It is in every way exceedingly\nvaluable, and superior to that of Nicot, because instead of keeping to the\nplane of classic and Latin French, it showed an acquaintance with and\nmastery of the popular tongue as well as of the written and learned\nlanguage.  As a foreigner, Cotgrave is a little behind in his information.\nHe is not aware of all the changes and novelties of the passing fashion.\nThe Pleiad School he evidently knew nothing of, but kept to the writers of\nthe fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century.  Thus words out\nof Rabelais, which he always translates with admirable skill, are frequent,\nand he attaches to them their author's name.  So Rabelais had already\ncrossed the Channel, and was read in his own tongue.  Somewhat later,\nduring the full sway of the Commonwealth--and Maitre Alcofribas Nasier must\nhave been a surprising apparition in the midst of Puritan severity--Captain\nUrquhart undertook to translate him and to naturalize him completely in\nEngland.\n\nThomas Urquhart belonged to a very old family of good standing in the North\nof Scotland.  After studying in Aberdeen he travelled in France, Spain, and\nItaly, where his sword was as active as that intelligent curiosity of his\nwhich is evidenced by his familiarity with three languages and the large\nlibrary which he brought back, according to his own account, from sixteen\ncountries he had visited.\n\nOn his return to England he entered the service of Charles I., who knighted\nhim in 1641.  Next year, after the death of his father, he went to Scotland\nto set his family affairs in order, and to redeem his house in Cromarty.\nBut, in spite of another sojourn in foreign lands, his efforts to free\nhimself from pecuniary embarrassments were unavailing.  At the king's death\nhis Scottish loyalty caused him to side with those who opposed the\nParliament.  Formally proscribed in 1649, taken prisoner at the defeat of\nWorcester in 1651, stripped of all his belongings, he was brought to\nLondon, but was released on parole at Cromwell's recommendation.  After\nreceiving permission to spend five months in Scotland to try once more to\nsettle his affairs, he came back to London to escape from his creditors.\nAnd there he must have died, though the date of his death is unknown.  It\nprobably took place after 1653, the date of the publication of the two\nfirst books, and after having written the translation of the third, which\nwas not printed from his manuscript till the end of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\nHis life was therefore not without its troubles, and literary activity must\nhave been almost his only consolation.  His writings reveal him as the\nstrangest character, fantastic, and full of a naive vanity, which, even at\nthe time he was translating the genealogy of Gargantua--surely well\ncalculated to cure any pondering on his own--caused him to trace his\nunbroken descent from Adam, and to state that his family name was derived\nfrom his ancestor Esormon, Prince of Achaia, 2139 B.C., who was surnamed\nOurochartos, that is to say the Fortunate and the Well-beloved.  A Gascon\ncould not have surpassed this.\n\nGifted as he was, learned in many directions, an enthusiastic\nmathematician, master of several languages, occasionally full of wit and\nhumour, and even good sense, yet he gave his books the strangest titles,\nand his ideas were no less whimsical.  His style is mystic, fastidious, and\ntoo often of a wearisome length and obscurity; his verses rhyme anyhow, or\nnot at all; but vivacity, force and heat are never lacking, and the\nMaitland Club did well in reprinting, in 1834, his various works, which are\nvery rare.  Yet, in spite of their curious interest, he owes his real\ndistinction and the survival of his name to his translation of Rabelais.\n\nThe first two books appeared in 1653.  The original edition, exceedingly\nscarce, was carefully reprinted in 1838, only a hundred copies being\nissued, by an English bibliophile T(heodore) M(artin), whose interesting\npreface I regret to sum up so cursorily.  At the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, in 1693, a French refugee, Peter Antony Motteux, whose English\nverses and whose plays are not without value, published in a little octavo\nvolume a reprint, very incorrect as to the text, of the first two books, to\nwhich he added the third, from the manuscript found amongst Urquhart's\npapers.  The success which attended this venture suggested to Motteux the\nidea of completing the work, and a second edition, in two volumes, appeared\nin 1708, with the translation of the fourth and fifth books, and notes.\nNineteen years after his death, John Ozell, translator on a large scale of\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish authors, revised Motteux's edition, which he\npublished in five volumes in 1737, adding Le Duchat's notes; and this\nversion has often been reprinted since.\n\nThe continuation by Motteux, who was also the translator of Don Quixote,\nhas merits of its own.  It is precise, elegant, and very faithful.\nUrquhart's, without taking liberties with Rabelais like Fischart, is not\nalways so closely literal and exact.  Nevertheless, it is much superior to\nMotteux's.  If Urquhart does not constantly adhere to the form of the\nexpression, if he makes a few slight additions, not only has he an\nunderstanding of the original, but he feels it, and renders the sense with\na force and a vivacity full of warmth and brilliancy.  His own learning\nmade the comprehension of the work easy to him, and his anglicization of\nwords fabricated by Rabelais is particularly successful.  The necessity of\nkeeping to his text prevented his indulgence in the convolutions and\ndivagations dictated by his exuberant fancy when writing on his own\naccount.  His style, always full of life and vigour, is here balanced,\nlucid, and picturesque.  Never elsewhere did he write so well.  And thus\nthe translation reproduces the very accent of the original, besides\npossessing a very remarkable character of its own.  Such a literary tone\nand such literary qualities are rarely found in a translation.  Urquhart's,\nvery useful for the interpretation of obscure passages, may, and indeed\nshould be read as a whole, both for Rabelais and for its own merits.\n\nHolland, too, possesses a translation of Rabelais.  They knew French in\nthat country in the seventeenth century better than they do to-day, and\nthere Rabelais' works were reprinted when no editions were appearing in\nFrance.  This Dutch translation was published at Amsterdam in 1682, by J.\nTenhoorn.  The name attached to it, Claudio Gallitalo (Claudius\nFrench-Italian) must certainly be a pseudonym.  Only a Dutch scholar could\nidentify the translator, and state the value to be assigned to his work.\n\nRabelais' style has many different sources.  Besides its force and\nbrilliancy, its gaiety, wit, and dignity, its abundant richness is no less\nremarkable.  It would be impossible and useless to compile a glossary of\nVoltaire's words.  No French writer has used so few, and all of them are of\nthe simplest.  There is not one of them that is not part of the common\nspeech, or which demands a note or an explanation.  Rabelais' vocabulary,\non the other hand, is of an astonishing variety.  Where does it all come\nfrom?  As a fact, he had at his command something like three languages,\nwhich he used in turn, or which he mixed according to the effect he wished\nto produce.\n\nFirst of all, of course, he had ready to his hand the whole speech of his\ntime, which had no secrets for him.  Provincials have been too eager to\nappropriate him, to make of him a local author, the pride of some village,\nin order that their district might have the merit of being one of the\ncauses, one of the factors of his genius.  Every neighbourhood where he\never lived has declared that his distinction was due to his knowledge of\nits popular speech.  But these dialect-patriots have fallen out among\nthemselves.  To which dialect was he indebted?  Was it that of Touraine, or\nBerri, or Poitou, or Paris?  It is too often forgotten, in regard to French\npatois--leaving out of count the languages of the South--that the words or\nexpressions that are no longer in use to-day are but a survival, a still\nliving trace of the tongue and the pronunciation of other days.  Rabelais,\nmore than any other writer, took advantage of the happy chances and the\nrichness of the popular speech, but he wrote in French, and nothing but\nFrench.  That is why he remains so forcible, so lucid, and so living, more\nliving even--speaking only of his style out of charity to the others--than\nany of his contemporaries.\n\nIt has been said that great French prose is solely the work of the\nseventeenth century.  There were nevertheless, before that, two men,\ncertainly very different and even hostile, who were its initiators and its\nmasters, Calvin on the one hand, on the other Rabelais.\n\nRabelais had a wonderful knowledge of the prose and the verse of the\nfifteenth century:  he was familiar with Villon, Pathelin, the Quinze Joies\nde Mariage, the Cent Nouvelles, the chronicles and the romances, and even\nearlier works, too, such as the Roman de la Rose.  Their words, their turns\nof expression came naturally to his pen, and added a piquancy and, as it\nwere, a kind of gloss of antique novelty to his work.  He fabricated words,\ntoo, on Greek and Latin models, with great ease, sometimes audaciously and\nwith needless frequency.  These were for him so many means, so many\nelements of variety.  Sometimes he did this in mockery, as in the humorous\ndiscourse of the Limousin scholar, for which he is not a little indebted to\nGeoffroy Tory in the Champfleury; sometimes, on the contrary, seriously,\nfrom a habit acquired in dealing with classical tongues.\n\nAgain, another reason of the richness of his vocabulary was that he\ninvented and forged words for himself.  Following the example of\nAristophanes, he coined an enormous number of interminable words, droll\nexpressions, sudden and surprising constructions.  What had made Greece and\nthe Athenians laugh was worth transporting to Paris.\n\nWith an instrument so rich, resources so endless, and the skill to use\nthem, it is no wonder that he could give voice to anything, be as humorous\nas he could be serious, as comic as he could be grave, that he could\nexpress himself and everybody else, from the lowest to the highest.  He had\nevery colour on his palette, and such skill was in his fingers that he\ncould depict every variety of light and shade.\n\nWe have evidence that Rabelais did not always write in the same fashion.\nThe Chronique Gargantuaine is uniform in style and quite simple, but cannot\nwith certainty be attributed to him.  His letters are bombastic and thin;\nhis few attempts at verse are heavy, lumbering, and obscure, altogether\nlacking in harmony, and quite as bad as those of his friend, Jean Bouchet.\nHe had no gift of poetic form, as indeed is evident even from his prose.\nAnd his letters from Rome to the Bishop of Maillezais, interesting as they\nare in regard to the matter, are as dull, bare, flat, and dry in style as\npossible.  Without his signature no one would possibly have thought of\nattributing them to him.  He is only a literary artist when he wishes to be\nsuch; and in his romance he changes the style completely every other\nmoment:  it has no constant character or uniform manner, and therefore\nunity is almost entirely wanting in his work, while his endeavours after\ncontrast are unceasing.  There is throughout the whole the evidence of\ncareful and conscious elaboration.\n\nHence, however lucid and free be the style of his romance, and though its\nflexibility and ease seem at first sight to have cost no trouble at all,\nyet its merit lies precisely in the fact that it succeeds in concealing the\ntoil, in hiding the seams.  He could not have reached this perfection at a\nfirst attempt.  He must have worked long at the task, revised it again and\nagain, corrected much, and added rather than cut away.  The aptness of form\nand expression has been arrived at by deliberate means, and owes nothing to\nchance.  Apart from the toning down of certain bold passages, to soften\ntheir effect, and appease the storm--for these were not literary\nalterations, but were imposed on him by prudence--one can see how numerous\nare the variations in his text, how necessary it is to take account of\nthem, and to collect them.  A good edition, of course, would make no\nattempt at amalgamating these.  That would give a false impression and end\nin confusion; but it should note them all, and show them all, not combined,\nbut simply as variations.\n\nAfter Le Duchat, all the editions, in their care that nothing should be\nlost, made the mistake of collecting and placing side by side things which\nhad no connection with each other, which had even been substituted for each\nother.  The result was a fabricated text, full of contradictions naturally.\nBut since the edition issued by M. Jannet, the well-known publisher of the\nBibliotheque Elzevirienne, who was the first to get rid of this patchwork,\nthis mosaic, Rabelais' latest text has been given, accompanied by all the\nearlier variations, to show the changes he made, as well as his\nsuppressions and additions.  It would also be possible to reverse the\nmethod.  It would be interesting to take his first text as the basis,\nnoting the later modifications.  This would be quite as instructive and\nreally worth doing.  Perhaps one might then see more clearly with what care\nhe made his revisions, after what fashion he corrected, and especially what\nwere the additions he made.\n\nNo more striking instance can be quoted than the admirable chapter about\nthe shipwreck.  It was not always so long as Rabelais made it in the end:\nit was much shorter at first.  As a rule, when an author recasts some\npassage that he wishes to revise, he does so by rewriting the whole, or at\nleast by interpolating passages at one stroke, so to speak.  Nothing of the\nkind is seen here.  Rabelais suppressed nothing, modified nothing; he did\nnot change his plan at all.  What he did was to make insertions, to slip in\nbetween two clauses a new one.  He expressed his meaning in a lengthier\nway, and the former clause is found in its integrity along with the\nadditional one, of which it forms, as it were, the warp.  It was by this\nmethod of touching up the smallest details, by making here and there such\nlittle noticeable additions, that he succeeded in heightening the effect\nwithout either change or loss.  In the end it looks as if he had altered\nnothing, added nothing new, as if it had always been so from the first, and\nhad never been meddled with.\n\nThe comparison is most instructive, showing us to what an extent Rabelais'\nadmirable style was due to conscious effort, care, and elaboration, a fact\nwhich is generally too much overlooked, and how instead of leaving any\ntrace which would reveal toil and study, it has on the contrary a\nmarvellous cohesion, precision, and brilliancy.  It was modelled and\nremodelled, repaired, touched up, and yet it has all the appearance of\nhaving been created at a single stroke, or of having been run like molten\nwax into its final form.\n\nSomething should be said here of the sources from which Rabelais borrowed.\nHe was not the first in France to satirize the romances of chivalry.  The\nromance in verse by Baudouin de Sebourc, printed in recent years, was a\nparody of the Chansons de Geste.  In the Moniage Guillaume, and especially\nin the Moniage Rainouart, in which there is a kind of giant, and\noccasionally a comic giant, there are situations and scenes which remind us\nof Rabelais.  The kind of Fabliaux in mono-rhyme quatrains of the old\nAubery anticipate his coarse and popular jests.  But all that is beside the\nquestion; Rabelais did not know these.  Nothing is of direct interest save\nwhat was known to him, what fell under his eyes, what lay to his hand--as\nthe Facetiae of Poggio, and the last sermonnaires.  In the course of one's\nreading one may often enough come across the origin of some of Rabelais'\nwitticisms; here and there we may discover how he has developed a\nsituation.  While gathering his materials wherever he could find them, he\nwas nevertheless profoundly original.\n\nOn this point much research and investigation might be employed.  But there\nis no need why these researches should be extended to the region of fancy.\nGargantua has been proved by some to be of Celtic origin.  Very often he is\na solar myth, and the statement that Rabelais only collected popular\ntraditions and gave new life to ancient legends is said to be proved by the\nlarge number of megalithic monuments to which is attached the name of\nGargantua.  It was, of course, quite right to make a list of these, to draw\nup, as it were, a chart of them, but the conclusion is not justified.  The\nname, instead of being earlier, is really later, and is a witness, not to\nthe origin, but to the success and rapid popularity of his novel.  No one\nhas ever yet produced a written passage or any ancient testimony to prove\nthe existence of the name before Rabelais.  To place such a tradition on a\nsure basis, positive traces must be forthcoming; and they cannot be adduced\neven for the most celebrated of these monuments, since he mentions himself\nthe great menhir near Poitiers, which he christened by the name of\nPasselourdin.  That there is something in the theory is possible.  Perrault\nfound the subjects of his stories in the tales told by mothers and nurses.\nHe fixed them finally by writing them down.  Floating about vaguely as they\nwere, he seized them, worked them up, gave them shape, and yet of scarcely\nany of them is there to be found before his time a single trace.  So we\nmust resign ourselves to know just as little of what Gargantua and\nPantagruel were before the sixteenth century.\n\nIn a book of a contemporary of Rabelais, the Legende de Pierre Faifeu by\nthe Angevin, Charles de Bourdigne, the first edition of which dates from\n1526 and the second 1531--both so rare and so forgotten that the work is\nonly known since the eighteenth century by the reprint of Custelier--in the\nintroductory ballad which recommends this book to readers, occur these\nlines in the list of popular books which Faifeu would desire to replace:\n\n  'Laissez ester Caillette le folastre,\n  Les quatre filz Aymon vestuz de bleu,\n  Gargantua qui a cheveux de plastre.'\n\nHe has not 'cheveux de plastre' in Rabelais.  If the rhyme had not\nsuggested the phrase--and the exigencies of the strict form of the ballade\nand its forced repetitions often imposed an idea which had its whole origin\nin the rhyme--we might here see a dramatic trace found nowhere else.  The\nname of Pantagruel is mentioned too, incidentally, in a Mystery of the\nfifteenth century.  These are the only references to the names which up\ntill now have been discovered, and they are, as one sees, of but little\naccount.\n\nOn the other hand, the influence of Aristophanes and of Lucian, his\nintimate acquaintance with nearly all the writers of antiquity, Greek as\nwell as Latin, with whom Rabelais is more permeated even than Montaigne,\nwere a mine of inspiration.  The proof of it is everywhere.  Pliny\nespecially was his encyclopaedia, his constant companion.  All he says of\nthe Pantagruelian herb, though he amply developed it for himself, is taken\nfrom Pliny's chapter on flax.  And there is a great deal more of this kind\nto be discovered, for Rabelais does not always give it as quotation.  On\nthe other hand, when he writes, 'Such an one says,' it would be difficult\nenough to find who is meant, for the 'such an one' is a fictitious writer.\nThe method is amusing, but it is curious to account of it.\n\nThe question of the Chronique Gargantuaine is still undecided.  Is it by\nRabelais or by someone else?  Both theories are defensible, and can be\nsupported by good reasons.  In the Chronique everything is heavy,\noccasionally meaningless, and nearly always insipid.  Can the same man have\nwritten the Chronique and Gargantua, replaced a book really commonplace by\na masterpiece, changed the facts and incidents, transformed a heavy icy\npleasantry into a work glowing with wit and life, made it no longer a mass\nof laborious trifling and cold-blooded exaggerations but a satire on human\nlife of the highest genius?  Still there are points common to the two.\nBesides, Rabelais wrote other things; and it is only in his romance that he\nshows literary skill.  The conception of it would have entered his mind\nfirst only in a bare and summary fashion.  It would have been taken up\nagain, expanded, developed, metamorphosed.  That is possible, and, for my\npart, I am of those who, like Brunet and Nodier, are inclined to think that\nthe Chronique, in spite of its inferiority, is really a first attempt,\ncondemned as soon as the idea was conceived in another form.  As its\nearlier date is incontestable, we must conclude that if the Chronique is\nnot by him, his Gargantua and its continuation would not have existed\nwithout it.  This would be a great obligation to stand under to some\nunknown author, and in that case it is astonishing that his enemies did not\nreproach him during his lifetime with being merely an imitator and a\nplagiarist.  So there are reasons for and against his authorship of it, and\nit would be dangerous to make too bold an assertion.\n\nOne fact which is absolutely certain and beyond all controversy, is that\nRabelais owed much to one of his contemporaries, an Italian, to the\nHistoire Macaronique of Merlin Coccaie.  Its author, Theophilus Folengo,\nwho was also a monk, was born in 1491, and died only a short time before\nRabelais, in 1544.  But his burlesque poem was published in 1517.  It was\nin Latin verse, written in an elaborately fabricated style.  It is not dog\nLatin, but Latin ingeniously italianized, or rather Italian, even Mantuan,\nlatinized.  The contrast between the modern form of the word and its Roman\ngarb produces the most amusing effect.  In the original it is sometimes\ndifficult to read, for Folengo has no objection to using the most\ncolloquial words and phrases.\n\nThe subject is quite different.  It is the adventures of Baldo, son of Guy\nde Montauban, the very lively history of his youth, his trial, imprisonment\nand deliverance, his journey in search of his father, during which he\nvisits the Planets and Hell.  The narration is constantly interrupted by\nincidental adventures.  Occasionally they are what would be called to-day\nvery naturalistic, and sometimes they are madly extravagant.\n\nBut Fracasso, Baldo's friend, is a giant; another friend, Cingar, who\ndelivers him, is Panurge exactly, and quite as much given to practical\njoking.  The women in the senile amour of the old Tognazzo, the judges, and\nthe poor sergeants, are no more gently dealt with by Folengo than by the\nmonk of the Iles d'Hyeres.  If Dindenaut's name does not occur, there are\nthe sheep.  The tempest is there, and the invocation to all the saints.\nRabelais improves all he borrows, but it is from Folengo he starts.  He\ndoes not reproduce the words, but, like the Italian, he revels in drinking\nscenes, junkettings, gormandizing, battles, scuffles, wounds and corpses,\nmagic, witches, speeches, repeated enumerations, lengthiness, and a\nsolemnly minute precision of impossible dates and numbers.  The atmosphere,\nthe tone, the methods are the same, and to know Rabelais well, you must\nknow Folengo well too.\n\nDetailed proof of this would be too lengthy a matter; one would have to\nquote too many passages, but on this question of sources nothing is more\ninteresting than a perusal of the Opus Macaronicorum.  It was translated\ninto French only in 1606--Paris, Gilley Robinot.  This translation of\ncourse cannot reproduce all the many amusing forms of words, but it is\nuseful, nevertheless, in showing more clearly the points of resemblance\nbetween the two works,--how far in form, ideas, details, and phrases\nRabelais was permeated by Folengo.  The anonymous translator saw this quite\nwell, and said so in his title, 'Histoire macaronique de Merlin Coccaie,\nprototype of Rabelais.'  It is nothing but the truth, and Rabelais, who\ndoes not hide it from himself, on more than one occasion mentions the name\nof Merlin Coccaie.\n\nBesides, Rabelais was fed on the Italians of his time as on the Greeks and\nRomans.  Panurge, who owes much to Cingar, is also not free from\nobligations to the miscreant Margutte in the Morgante Maggiore of Pulci.\nHad Rabelais in his mind the tale from the Florentine Chronicles, how in\nthe Savonarola riots, when the Piagnoni and the Arrabiati came to blows in\nthe church of the Dominican convent of San-Marco, Fra Pietro in the scuffle\nbroke the heads of the assailants with the bronze crucifix he had taken\nfrom the altar?  A well-handled cross could so readily be used as a weapon,\nthat probably it has served as such more than once, and other and even\nquite modern instances might be quoted.\n\nBut other Italian sources are absolutely certain.  There are few more\nwonderful chapters in Rabelais than the one about the drinkers.  It is not\na dialogue:  those short exclamations exploding from every side, all\nreferring to the same thing, never repeating themselves, and yet always\nvarying the same theme.  At the end of the Novelle of Gentile Sermini of\nSiena, there is a chapter called Il Giuoco della pugna, the Game of Battle.\nHere are the first lines of it:  'Apre, apre, apre.  Chi gioca, chi gioca\n--uh, uh!--A Porrione, a Porrione.--Viela, viela; date a ognuno.--Alle\nmantella, alle mantella.--Oltre di corsa; non vi fermate.--Voltate qui;\necco costoro; fate veli innanzi.--Viela, viela; date costi.--Chi la fa?\nIo--Ed io.--Dagli; ah, ah, buona fu.--Or cosi; alla mascella, al fianco.\n--Dagli basso; di punta, di punta.--Ah, ah, buon gioco, buon gioco.'\n\nAnd thus it goes on with fire and animation for pages.  Rabelais probably\ntranslated or directly imitated it.  He changed the scene; there was no\ngiuooco della pugna in France.  He transferred to a drinking-bout this\nclatter of exclamations which go off by themselves, which cross each other\nand get no answer.  He made a wonderful thing of it.  But though he did not\ncopy Sermini, yet Sermini's work provided him with the form of the subject,\nand was the theme for Rabelais' marvellous variations.\n\nWho does not remember the fantastic quarrel of the cook with the poor devil\nwho had flavoured his dry bread with the smoke of the roast, and the\njudgment of Seyny John, truly worthy of Solomon?  It comes from the Cento\nNovelle Antiche, rewritten from tales older than Boccaccio, and moreover of\nan extreme brevity and dryness.  They are only the framework, the notes,\nthe skeleton of tales.  The subject is often wonderful, but nothing is made\nof it:  it is left unshaped.  Rabelais wrote a version of one, the ninth.\nThe scene takes place, not at Paris, but at Alexandria in Egypt among the\nSaracens, and the cook is called Fabrac.  But the surprise at the end, the\nsagacious judgment by which the sound of a piece of money was made the\nprice of the smoke, is the same.  Now the first dated edition of the Cento\nNovelle (which were frequently reprinted) appeared at Bologna in 1525, and\nit is certain that Rabelais had read the tales.  And there would be much\nelse of the same kind to learn if we knew Rabelais' library.\n\nA still stranger fact of this sort may be given to show how nothing came\namiss to him.  He must have known, and even copied the Latin Chronicle of\nthe Counts of Anjou.  It is accepted, and rightly so, as an historical\ndocument, but that is no reason for thinking that the truth may not have\nbeen manipulated and adorned.  The Counts of Anjou were not saints.  They\nwere proud, quarrelsome, violent, rapacious, and extravagant, as greedy as\nthey were charitable to the Church, treacherous and cruel.  Yet their\nanonymous panegyrist has made them patterns of all the virtues.  In reality\nit is both a history and in some sort a romance; especially is it a\ncollection of examples worthy of being followed, in the style of the\nCyropaedia, our Juvenal of the fifteenth century, and a little like\nFenelon's Telemaque.  Now in it there occurs the address of one of the\ncounts to those who rebelled against him and who were at his mercy.\nRabelais must have known it, for he has copied it, or rather, literally\ntranslated whole lines of it in the wonderful speech of Gargantua to the\nvanquished.  His contemporaries, who approved of his borrowing from\nantiquity, could not detect this one, because the book was not printed till\nmuch later.  But Rabelais lived in Maine.  In Anjou, which often figures\namong the localities he names, he must have met with and read the\nChronicles of the Counts in manuscript, probably in some monastery library,\nwhether at Fontenay-le-Comte or elsewhere it matters little.  There is not\nonly a likeness in the ideas and tone, but in the words too, which cannot\nbe a mere matter of chance.  He must have known the Chronicles of the\nCounts of Anjou, and they inspired one of his finest pages.  One sees,\ntherefore, how varied were the sources whence he drew, and how many of them\nmust probably always escape us.\n\nWhen, as has been done for Moliere, a critical bibliography of the works\nrelating to Rabelais is drawn up--which, by the bye, will entail a very\ngreat amount of labour--the easiest part will certainly be the bibliography\nof the old editions.  That is the section that has been most satisfactorily\nand most completely worked out.  M. Brunet said the last word on the\nsubject in his Researches in 1852, and in the important article in the\nfifth edition of his Manuel du Libraire (iv., 1863, pp. 1037-1071).\n\nThe facts about the fifth book cannot be summed up briefly.  It was printed\nas a whole at first, without the name of the place, in 1564, and next year\nat Lyons by Jean Martin.  It has given, and even still gives rise to two\ncontradictory opinions.  Is it Rabelais' or not?\n\nFirst of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen years have gone by\nbefore it was printed?  Then, does it bear evident marks of his\nworkmanship?  Is the hand of the master visible throughout?  Antoine Du\nVerdier in the 1605 edition of his Prosopographie writes: '(Rabelais')\nmisfortune has been that everybody has wished to \"pantagruelize!\" and\nseveral books have appeared under his name, and have been added to his\nworks, which are not by him, as, for instance, l'Ile Sonnante, written by a\ncertain scholar of Valence and others.'\n\nThe scholar of Valence might be Guillaume des Autels, to whom with more\ncertainty can be ascribed the authorship of a dull imitation of Rabelais,\nthe History of Fanfreluche and Gaudichon, published in 1578, which, to say\nthe least of it, is very much inferior to the fifth book.\n\nLouis Guyon, in his Diverses Lecons, is still more positive:  'As to the\nlast book which has been included in his works, entitled l'Ile Sonnante,\nthe object of which seems to be to find fault with and laugh at the members\nand the authorities of the Catholic Church, I protest that he did not\ncompose it, for it was written long after his death.  I was at Paris when\nit was written, and I know quite well who was its author; he was not a\ndoctor.'  That is very emphatic, and it is impossible to ignore it.\n\nYet everyone must recognize that there is a great deal of Rabelais in the\nfifth book.  He must have planned it and begun it.  Remembering that in\n1548 he had published, not as an experiment, but rather as a bait and as an\nannouncement, the first eleven chapters of the fourth book, we may conclude\nthat the first sixteen chapters of the fifth book published by themselves\nnine years after his death, in 1562, represent the remainder of his\ndefinitely finished work.  This is the more certain because these first\nchapters, which contain the Apologue of the Horse and the Ass and the\nterrible Furred Law-cats, are markedly better than what follows them.  They\nare not the only ones where the master's hand may be traced, but they are\nthe only ones where no other hand could possibly have interfered.\n\nIn the remainder the sentiment is distinctly Protestant.  Rabelais was much\nstruck by the vices of the clergy and did not spare them.  Whether we are\nunable to forgive his criticisms because they were conceived in a spirit of\nraillery, or whether, on the other hand, we feel admiration for him on this\npoint, yet Rabelais was not in the least a sectary.  If he strongly desired\na moral reform, indirectly pointing out the need of it in his mocking\nfashion, he was not favourable to a political reform.  Those who would make\nof him a Protestant altogether forget that the Protestants of his time were\nnot for him, but against him.  Henri Estienne, for instance, Ramus,\nTheodore de Beze, and especially Calvin, should know how he was to be\nregarded.  Rabelais belonged to what may be called the early reformation,\nto that band of honest men in the beginning of the sixteenth century,\nprecursors of the later one perhaps, but, like Erasmus, between the two\nextremes.  He was neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, neither German nor\nGenevese, and it is quite natural that his work was not reprinted in\nSwitzerland, which would certainly have happened had the Protestants looked\non him as one of themselves.\n\nThat Rabelais collected the materials for the fifth book, had begun it, and\ngot on some way, there can be no doubt:  the excellence of a large number\nof passages prove it, but--taken as a whole--the fifth book has not the\nvalue, the verve, and the variety of the others.  The style is quite\ndifferent, less rich, briefer, less elaborate, drier, in parts even\nwearisome.  In the first four books Rabelais seldom repeats himself.  The\nfifth book contains from the point of view of the vocabulary really the\nleast novelty.  On the contrary, it is full of words and expressions\nalready met with, which is very natural in an imitation, in a copy, forced\nto keep to a similar tone, and to show by such reminders and likenesses\nthat it is really by the same pen.  A very striking point is the profound\ndifference in the use of anatomical terms.  In the other books they are\nmost frequently used in a humorous sense, and nonsensically, with a quite\nother meaning than their own; in the fifth they are applied correctly.  It\nwas necessary to include such terms to keep up the practice, but the writer\nhas not thought of using them to add to the comic effect:  one cannot\nalways think of everything.  Trouble has been taken, of course, to include\nenumerations, but there are much fewer fabricated and fantastic words.  In\nshort, the hand of the maker is far from showing the same suppleness and\nstrength.\n\nA eulogistic quatrain is signed Nature quite, which, it is generally\nagreed, is an anagram of Jean Turquet.  Did the adapter of the fifth book\nsign his work in this indirect fashion?  He might be of the Genevese family\nto whom Louis Turquet and his son Theodore belonged, both well-known, and\nboth strong Protestants.  The obscurity relating to this matter is far from\nbeing cleared up, and perhaps never will be.\n\nIt fell to my lot--here, unfortunately, I am forced to speak of a personal\nmatter--to print for the first time the manuscript of the fifth book.  At\nfirst it was hoped it might be in Rabelais' own hand; afterwards that it\nmight be at least a copy of his unfinished work.  The task was a difficult\none, for the writing, extremely flowing and rapid, is execrable, and most\ndifficult to decipher and to transcribe accurately.  Besides, it often\nhappens in the sixteenth and the end of the fifteenth century, that\nmanuscripts are much less correct than the printed versions, even when they\nhave not been copied by clumsy and ignorant hands.  In this case, it is the\nwriting of a clerk executed as quickly as possible.  The farther it goes\nthe more incorrect it becomes, as if the writer were in haste to finish.\n\nWhat is really the origin of it?  It has less the appearance of notes or\nfragments prepared by Rabelais than of a first attempt at revision.  It is\nnot an author's rough draft; still less is it his manuscript.  If I had not\nprinted this enigmatical text with scrupulous and painful fidelity, I would\ndo it now.  It was necessary to do it so as to clear the way.  But as the\nthing is done, and accessible to those who may be interested, and who wish\nto critically examine it, there is no further need of reprinting it.  All\nthe editions of Rabelais continue, and rightly, to reproduce the edition of\n1564.  It is not the real Rabelais, but however open to criticism it may\nbe, it was under that form that the fifth book appeared in the sixteenth\ncentury, under that form it was accepted.  Consequently it is convenient\nand even necessary to follow and keep to the original edition.\n\nThe first sixteen chapters may, and really must be, the text of Rabelais,\nin the final form as left by him, and found after his death; the framework,\nand a number of the passages in the continuation, the best ones, of course,\nare his, but have been patched up and tampered with.  Nothing can have been\nsuppressed of what existed; it was evidently thought that everything should\nbe admitted with the final revision; but the tone was changed, additions\nwere made, and 'improvements.'  Adapters are always strangely vain.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the French printing-press, save for an edition\nissued at Troyes in 1613, gave up publishing Rabelais, and the work passed\nto foreign countries.  Jean Fuet reprinted him at Antwerp in 1602.  After\nthe Amsterdam edition of 1659, where for the first time appears 'The\nAlphabet of the French Author,' comes the Elzevire edition of 1663.  The\ntype, an imitation of what made the reputation of the little volumes of the\nGryphes of Lyons, is charming, the printing is perfect, and the paper,\nwhich is French--the development of paper-making in Holland and England did\nnot take place till after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes--is\nexcellent.  They are pretty volumes to the eye, but, as in all the reprints\nof the seventeenth century, the text is full of faults and most\nuntrustworthy.\n\nFrance, through a representative in a foreign land, however, comes into\nline again in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and in a really\nserious fashion, thanks to the very considerable learning of a French\nrefugee, Jacob Le Duchat, who died in 1748.  He had a most thorough\nknowledge of the French prose-writers of the sixteenth century, and he made\nthem accessible by his editions of the Quinze Joies du Mariage, of Henri\nEstienne, of Agrippa d'Aubigne, of L'Etoile, and of the Satyre Menippee.\nIn 1711 he published an edition of Rabelais at Amsterdam, through Henry\nBordesius, in five duodecimo volumes.  The reprint in quarto which he\nissued in 1741, seven years before his death, is, with its engravings by\nBernard Picot, a fine library edition.  Le Duchat's is the first of the\ncritical editions.  It takes account of differences in the texts, and\nbegins to point out the variations.  His very numerous notes are\nremarkable, and are still worthy of most serious consideration.  He was the\nfirst to offer useful elucidations, and these have been repeated after him,\nand with good reason will continue to be so.  The Abbe de Massy's edition\nof 1752, also an Amsterdam production, has made use of Le Duchat's but does\nnot take its place.  Finally, at the end of the century, Cazin printed\nRabelais in his little volume, in 1782, and Bartiers issued two editions\n(of no importance) at Paris in 1782 and 1798.  Fortunately the nineteenth\ncentury has occupied itself with the great 'Satyrique' in a more competent\nand useful fashion.\n\nIn 1820 L'Aulnaye published through Desoer his three little volumes,\nprinted in exquisite style, and which have other merits besides.  His\nvolume of annotations, in which, that nothing might be lost of his own\nnotes, he has included many things not directly relating to Rabelais, is\nfull of observations and curious remarks which are very useful additions to\nLe Duchat.  One fault to be found with him is his further complication of\nthe spelling.  This he did in accordance with a principle that the words\nshould be referred to their real etymology.  Learned though he was,\nRabelais had little care to be so etymological, and it is not his theories\nbut those of the modern scholar that have been ventilated.\n\nSomewhat later, from 1823 to 1826, Esmangart and Johanneau issued a\nvariorum edition in nine volumes, in which the text is often encumbered by\nnotes which are really too numerous, and, above all, too long.  The work\nwas an enormous one, but the best part of it is Le Duchat's, and what is\nnot his is too often absolutely hypothetical and beside the truth.  Le\nDuchat had already given too much importance to the false historical\nexplanation.  Here it is constantly coming in, and it rests on no evidence.\nIn reality, there is no need of the key to Rabelais by which to discover\nthe meaning of subtle allusions.  He is neither so complicated nor so full\nof riddles.  We know how he has scattered the names of contemporaries about\nhis work, sometimes of friends, sometimes of enemies, and without\ndisguising them under any mask.  He is no more Panurge than Louis XII. is\nGargantua or Francis I. Pantagruel.  Rabelais says what he wants, all he\nwants, and in the way he wants.  There are no mysteries below the surface,\nand it is a waste of time to look for knots in a bulrush.  All the\nhistorical explanations are purely imaginary, utterly without proof, and\nshould the more emphatically be looked on as baseless and dismissed.  They\nare radically false, and therefore both worthless and harmful.\n\nIn 1840 there appeared in the Bibliotheque Charpentier the Rabelais in a\nsingle duodecimo volume, begun by Charles Labiche, and, after his death,\ncompleted by M. Paul Lacroix, whose share is the larger.  The text is that\nof L'Aulnaye; the short footnotes, with all their brevity, contain useful\nexplanations of difficult words.  Amongst the editions of Rabelais this is\none of the most important, because it brought him many readers and\nadmirers.  No other has made him so well and so widely known as this\nportable volume, which has been constantly reprinted.  No other has been so\nwidely circulated, and the sale still goes on.  It was, and must still be\nlooked on as a most serviceable edition.\n\nThe edition published by Didot in 1857 has an altogether special character.\nIn the biographical notice M. Rathery for the first time treated as they\ndeserve the foolish prejudices which have made Rabelais misunderstood, and\nM. Burgaud des Marets set the text on a quite new base.  Having proved,\nwhat of course is very evident, that in the original editions the spelling,\nand the language too, were of the simplest and clearest, and were not\nbristling with the nonsensical and superfluous consonants which have given\nrise to the idea that Rabelais is difficult to read, he took the trouble\nfirst of all to note the spelling of each word.  Whenever in a single\ninstance he found it in accordance with modern spelling, he made it the\nsame throughout.  The task was a hard one, and Rabelais certainly gained in\nclearness, but over-zeal is often fatal to a reform.  In respect to its\nprecision and the value of its notes, which are short and very judicious,\nBurgaud des Marets' edition is valuable, and is amongst those which should\nbe known and taken into account.\n\nSince Le Duchat all the editions have a common fault.  They are not exactly\nguilty of fabricating, but they set up an artificial text in the sense\nthat, in order to lose as little as possible, they have collected and\nunited what originally were variations--the revisions, in short, of the\noriginal editions.  Guided by the wise counsels given by Brunet in 1852 in\nhis Researches on the old editions of Rabelais, Pierre Jannet published the\nfirst three books in 1858; then, when the publication of the Bibliotheque\nElzevirienne was discontinued, he took up the work again and finished the\nedition in Picard's blue library, in little volumes, each book quite\ndistinct.  It was M. Jannet who in our days first restored the pure and\nexact text of Rabelais, not only without retouching it, but without making\nadditions or insertions, or juxtaposition of things that were not formerly\nfound together.  For each of the books he has followed the last edition\nissued by Rabelais, and all the earlier differences he gives as variations.\nIt is astonishing that a thing so simple and so fitting should not have\nbeen done before, and the result is that this absolutely exact fidelity has\nrestored a lucidity which was not wanting in Rabelais's time, but which had\nsince been obscured.  All who have come after Jannet have followed in his\npath, and there is no reason for straying from it.\n\n\n\n\nFRANCIS RABELAIS.\n\n\nTHE FIRST BOOK.\n\n\nTo the Honoured, Noble Translator of Rabelais.\n\nRabelais, whose wit prodigiously was made,\nAll men, professions, actions to invade,\nWith so much furious vigour, as if it\nHad lived o'er each of them, and each had quit,\nYet with such happy sleight and careless skill,\nAs, like the serpent, doth with laughter kill,\nSo that although his noble leaves appear\nAntic and Gottish, and dull souls forbear\nTo turn them o'er, lest they should only find\nNothing but savage monsters of a mind,--\nNo shapen beauteous thoughts; yet when the wise\nSeriously strip him of his wild disguise,\nMelt down his dross, refine his massy ore,\nAnd polish that which seem'd rough-cast before,\nSearch his deep sense, unveil his hidden mirth,\nAnd make that fiery which before seem'd earth\n(Conquering those things of highest consequence,\nWhat's difficult of language or of sense),\nHe will appear some noble table writ\nIn the old Egyptian hieroglyphic wit;\nWhere, though you monsters and grotescoes see,\nYou meet all mysteries of philosophy.\nFor he was wise and sovereignly bred\nTo know what mankind is, how 't may be led:\nHe stoop'd unto them, like that wise man, who\nRid on a stick, when 's children would do so.\nFor we are easy sullen things, and must\nBe laugh'd aright, and cheated into trust;\nWhilst a black piece of phlegm, that lays about\nDull menaces, and terrifies the rout,\nAnd cajoles it, with all its peevish strength\nPiteously stretch'd and botch'd up into length,\nWhilst the tired rabble sleepily obey\nSuch opiate talk, and snore away the day,\nBy all his noise as much their minds relieves,\nAs caterwauling of wild cats frights thieves.\n  But Rabelais was another thing, a man\nMade up of all that art and nature can\nForm from a fiery genius,--he was one\nWhose soul so universally was thrown\nThrough all the arts of life, who understood\nEach stratagem by which we stray from good;\nSo that he best might solid virtue teach,\nAs some 'gainst sins of their own bosoms preach:\nHe from wise choice did the true means prefer,\nIn the fool's coat acting th' philosopher.\n  Thus hoary Aesop's beasts did mildly tame\nFierce man, and moralize him into shame;\nThus brave romances, while they seem to lay\nGreat trains of lust, platonic love display;\nThus would old Sparta, if a seldom chance\nShow'd a drunk slave, teach children temperance;\nThus did the later poets nobly bring\nThe scene to height, making the fool the king.\n  And, noble sir, you vigorously have trod\nIn this hard path, unknown, un-understood\nBy its own countrymen, 'tis you appear\nOur full enjoyment which was our despair,\nScattering his mists, cheering his cynic frowns\n(For radiant brightness now dark Rabelais crowns),\nLeaving your brave heroic cares, which must\nMake better mankind and embalm your dust,\nSo undeceiving us, that now we see\nAll wit in Gascon and in Cromarty,\nBesides that Rabelais is convey'd to us,\nAnd that our Scotland is not barbarous.\n\n                                      J.

Silenes of old were little\nboxes, like those we now may see in the shops of apothecaries, painted on\nthe outside with wanton toyish figures, as harpies, satyrs, bridled geese,\nhorned hares, saddled ducks, flying goats, thiller harts, and other\nsuch-like counterfeited pictures at discretion, to excite people unto\nlaughter, as Silenus himself, who was the foster-father of good Bacchus, was\nwont to do; but within those capricious caskets were carefully preserved and\nkept many rich jewels and fine drugs, such as balm, ambergris, amomon, musk,\ncivet, with several kinds of precious stones, and other things of great\nprice.  Just such another thing was Socrates.  For to have eyed his outside,\nand esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would not have given the\npeel of an onion for him, so deformed he was in body, and ridiculous in his\ngesture.  He had a sharp pointed nose, with the look of a bull, and\ncountenance of a fool:  he was in his carriage simple, boorish in his\napparel, in fortune poor, unhappy in his wives, unfit for all offices in the\ncommonwealth, always laughing, tippling, and merrily carousing to everyone,\nwith continual gibes and jeers, the better by those means to conceal his\ndivine knowledge.  Now, opening this box you would have found within it a\nheavenly and inestimable drug, a more than human understanding, an admirable\nvirtue, matchless learning, invincible courage, unimitable sobriety, certain\ncontentment of mind, perfect assurance, and an incredible misregard of all\nthat for which men commonly do so much watch, run, sail, fight, travel, toil\nand turmoil themselves.\n\nWhereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flourish of a preamble tend?\nFor so much as you, my good disciples, and some other jolly fools of ease\nand leisure, reading the pleasant titles of some books of our invention, as\nGargantua, Pantagruel, Whippot (Fessepinte.), the Dignity of Codpieces, of\nPease and Bacon with a Commentary, &c., are too ready to judge that there\nis nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious discourse, and\nrecreative lies; because the outside (which is the title) is usually,\nwithout any farther inquiry, entertained with scoffing and derision.  But\ntruly it is very unbeseeming to make so slight account of the works of men,\nseeing yourselves avouch that it is not the habit makes the monk, many\nbeing monasterially accoutred, who inwardly are nothing less than monachal,\nand that there are of those that wear Spanish capes, who have but little of\nthe valour of Spaniards in them.  Therefore is it, that you must open the\nbook, and seriously consider of the matter treated in it.  Then shall you\nfind that it containeth things of far higher value than the box did\npromise; that is to say, that the subject thereof is not so foolish as by\nthe title at the first sight it would appear to be.\n\nAnd put the case, that in the literal sense you meet with purposes merry\nand solacious enough, and consequently very correspondent to their\ninscriptions, yet must not you stop there as at the melody of the charming\nsyrens, but endeavour to interpret that in a sublimer sense which possibly\nyou intended to have spoken in the jollity of your heart.  Did you ever\npick the lock of a cupboard to steal a bottle of wine out of it?  Tell me\ntruly, and, if you did, call to mind the countenance which then you had.\nOr, did you ever see a dog with a marrowbone in his mouth,--the beast of\nall other, says Plato, lib. 2, de Republica, the most philosophical?  If\nyou have seen him, you might have remarked with what devotion and\ncircumspectness he wards and watcheth it:  with what care he keeps it:  how\nfervently he holds it:  how prudently he gobbets it:  with what affection\nhe breaks it:  and with what diligence he sucks it.  To what end all this?\nWhat moveth him to take all these pains?  What are the hopes of his labour?\nWhat doth he expect to reap thereby?  Nothing but a little marrow.  True it\nis, that this little is more savoury and delicious than the great\nquantities of other sorts of meat, because the marrow (as Galen testifieth,\n5. facult. nat. & 11. de usu partium) is a nourishment most perfectly\nelaboured by nature.\n\nIn imitation of this dog, it becomes you to be wise, to smell, feel and\nhave in estimation these fair goodly books, stuffed with high conceptions,\nwhich, though seemingly easy in the pursuit, are in the cope and encounter\nsomewhat difficult.  And then, like him, you must, by a sedulous lecture,\nand frequent meditation, break the bone, and suck out the marrow,--that is,\nmy allegorical sense, or the things I to myself propose to be signified by\nthese Pythagorical symbols, with assured hope, that in so doing you will at\nlast attain to be both well-advised and valiant by the reading of them:\nfor in the perusal of this treatise you shall find another kind of taste,\nand a doctrine of a more profound and abstruse consideration, which will\ndisclose unto you the most glorious sacraments and dreadful mysteries, as\nwell in what concerneth your religion, as matters of the public state, and\nlife economical.\n\nDo you believe, upon your conscience, that Homer, whilst he was a-couching\nhis Iliads and Odysses, had any thought upon those allegories, which\nPlutarch, Heraclides Ponticus, Eustathius, Cornutus squeezed out of him,\nand which Politian filched again from them?  If you trust it, with neither\nhand nor foot do you come near to my opinion, which judgeth them to have\nbeen as little dreamed of by Homer, as the Gospel sacraments were by Ovid\nin his Metamorphoses, though a certain gulligut friar (Frere Lubin\ncroquelardon.) and true bacon-picker would have undertaken to prove it, if\nperhaps he had met with as very fools as himself, (and as the proverb says)\na lid worthy of such a kettle.\n\nIf you give no credit thereto, why do not you the same in these jovial new\nchronicles of mine?  Albeit when I did dictate them, I thought upon no more\nthan you, who possibly were drinking the whilst as I was.  For in the\ncomposing of this lordly book, I never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any\nother time than what was appointed to serve me for taking of my bodily\nrefection, that is, whilst I was eating and drinking.  And indeed that is\nthe fittest and most proper hour wherein to write these high matters and\ndeep sciences:  as Homer knew very well, the paragon of all philologues,\nand Ennius, the father of the Latin poets, as Horace calls him, although a\ncertain sneaking jobernol alleged that his verses smelled more of the wine\nthan oil.\n\nSo saith a turlupin or a new start-up grub of my books, but a turd for him.\nThe fragrant odour of the wine, O how much more dainty, pleasant, laughing\n(Riant, priant, friant.), celestial and delicious it is, than that smell of\noil!  And I will glory as much when it is said of me, that I have spent\nmore on wine than oil, as did Demosthenes, when it was told him, that his\nexpense on oil was greater than on wine.  I truly hold it for an honour and\npraise to be called and reputed a Frolic Gualter and a Robin Goodfellow;\nfor under this name am I welcome in all choice companies of Pantagruelists.\nIt was upbraided to Demosthenes by an envious surly knave, that his\nOrations did smell like the sarpler or wrapper of a foul and filthy\noil-vessel.  For this cause interpret you all my deeds and sayings in the\nperfectest sense; reverence the cheese-like brain that feeds you with these\nfair billevezees and trifling jollities, and do what lies in you to keep me\nalways merry.  Be frolic now, my lads, cheer up your hearts, and joyfully\nread the rest, with all the ease of your body and profit of your reins.\nBut hearken, joltheads, you viedazes, or dickens take ye, remember to drink\na health to me for the like favour again, and I will pledge you instantly,\nTout ares-metys.\n\n\n\nRabelais to the Reader.\n\nGood friends, my Readers, who peruse this Book,\nBe not offended, whilst on it you look:\nDenude yourselves of all depraved affection,\nFor it contains no badness, nor infection:\n'Tis true that it brings forth to you no birth\nOf any value, but in point of mirth;\nThinking therefore how sorrow might your mind\nConsume, I could no apter subject find;\nOne inch of joy surmounts of grief a span;\nBecause to laugh is proper to the man.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.I.\n\nOf the Genealogy and Antiquity of Gargantua.\n\nI must refer you to the great chronicle of Pantagruel for the knowledge of\nthat genealogy and antiquity of race by which Gargantua is come unto us.\nIn it you may understand more at large how the giants were born in this\nworld, and how from them by a direct line issued Gargantua, the father of\nPantagruel:  and do not take it ill, if for this time I pass by it,\nalthough the subject be such, that the oftener it were remembered, the more\nit would please your worshipful Seniorias; according to which you have the\nauthority of Plato in Philebo and Gorgias; and of Flaccus, who says that\nthere are some kinds of purposes (such as these are without doubt), which,\nthe frequentlier they be repeated, still prove the more delectable.\n\nWould to God everyone had as certain knowledge of his genealogy since the\ntime of the ark of Noah until this age.  I think many are at this day\nemperors, kings, dukes, princes, and popes on the earth, whose extraction\nis from some porters and pardon-pedlars; as, on the contrary, many are now\npoor wandering beggars, wretched and miserable, who are descended of the\nblood and lineage of great kings and emperors, occasioned, as I conceive\nit, by the transport and revolution of kingdoms and empires, from the\nAssyrians to the Medes, from the Medes to the Persians, from the Persians\nto the Macedonians, from the Macedonians to the Romans, from the Romans to\nthe Greeks, from the Greeks to the French.\n\nAnd to give you some hint concerning myself, who speaks unto you, I cannot\nthink but I am come of the race of some rich king or prince in former\ntimes; for never yet saw you any man that had a greater desire to be a\nking, and to be rich, than I have, and that only that I may make good\ncheer, do nothing, nor care for anything, and plentifully enrich my\nfriends, and all honest and learned men.  But herein do I comfort myself,\nthat in the other world I shall be so, yea and greater too than at this\npresent I dare wish.  As for you, with the same or a better conceit\nconsolate yourselves in your distresses, and drink fresh if you can come by\nit.\n\nTo return to our wethers, I say that by the sovereign gift of heaven, the\nantiquity and genealogy of Gargantua hath been reserved for our use more\nfull and perfect than any other except that of the Messias, whereof I mean\nnot to speak; for it belongs not unto my purpose, and the devils, that is\nto say, the false accusers and dissembled gospellers, will therein oppose\nme.  This genealogy was found by John Andrew in a meadow, which he had near\nthe pole-arch, under the olive-tree, as you go to Narsay:  where, as he was\nmaking cast up some ditches, the diggers with their mattocks struck against\na great brazen tomb, and unmeasurably long, for they could never find the\nend thereof, by reason that it entered too far within the sluices of\nVienne.  Opening this tomb in a certain place thereof, sealed on the top\nwith the mark of a goblet, about which was written in Etrurian letters Hic\nBibitur, they found nine flagons set in such order as they use to rank\ntheir kyles in Gascony, of which that which was placed in the middle had\nunder it a big, fat, great, grey, pretty, small, mouldy, little pamphlet,\nsmelling stronger, but no better than roses.  In that book the said\ngenealogy was found written all at length, in a chancery hand, not in\npaper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in the bark of an elm-tree, yet so\nworn with the long tract of time, that hardly could three letters together\nbe there perfectly discerned.\n\nI (though unworthy) was sent for thither, and with much help of those\nspectacles, whereby the art of reading dim writings, and letters that do\nnot clearly appear to the sight, is practised, as Aristotle teacheth it,\ndid translate the book as you may see in your Pantagruelizing, that is to\nsay, in drinking stiffly to your own heart's desire, and reading the\ndreadful and horrific acts of Pantagruel.  At the end of the book there was\na little treatise entitled the Antidoted Fanfreluches, or a Galimatia of\nextravagant conceits.  The rats and moths, or (that I may not lie) other\nwicked beasts, had nibbled off the beginning:  the rest I have hereto\nsubjoined, for the reverence I bear to antiquity.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.II.\n\nThe Antidoted Fanfreluches:  or, a Galimatia of extravagant Conceits found\nin an ancient Monument.\n\nNo sooner did the Cymbrians' overcomer\nPass through the air to shun the dew of summer,\nBut at his coming straight great tubs were fill'd,\nWith pure fresh butter down in showers distill'd:\nWherewith when water'd was his grandam, Hey,\nAloud he cried, Fish it, sir, I pray y';\nBecause his beard is almost all beray'd;\nOr, that he would hold to 'm a scale, he pray'd.\n\nTo lick his slipper, some told was much better,\nThan to gain pardons, and the merit greater.\nIn th' interim a crafty chuff approaches,\nFrom the depth issued, where they fish for roaches;\nWho said, Good sirs, some of them let us save,\nThe eel is here, and in this hollow cave\nYou'll find, if that our looks on it demur,\nA great waste in the bottom of his fur.\n\nTo read this chapter when he did begin,\nNothing but a calf's horns were found therein;\nI feel, quoth he, the mitre which doth hold\nMy head so chill, it makes my brains take cold.\nBeing with the perfume of a turnip warm'd,\nTo stay by chimney hearths himself he arm'd,\nProvided that a new thill-horse they made\nOf every person of a hair-brain'd head.\n\nThey talked of the bunghole of Saint Knowles,\nOf Gilbathar and thousand other holes,\nIf they might be reduced t' a scarry stuff,\nSuch as might not be subject to the cough:\nSince ev'ry man unseemly did it find,\nTo see them gaping thus at ev'ry wind:\nFor, if perhaps they handsomely were closed,\nFor pledges they to men might be exposed.\n\nIn this arrest by Hercules the raven\nWas flayed at her (his) return from Lybia haven.\nWhy am not I, said Minos, there invited?\nUnless it be myself, not one's omitted:\nAnd then it is their mind, I do no more\nOf frogs and oysters send them any store:\nIn case they spare my life and prove but civil,\nI give their sale of distaffs to the devil.\n\nTo quell him comes Q.B., who limping frets\nAt the safe pass of tricksy crackarets:\nThe boulter, the grand Cyclops' cousin, those\nDid massacre, whilst each one wiped his nose:\nFew ingles in this fallow ground are bred,\nBut on a tanner's mill are winnowed.\nRun thither all of you, th' alarms sound clear,\nYou shall have more than you had the last year.\n\nShort while thereafter was the bird of Jove\nResolved to speak, though dismal it should prove;\nYet was afraid, when he saw them in ire,\nThey should o'erthrow quite flat down dead th' empire.\nHe rather choosed the fire from heaven to steal,\nTo boats where were red herrings put to sale;\nThan to be calm 'gainst those, who strive to brave us,\nAnd to the Massorets' fond words enslave us.\n\nAll this at last concluded gallantly,\nIn spite of Ate and her hern-like thigh,\nWho, sitting, saw Penthesilea ta'en,\nIn her old age, for a cress-selling quean.\nEach one cried out, Thou filthy collier toad,\nDoth it become thee to be found abroad?\nThou hast the Roman standard filch'd away,\nWhich they in rags of parchment did display.\n\nJuno was born, who, under the rainbow,\nWas a-bird-catching with her duck below:\nWhen her with such a grievous trick they plied\nThat she had almost been bethwacked by it.\nThe bargain was, that, of that throatful, she\nShould of Proserpina have two eggs free;\nAnd if that she thereafter should be found,\nShe to a hawthorn hill should be fast bound.\n\nSeven months thereafter, lacking twenty-two,\nHe, that of old did Carthage town undo,\nDid bravely midst them all himself advance,\nRequiring of them his inheritance;\nAlthough they justly made up the division,\nAccording to the shoe-welt-law's decision,\nBy distributing store of brews and beef\nTo these poor fellows that did pen the brief.\n\nBut th' year will come, sign of a Turkish bow,\nFive spindles yarn'd, and three pot-bottoms too,\nWherein of a discourteous king the dock\nShall pepper'd be under an hermit's frock.\nAh! that for one she hypocrite you must\nPermit so many acres to be lost!\nCease, cease, this vizard may become another,\nWithdraw yourselves unto the serpent's brother.\n\n'Tis in times past, that he who is shall reign\nWith his good friends in peace now and again.\nNo rash nor heady prince shall then rule crave,\nEach good will its arbitrement shall have;\nAnd the joy, promised of old as doom\nTo the heaven's guests, shall in its beacon come.\nThen shall the breeding mares, that benumb'd were,\nLike royal palfreys ride triumphant there.\n\nAnd this continue shall from time to time,\nTill Mars be fetter'd for an unknown crime;\nThen shall one come, who others will surpass,\nDelightful, pleasing, matchless, full of grace.\nCheer up your hearts, approach to this repast,\nAll trusty friends of mine; for he's deceased,\nWho would not for a world return again,\nSo highly shall time past be cried up then.\n\nHe who was made of wax shall lodge each member\nClose by the hinges of a block of timber.\nWe then no more shall Master, master, whoot,\nThe swagger, who th' alarum bell holds out;\nCould one seize on the dagger which he bears,\nHeads would be free from tingling in the ears,\nTo baffle the whole storehouse of abuses.\nThe thus farewell Apollo and the Muses.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.III.\n\nHow Gargantua was carried eleven months in his mother's belly.\n\nGrangousier was a good fellow in his time, and notable jester; he loved to\ndrink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would\nwillingly eat salt meat.  To this intent he was ordinarily well furnished\nwith gammons of bacon, both of Westphalia, Mayence and Bayonne, with store\nof dried neat's tongues, plenty of links, chitterlings and puddings in\ntheir season; together with salt beef and mustard, a good deal of hard roes\nof powdered mullet called botargos, great provision of sausages, not of\nBolonia (for he feared the Lombard Boccone), but of Bigorre, Longaulnay,\nBrene, and Rouargue.  In the vigour of his age he married Gargamelle,\ndaughter to the King of the Parpaillons, a jolly pug, and well-mouthed\nwench.  These two did oftentimes do the two-backed beast together, joyfully\nrubbing and frotting their bacon 'gainst one another, in so far, that at\nlast she became great with child of a fair son, and went with him unto the\neleventh month; for so long, yea longer, may a woman carry her great belly,\nespecially when it is some masterpiece of nature, and a person\npredestinated to the performance, in his due time, of great exploits.  As\nHomer says, that the child, which Neptune begot upon the nymph, was born a\nwhole year after the conception, that is, in the twelfth month.  For, as\nAulus Gellius saith, lib. 3, this long time was suitable to the majesty of\nNeptune, that in it the child might receive his perfect form.  For the like\nreason Jupiter made the night, wherein he lay with Alcmena, last\nforty-eight hours, a shorter time not being sufficient for the forging of\nHercules, who cleansed the world of the monsters and tyrants wherewith it\nwas suppressed.  My masters, the ancient Pantagruelists, have confirmed\nthat which I say, and withal declared it to be not only possible, but also\nmaintained the lawful birth and legitimation of the infant born of a woman\nin the eleventh month after the decease of her husband.  Hypocrates, lib.\nde alimento.  Plinius, lib. 7, cap. 5.  Plautus, in his Cistelleria.\nMarcus Varro, in his satire inscribed The Testament, alleging to this\npurpose the authority of Aristotle.  Censorinus, lib. de die natali.\nArist. lib. 7, cap. 3 & 4, de natura animalium.  Gellius, lib. 3, cap. 16.\nServius, in his exposition upon this verse of Virgil's eclogues, Matri\nlonga decem, &c., and a thousand other fools, whose number hath been\nincreased by the lawyers ff. de suis, et legit l. intestato. paragrapho.\nfin. and in Auth. de restitut. et ea quae parit in xi mense.  Moreover upon\nthese grounds they have foisted in their Robidilardic, or Lapiturolive law.\nGallus ff. de lib. et posth. l. sept. ff. de stat. hom., and some other\nlaws, which at this time I dare not name.  By means whereof the honest\nwidows may without danger play at the close buttock game with might and\nmain, and as hard as they can, for the space of the first two months after\nthe decease of their husbands.  I pray you, my good lusty springal lads, if\nyou find any of these females, that are worth the pains of untying the\ncodpiece-point, get up, ride upon them, and bring them to me; for, if they\nhappen within the third month to conceive, the child should be heir to the\ndeceased, if, before he died, he had no other children, and the mother\nshall pass for an honest woman.\n\nWhen she is known to have conceived, thrust forward boldly, spare her not,\nwhatever betide you, seeing the paunch is full.  As Julia, the daughter of\nthe Emperor Octavian, never prostituted herself to her belly-bumpers, but\nwhen she found herself with child, after the manner of ships, that receive\nnot their steersman till they have their ballast and lading.  And if any\nblame them for this their rataconniculation, and reiterated lechery upon\ntheir pregnancy and big-belliedness, seeing beasts, in the like exigent of\ntheir fulness, will never suffer the male-masculant to encroach them, their\nanswer will be, that those are beasts, but they are women, very well\nskilled in the pretty vales and small fees of the pleasant trade and\nmysteries of superfetation:  as Populia heretofore answered, according to\nthe relation of Macrobius, lib. 2. Saturnal.  If the devil will not have\nthem to bag, he must wring hard the spigot, and stop the bung-hole.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.IV.\n\nHow Gargamelle, being great with Gargantua, did eat a huge deal of tripes.\n\nThe occasion and manner how Gargamelle was brought to bed, and delivered of\nher child, was thus:  and, if you do not believe it, I wish your bum-gut\nfall out and make an escapade.  Her bum-gut, indeed, or fundament escaped\nher in an afternoon, on the third day of February, with having eaten at\ndinner too many godebillios.  Godebillios are the fat tripes of coiros.\nCoiros are beeves fattened at the cratch in ox-stalls, or in the fresh\nguimo meadows.  Guimo meadows are those that for their fruitfulness may be\nmowed twice a year.  Of those fat beeves they had killed three hundred\nsixty-seven thousand and fourteen, to be salted at Shrovetide, that in the\nentering of the spring they might have plenty of powdered beef, wherewith\nto season their mouths at the beginning of their meals, and to taste their\nwine the better.\n\nThey had abundance of tripes, as you have heard, and they were so\ndelicious, that everyone licked his fingers.  But the mischief was this,\nthat, for all men could do, there was no possibility to keep them long in\nthat relish; for in a very short while they would have stunk, which had\nbeen an undecent thing.  It was therefore concluded, that they should be\nall of them gulched up, without losing anything.  To this effect they\ninvited all the burghers of Sainais, of Suille, of the Roche-Clermaud, of\nVaugaudry, without omitting the Coudray, Monpensier, the Gue de Vede, and\nother their neighbours, all stiff drinkers, brave fellows, and good players\nat the kyles.  The good man Grangousier took great pleasure in their\ncompany, and commanded there should be no want nor pinching for anything.\nNevertheless he bade his wife eat sparingly, because she was near her time,\nand that these tripes were no very commendable meat.  They would fain, said\nhe, be at the chewing of ordure, that would eat the case wherein it was.\nNotwithstanding these admonitions, she did eat sixteen quarters, two\nbushels, three pecks and a pipkin full.  O the fair fecality wherewith she\nswelled, by the ingrediency of such shitten stuff!\n\nAfter dinner they all went out in a hurl to the grove of the willows,\nwhere, on the green grass, to the sound of the merry flutes and pleasant\nbagpipes, they danced so gallantly, that it was a sweet and heavenly sport\nto see them so frolic.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.V.\n\nThe Discourse of the Drinkers.\n\nThen did they fall upon the chat of victuals and some belly furniture to be\nsnatched at in the very same place.  Which purpose was no sooner mentioned,\nbut forthwith began flagons to go, gammons to trot, goblets to fly, great\nbowls to ting, glasses to ring.  Draw, reach, fill, mix, give it me without\nwater.  So, my friend, so, whip me off this glass neatly, bring me hither\nsome claret, a full weeping glass till it run over.  A cessation and truce\nwith thirst.  Ha, thou false fever, wilt thou not be gone?  By my figgins,\ngodmother, I cannot as yet enter in the humour of being merry, nor drink so\ncurrently as I would.  You have catched a cold, gammer?  Yea, forsooth,\nsir.  By the belly of Sanct Buff, let us talk of our drink:  I never drink\nbut at my hours, like the Pope's mule.  And I never drink but in my\nbreviary, like a fair father guardian.  Which was first, thirst or\ndrinking?  Thirst, for who in the time of innocence would have drunk\nwithout being athirst?  Nay, sir, it was drinking; for privatio\npraesupponit habitum.  I am learned, you see:  Foecundi calices quem non\nfecere disertum?  We poor innocents drink but too much without thirst.  Not\nI truly, who am a sinner, for I never drink without thirst, either present\nor future.  To prevent it, as you know, I drink for the thirst to come.  I\ndrink eternally.  This is to me an eternity of drinking, and drinking of\neternity.  Let us sing, let us drink, and tune up our roundelays.  Where is\nmy funnel?  What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?  Do you wet\nyourselves to dry, or do you dry to wet you?  Pish, I understand not the\nrhetoric (theoric, I should say), but I help myself somewhat by the\npractice.  Baste! enough!  I sup, I wet, I humect, I moisten my gullet, I\ndrink, and all for fear of dying.  Drink always and you shall never die.\nIf I drink not, I am a-ground, dry, gravelled and spent.  I am stark dead\nwithout drink, and my soul ready to fly into some marsh amongst frogs; the\nsoul never dwells in a dry place, drouth kills it.  O you butlers, creators\nof new forms, make me of no drinker a drinker, a perennity and\neverlastingness of sprinkling and bedewing me through these my parched and\nsinewy bowels.  He drinks in vain that feels not the pleasure of it.  This\nentereth into my veins,--the pissing tools and urinal vessels shall have\nnothing of it.  I would willingly wash the tripes of the calf which I\napparelled this morning.  I have pretty well now ballasted my stomach and\nstuffed my paunch.  If the papers of my bonds and bills could drink as well\nas I do, my creditors would not want for wine when they come to see me, or\nwhen they are to make any formal exhibition of their rights to what of me\nthey can demand.  This hand of yours spoils your nose.  O how many other\nsuch will enter here before this go out!  What, drink so shallow?  It is\nenough to break both girds and petrel.  This is called a cup of\ndissimulation, or flagonal hypocrisy.\n\nWhat difference is there between a bottle and a flagon.  Great difference;\nfor the bottle is stopped and shut up with a stopple, but the flagon with a\nvice (La bouteille est fermee a bouchon, et le flaccon a vis.).  Bravely\nand well played upon the words!  Our fathers drank lustily, and emptied\ntheir cans.  Well cacked, well sung!  Come, let us drink:  will you send\nnothing to the river?  Here is one going to wash the tripes.  I drink no\nmore than a sponge.  I drink like a Templar knight.  And I, tanquam\nsponsus.  And I, sicut terra sine aqua.  Give me a synonymon for a gammon\nof bacon.  It is the compulsory of drinkers:  it is a pulley.  By a\npulley-rope wine is let down into a cellar, and by a gammon into the\nstomach. Hey! now, boys, hither, some drink, some drink.  There is no\ntrouble in it. Respice personam, pone pro duos, bus non est in usu.  If I\ncould get up as well as I can swallow down, I had been long ere now very\nhigh in the air.\n\nThus became Tom Tosspot rich,--thus went in the tailor's stitch.  Thus did\nBacchus conquer th' Inde--thus Philosophy, Melinde.  A little rain allays a\ngreat deal of wind:  long tippling breaks the thunder.  But if there came\nsuch liquor from my ballock, would you not willingly thereafter suck the\nudder whence it issued?  Here, page, fill!  I prithee, forget me not when\nit comes to my turn, and I will enter the election I have made of thee into\nthe very register of my heart.  Sup, Guillot, and spare not, there is\nsomewhat in the pot.  I appeal from thirst, and disclaim its jurisdiction.\nPage, sue out my appeal in form.  This remnant in the bottom of the glass\nmust follow its leader.  I was wont heretofore to drink out all, but now I\nleave nothing.  Let us not make too much haste; it is requisite we carry\nall along with us.  Heyday, here are tripes fit for our sport, and, in\nearnest, excellent godebillios of the dun ox (you know) with the black\nstreak.  O, for God's sake, let us lash them soundly, yet thriftily.\nDrink, or I will,--No, no, drink, I beseech you (Ou je vous, je vous\nprie.).  Sparrows will not eat unless you bob them on the tail, nor can I\ndrink if I be not fairly spoke to.  The concavities of my body are like\nanother Hell for their capacity.  Lagonaedatera (lagon lateris cavitas:\naides orcus: and eteros alter.).  There is not a corner, nor coney-burrow in\nall my body, where this wine doth not ferret out my thirst.  Ho, this will\nbang it soundly.  But this shall banish it utterly.  Let us wind our horns\nby the sound of flagons and bottles, and cry aloud, that whoever hath lost\nhis thirst come not hither to seek it.  Long clysters of drinking are to be\nvoided without doors.  The great God made the planets, and we make the\nplatters neat.  I have the word of the gospel in my mouth, Sitio.  The\nstone called asbestos is not more unquenchable than the thirst of my\npaternity.  Appetite comes with eating, says Angeston, but the thirst goes\naway with drinking.  I have a remedy against thirst, quite contrary to that\nwhich is good against the biting of a mad dog.  Keep running after a dog,\nand he will never bite you; drink always before the thirst, and it will\nnever come upon you.  There I catch you, I awake you.  Argus had a hundred\neyes for his sight, a butler should have (like Briareus) a hundred hands\nwherewith to fill us wine indefatigably.  Hey now, lads, let us moisten\nourselves, it will be time to dry hereafter.  White wine here, wine, boys!\nPour out all in the name of Lucifer, fill here, you, fill and fill\n(peascods on you) till it be full.  My tongue peels.  Lans trinque; to\nthee, countryman, I drink to thee, good fellow, comrade to thee, lusty,\nlively!  Ha, la, la, that was drunk to some purpose, and bravely gulped\nover.  O lachryma Christi, it is of the best grape!  I'faith, pure Greek,\nGreek!  O the fine white wine! upon my conscience, it is a kind of taffetas\nwine,--hin, hin, it is of one ear, well wrought, and of good wool.\nCourage, comrade, up thy heart, billy!  We will not be beasted at this\nbout, for I have got one trick.  Ex hoc in hoc.  There is no enchantment\nnor charm there, every one of you hath seen it.  My 'prenticeship is out, I\nam a free man at this trade.  I am prester mast (Prestre mace, maistre\npasse.), Prish, Brum!  I should say, master past.  O the drinkers, those\nthat are a-dry, O poor thirsty souls!  Good page, my friend, fill me here\nsome, and crown the wine, I pray thee.  Like a cardinal!  Natura abhorret\nvacuum.  Would you say that a fly could drink in this?  This is after the\nfashion of Switzerland.  Clear off, neat, supernaculum!  Come, therefore,\nblades, to this divine liquor and celestial juice, swill it over heartily,\nand spare not!  It is a decoction of nectar and ambrosia.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.VI.\n\nHow Gargantua was born in a strange manner.\n\nWhilst they were on this discourse and pleasant tattle of drinking,\nGargamelle began to be a little unwell in her lower parts; whereupon\nGrangousier arose from off the grass, and fell to comfort her very honestly\nand kindly, suspecting that she was in travail, and told her that it was\nbest for her to sit down upon the grass under the willows, because she was\nlike very shortly to see young feet, and that therefore it was convenient\nshe should pluck up her spirits, and take a good heart of new at the fresh\narrival of her baby; saying to her withal, that although the pain was\nsomewhat grievous to her, it would be but of short continuance, and that\nthe succeeding joy would quickly remove that sorrow, in such sort that she\nshould not so much as remember it.  On, with a sheep's courage! quoth he.\nDespatch this boy, and we will speedily fall to work for the making of\nanother.  Ha! said she, so well as you speak at your own ease, you that are\nmen!  Well, then, in the name of God, I'll do my best, seeing that you will\nhave it so, but would to God that it were cut off from you!  What? said\nGrangousier.  Ha, said she, you are a good man indeed, you understand it\nwell enough.  What, my member? said he.  By the goat's blood, if it please\nyou, that shall be done instantly; cause bring hither a knife.  Alas, said\nshe, the Lord forbid, and pray Jesus to forgive me!  I did not say it from\nmy heart, therefore let it alone, and do not do it neither more nor less\nany kind of harm for my speaking so to you.  But I am like to have work\nenough to do to-day and all for your member, yet God bless you and it.\n\nCourage, courage, said he, take you no care of the matter, let the four\nforemost oxen do the work.  I will yet go drink one whiff more, and if in\nthe mean time anything befall you that may require my presence, I will be\nso near to you, that, at the first whistling in your fist, I shall be with\nyou forthwith.  A little while after she began to groan, lament and cry.\nThen suddenly came the midwives from all quarters, who groping her below,\nfound some peloderies, which was a certain filthy stuff, and of a taste\ntruly bad enough.  This they thought had been the child, but it was her\nfundament, that was slipped out with the mollification of her straight\nentrail, which you call the bum-gut, and that merely by eating of too many\ntripes, as we have showed you before.  Whereupon an old ugly trot in the\ncompany, who had the repute of an expert she-physician, and was come from\nBrisepaille, near to Saint Genou, three score years before, made her so\nhorrible a restrictive and binding medicine, and whereby all her larris,\narse-pipes, and conduits were so oppilated, stopped, obstructed, and\ncontracted, that you could hardly have opened and enlarged them with your\nteeth, which is a terrible thing to think upon; seeing the Devil at the\nmass at Saint Martin's was puzzled with the like task, when with his teeth\nhe had lengthened out the parchment whereon he wrote the tittle-tattle of\ntwo young mangy whores.  By this inconvenient the cotyledons of her matrix\nwere presently loosed, through which the child sprang up and leaped, and\nso, entering into the hollow vein, did climb by the diaphragm even above\nher shoulders, where the vein divides itself into two, and from thence\ntaking his way towards the left side, issued forth at her left ear.  As\nsoon as he was born, he cried not as other babes use to do, Miez, miez,\nmiez, miez, but with a high, sturdy, and big voice shouted about, Some\ndrink, some drink, some drink, as inviting all the world to drink with him.\nThe noise hereof was so extremely great, that it was heard in both the\ncountries at once of Beauce and Bibarois.  I doubt me, that you do not\nthoroughly believe the truth of this strange nativity.  Though you believe\nit not, I care not much:  but an honest man, and of good judgment,\nbelieveth still what is told him, and that which he finds written.\n\nIs this beyond our law or our faith--against reason or the holy Scripture?\nFor my part, I find nothing in the sacred Bible that is against it.  But\ntell me, if it had been the will of God, would you say that he could not do\nit?  Ha, for favour sake, I beseech you, never emberlucock or inpulregafize\nyour spirits with these vain thoughts and idle conceits; for I tell you, it\nis not impossible with God, and, if he pleased, all women henceforth should\nbring forth their children at the ear.  Was not Bacchus engendered out of\nthe very thigh of Jupiter?  Did not Roquetaillade come out at his mother's\nheel, and Crocmoush from the slipper of his nurse?  Was not Minerva born of\nthe brain, even through the ear of Jove?  Adonis, of the bark of a myrrh\ntree; and Castor and Pollux of the doupe of that egg which was laid and\nhatched by Leda?  But you would wonder more, and with far greater\namazement, if I should now present you with that chapter of Plinius,\nwherein he treateth of strange births, and contrary to nature, and yet am\nnot I so impudent a liar as he was.  Read the seventh book of his Natural\nHistory, chap.3, and trouble not my head any more about this.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.VII.\n\nAfter what manner Gargantua had his name given him, and how he tippled,\nbibbed, and curried the can.\n\nThe good man Grangousier, drinking and making merry with the rest, heard\nthe horrible noise which his son had made as he entered into the light of\nthis world, when he cried out, Some drink, some drink, some drink;\nwhereupon he said in French, Que grand tu as et souple le gousier! that is\nto say, How great and nimble a throat thou hast.  Which the company\nhearing, said that verily the child ought to be called Gargantua; because\nit was the first word that after his birth his father had spoke, in\nimitation, and at the example of the ancient Hebrews; whereunto he\ncondescended, and his mother was very well pleased therewith.  In the\nmeanwhile, to quiet the child, they gave him to drink a tirelaregot, that\nis, till his throat was like to crack with it; then was he carried to the\nfont, and there baptized, according to the manner of good Christians.\n\nImmediately thereafter were appointed for him seventeen thousand, nine\nhundred, and thirteen cows of the towns of Pautille and Brehemond, to\nfurnish him with milk in ordinary, for it was impossible to find a nurse\nsufficient for him in all the country, considering the great quantity of\nmilk that was requisite for his nourishment; although there were not\nwanting some doctors of the opinion of Scotus, who affirmed that his own\nmother gave him suck, and that she could draw out of her breasts one\nthousand, four hundred, two pipes, and nine pails of milk at every time.\n\nWhich indeed is not probable, and this point hath been found duggishly\nscandalous and offensive to tender ears, for that it savoured a little of\nheresy.  Thus was he handled for one year and ten months; after which time,\nby the advice of physicians, they began to carry him, and then was made for\nhim a fine little cart drawn with oxen, of the invention of Jan Denio,\nwherein they led him hither and thither with great joy; and he was worth\nthe seeing, for he was a fine boy, had a burly physiognomy, and almost ten\nchins.  He cried very little, but beshit himself every hour:  for, to speak\ntruly of him, he was wonderfully phlegmatic in his posteriors, both by\nreason of his natural complexion and the accidental disposition which had\nbefallen him by his too much quaffing of the Septembral juice.  Yet without\na cause did not he sup one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry,\ndispleased, or sorry, if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and\nwhat grievous quarter soever he kept, in bringing him some drink, he would\nbe instantly pacified, reseated in his own temper, in a good humour again,\nand as still and quiet as ever.  One of his governesses told me (swearing\nby her fig), how he was so accustomed to this kind of way, that, at the\nsound of pints and flagons, he would on a sudden fall into an ecstasy, as\nif he had then tasted of the joys of paradise; so that they, upon\nconsideration of this, his divine complexion, would every morning, to cheer\nhim up, play with a knife upon the glasses, on the bottles with their\nstopples, and on the pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the sound\nwhereof he became gay, did leap for joy, would loll and rock himself in the\ncradle, then nod with his head, monochordizing with his fingers, and\nbarytonizing with his tail.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.VIII.\n\nHow they apparelled Gargantua.\n\nBeing of this age, his father ordained to have clothes made to him in his\nown livery, which was white and blue.  To work then went the tailors, and\nwith great expedition were those clothes made, cut, and sewed, according to\nthe fashion that was then in request.  I find by the ancient records or\npancarts, to be seen in the chamber of accounts, or court of the exchequer\nat Montsoreau, that he was accoutred in manner as followeth.  To make him\nevery shirt of his were taken up nine hundred ells of Chasteleraud linen,\nand two hundred for the gussets, in manner of cushions, which they put\nunder his armpits.  His shirt was not gathered nor plaited, for the\nplaiting of shirts was not found out till the seamstresses (when the point\nof their needle (Besongner du cul, Englished The eye of the needle.) was\nbroken) began to work and occupy with the tail.  There were taken up for\nhis doublet, eight hundred and thirteen ells of white satin, and for his\npoints fifteen hundred and nine dogs' skins and a half.  Then was it that\nmen began to tie their breeches to their doublets, and not their doublets\nto their breeches:  for it is against nature, as hath most amply been\nshowed by Ockham upon the exponibles of Master Haultechaussade.\n\nFor his breeches were taken up eleven hundred and five ells and a third of\nwhite broadcloth.  They were cut in the form of pillars, chamfered,\nchannelled and pinked behind that they might not over-heat his reins:  and\nwere, within the panes, puffed out with the lining of as much blue damask\nas was needful:  and remark, that he had very good leg-harness,\nproportionable to the rest of his stature.\n\nFor his codpiece were used sixteen ells and a quarter of the same cloth,\nand it was fashioned on the top like unto a triumphant arch, most gallantly\nfastened with two enamelled clasps, in each of which was set a great\nemerald, as big as an orange; for, as says Orpheus, lib. de lapidibus, and\nPlinius, libro ultimo, it hath an erective virtue and comfortative of the\nnatural member.  The exiture, outjecting or outstanding, of his codpiece\nwas of the length of a yard, jagged and pinked, and withal bagging, and\nstrutting out with the blue damask lining, after the manner of his\nbreeches.  But had you seen the fair embroidery of the small needlework\npurl, and the curiously interlaced knots, by the goldsmith's art set out\nand trimmed with rich diamonds, precious rubies, fine turquoises, costly\nemeralds, and Persian pearls, you would have compared it to a fair\ncornucopia, or horn of abundance, such as you see in antiques, or as Rhea\ngave to the two nymphs, Amalthea and Ida, the nurses of Jupiter.\n\nAnd, like to that horn of abundance, it was still gallant, succulent,\ndroppy, sappy, pithy, lively, always flourishing, always fructifying, full\nof juice, full of flower, full of fruit, and all manner of delight.  I avow\nGod, it would have done one good to have seen him, but I will tell you more\nof him in the book which I have made of the dignity of codpieces.  One\nthing I will tell you, that as it was both long and large, so was it well\nfurnished and victualled within, nothing like unto the hypocritical\ncodpieces of some fond wooers and wench-courtiers, which are stuffed only\nwith wind, to the great prejudice of the female sex.\n\nFor his shoes were taken up four hundred and six ells of blue\ncrimson-velvet, and were very neatly cut by parallel lines, joined in\nuniform cylinders.  For the soling of them were made use of eleven hundred\nhides of brown cows, shapen like the tail of a keeling.\n\nFor his coat were taken up eighteen hundred ells of blue velvet, dyed in\ngrain, embroidered in its borders with fair gilliflowers, in the middle\ndecked with silver purl, intermixed with plates of gold and store of\npearls, hereby showing that in his time he would prove an especial good\nfellow and singular whipcan.\n\nHis girdle was made of three hundred ells and a half of silken serge, half\nwhite and half blue, if I mistake it not.  His sword was not of Valentia,\nnor his dagger of Saragossa, for his father could not endure these hidalgos\nborrachos maranisados como diablos:  but he had a fair sword made of wood,\nand the dagger of boiled leather, as well painted and gilded as any man\ncould wish.\n\nHis purse was made of the cod of an elephant, which was given him by Herr\nPracontal, proconsul of Lybia.\n\nFor his gown were employed nine thousand six hundred ells, wanting\ntwo-thirds, of blue velvet, as before, all so diagonally purled, that by\ntrue perspective issued thence an unnamed colour, like that you see in the\nnecks of turtle-doves or turkey-cocks, which wonderfully rejoiced the eyes\nof the beholders.  For his bonnet or cap were taken up three hundred, two\nells and a quarter of white velvet, and the form thereof was wide and round,\nof the bigness of his head; for his father said that the caps of the\nMarrabaise fashion, made like the cover of a pasty, would one time or other\nbring a mischief on those that wore them.  For his plume, he wore a fair\ngreat blue feather, plucked from an onocrotal of the country of Hircania the\nwild, very prettily hanging down over his right ear.  For the jewel or\nbrooch which in his cap he carried, he had in a cake of gold, weighing three\nscore and eight marks, a fair piece enamelled, wherein was portrayed a man's\nbody with two heads, looking towards one another, four arms, four feet, two\narses, such as Plato, in Symposio, says was the mystical beginning of man's\nnature; and about it was written in Ionic letters, Agame ou zetei ta eautes,\nor rather, Aner kai gune zugada anthrotos idiaitata, that is, Vir et mulier\njunctim propriissime homo.  To wear about his neck, he had a golden chain,\nweighing twenty-five thousand and sixty-three marks of gold, the links\nthereof being made after the manner of great berries, amongst which were set\nin work green jaspers engraven and cut dragon-like, all environed with beams\nand sparks, as king Nicepsos of old was wont to wear them:  and it reached\ndown to the very bust of the rising of his belly, whereby he reaped great\nbenefit all his life long, as the Greek physicians know well enough.  For\nhis gloves were put in work sixteen otters' skins, and three of the\nloupgarous, or men-eating wolves, for the bordering of them:  and of this\nstuff were they made, by the appointment of the Cabalists of Sanlouand.  As\nfor the rings which his father would have him to wear, to renew the ancient\nmark of nobility, he had on the forefinger of his left hand a carbuncle as\nbig as an ostrich's egg, enchased very daintily in gold of the fineness of a\nTurkey seraph.  Upon the middle finger of the same hand he had a ring made\nof four metals together, of the strangest fashion that ever was seen; so\nthat the steel did not crash against the gold, nor the silver crush the\ncopper.  All this was made by Captain Chappuys, and Alcofribas his good\nagent.  On the medical finger of his right hand he had a ring made\nspire-wise, wherein was set a perfect Balas ruby, a pointed diamond, and\na Physon emerald, of an inestimable value.  For Hans Carvel, the king of\nMelinda's jeweller, esteemed them at the rate of threescore nine millions,\neight hundred ninety-four thousand, and eighteen French crowns of Berry, and\nat so much did the Foucres of Augsburg prize them.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.IX.\n\nThe colours and liveries of Gargantua.\n\nGargantua's colours were white and blue, as I have showed you before, by\nwhich his father would give us to understand that his son to him was a\nheavenly joy; for the white did signify gladness, pleasure, delight, and\nrejoicing, and the blue, celestial things.  I know well enough that, in\nreading this, you laugh at the old drinker, and hold this exposition of\ncolours to be very extravagant, and utterly disagreeable to reason, because\nwhite is said to signify faith, and blue constancy.  But without moving,\nvexing, heating, or putting you in a chafe (for the weather is dangerous),\nanswer me, if it please you; for no other compulsory way of arguing will I\nuse towards you, or any else; only now and then I will mention a word or\ntwo of my bottle.  What is it that induceth you, what stirs you up to\nbelieve, or who told you that white signifieth faith, and blue constancy?\nAn old paltry book, say you, sold by the hawking pedlars and balladmongers,\nentitled The Blason of Colours.  Who made it?  Whoever it was, he was wise\nin that he did not set his name to it.  But, besides, I know not what I\nshould rather admire in him, his presumption or his sottishness.  His\npresumption and overweening, for that he should without reason, without\ncause, or without any appearance of truth, have dared to prescribe, by his\nprivate authority, what things should be denotated and signified by the\ncolour:  which is the custom of tyrants, who will have their will to bear\nsway in stead of equity, and not of the wise and learned, who with the\nevidence of reason satisfy their readers.  His sottishness and want of\nspirit, in that he thought that, without any other demonstration or\nsufficient argument, the world would be pleased to make his blockish and\nridiculous impositions the rule of their devices.  In effect, according to\nthe proverb, To a shitten tail fails never ordure, he hath found, it seems,\nsome simple ninny in those rude times of old, when the wearing of high\nround bonnets was in fashion, who gave some trust to his writings,\naccording to which they carved and engraved their apophthegms and mottoes,\ntrapped and caparisoned their mules and sumpter-horses, apparelled their\npages, quartered their breeches, bordered their gloves, fringed the\ncurtains and valances of their beds, painted their ensigns, composed songs,\nand, which is worse, placed many deceitful jugglings and unworthy base\ntricks undiscoveredly amongst the very chastest matrons and most reverend\nsciences.  In the like darkness and mist of ignorance are wrapped up these\nvain-glorious courtiers and name-transposers, who, going about in their\nimpresas to signify esperance (that is, hope), have portrayed a sphere--and\nbirds' pennes for pains--l'ancholie (which is the flower colombine) for\nmelancholy--a waning moon or crescent, to show the increasing or rising of\none's fortune--a bench rotten and broken, to signify bankrupt--non and a\ncorslet for non dur habit (otherwise non durabit, it shall not last), un\nlit sans ciel, that is, a bed without a tester, for un licencie, a\ngraduated person, as bachelor in divinity or utter barrister-at-law; which\nare equivocals so absurd and witless, so barbarous and clownish, that a\nfox's tail should be fastened to the neck-piece of, and a vizard made of a\ncowsherd given to everyone that henceforth should offer, after the\nrestitution of learning, to make use of any such fopperies in France.\n\nBy the same reasons (if reasons I should call them, and not ravings rather,\nand idle triflings about words), might I cause paint a pannier, to signify\nthat I am in pain--a mustard-pot, that my heart tarries much for't--one\npissing upwards for a bishop--the bottom of a pair of breeches for a vessel\nfull of fart-hings--a codpiece for the office of the clerks of the\nsentences, decrees, or judgments, or rather, as the English bears it, for\nthe tail of a codfish--and a dog's turd for the dainty turret wherein lies\nthe love of my sweetheart.  Far otherwise did heretofore the sages of\nEgypt, when they wrote by letters, which they called hieroglyphics, which\nnone understood who were not skilled in the virtue, property, and nature of\nthe things represented by them.  Of which Orus Apollon hath in Greek\ncomposed two books, and Polyphilus, in his Dream of Love, set down more.\nIn France you have a taste of them in the device or impresa of my Lord\nAdmiral, which was carried before that time by Octavian Augustus.  But my\nlittle skiff alongst these unpleasant gulfs and shoals will sail no\nfurther, therefore must I return to the port from whence I came.  Yet do I\nhope one day to write more at large of these things, and to show both by\nphilosophical arguments and authorities, received and approved of by and\nfrom all antiquity, what, and how many colours there are in nature, and\nwhat may be signified by every one of them, if God save the mould of my\ncap, which is my best wine-pot, as my grandam said.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.X.\n\nOf that which is signified by the colours white and blue.\n\nThe white therefore signifieth joy, solace, and gladness, and that not at\nrandom, but upon just and very good grounds:  which you may perceive to be\ntrue, if laying aside all prejudicate affections, you will but give ear to\nwhat presently I shall expound unto you.\n\nAristotle saith that, supposing two things contrary in their kind, as good\nand evil, virtue and vice, heat and cold, white and black, pleasure and\npain, joy and grief,--and so of others,--if you couple them in such manner\nthat the contrary of one kind may agree in reason with the contrary of the\nother, it must follow by consequence that the other contrary must answer to\nthe remanent opposite to that wherewith it is conferred.  As, for example,\nvirtue and vice are contrary in one kind, so are good and evil.  If one of\nthe contraries of the first kind be consonant to one of those of the\nsecond, as virtue and goodness, for it is clear that virtue is good, so\nshall the other two contraries, which are evil and vice, have the same\nconnection, for vice is evil.\n\nThis logical rule being understood, take these two contraries, joy and\nsadness; then these other two, white and black, for they are physically\ncontrary.  If so be, then, that black do signify grief, by good reason then\nshould white import joy.  Nor is this signification instituted by human\nimposition, but by the universal consent of the world received, which\nphilosophers call Jus Gentium, the Law of Nations, or an uncontrollable\nright of force in all countries whatsoever.  For you know well enough that\nall people, and all languages and nations, except the ancient Syracusans\nand certain Argives, who had cross and thwarting souls, when they mean\noutwardly to give evidence of their sorrow, go in black; and all mourning\nis done with black.  Which general consent is not without some argument and\nreason in nature, the which every man may by himself very suddenly\ncomprehend, without the instruction of any--and this we call the law of\nnature.  By virtue of the same natural instinct we know that by white all\nthe world hath understood joy, gladness, mirth, pleasure, and delight.  In\nformer times the Thracians and Cretans did mark their good, propitious, and\nfortunate days with white stones, and their sad, dismal, and unfortunate\nones with black.  Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?  It is\nblack and dark by the privation of light.  Doth not the light comfort all\nthe world?  And it is more white than anything else.  Which to prove, I\ncould direct you to the book of Laurentius Valla against Bartolus; but an\nevangelical testimony I hope will content you.  Matth. 17 it is said that,\nat the transfiguration of our Lord, Vestimenta ejus facta sunt alba sicut\nlux, his apparel was made white like the light.  By which lightsome\nwhiteness he gave his three apostles to understand the idea and figure of\nthe eternal joys; for by the light are all men comforted, according to the\nword of the old woman, who, although she had never a tooth in her head, was\nwont to say, Bona lux.  And Tobit, chap.5, after he had lost his sight,\nwhen Raphael saluted him, answered, What joy can I have, that do not see\nthe light of Heaven?  In that colour did the angels testify the joy of the\nwhole world at the resurrection of our Saviour, John 20, and at his\nascension, Acts 1.  With the like colour of vesture did St. John the\nEvangelist, Apoc. 4.7, see the faithful clothed in the heavenly and blessed\nJerusalem.\n\nRead the ancient, both Greek and Latin histories, and you shall find that\nthe town of Alba (the first pattern of Rome) was founded and so named by\nreason of a white sow that was seen there.  You shall likewise find in\nthose stories, that when any man, after he had vanquished his enemies, was\nby decree of the senate to enter into Rome triumphantly, he usually rode in\na chariot drawn by white horses:  which in the ovation triumph was also the\ncustom; for by no sign or colour would they so significantly express the\njoy of their coming as by the white.  You shall there also find, how\nPericles, the general of the Athenians, would needs have that part of his\narmy unto whose lot befell the white beans, to spend the whole day in\nmirth, pleasure, and ease, whilst the rest were a-fighting.  A thousand\nother examples and places could I allege to this purpose, but that it is\nnot here where I should do it.\n\nBy understanding hereof, you may resolve one problem, which Alexander\nAphrodiseus hath accounted unanswerable:  why the lion, who with his only\ncry and roaring affrights all beasts, dreads and feareth only a white cock?\nFor, as Proclus saith, Libro de Sacrificio et Magia, it is because the\npresence of the virtue of the sun, which is the organ and promptuary of all\nterrestrial and sidereal light, doth more symbolize and agree with a white\ncock, as well in regard of that colour, as of his property and specifical\nquality, than with a lion.  He saith, furthermore, that devils have been\noften seen in the shape of lions, which at the sight of a white cock have\npresently vanished.  This is the cause why Galli or Gallices (so are the\nFrenchmen called, because they are naturally white as milk, which the\nGreeks call Gala,) do willingly wear in their caps white feathers, for by\nnature they are of a candid disposition, merry, kind, gracious, and\nwell-beloved, and for their cognizance and arms have the whitest flower\nof any, the Flower de luce or Lily.\n\nIf you demand how, by white, nature would have us understand joy and\ngladness, I answer, that the analogy and uniformity is thus.  For, as the\nwhite doth outwardly disperse and scatter the rays of the sight, whereby\nthe optic spirits are manifestly dissolved, according to the opinion of\nAristotle in his problems and perspective treatises; as you may likewise\nperceive by experience, when you pass over mountains covered with snow, how\nyou will complain that you cannot see well; as Xenophon writes to have\nhappened to his men, and as Galen very largely declareth, lib. 10, de usu\npartium:  just so the heart with excessive joy is inwardly dilated, and\nsuffereth a manifest resolution of the vital spirits, which may go so far\non that it may thereby be deprived of its nourishment, and by consequence\nof life itself, by this perichary or extremity of gladness, as Galen saith,\nlib. 12, method, lib. 5, de locis affectis, and lib. 2, de symptomatum\ncausis.  And as it hath come to pass in former times, witness Marcus\nTullius, lib. 1, Quaest. Tuscul., Verrius, Aristotle, Titus Livius, in his\nrelation of the battle of Cannae, Plinius, lib. 7, cap. 32 and 34, A.\nGellius, lib. 3, c. 15, and many other writers,--to Diagoras the Rhodian,\nChilon, Sophocles, Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily, Philippides, Philemon,\nPolycrates, Philistion, M. Juventi, and others who died with joy.  And as\nAvicen speaketh, in 2 canon et lib. de virib. cordis, of the saffron, that\nit doth so rejoice the heart that, if you take of it excessively, it will\nby a superfluous resolution and dilation deprive it altogether of life.\nHere peruse Alex. Aphrodiseus, lib. 1, Probl., cap. 19, and that for a\ncause.  But what?  It seems I am entered further into this point than I\nintended at the first.  Here, therefore, will I strike sail, referring the\nrest to that book of mine which handleth this matter to the full.\nMeanwhile, in a word I will tell you, that blue doth certainly signify\nheaven and heavenly things, by the same very tokens and symbols that white\nsignifieth joy and pleasure.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XI.\n\nOf the youthful age of Gargantua.\n\nGargantua, from three years upwards unto five, was brought up and\ninstructed in all convenient discipline by the commandment of his father;\nand spent that time like the other little children of the country, that is,\nin drinking, eating, and sleeping:  in eating, sleeping, and drinking:  and\nin sleeping, drinking, and eating.  Still he wallowed and rolled up and\ndown himself in the mire and dirt--he blurred and sullied his nose with\nfilth--he blotted and smutched his face with any kind of scurvy stuff--he\ntrod down his shoes in the heel--at the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and\nran very heartily after the butterflies, the empire whereof belonged to his\nfather.  He pissed in his shoes, shit in his shirt, and wiped his nose on\nhis sleeve--he did let his snot and snivel fall in his pottage, and\ndabbled, paddled, and slobbered everywhere--he would drink in his slipper,\nand ordinarily rub his belly against a pannier.  He sharpened his teeth\nwith a top, washed his hands with his broth, and combed his head with a\nbowl.  He would sit down betwixt two stools, and his arse to the ground\n--would cover himself with a wet sack, and drink in eating of his soup.  He\ndid eat his cake sometimes without bread, would bite in laughing, and laugh\nin biting.  Oftentimes did he spit in the basin, and fart for fatness, piss\nagainst the sun, and hide himself in the water for fear of rain.  He would\nstrike out of the cold iron, be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle\nit.  He would flay the fox, say the ape's paternoster, return to his sheep,\nand turn the hogs to the hay.  He would beat the dogs before the lion, put\nthe plough before the oxen, and claw where it did not itch.  He would pump\none to draw somewhat out of him, by griping all would hold fast nothing,\nand always eat his white bread first.  He shoed the geese, kept a\nself-tickling to make himself laugh, and was very steadable in the kitchen:\nmade a mock at the gods, would cause sing Magnificat at matins, and found\nit very convenient so to do.  He would eat cabbage, and shite beets,--knew\nflies in a dish of milk, and would make them lose their feet.  He would\nscrape paper, blur parchment, then run away as hard as he could.  He would\npull at the kid's leather, or vomit up his dinner, then reckon without his\nhost.  He would beat the bushes without catching the birds, thought the\nmoon was made of green cheese, and that bladders are lanterns.  Out of one\nsack he would take two moultures or fees for grinding; would act the ass's\npart to get some bran, and of his fist would make a mallet.  He took the\ncranes at the first leap, and would have the mail-coats to be made link\nafter link.  He always looked a given horse in the mouth, leaped from the\ncock to the ass, and put one ripe between two green.  By robbing Peter he\npaid Paul, he kept the moon from the wolves, and hoped to catch larks if\never the heavens should fall.  He did make of necessity virtue, of such\nbread such pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven.\nEvery morning he did cast up his gorge, and his father's little dogs eat\nout of the dish with him, and he with them.  He would bite their ears, and\nthey would scratch his nose--he would blow in their arses, and they would\nlick his chaps.\n\nBut hearken, good fellows, the spigot ill betake you, and whirl round your\nbrains, if you do not give ear!  This little lecher was always groping his\nnurses and governesses, upside down, arsiversy, topsyturvy, harri\nbourriquet, with a Yacco haick, hyck gio! handling them very rudely in\njumbling and tumbling them to keep them going; for he had already begun to\nexercise the tools, and put his codpiece in practice.  Which codpiece, or\nbraguette, his governesses did every day deck up and adorn with fair\nnosegays, curious rubies, sweet flowers, and fine silken tufts, and very\npleasantly would pass their time in taking you know what between their\nfingers, and dandling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and\nstiffness of a suppository, or street magdaleon, which is a hard rolled-up\nsalve spread upon leather.  Then did they burst out in laughing, when they\nsaw it lift up its ears, as if the sport had liked them.  One of them would\ncall it her little dille, her staff of love, her quillety, her faucetin,\nher dandilolly.  Another, her peen, her jolly kyle, her bableret, her\nmembretoon, her quickset imp:  another again, her branch of coral, her\nfemale adamant, her placket-racket, her Cyprian sceptre, her jewel for\nladies.  And some of the other women would give it these names,--my\nbunguetee, my stopple too, my bush-rusher, my gallant wimble, my pretty\nborer, my coney-burrow-ferret, my little piercer, my augretine, my dangling\nhangers, down right to it, stiff and stout, in and to, my pusher, dresser,\npouting stick, my honey pipe, my pretty pillicock, linky pinky, futilletie,\nmy lusty andouille, and crimson chitterling, my little couille bredouille,\nmy pretty rogue, and so forth.  It belongs to me, said one.  It is mine,\nsaid the other.  What, quoth a third, shall I have no share in it?  By my\nfaith, I will cut it then.  Ha, to cut it, said the other, would hurt him.\nMadam, do you cut little children's things?  Were his cut off, he would be\nthen Monsieur sans queue, the curtailed master.  And that he might play and\nsport himself after the manner of the other little children of the country,\nthey made him a fair weather whirl-jack of the wings of the windmill of\nMyrebalais.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XII.\n\nOf Gargantua's wooden horses.\n\nAfterwards, that he might be all his lifetime a good rider, they made to\nhim a fair great horse of wood, which he did make leap, curvet, jerk out\nbehind, and skip forward, all at a time:  to pace, trot, rack, gallop,\namble, to play the hobby, the hackney-gelding:  go the gait of the camel,\nand of the wild ass.  He made him also change his colour of hair, as the\nmonks of Coultibo (according to the variety of their holidays) use to do\ntheir clothes, from bay brown, to sorrel, dapple-grey, mouse-dun,\ndeer-colour, roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skewed colour, piebald, and the\ncolour of the savage elk.\n\nHimself of a huge big post made a hunting nag, and another for daily\nservice of the beam of a vinepress:  and of a great oak made up a mule,\nwith a footcloth, for his chamber.  Besides this, he had ten or twelve\nspare horses, and seven horses for post; and all these were lodged in his\nown chamber, close by his bedside.  One day the Lord of Breadinbag\n(Painensac.) came to visit his father in great bravery, and with a gallant\ntrain:  and, at the same time, to see him came likewise the Duke of\nFreemeal (Francrepas.) and the Earl of Wetgullet (Mouillevent.).  The house\ntruly for so many guests at once was somewhat narrow, but especially the\nstables; whereupon the steward and harbinger of the said Lord Breadinbag,\nto know if there were any other empty stable in the house, came to\nGargantua, a little young lad, and secretly asked him where the stables of\nthe great horses were, thinking that children would be ready to tell all.\nThen he led them up along the stairs of the castle, passing by the second\nhall unto a broad great gallery, by which they entered into a large tower,\nand as they were going up at another pair of stairs, said the harbinger to\nthe steward, This child deceives us, for the stables are never on the top\nof the house.  You may be mistaken, said the steward, for I know some\nplaces at Lyons, at the Basmette, at Chaisnon, and elsewhere, which have\ntheir stables at the very tops of the houses:  so it may be that behind the\nhouse there is a way to come to this ascent.  But I will question with him\nfurther.  Then said he to Gargantua, My pretty little boy, whither do you\nlead us?  To the stable, said he, of my great horses.  We are almost come\nto it; we have but these stairs to go up at.  Then leading them alongst\nanother great hall, he brought them into his chamber, and, opening the\ndoor, said unto them, This is the stable you ask for; this is my jennet;\nthis is my gelding; this is my courser, and this is my hackney, and laid on\nthem with a great lever.  I will bestow upon you, said he, this Friesland\nhorse; I had him from Frankfort, yet will I give him you; for he is a\npretty little nag, and will go very well, with a tessel of goshawks, half a\ndozen of spaniels, and a brace of greyhounds:  thus are you king of the\nhares and partridges for all this winter.  By St. John, said they, now we\nare paid, he hath gleeked us to some purpose, bobbed we are now for ever.\nI deny it, said he,--he was not here above three days.  Judge you now,\nwhether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for shame, or to\nlaugh at the jest.  As they were going down again thus amazed, he asked\nthem, Will you have a whimwham (Aubeliere.)?  What is that, said they?  It\nis, said he, five turds to make you a muzzle.  To-day, said the steward,\nthough we happen to be roasted, we shall not be burnt, for we are pretty\nwell quipped and larded, in my opinion.  O my jolly dapper boy, thou hast\ngiven us a gudgeon; I hope to see thee Pope before I die.  I think so, said\nhe, myself; and then shall you be a puppy, and this gentle popinjay a\nperfect papelard, that is, dissembler.  Well, well, said the harbinger.\nBut, said Gargantua, guess how many stitches there are in my mother's\nsmock.  Sixteen, quoth the harbinger.  You do not speak gospel, said\nGargantua, for there is cent before, and cent behind, and you did not\nreckon them ill, considering the two under holes.  When? said the\nharbinger.  Even then, said Gargantua, when they made a shovel of your nose\nto take up a quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel, wherewith to put\nit into another vessel, because the bottom of the old one was out.\nCocksbod, said the steward, we have met with a prater.  Farewell, master\ntattler, God keep you, so goodly are the words which you come out with, and\nso fresh in your mouth, that it had need to be salted.\n\nThus going down in great haste, under the arch of the stairs they let fall\nthe great lever, which he had put upon their backs; whereupon Gargantua\nsaid, What a devil! you are, it seems, but bad horsemen, that suffer your\nbilder to fail you when you need him most.  If you were to go from hence to\nCahusac, whether had you rather, ride on a gosling or lead a sow in a\nleash?  I had rather drink, said the harbinger.  With this they entered\ninto the lower hall, where the company was, and relating to them this new\nstory, they made them laugh like a swarm of flies.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XIII.\n\nHow Gargantua's wonderful understanding became known to his father\nGrangousier, by the invention of a torchecul or wipebreech.\n\nAbout the end of the fifth year, Grangousier returning from the conquest of\nthe Canarians, went by the way to see his son Gargantua.  There was he\nfilled with joy, as such a father might be at the sight of such a child of\nhis:  and whilst he kissed and embraced him, he asked many childish\nquestions of him about divers matters, and drank very freely with him and\nwith his governesses, of whom in great earnest he asked, amongst other\nthings, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and sweet.  To this\nGargantua answered, that he had taken such a course for that himself, that\nin all the country there was not to be found a cleanlier boy than he.  How\nis that? said Grangousier.  I have, answered Gargantua, by a long and\ncurious experience, found out a means to wipe my bum, the most lordly, the\nmost excellent, and the most convenient that ever was seen.  What is that?\nsaid Grangousier, how is it?  I will tell you by-and-by, said Gargantua.\nOnce I did wipe me with a gentle-woman's velvet mask, and found it to be\ngood; for the softness of the silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to my\nfundament.  Another time with one of their hoods, and in like manner that\nwas comfortable.  At another time with a lady's neckerchief, and after that\nI wiped me with some ear-pieces of hers made of crimson satin, but there\nwas such a number of golden spangles in them (turdy round things, a pox\ntake them) that they fetched away all the skin of my tail with a vengeance.\nNow I wish St. Antony's fire burn the bum-gut of the goldsmith that made\nthem, and of her that wore them!  This hurt I cured by wiping myself with a\npage's cap, garnished with a feather after the Switzers' fashion.\n\nAfterwards, in dunging behind a bush, I found a March-cat, and with it I\nwiped my breech, but her claws were so sharp that they scratched and\nexulcerated all my perinee.  Of this I recovered the next morning\nthereafter, by wiping myself with my mother's gloves, of a most excellent\nperfume and scent of the Arabian Benin.  After that I wiped me with sage,\nwith fennel, with anet, with marjoram, with roses, with gourd-leaves, with\nbeets, with colewort, with leaves of the vine-tree, with mallows,\nwool-blade, which is a tail-scarlet, with lettuce, and with spinach leaves.\nAll this did very great good to my leg.  Then with mercury, with parsley,\nwith nettles, with comfrey, but that gave me the bloody flux of Lombardy,\nwhich I healed by wiping me with my braguette.  Then I wiped my tail in the\nsheets, in the coverlet, in the curtains, with a cushion, with arras\nhangings, with a green carpet, with a table-cloth, with a napkin, with a\nhandkerchief, with a combing-cloth; in all which I found more pleasure than\ndo the mangy dogs when you rub them.  Yea, but, said Grangousier, which\ntorchecul did you find to be the best?  I was coming to it, said Gargantua,\nand by-and-by shall you hear the tu autem, and know the whole mystery and\nknot of the matter.  I wiped myself with hay, with straw, with\nthatch-rushes, with flax, with wool, with paper, but,\n\n  Who his foul tail with paper wipes,\n  Shall at his ballocks leave some chips.\n\nWhat, said Grangousier, my little rogue, hast thou been at the pot, that\nthou dost rhyme already?  Yes, yes, my lord the king, answered Gargantua, I\ncan rhyme gallantly, and rhyme till I become hoarse with rheum.  Hark, what\nour privy says to the skiters:\n\n\nShittard,\nSquirtard,\nCrackard,\n   Turdous,\nThy bung\nHath flung\nSome dung\n   On us:\nFilthard,\nCackard,\nStinkard,\n   St. Antony's fire seize on thy toane (bone?),\nIf thy\nDirty\nDounby\n   Thou do not wipe, ere thou be gone.\n\nWill you have any more of it?  Yes, yes, answered Grangousier.  Then, said\nGargantua,\n\nA Roundelay.\n\nIn shitting yes'day I did know\nThe sess I to my arse did owe:\nThe smell was such came from that slunk,\nThat I was with it all bestunk:\nO had but then some brave Signor\nBrought her to me I waited for,\n   In shitting!\n\nI would have cleft her watergap,\nAnd join'd it close to my flipflap,\nWhilst she had with her fingers guarded\nMy foul nockandrow, all bemerded\n   In shitting.\n\nNow say that I can do nothing!  By the Merdi, they are not of my making,\nbut I heard them of this good old grandam, that you see here, and ever\nsince have retained them in the budget of my memory.\n\nLet us return to our purpose, said Grangousier.  What, said Gargantua, to\nskite?  No, said Grangousier, but to wipe our tail.  But, said Gargantua,\nwill not you be content to pay a puncheon of Breton wine, if I do not blank\nand gravel you in this matter, and put you to a non-plus?  Yes, truly, said\nGrangousier.\n\nThere is no need of wiping one's tail, said Gargantua, but when it is foul;\nfoul it cannot be, unless one have been a-skiting; skite then we must\nbefore we wipe our tails.  O my pretty little waggish boy, said\nGrangousier, what an excellent wit thou hast?  I will make thee very\nshortly proceed doctor in the jovial quirks of gay learning, and that, by\nG--, for thou hast more wit than age.  Now, I prithee, go on in this\ntorcheculative, or wipe-bummatory discourse, and by my beard I swear, for\none puncheon, thou shalt have threescore pipes, I mean of the good Breton\nwine, not that which grows in Britain, but in the good country of Verron.\nAfterwards I wiped my bum, said Gargantua, with a kerchief, with a pillow,\nwith a pantoufle, with a pouch, with a pannier, but that was a wicked and\nunpleasant torchecul; then with a hat.  Of hats, note that some are shorn,\nand others shaggy, some velveted, others covered with taffeties, and others\nwith satin.  The best of all these is the shaggy hat, for it makes a very\nneat abstersion of the fecal matter.\n\nAfterwards I wiped my tail with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a\ncalf's skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an\nattorney's bag, with a montero, with a coif, with a falconer's lure.  But,\nto conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps,\nbumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipe-breeches, there is\nnone in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well downed,\nif you hold her head betwixt your legs.  And believe me therein upon mine\nhonour, for you will thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful\npleasure, both in regard of the softness of the said down and of the\ntemporate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut\nand the rest of the inwards, in so far as to come even to the regions of\nthe heart and brains.  And think not that the felicity of the heroes and\ndemigods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their asphodel,\nambrosia, or nectar, as our old women here used to say; but in this,\naccording to my judgment, that they wipe their tails with the neck of a\ngoose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of\nMaster John of Scotland, alias Scotus.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XIV.\n\nHow Gargantua was taught Latin by a Sophister.\n\nThe good man Grangousier having heard this discourse, was ravished with\nadmiration, considering the high reach and marvellous understanding of his\nson Gargantua, and said to his governesses, Philip, king of Macedon, knew\nthe great wit of his son Alexander by his skilful managing of a horse; for\nhis horse Bucephalus was so fierce and unruly that none durst adventure\nto ride him, after that he had given to his riders such devilish falls,\nbreaking the neck of this man, the other man's leg, braining one, and\nputting another out of his jawbone.  This by Alexander being considered,\none day in the hippodrome (which was a place appointed for the breaking and\nmanaging of great horses), he perceived that the fury of the horse\nproceeded merely from the fear he had of his own shadow, whereupon getting\non his back, he run him against the sun, so that the shadow fell behind,\nand by that means tamed the horse and brought him to his hand.  Whereby his\nfather, knowing the divine judgment that was in him, caused him most\ncarefully to be instructed by Aristotle, who at that time was highly\nrenowned above all the philosophers of Greece.  After the same manner I\ntell you, that by this only discourse, which now I have here had before you\nwith my son Gargantua, I know that his understanding doth participate of\nsome divinity, and that, if he be well taught, and have that education\nwhich is fitting, he will attain to a supreme degree of wisdom.  Therefore\nwill I commit him to some learned man, to have him indoctrinated according\nto his capacity, and will spare no cost.  Presently they appointed him a\ngreat sophister-doctor, called Master Tubal Holofernes, who taught him his\nABC so well, that he could say it by heart backwards; and about this he was\nfive years and three months.  Then read he to him Donat, Le Facet,\nTheodolet, and Alanus in parabolis.  About this he was thirteen years, six\nmonths, and two weeks.  But you must remark that in the mean time he did\nlearn to write in Gothic characters, and that he wrote all his books--for\nthe art of printing was not then in use--and did ordinarily carry a great\npen and inkhorn, weighing about seven thousand quintals (that is, 700,000\npound weight), the penner whereof was as big and as long as the great\npillars of Enay, and the horn was hanging to it in great iron chains, it\nbeing of the wideness of a tun of merchant ware.  After that he read unto\nhim the book de modis significandi, with the commentaries of Hurtbise, of\nFasquin, of Tropdieux, of Gualhaut, of John Calf, of Billonio, of\nBerlinguandus, and a rabble of others; and herein he spent more than\neighteen years and eleven months, and was so well versed in it that, to try\nmasteries in school disputes with his condisciples, he would recite it by\nheart backwards, and did sometimes prove on his finger-ends to his mother,\nquod de modis significandi non erat scientia.  Then did he read to him the\ncompost for knowing the age of the moon, the seasons of the year, and tides\nof the sea, on which he spent sixteen years and two months, and that justly\nat the time that his said preceptor died of the French pox, which was in\nthe year one thousand four hundred and twenty.  Afterwards he got an old\ncoughing fellow to teach him, named Master Jobelin Bride, or muzzled dolt,\nwho read unto him Hugutio, Hebrard('s) Grecism, the Doctrinal, the Parts,\nthe Quid est, the Supplementum, Marmotretus, De moribus in mensa servandis,\nSeneca de quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus, Passavantus cum commento, and\nDormi secure for the holidays, and some other of such like mealy stuff, by\nreading whereof he became as wise as any we ever since baked in an oven.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XV.\n\nHow Gargantua was put under other schoolmasters.\n\nAt the last his father perceived that indeed he studied hard, and that,\nalthough he spent all his time in it, he did nevertheless profit nothing,\nbut which is worse, grew thereby foolish, simple, doted, and blockish,\nwhereof making a heavy regret to Don Philip of Marays, Viceroy or Depute\nKing of Papeligosse, he found that it were better for him to learn nothing\nat all, than to be taught such-like books, under such schoolmasters;\nbecause their knowledge was nothing but brutishness, and their wisdom but\nblunt foppish toys, serving only to bastardize good and noble spirits, and\nto corrupt all the flower of youth.  That it is so, take, said he, any\nyoung boy of this time who hath only studied two years,--if he have not a\nbetter judgment, a better discourse, and that expressed in better terms\nthan your son, with a completer carriage and civility to all manner of\npersons, account me for ever hereafter a very clounch and bacon-slicer of\nBrene.  This pleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that it should\nbe done.  At night at supper, the said Des Marays brought in a young page\nof his, of Ville-gouges, called Eudemon, so neat, so trim, so handsome in\nhis apparel, so spruce, with his hair in so good order, and so sweet and\ncomely in his behaviour, that he had the resemblance of a little angel more\nthan of a human creature.  Then he said to Grangousier, Do you see this\nyoung boy?  He is not as yet full twelve years old.  Let us try, if it\nplease you, what difference there is betwixt the knowledge of the doting\nMateologians of old time and the young lads that are now.  The trial\npleased Grangousier, and he commanded the page to begin.  Then Eudemon,\nasking leave of the vice-king his master so to do, with his cap in his\nhand, a clear and open countenance, beautiful and ruddy lips, his eyes\nsteady, and his looks fixed upon Gargantua with a youthful modesty,\nstanding up straight on his feet, began very gracefully to commend him;\nfirst, for his virtue and good manners; secondly, for his knowledge,\nthirdly, for his nobility; fourthly, for his bodily accomplishments; and,\nin the fifth place, most sweetly exhorted him to reverence his father with\nall due observancy, who was so careful to have him well brought up.  In the\nend he prayed him, that he would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the\nleast of his servants; for other favour at that time desired he none of\nheaven, but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable service.  All\nthis was by him delivered with such proper gestures, such distinct\npronunciation, so pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine terms, and so\ngood Latin, that he seemed rather a Gracchus, a Cicero, an Aemilius of the\ntime past, than a youth of this age.  But all the countenance that\nGargantua kept was, that he fell to crying like a cow, and cast down his\nface, hiding it with his cap, nor could they possibly draw one word from\nhim, no more than a fart from a dead ass.  Whereat his father was so\ngrievously vexed that he would have killed Master Jobelin, but the said Des\nMarays withheld him from it by fair persuasions, so that at length he\npacified his wrath.  Then Grangousier commanded he should be paid his\nwages, that they should whittle him up soundly, like a sophister, with good\ndrink, and then give him leave to go to all the devils in hell.  At least,\nsaid he, today shall it not cost his host much if by chance he should die\nas drunk as a Switzer.  Master Jobelin being gone out of the house,\nGrangousier consulted with the Viceroy what schoolmaster they should choose\nfor him, and it was betwixt them resolved that Ponocrates, the tutor of\nEudemon, should have the charge, and that they should go altogether to\nParis, to know what was the study of the young men of France at that time.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XVI.\n\nHow Gargantua was sent to Paris, and of the huge great mare that he rode\non; how she destroyed the oxflies of the Beauce.\n\nIn the same season Fayoles, the fourth King of Numidia, sent out of the\ncountry of Africa to Grangousier the most hideously great mare that ever\nwas seen, and of the strangest form, for you know well enough how it is\nsaid that Africa always is productive of some new thing.  She was as big as\nsix elephants, and had her feet cloven into fingers, like Julius Caesar's\nhorse, with slouch-hanging ears, like the goats in Languedoc, and a little\nhorn on her buttock.  She was of a burnt sorrel hue, with a little mixture\nof dapple-grey spots, but above all she had a horrible tail; for it was\nlittle more or less than every whit as great as the steeple-pillar of St.\nMark beside Langes:  and squared as that is, with tuffs and ennicroches or\nhair-plaits wrought within one another, no otherwise than as the beards are\nupon the ears of corn.\n\nIf you wonder at this, wonder rather at the tails of the Scythian rams,\nwhich weighed above thirty pounds each; and of the Surian sheep, who need,\nif Tenaud say true, a little cart at their heels to bear up their tail, it\nis so long and heavy.  You female lechers in the plain countries have no\nsuch tails.  And she was brought by sea in three carricks and a brigantine\nunto the harbour of Olone in Thalmondois.  When Grangousier saw her, Here\nis, said he, what is fit to carry my son to Paris.  So now, in the name of\nGod, all will be well.  He will in times coming be a great scholar.  If it\nwere not, my masters, for the beasts, we should live like clerks.  The next\nmorning--after they had drunk, you must understand--they took their\njourney; Gargantua, his pedagogue Ponocrates, and his train, and with them\nEudemon, the young page.  And because the weather was fair and temperate,\nhis father caused to be made for him a pair of dun boots,--Babin calls them\nbuskins.  Thus did they merrily pass their time in travelling on their high\nway, always making good cheer, and were very pleasant till they came a\nlittle above Orleans, in which place there was a forest of five-and-thirty\nleagues long, and seventeen in breadth, or thereabouts.  This forest was\nmost horribly fertile and copious in dorflies, hornets, and wasps, so that\nit was a very purgatory for the poor mares, asses, and horses.  But\nGargantua's mare did avenge herself handsomely of all the outrages therein\ncommitted upon beasts of her kind, and that by a trick whereof they had no\nsuspicion.  For as soon as ever they were entered into the said forest, and\nthat the wasps had given the assault, she drew out and unsheathed her tail,\nand therewith skirmishing, did so sweep them that she overthrew all the\nwood alongst and athwart, here and there, this way and that way, longwise\nand sidewise, over and under, and felled everywhere the wood with as much\nease as a mower doth the grass, in such sort that never since hath there\nbeen there neither wood nor dorflies:  for all the country was thereby\nreduced to a plain champaign field.  Which Gargantua took great pleasure to\nbehold, and said to his company no more but this:  Je trouve beau ce (I\nfind this pretty); whereupon that country hath been ever since that time\ncalled Beauce.  But all the breakfast the mare got that day was but a\nlittle yawning and gaping, in memory whereof the gentlemen of Beauce do as\nyet to this day break their fast with gaping, which they find to be very\ngood, and do spit the better for it.  At last they came to Paris, where\nGargantua refreshed himself two or three days, making very merry with his\nfolks, and inquiring what men of learning there were then in the city, and\nwhat wine they drunk there.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XVII.\n\nHow Gargantua paid his welcome to the Parisians, and how he took away the\ngreat bells of Our Lady's Church.\n\nSome few days after that they had refreshed themselves, he went to see the\ncity, and was beheld of everybody there with great admiration; for the\npeople of Paris are so sottish, so badot, so foolish and fond by nature,\nthat a juggler, a carrier of indulgences, a sumpter-horse, or mule with\ncymbals or tinkling bells, a blind fiddler in the middle of a cross lane,\nshall draw a greater confluence of people together than an evangelical\npreacher.  And they pressed so hard upon him that he was constrained to\nrest himself upon the towers of Our Lady's Church.  At which place, seeing\nso many about him, he said with a loud voice, I believe that these buzzards\nwill have me to pay them here my welcome hither, and my Proficiat.  It is\nbut good reason.  I will now give them their wine, but it shall be only in\nsport.  Then smiling, he untied his fair braguette, and drawing out his\nmentul into the open air, he so bitterly all-to-bepissed them, that he\ndrowned two hundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and eighteen, besides\nthe women and little children.  Some, nevertheless, of the company escaped\nthis piss-flood by mere speed of foot, who, when they were at the higher\nend of the university, sweating, coughing, spitting, and out of breath,\nthey began to swear and curse, some in good hot earnest, and others in\njest.  Carimari, carimara:  golynoly, golynolo.  By my sweet Sanctess, we\nare washed in sport, a sport truly to laugh at;--in French, Par ris, for\nwhich that city hath been ever since called Paris; whose name formerly was\nLeucotia, as Strabo testifieth, lib. quarto, from the Greek word leukotes,\nwhiteness,--because of the white thighs of the ladies of that place.  And\nforasmuch as, at this imposition of a new name, all the people that were\nthere swore everyone by the Sancts of his parish, the Parisians, which are\npatched up of all nations and all pieces of countries, are by nature both\ngood jurors and good jurists, and somewhat overweening; whereupon Joanninus\nde Barrauco, libro de copiositate reverentiarum, thinks that they are\ncalled Parisians from the Greek word parresia, which signifies boldness and\nliberty in speech.  This done, he considered the great bells, which were in\nthe said towers, and made them sound very harmoniously.  Which whilst he\nwas doing, it came into his mind that they would serve very well for\ntingling tantans and ringing campanels to hang about his mare's neck when\nshe should be sent back to his father, as he intended to do, loaded with\nBrie cheese and fresh herring.  And indeed he forthwith carried them to his\nlodging.  In the meanwhile there came a master beggar of the friars of St.\nAnthony to demand in his canting way the usual benevolence of some hoggish\nstuff, who, that he might be heard afar off, and to make the bacon he was\nin quest of shake in the very chimneys, made account to filch them away\nprivily.  Nevertheless, he left them behind very honestly, not for that\nthey were too hot, but that they were somewhat too heavy for his carriage.\nThis was not he of Bourg, for he was too good a friend of mine.  All the\ncity was risen up in sedition, they being, as you know, upon any slight\noccasion, so ready to uproars and insurrections, that foreign nations\nwonder at the patience of the kings of France, who do not by good justice\nrestrain them from such tumultuous courses, seeing the manifold\ninconveniences which thence arise from day to day.  Would to God I knew the\nshop wherein are forged these divisions and factious combinations, that I\nmight bring them to light in the confraternities of my parish!  Believe for\na truth, that the place wherein the people gathered together, were thus\nsulphured, hopurymated, moiled, and bepissed, was called Nesle, where then\nwas, but now is no more, the oracle of Leucotia.  There was the case\nproposed, and the inconvenience showed of the transporting of the bells.\nAfter they had well ergoted pro and con, they concluded in baralipton, that\nthey should send the oldest and most sufficient of the faculty unto\nGargantua, to signify unto him the great and horrible prejudice they\nsustain by the want of those bells.  And notwithstanding the good reasons\ngiven in by some of the university why this charge was fitter for an orator\nthan a sophister, there was chosen for this purpose our Master Janotus de\nBragmardo.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XVIII.\n\nHow Janotus de Bragmardo was sent to Gargantua to recover the great bells.\n\nMaster Janotus, with his hair cut round like a dish a la Caesarine, in his\nmost antique accoutrement liripipionated with a graduate's hood, and having\nsufficiently antidoted his stomach with oven-marmalades, that is, bread and\nholy water of the cellar, transported himself to the lodging of Gargantua,\ndriving before him three red-muzzled beadles, and dragging after him five\nor six artless masters, all thoroughly bedaggled with the mire of the\nstreets.  At their entry Ponocrates met them, who was afraid, seeing them\nso disguised, and thought they had been some masquers out of their wits,\nwhich moved him to inquire of one of the said artless masters of the\ncompany what this mummery meant.  It was answered him, that they desired to\nhave their bells restored to them.  As soon as Ponocrates heard that, he\nran in all haste to carry the news unto Gargantua, that he might be ready\nto answer them, and speedily resolve what was to be done.  Gargantua being\nadvertised hereof, called apart his schoolmaster Ponocrates, Philotimus,\nsteward of his house, Gymnastes, his esquire, and Eudemon, and very\nsummarily conferred with them, both of what he should do and what answer he\nshould give.  They were all of opinion that they should bring them unto the\ngoblet-office, which is the buttery, and there make them drink like\nroysters and line their jackets soundly.  And that this cougher might not\nbe puffed up with vain-glory by thinking the bells were restored at his\nrequest, they sent, whilst he was chopining and plying the pot, for the\nmayor of the city, the rector of the faculty, and the vicar of the church,\nunto whom they resolved to deliver the bells before the sophister had\npropounded his commission.  After that, in their hearing, he should\npronounce his gallant oration, which was done; and they being come, the\nsophister was brought in full hall, and began as followeth, in coughing.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XIX.\n\nThe oration of Master Janotus de Bragmardo for recovery of the bells.\n\nHem, hem, gud-day, sirs, gud-day.  Et vobis, my masters.  It were but\nreason that you should restore to us our bells; for we have great need of\nthem.  Hem, hem, aihfuhash.  We have oftentimes heretofore refused good\nmoney for them of those of London in Cahors, yea and those of Bourdeaux in\nBrie, who would have bought them for the substantific quality of the\nelementary complexion, which is intronificated in the terrestreity of their\nquidditative nature, to extraneize the blasting mists and whirlwinds upon\nour vines, indeed not ours, but these round about us.  For if we lose the\npiot and liquor of the grape, we lose all, both sense and law.  If you\nrestore them unto us at my request, I shall gain by it six basketfuls of\nsausages and a fine pair of breeches, which will do my legs a great deal of\ngood, or else they will not keep their promise to me.  Ho by gob, Domine, a\npair of breeches is good, et vir sapiens non abhorrebit eam.  Ha, ha, a\npair of breeches is not so easily got; I have experience of it myself.\nConsider, Domine, I have been these eighteen days in matagrabolizing this\nbrave speech.  Reddite quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari, et quae sunt Dei, Deo.\nIbi jacet lepus.  By my faith, Domine, if you will sup with me in cameris,\nby cox body, charitatis, nos faciemus bonum cherubin.  Ego occiditunum\nporcum, et ego habet bonum vino:  but of good wine we cannot make bad\nLatin.  Well, de parte Dei date nobis bellas nostras.  Hold, I give you in\nthe name of the faculty a Sermones de Utino, that utinam you would give us\nour bells.  Vultis etiam pardonos?  Per diem vos habebitis, et nihil\npayabitis.  O, sir, Domine, bellagivaminor nobis; verily, est bonum vobis.\nThey are useful to everybody.  If they fit your mare well, so do they do\nour faculty; quae comparata est jumentis insipientibus, et similis facta\nest eis, Psalmo nescio quo.  Yet did I quote it in my note-book, et est\nunum bonum Achilles, a good defending argument.  Hem, hem, hem, haikhash!\nFor I prove unto you, that you should give me them.  Ego sic argumentor.\nOmnis bella bellabilis in bellerio bellando, bellans, bellativo, bellare\nfacit, bellabiliter bellantes.  Parisius habet bellas.  Ergo gluc, Ha, ha,\nha.  This is spoken to some purpose.  It is in tertio primae, in Darii, or\nelsewhere.  By my soul, I have seen the time that I could play the devil in\narguing, but now I am much failed, and henceforward want nothing but a cup\nof good wine, a good bed, my back to the fire, my belly to the table, and a\ngood deep dish.  Hei, Domine, I beseech you, in nomine Patris, Filii, et\nSpiritus sancti, Amen, to restore unto us our bells:  and God keep you from\nevil, and our Lady from health, qui vivit et regnat per omnia secula\nseculorum, Amen.  Hem, hashchehhawksash, qzrchremhemhash.\n\nVerum enim vero, quandoquidem, dubio procul.  Edepol, quoniam, ita certe,\nmedius fidius; a town without bells is like a blind man without a staff, an\nass without a crupper, and a cow without cymbals.  Therefore be assured,\nuntil you have restored them unto us, we will never leave crying after you,\nlike a blind man that hath lost his staff, braying like an ass without a\ncrupper, and making a noise like a cow without cymbals.  A certain\nlatinisator, dwelling near the hospital, said since, producing the\nauthority of one Taponnus,--I lie, it was one Pontanus the secular poet,\n--who wished those bells had been made of feathers, and the clapper of a\nfoxtail, to the end they might have begot a chronicle in the bowels of his\nbrain, when he was about the composing of his carminiformal lines.  But nac\npetetin petetac, tic, torche lorgne, or rot kipipur kipipot put pantse\nmalf, he was declared an heretic.  We make them as of wax.  And no more\nsaith the deponent.  Valete et plaudite.  Calepinus recensui.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XX.\n\nHow the Sophister carried away his cloth, and how he had a suit in law\nagainst the other masters.\n\nThe sophister had no sooner ended, but Ponocrates and Eudemon burst out in\na laughing so heartily, that they had almost split with it, and given up\nthe ghost, in rendering their souls to God:  even just as Crassus did,\nseeing a lubberly ass eat thistles; and as Philemon, who, for seeing an ass\neat those figs which were provided for his own dinner, died with force of\nlaughing.  Together with them Master Janotus fell a-laughing too as fast as\nhe could, in which mood of laughing they continued so long, that their eyes\ndid water by the vehement concussion of the substance of the brain, by\nwhich these lachrymal humidities, being pressed out, glided through the\noptic nerves, and so to the full represented Democritus Heraclitizing and\nHeraclitus Democritizing.\n\nWhen they had done laughing, Gargantua consulted with the prime of his\nretinue what should be done.  There Ponocrates was of opinion that they\nshould make this fair orator drink again; and seeing he had showed them\nmore pastime, and made them laugh more than a natural soul could have done,\nthat they should give him ten baskets full of sausages, mentioned in his\npleasant speech, with a pair of hose, three hundred great billets of\nlogwood, five-and-twenty hogsheads of wine, a good large down-bed, and a\ndeep capacious dish, which he said were necessary for his old age.  All\nthis was done as they did appoint:  only Gargantua, doubting that they\ncould not quickly find out breeches fit for his wearing, because he knew\nnot what fashion would best become the said orator, whether the martingale\nfashion of breeches, wherein is a spunghole with a drawbridge for the more\neasy caguing:  or the fashion of the mariners, for the greater solace and\ncomfort of his kidneys:  or that of the Switzers, which keeps warm the\nbedondaine or belly-tabret:  or round breeches with straight cannions,\nhaving in the seat a piece like a cod's tail, for fear of over-heating his\nreins:--all which considered, he caused to be given him seven ells of white\ncloth for the linings.  The wood was carried by the porters, the masters of\narts carried the sausages and the dishes, and Master Janotus himself would\ncarry the cloth.  One of the said masters, called Jousse Bandouille, showed\nhim that it was not seemly nor decent for one of his condition to do so,\nand that therefore he should deliver it to one of them.  Ha, said Janotus,\nbaudet, baudet, or blockhead, blockhead, thou dost not conclude in modo et\nfigura.  For lo, to this end serve the suppositions and parva logicalia.\nPannus, pro quo supponit?  Confuse, said Bandouille, et distributive.  I do\nnot ask thee, said Janotus, blockhead, quomodo supponit, but pro quo?  It\nis, blockhead, pro tibiis meis, and therefore I will carry it, Egomet,\nsicut suppositum portat appositum.  So did he carry it away very close and\ncovertly, as Patelin the buffoon did his cloth.  The best was, that when\nthis cougher, in a full act or assembly held at the Mathurins, had with\ngreat confidence required his breeches and sausages, and that they were\nflatly denied him, because he had them of Gargantua, according to the\ninformations thereupon made, he showed them that this was gratis, and out\nof his liberality, by which they were not in any sort quit of their\npromises.  Notwithstanding this, it was answered him that he should be\ncontent with reason, without expectation of any other bribe there.  Reason?\nsaid Janotus.  We use none of it here.  Unlucky traitors, you are not worth\nthe hanging.  The earth beareth not more arrant villains than you are.  I\nknow it well enough; halt not before the lame.  I have practised wickedness\nwith you.  By God's rattle, I will inform the king of the enormous abuses\nthat are forged here and carried underhand by you, and let me be a leper,\nif he do not burn you alive like sodomites, traitors, heretics and\nseducers, enemies to God and virtue.\n\nUpon these words they framed articles against him:  he on the other side\nwarned them to appear.  In sum, the process was retained by the court, and\nis there as yet.  Hereupon the magisters made a vow never to decrott\nthemselves in rubbing off the dirt of either their shoes or clothes:\nMaster Janotus with his adherents vowed never to blow or snuff their noses,\nuntil judgment were given by a definitive sentence.\n\nBy these vows do they continue unto this time both dirty and snotty; for\nthe court hath not garbled, sifted, and fully looked into all the pieces as\nyet.  The judgment or decree shall be given out and pronounced at the next\nGreek kalends, that is, never.  As you know that they do more than nature,\nand contrary to their own articles.  The articles of Paris maintain that to\nGod alone belongs infinity, and nature produceth nothing that is immortal;\nfor she putteth an end and period to all things by her engendered,\naccording to the saying, Omnia orta cadunt, &c.  But these thick\nmist-swallowers make the suits in law depending before them both infinite\nand immortal.  In doing whereof, they have given occasion to, and verified\nthe saying of Chilo the Lacedaemonian, consecrated to the oracle at Delphos,\nthat misery is the inseparable companion of law-debates; and that pleaders\nare miserable; for sooner shall they attain to the end of their lives, than\nto the final decision of their pretended rights.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXI.\n\nThe study of Gargantua, according to the discipline of his schoolmasters\nthe Sophisters.\n\nThe first day being thus spent, and the bells put up again in their own\nplace, the citizens of Paris, in acknowledgment of this courtesy, offered\nto maintain and feed his mare as long as he pleased, which Gargantua took\nin good part, and they sent her to graze in the forest of Biere.  I think\nshe is not there now.  This done, he with all his heart submitted his study\nto the discretion of Ponocrates; who for the beginning appointed that he\nshould do as he was accustomed, to the end he might understand by what\nmeans, in so long time, his old masters had made him so sottish and\nignorant.  He disposed therefore of his time in such fashion, that\nordinarily he did awake betwixt eight and nine o'clock, whether it was day\nor not, for so had his ancient governors ordained, alleging that which\nDavid saith, Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere.  Then did he tumble and\ntoss, wag his legs, and wallow in the bed some time, the better to stir up\nand rouse his vital spirits, and apparelled himself according to the\nseason:  but willingly he would wear a great long gown of thick frieze,\nfurred with fox-skins.  Afterwards he combed his head with an Almain comb,\nwhich is the four fingers and the thumb.  For his preceptor said that to\ncomb himself otherwise, to wash and make himself neat, was to lose time in\nthis world.  Then he dunged, pissed, spewed, belched, cracked, yawned,\nspitted, coughed, yexed, sneezed and snotted himself like an archdeacon,\nand, to suppress the dew and bad air, went to breakfast, having some good\nfried tripes, fair rashers on the coals, excellent gammons of bacon, store\nof fine minced meat, and a great deal of sippet brewis, made up of the fat\nof the beef-pot, laid upon bread, cheese, and chopped parsley strewed\ntogether.  Ponocrates showed him that he ought not to eat so soon after\nrising out of his bed, unless he had performed some exercise beforehand.\nGargantua answered, What! have not I sufficiently well exercised myself?  I\nhave wallowed and rolled myself six or seven turns in my bed before I rose.\nIs not that enough?  Pope Alexander did so, by the advice of a Jew his\nphysician, and lived till his dying day in despite of his enemies.  My\nfirst masters have used me to it, saying that to breakfast made a good\nmemory, and therefore they drank first.  I am very well after it, and dine\nbut the better.  And Master Tubal, who was the first licenciate at Paris,\ntold me that it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes:  so\ndoth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon perpetual drinking\nin a ribble rabble, like ducks, but on drinking early in the morning; unde\nversus,\n\n  To rise betimes is no good hour,\n  To drink betimes is better sure.\n\nAfter that he had thoroughly broke his fast, he went to church, and they\ncarried to him, in a great basket, a huge impantoufled or thick-covered\nbreviary, weighing, what in grease, clasps, parchment and cover, little\nmore or less than eleven hundred and six pounds.  There he heard\nsix-and-twenty or thirty masses.  This while, to the same place came his\norison-mutterer impaletocked, or lapped up about the chin like a tufted\nwhoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with store of the\nvine-tree-syrup.  With him he mumbled all his kiriels and dunsical\nbreborions, which he so curiously thumbed and fingered, that there fell not\nso much as one grain to the ground.  As he went from the church, they\nbrought him, upon a dray drawn with oxen, a confused heap of paternosters\nand aves of St. Claude, every one of them being of the bigness of a\nhat-block; and thus walking through the cloisters, galleries, or garden, he\nsaid more in turning them over than sixteen hermits would have done.  Then\ndid he study some paltry half-hour with his eyes fixed upon his book; but,\nas the comic saith, his mind was in the kitchen.  Pissing then a full\nurinal, he sat down at table; and because he was naturally phlegmatic, he\nbegan his meal with some dozens of gammons, dried neat's tongues, hard roes\nof mullet, called botargos, andouilles or sausages, and such other\nforerunners of wine. In the meanwhile, four of his folks did cast into his\nmouth one after another continually mustard by whole shovelfuls.\nImmediately after that, he drank a horrible draught of white wine for the\nease of his kidneys.  When that was done, he ate according to the season\nmeat agreeable to his appetite, and then left off eating when his belly\nbegan to strout, and was like to crack for fulness.  As for his drinking, he\nhad in that neither end nor rule.  For he was wont to say, That the limits\nand bounds of drinking were, when the cork of the shoes of him that drinketh\nswelleth up half a foot high.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXII.\n\nThe games of Gargantua.\n\nThen blockishly mumbling with a set on countenance a piece of scurvy grace,\nhe washed his hands in fresh wine, picked his teeth with the foot of a hog,\nand talked jovially with his attendants.  Then the carpet being spread,\nthey brought plenty of cards, many dice, with great store and abundance of\nchequers and chessboards.\n\nThere he played.\nAt flush.

After he was awakened he\nwould shake his ears a little.  In the mean time they brought him fresh\nwine.  There he drank better than ever.  Ponocrates showed him that it was\nan ill diet to drink so after sleeping.  It is, answered Gargantua, the\nvery life of the patriarchs and holy fathers; for naturally I sleep salt,\nand my sleep hath been to me in stead of so many gammons of bacon.  Then\nbegan he to study a little, and out came the paternosters or rosary of\nbeads, which the better and more formally to despatch, he got upon an old\nmule, which had served nine kings, and so mumbling with his mouth, nodding\nand doddling his head, would go see a coney ferreted or caught in a gin.\nAt his return he went into the kitchen to know what roast meat was on the\nspit, and what otherwise was to be dressed for supper.  And supped very\nwell, upon my conscience, and commonly did invite some of his neighbours\nthat were good drinkers, with whom carousing and drinking merrily, they\ntold stories of all sorts from the old to the new.  Amongst others he had\nfor domestics the Lords of Fou, of Gourville, of Griniot, and of Marigny.\nAfter supper were brought in upon the place the fair wooden gospels and the\nbooks of the four kings, that is to say, many pairs of tables and cards--or\nthe fair flush, one, two, three--or at all, to make short work; or else\nthey went to see the wenches thereabouts, with little small banquets,\nintermixed with collations and rear-suppers.  Then did he sleep, without\nunbridling, until eight o'clock in the next morning.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXIII.\n\nHow Gargantua was instructed by Ponocrates, and in such sort disciplinated,\nthat he lost not one hour of the day.\n\nWhen Ponocrates knew Gargantua's vicious manner of living, he resolved to\nbring him up in another kind; but for a while he bore with him, considering\nthat nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great violence.\nTherefore, to begin his work the better, he requested a learned physician\nof that time, called Master Theodorus, seriously to perpend, if it were\npossible, how to bring Gargantua into a better course.  The said physician\npurged him canonically with Anticyrian hellebore, by which medicine he\ncleansed all the alteration and perverse habitude of his brain.  By this\nmeans also Ponocrates made him forget all that he had learned under his\nancient preceptors, as Timotheus did to his disciples, who had been\ninstructed under other musicians.  To do this the better, they brought him\ninto the company of learned men, which were there, in whose imitation he\nhad a great desire and affection to study otherwise, and to improve his\nparts.  Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of studying,\nthat he lost not any one hour in the day, but employed all his time in\nlearning and honest knowledge.  Gargantua awaked, then, about four o'clock\nin the morning.  Whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto\nhim some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a\npronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page\nborn in Basche, named Anagnostes.  According to the purpose and argument of\nthat lesson, he oftentimes gave himself to worship, adore, pray, and send\nup his supplications to that good God, whose Word did show his majesty and\nmarvellous judgment.  Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion\nof his natural digestions.  There his master repeated what had been read,\nexpounding unto him the most obscure and difficult points.  In returning,\nthey considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed it\nthe night before, and into what signs the sun was entering, as also the\nmoon for that day.  This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed,\nand perfumed, during which time they repeated to him the lessons of the day\nbefore.  He himself said them by heart, and upon them would ground some\npractical cases concerning the estate of man, which he would prosecute\nsometimes two or three hours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was\nfully clothed.  Then for three good hours he had a lecture read unto him.\nThis done they went forth, still conferring of the substance of the\nlecture, either unto a field near the university called the Brack, or unto\nthe meadows, where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and at the\npiletrigone (which is a play wherein we throw a triangular piece of iron at\na ring, to pass it), most gallantly exercising their bodies, as formerly\nthey had done their minds.  All their play was but in liberty, for they\nleft off when they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat over\nall their body, or were otherwise weary.  Then were they very well wiped\nand rubbed, shifted their shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see if\ndinner was ready.  Whilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and\neloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the lecture.\nIn the meantime Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sat they down\nat table.  At the beginning of the meal there was read some pleasant\nhistory of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glass\nof wine.  Then, if they thought good, they continued reading, or began to\ndiscourse merrily together; speaking first of the virtue, propriety,\nefficacy, and nature of all that was served in at the table; of bread, of\nwine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of\ntheir dressing.  By means whereof he learned in a little time all the\npassages competent for this that were to be found in Pliny, Athenaeus,\nDioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore,\nAristotle, Aelian, and others.  Whilst they talked of these things, many\ntimes, to be the more certain, they caused the very books to be brought to\nthe table, and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the things\nabove said, that in that time there was not a physician that knew half so\nmuch as he did.  Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read in the\nmorning, and, ending their repast with some conserve or marmalade of\nquinces, he picked his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers, washed his hands\nand eyes with fair fresh water, and gave thanks unto God in some fine\ncantiques, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence.  This done,\nthey brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks\nand new inventions, which were all grounded upon arithmetic.  By this means\nhe fell in love with that numerical science, and every day after dinner and\nsupper he passed his time in it as pleasantly as he was wont to do at cards\nand dice; so that at last he understood so well both the theory and\npractical part thereof, that Tunstall the Englishman, who had written very\nlargely of that purpose, confessed that verily in comparison of him he had\nno skill at all.  And not only in that, but in the other mathematical\nsciences, as geometry, astronomy, music, &c.  For in waiting on the\nconcoction and attending the digestion of his food, they made a thousand\npretty instruments and geometrical figures, and did in some measure\npractise the astronomical canons.\n\nAfter this they recreated themselves with singing musically, in four or\nfive parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased\nthem.  In matter of musical instruments, he learned to play upon the lute,\nthe virginals, the harp, the Almain flute with nine holes, the viol, and\nthe sackbut.  This hour thus spent, and digestion finished, he did purge\nhis body of natural excrements, then betook himself to his principal study\nfor three hours together, or more, as well to repeat his matutinal lectures\nas to proceed in the book wherein he was, as also to write handsomely, to\ndraw and form the antique and Roman letters.  This being done, they went\nout of their house, and with them a young gentleman of Touraine, named the\nEsquire Gymnast, who taught him the art of riding.  Changing then his\nclothes, he rode a Naples courser, a Dutch roussin, a Spanish jennet, a\nbarded or trapped steed, then a light fleet horse, unto whom he gave a\nhundred carieres, made him go the high saults, bounding in the air, free\nthe ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale, turn short in a ring both\nto the right and left hand.  There he broke not his lance; for it is the\ngreatest foolery in the world to say, I have broken ten lances at tilts or\nin fight.  A carpenter can do even as much.  But it is a glorious and\npraise-worthy action with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies.\nTherefore, with a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeled lance would he\nusually force up a door, pierce a harness, beat down a tree, carry away the\nring, lift up a cuirassier saddle, with the mail-coat and gauntlet.  All\nthis he did in complete arms from head to foot.  As for the prancing\nflourishes and smacking popisms for the better cherishing of the horse,\ncommonly used in riding, none did them better than he.  The cavallerize of\nFerrara was but as an ape compared to him.  He was singularly skilful in\nleaping nimbly from one horse to another without putting foot to ground,\nand these horses were called desultories.  He could likewise from either\nside, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and\nrule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for such things are useful\nin military engagements.  Another day he exercised the battle-axe, which he\nso dexterously wielded, both in the nimble, strong, and smooth management\nof that weapon, and that in all the feats practicable by it, that he passed\nknight of arms in the field, and at all essays.\n\nThen tossed he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the\nbacksword, with the Spanish tuck, the dagger, poniard, armed, unarmed, with\na buckler, with a cloak, with a target.  Then would he hunt the hart, the\nroebuck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, the hare, the pheasant,\nthe partridge, and the bustard.  He played at the balloon, and made it\nbound in the air, both with fist and foot.  He wrestled, ran, jumped--not\nat three steps and a leap, called the hops, nor at clochepied, called the\nhare's leap, nor yet at the Almains; for, said Gymnast, these jumps are for\nthe wars altogether unprofitable, and of no use--but at one leap he would\nskip over a ditch, spring over a hedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp\nand grapple after this fashion up against a window of the full height of a\nlance.  He did swim in deep waters on his belly, on his back, sideways,\nwith all his body, with his feet only, with one hand in the air, wherein he\nheld a book, crossing thus the breadth of the river of Seine without\nwetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did Julius\nCaesar; then with the help of one hand he entered forcibly into a boat,\nfrom whence he cast himself again headlong into the water, sounded the\ndepths, hollowed the rocks, and plunged into the pits and gulfs.  Then\nturned he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the\nstream and against the stream, stopped it in his course, guided it with one\nhand, and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great oar, hoisted\nthe sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the\ndecks, set the compass in order, tackled the bowlines, and steered the\nhelm.  Coming out of the water, he ran furiously up against a hill, and\nwith the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again.  He climbed up at\ntrees like a cat, and leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel.  He\ndid pull down the great boughs and branches like another Milo; then with\ntwo sharp well-steeled daggers and two tried bodkins would he run up by the\nwall to the very top of a house like a rat; then suddenly came down from\nthe top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members that by the\nfall he would catch no harm.\n\nHe did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practise the javelin,\nthe boar-spear or partisan, and the halbert.  He broke the strongest bows\nin drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crossbows of steel, took\nhis aim by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted\nthe cannon, shot at butt-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, or to a\nheight from above downwards, or to a descent; then before him, sideways,\nand behind him, like the Parthians.  They tied a cable-rope to the top of a\nhigh tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground he wrought himself\nwith his hands to the very top; then upon the same track came down so\nsturdily and firm that you could not on a plain meadow have run with more\nassurance.  They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees.  There would he\nhang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would\ngo back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftness that\nhardly could one overtake him with running; and then, to exercise his\nbreast and lungs, he would shout like all the devils in hell.  I heard him\nonce call Eudemon from St. Victor's gate to Montmartre.  Stentor had never\nsuch a voice at the siege of Troy.  Then for the strengthening of his\nnerves or sinews they made him two great sows of lead, each of them\nweighing eight thousand and seven hundred quintals, which they called\nalteres.  Those he took up from the ground, in each hand one, then lifted\nthem up over his head, and held them so without stirring three quarters of\nan hour and more, which was an inimitable force.  He fought at barriers\nwith the stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when it came to the\ncope, he stood so sturdily on his feet that he abandoned himself unto the\nstrongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as Milo was wont\nto do of old.  In whose imitation, likewise, he held a pomegranate in his\nhand, to give it unto him that could take it from him.  The time being thus\nbestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, and refreshed with other\nclothes, he returned fair and softly; and passing through certain meadows,\nor other grassy places, beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with\nwhat is written of them in the books of the ancients, such as Theophrast,\nDioscorides, Marinus, Pliny, Nicander, Macer, and Galen, and carried home\nto the house great handfuls of them, whereof a young page called Rizotomos\nhad charge; together with little mattocks, pickaxes, grubbing-hooks,\ncabbies, pruning-knives, and other instruments requisite for herborizing.\nBeing come to their lodging, whilst supper was making ready, they repeated\ncertain passages of that which hath been read, and sat down to table.  Here\nremark, that his dinner was sober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to\nprevent the gnawings of his stomach, but his supper was copious and large,\nfor he took then as much as was fit to maintain and nourish him; which,\nindeed, is the true diet prescribed by the art of good and sound physic,\nalthough a rabble of loggerheaded physicians, nuzzeled in the brabbling\nshop of sophisters, counsel the contrary.  During that repast was continued\nthe lesson read at dinner as long as they thought good; the rest was spent\nin good discourse, learned and profitable.  After that they had given\nthanks, he set himself to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious\ninstruments, or otherwise passed his time at some pretty sports, made with\ncards or dice, or in practising the feats of legerdemain with cups and\nballs.  There they stayed some nights in frolicking thus, and making\nthemselves merry till it was time to go to bed; and on other nights they\nwould go make visits unto learned men, or to such as had been travellers in\nstrange and remote countries.  When it was full night before they retired\nthemselves, they went unto the most open place of the house to see the face\nof the sky, and there beheld the comets, if any were, as likewise the\nfigures, situations, aspects, oppositions, and conjunctions of both the\nfixed stars and planets.\n\nThen with his master did he briefly recapitulate, after the manner of the\nPythagoreans, that which he had read, seen, learned, done, and understood\nin the whole course of that day.\n\nThen prayed they unto God the Creator, in falling down before him, and\nstrengthening their faith towards him, and glorifying him for his boundless\nbounty; and, giving thanks unto him for the time that was past, they\nrecommended themselves to his divine clemency for the future.  Which being\ndone, they went to bed, and betook themselves to their repose and rest.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXIV.\n\nHow Gargantua spent his time in rainy weather.\n\nIf it happened that the weather were anything cloudy, foul, and rainy, all\nthe forenoon was employed, as before specified, according to custom, with\nthis difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted to correct\nthe distempers of the air.  But after dinner, instead of their wonted\nexercitations, they did abide within, and, by way of apotherapy (that is, a\nmaking the body healthful by exercise), did recreate themselves in bottling\nup of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood, and in threshing sheaves of corn\nat the barn.  Then they studied the art of painting or carving; or brought\ninto use the antique play of tables, as Leonicus hath written of it, and as\nour good friend Lascaris playeth at it.  In playing they examined the\npassages of ancient authors wherein the said play is mentioned or any\nmetaphor drawn from it.  They went likewise to see the drawing of metals,\nor the casting of great ordnance; how the lapidaries did work; as also the\ngoldsmiths and cutters of precious stones.  Nor did they omit to visit the\nalchemists, money-coiners, upholsterers, weavers, velvet-workers,\nwatchmakers, looking-glass framers, printers, organists, and other such\nkind of artificers, and, everywhere giving them somewhat to drink, did\nlearn and consider the industry and invention of the trades.  They went\nalso to hear the public lectures, the solemn commencements, the\nrepetitions, the acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle lawyers, and\nsermons of evangelical preachers.  He went through the halls and places\nappointed for fencing, and there played against the masters themselves at\nall weapons, and showed them by experience that he knew as much in it as,\nyea, more than, they.  And, instead of herborizing, they visited the shops\nof druggists, herbalists, and apothecaries, and diligently considered the\nfruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds, the grease and ointments of some\nforeign parts, as also how they did adulterate them.  He went to see the\njugglers, tumblers, mountebanks, and quacksalvers, and considered their\ncunning, their shifts, their somersaults and smooth tongue, especially of\nthose of Chauny in Picardy, who are naturally great praters, and brave\ngivers of fibs, in matter of green apes.\n\nAt their return they did eat more soberly at supper than at other times,\nand meats more desiccative and extenuating; to the end that the intemperate\nmoisture of the air, communicated to the body by a necessary confinitive,\nmight by this means be corrected, and that they might not receive any\nprejudice for want of their ordinary bodily exercise.  Thus was Gargantua\ngoverned, and kept on in this course of education, from day to day\nprofiting, as you may understand such a young man of his age may, of a\npregnant judgment, with good discipline well continued.  Which, although at\nthe beginning it seemed difficult, became a little after so sweet, so easy,\nand so delightful, that it seemed rather the recreation of a king than the\nstudy of a scholar.  Nevertheless Ponocrates, to divert him from this\nvehement intension of the spirits, thought fit, once in a month, upon some\nfair and clear day, to go out of the city betimes in the morning, either\ntowards Gentilly, or Boulogne, or to Montrouge, or Charanton bridge, or to\nVanves, or St. Clou, and there spend all the day long in making the\ngreatest cheer that could be devised, sporting, making merry, drinking\nhealths, playing, singing, dancing, tumbling in some fair meadow,\nunnestling of sparrows, taking of quails, and fishing for frogs and crabs.\nBut although that day was passed without books or lecture, yet was it not\nspent without profit; for in the said meadows they usually repeated certain\npleasant verses of Virgil's agriculture, of Hesiod and of Politian's\nhusbandry, would set a-broach some witty Latin epigrams, then immediately\nturned them into roundelays and songs for dancing in the French language.\nIn their feasting they would sometimes separate the water from the wine\nthat was therewith mixed, as Cato teacheth, De re rustica, and Pliny with\nan ivy cup would wash the wine in a basinful of water, then take it out\nagain with a funnel as pure as ever.  They made the water go from one glass\nto another, and contrived a thousand little automatory engines, that is to\nsay, moving of themselves.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXV.\n\nHow there was great strife and debate raised betwixt the cake-bakers of\nLerne, and those of Gargantua's country, whereupon were waged great wars.\n\nAt that time, which was the season of vintage, in the beginning of harvest,\nwhen the country shepherds were set to keep the vines, and hinder the\nstarlings from eating up the grapes, as some cake-bakers of Lerne happened\nto pass along in the broad highway, driving into the city ten or twelve\nhorses loaded with cakes, the said shepherds courteously entreated them to\ngive them some for their money, as the price then ruled in the market.  For\nhere it is to be remarked, that it is a celestial food to eat for breakfast\nhot fresh cakes with grapes, especially the frail clusters, the great red\ngrapes, the muscadine, the verjuice grape, and the laskard, for those that\nare costive in their belly, because it will make them gush out, and squirt\nthe length of a hunter's staff, like the very tap of a barrel; and\noftentimes, thinking to let a squib, they did all-to-besquatter and\nconskite themselves, whereupon they are commonly called the vintage\nthinkers.  The bun-sellers or cake-makers were in nothing inclinable to\ntheir request; but, which was worse, did injure them most outrageously,\ncalling them prattling gabblers, lickorous gluttons, freckled bittors, mangy\nrascals, shite-a-bed scoundrels, drunken roysters, sly knaves, drowsy\nloiterers, slapsauce fellows, slabberdegullion druggels, lubberly louts,\ncozening foxes, ruffian rogues, paltry customers, sycophant-varlets,\ndrawlatch hoydens, flouting milksops, jeering companions, staring clowns,\nforlorn snakes, ninny lobcocks, scurvy sneaksbies, fondling fops, base\nloons, saucy coxcombs, idle lusks, scoffing braggarts, noddy meacocks,\nblockish grutnols, doddipol-joltheads, jobbernol goosecaps, foolish\nloggerheads, flutch calf-lollies, grouthead gnat-snappers, lob-dotterels,\ngaping changelings, codshead loobies, woodcock slangams, ninny-hammer\nflycatchers, noddypeak simpletons, turdy gut, shitten shepherds, and other\nsuchlike defamatory epithets; saying further, that it was not for them to\neat of these dainty cakes, but might very well content themselves with the\ncoarse unranged bread, or to eat of the great brown household loaf.  To\nwhich provoking words, one amongst them, called Forgier, an honest fellow\nof his person and a notable springal, made answer very calmly thus:  How\nlong is it since you have got horns, that you are become so proud?  Indeed\nformerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us\nhave any for our money?  This is not the part of good neighbours, neither\ndo we serve you thus when you come hither to buy our good corn, whereof you\nmake your cakes and buns.  Besides that, we would have given you to the\nbargain some of our grapes, but, by his zounds, you may chance to repent\nit, and possibly have need of us at another time, when we shall use you\nafter the like manner, and therefore remember it.  Then Marquet, a prime\nman in the confraternity of the cake-bakers, said unto him, Yea, sir, thou\nart pretty well crest-risen this morning, thou didst eat yesternight too\nmuch millet and bolymong.  Come hither, sirrah, come hither, I will give\nthee some cakes.  Whereupon Forgier, dreading no harm, in all simplicity\nwent towards him, and drew a sixpence out of his leather satchel, thinking\nthat Marquet would have sold him some of his cakes.  But, instead of cakes,\nhe gave him with his whip such a rude lash overthwart the legs, that the\nmarks of the whipcord knots were apparent in them, then would have fled\naway; but Forgier cried out as loud as he could, O, murder, murder, help,\nhelp, help! and in the meantime threw a great cudgel after him, which he\ncarried under his arm, wherewith he hit him in the coronal joint of his\nhead, upon the crotaphic artery of the right side thereof, so forcibly,\nthat Marquet fell down from his mare more like a dead than living man.\nMeanwhile the farmers and country swains, that were watching their walnuts\nnear to that place, came running with their great poles and long staves,\nand laid such load on these cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh upon\ngreen rye.  The other shepherds and shepherdesses, hearing the lamentable\nshout of Forgier, came with their slings and slackies following them, and\nthrowing great stones at them, as thick as if it had been hail.  At last\nthey overtook them, and took from them about four or five dozen of their\ncakes.  Nevertheless they paid for them the ordinary price, and gave them\nover and above one hundred eggs and three baskets full of mulberries.  Then\ndid the cake-bakers help to get up to his mare Marquet, who was most\nshrewdly wounded, and forthwith returned to Lerne, changing the resolution\nthey had to go to Pareille, threatening very sharp and boisterously the\ncowherds, shepherds, and farmers of Seville and Sinays.  This done, the\nshepherds and shepherdesses made merry with these cakes and fine grapes,\nand sported themselves together at the sound of the pretty small pipe,\nscoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day\nmet with a mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the\nmorning.  Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fair great red\nmedicinal grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was\nquickly cured.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXVI.\n\nHow the inhabitants of Lerne, by the commandment of Picrochole their king,\nassaulted the shepherds of Gargantua unexpectedly and on a sudden.\n\nThe cake-bakers, being returned to Lerne, went presently, before they did\neither eat or drink, to the Capitol, and there before their king, called\nPicrochole, the third of that name, made their complaint, showing their\npanniers broken, their caps all crumpled, their coats torn, their cakes\ntaken away, but, above all, Marquet most enormously wounded, saying that\nall that mischief was done by the shepherds and herdsmen of Grangousier,\nnear the broad highway beyond Seville.  Picrochole incontinent grew angry\nand furious; and, without asking any further what, how, why, or wherefore,\ncommanded the ban and arriere ban to be sounded throughout all his country,\nthat all his vassals of what condition soever should, upon pain of the\nhalter, come, in the best arms they could, unto the great place before the\ncastle, at the hour of noon, and, the better to strengthen his design, he\ncaused the drum to be beat about the town.  Himself, whilst his dinner was\nmaking ready, went to see his artillery mounted upon the carriage, to\ndisplay his colours, and set up the great royal standard, and loaded wains\nwith store of ammunition both for the field and the belly, arms and\nvictuals.  At dinner he despatched his commissions, and by his express\nedict my Lord Shagrag was appointed to command the vanguard, wherein were\nnumbered sixteen thousand and fourteen arquebusiers or firelocks, together\nwith thirty thousand and eleven volunteer adventurers.  The great\nTouquedillon, master of the horse, had the charge of the ordnance, wherein\nwere reckoned nine hundred and fourteen brazen pieces, in cannons, double\ncannons, basilisks, serpentines, culverins, bombards or murderers, falcons,\nbases or passevolins, spirols, and other sorts of great guns.  The\nrearguard was committed to the Duke of Scrapegood.  In the main battle was\nthe king and the princes of his kingdom.  Thus being hastily furnished,\nbefore they would set forward, they sent three hundred light horsemen,\nunder the conduct of Captain Swillwind, to discover the country, clear the\navenues, and see whether there was any ambush laid for them.  But, after\nthey had made diligent search, they found all the land round about in peace\nand quiet, without any meeting or convention at all; which Picrochole\nunderstanding, commanded that everyone should march speedily under his\ncolours.  Then immediately in all disorder, without keeping either rank or\nfile, they took the fields one amongst another, wasting, spoiling,\ndestroying, and making havoc of all wherever they went, not sparing poor\nnor rich, privileged or unprivileged places, church nor laity, drove away\noxen and cows, bulls, calves, heifers, wethers, ewes, lambs, goats, kids,\nhens, capons, chickens, geese, ganders, goslings, hogs, swine, pigs, and\nsuch like; beating down the walnuts, plucking the grapes, tearing the\nhedges, shaking the fruit-trees, and committing such incomparable abuses,\nthat the like abomination was never heard of.  Nevertheless, they met with\nnone to resist them, for everyone submitted to their mercy, beseeching them\nthat they might be dealt with courteously in regard that they had always\ncarried themselves as became good and loving neighbours, and that they had\nnever been guilty of any wrong or outrage done upon them, to be thus\nsuddenly surprised, troubled, and disquieted, and that, if they would not\ndesist, God would punish them very shortly.  To which expostulations and\nremonstrances no other answer was made, but that they would teach them to\neat cakes.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXVII.\n\nHow a monk of Seville saved the close of the abbey from being ransacked by\nthe enemy.\n\nSo much they did, and so far they went pillaging and stealing, that at last\nthey came to Seville, where they robbed both men and women, and took all\nthey could catch:  nothing was either too hot or too heavy for them.\nAlthough the plague was there in the most part of all the houses, they\nnevertheless entered everywhere, then plundered and carried away all that\nwas within, and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a\nmost wonderful case.  For the curates, vicars, preachers, physicians,\nchirurgeons, and apothecaries, who went to visit, to dress, to cure, to\nheal, to preach unto and admonish those that were sick, were all dead of\nthe infection, and these devilish robbers and murderers caught never any\nharm at all.  Whence comes this to pass, my masters?  I beseech you think\nupon it.  The town being thus pillaged, they went unto the abbey with a\nhorrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against\nthem.  Whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a pass or\nford called the Gue de Vede, except seven companies of foot and two hundred\nlancers, who, staying there, broke down the walls of the close, to waste,\nspoil, and make havoc of all the vines and vintage within that place.  The\nmonks (poor devils) knew not in that extremity to which of all their sancts\nthey should vow themselves.  Nevertheless, at all adventures they rang the\nbells ad capitulum capitulantes.  There it was decreed that they should\nmake a fair procession, stuffed with good lectures, prayers, and litanies\ncontra hostium insidias, and jolly responses pro pace.\n\nThere was then in the abbey a claustral monk, called Friar John of the\nfunnels and gobbets, in French des entoumeures, young, gallant, frisk,\nlusty, nimble, quick, active, bold, adventurous, resolute, tall, lean,\nwide-mouthed, long-nosed, a fair despatcher of morning prayers, unbridler\nof masses, and runner over of vigils; and, to conclude summarily in a word,\na right monk, if ever there was any, since the monking world monked a\nmonkery:  for the rest, a clerk even to the teeth in matter of breviary.\nThis monk, hearing the noise that the enemy made within the enclosure of\nthe vineyard, went out to see what they were doing; and perceiving that\nthey were cutting and gathering  the grapes, whereon was grounded the\nfoundation of all their next year's wine, returned unto the choir of the\nchurch where the other monks were, all amazed and astonished like so many\nbell-melters.  Whom when he heard sing, im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nene,\ntum, ne, num, num, ini, i mi, co, o, no, o, o, neno, ne, no, no, no, rum,\nnenum, num:  It is well shit, well sung, said he.  By the virtue of God,\nwhy do not you sing, Panniers, farewell, vintage is done?  The devil snatch\nme, if they be not already within the middle of our close, and cut so well\nboth vines and grapes, that, by Cod's body, there will not be found for\nthese four years to come so much as a gleaning in it.  By the belly of\nSanct James, what shall we poor devils drink the while?  Lord God! da mihi\npotum.  Then said the prior of the convent:  What should this drunken\nfellow do here? let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine\nservice.  Nay, said the monk, the wine service, let us behave ourselves so\nthat it be not troubled; for you yourself, my lord prior, love to drink of\nthe best, and so doth every honest man.  Never yet did a man of worth\ndislike good wine, it is a monastical apophthegm.  But these responses that\nyou chant here, by G--, are not in season.  Wherefore is it, that our\ndevotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage,\nand long in the advent, and all the winter?  The late friar, Massepelosse,\nof good memory, a true zealous man, or else I give myself to the devil, of\nour religion, told me, and I remember it well, how the reason was, that in\nthis season we might press and make the wine, and in winter whiff it up.\nHark you, my masters, you that love the wine, Cop's body, follow me; for\nSanct Anthony burn me as freely as a faggot, if they get leave to taste one\ndrop of the liquor that will not now come and fight for relief of the vine.\nHog's belly, the goods of the church!  Ha, no, no.  What the devil, Sanct\nThomas of England was well content to die for them; if I died in the same\ncause, should not I be a sanct likewise?  Yes.  Yet shall not I die there\nfor all this, for it is I that must do it to others and send them\na-packing.\n\nAs he spake this he threw off his great monk's habit, and laid hold upon\nthe staff of the cross, which was made of the heart of a sorbapple-tree, it\nbeing of the length of a lance, round, of a full grip, and a little\npowdered with lilies called flower de luce, the workmanship whereof was\nalmost all defaced and worn out.  Thus went he out in a fair long-skirted\njacket, putting his frock scarfwise athwart his breast, and in this\nequipage, with his staff, shaft or truncheon of the cross, laid on so\nlustily, brisk, and fiercely upon his enemies, who, without any order, or\nensign, or trumpet, or drum, were busied in gathering the grapes of the\nvineyard.  For the cornets, guidons, and ensign-bearers had laid down their\nstandards, banners, and colours by the wall sides:  the drummers had\nknocked out the heads of their drums on one end to fill them with grapes:\nthe trumpeters were loaded with great bundles of bunches and huge knots of\nclusters:  in sum, everyone of them was out of array, and all in disorder.\nHe hurried, therefore, upon them so rudely, without crying gare or beware,\nthat he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled them over like swine, striking\nathwart and alongst, and by one means or other laid so about him, after the\nold fashion of fencing, that to some he beat out their brains, to others he\ncrushed their arms, battered their legs, and bethwacked their sides till\ntheir ribs cracked with it.  To others again he unjointed the spondyles or\nknuckles of the neck, disfigured their chaps, gashed their faces, made\ntheir cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and so swinged and balammed them\nthat they fell down before him like hay before a mower.  To some others he\nspoiled the frame of their kidneys, marred their backs, broke their\nthigh-bones, pashed in their noses, poached out their eyes, cleft their\nmandibles, tore their jaws, dung in their teeth into their throat, shook\nasunder their omoplates or shoulder-blades, sphacelated their shins,\nmortified their shanks, inflamed their ankles, heaved off of the hinges\ntheir ishies, their sciatica or hip-gout, dislocated the joints of their\nknees, squattered into pieces the boughts or pestles of their thighs, and\nso thumped, mauled and belaboured them everywhere, that never was corn so\nthick and threefold threshed upon by ploughmen's flails as were the\npitifully disjointed members of their mangled bodies under the merciless\nbaton of the cross.  If any offered to hide himself amongst the thickest of\nthe vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge of his back,\nand dashed his reins like a dog.  If any thought by flight to escape, he\nmade his head to fly in pieces by the lamboidal commissure, which is a seam\nin the hinder part of the skull.  If anyone did scramble up into a tree,\nthinking there to be safe, he rent up his perinee, and impaled him in at\nthe fundament.  If any of his old acquaintance happened to cry out, Ha,\nFriar John, my friend Friar John, quarter, quarter, I yield myself to you,\nto you I render myself!  So thou shalt, said he, and must, whether thou\nwouldst or no, and withal render and yield up thy soul to all the devils in\nhell; then suddenly gave them dronos, that is, so many knocks, thumps,\nraps, dints, thwacks, and bangs, as sufficed to warn Pluto of their coming\nand despatch them a-going.  If any was so rash and full of temerity as to\nresist him to his face, then was it he did show the strength of his\nmuscles, for without more ado he did transpierce him, by running him in at\nthe breast, through the mediastine and the heart.  Others, again, he so\nquashed and bebumped, that, with a sound bounce under the hollow of their\nshort ribs, he overturned their stomachs so that they died immediately.  To\nsome, with a smart souse on the epigaster, he would make their midriff\nswag, then, redoubling the blow, gave them such a homepush on the navel\nthat he made their puddings to gush out.  To others through their ballocks\nhe pierced their bumgut, and left not bowel, tripe, nor entrail in their\nbody that had not felt the impetuosity, fierceness, and fury of his\nviolence.  Believe, that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one\nsaw.  Some cried unto Sanct Barbe, others to St. George.  O the holy Lady\nNytouch, said one, the good Sanctess; O our Lady of Succours, said another,\nhelp, help!  Others cried, Our Lady of Cunaut, of Loretto, of Good Tidings,\non the other side of the water St. Mary Over.  Some vowed a pilgrimage to\nSt. James, and others to the holy handkerchief at Chamberry, which three\nmonths after that burnt so well in the fire that they could not get one\nthread of it saved.  Others sent up their vows to St. Cadouin, others to\nSt. John d'Angely, and to St. Eutropius of Xaintes.  Others again invoked\nSt. Mesmes of Chinon, St. Martin of Candes, St. Clouaud of Sinays, the holy\nrelics of Laurezay, with a thousand other jolly little sancts and santrels.\nSome died without speaking, others spoke without dying; some died in\nspeaking, others spoke in dying.  Others shouted as loud as they could\nConfession, Confession, Confiteor, Miserere, In manus!  So great was the\ncry of the wounded, that the prior of the abbey with all his monks came\nforth, who, when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the vines,\nand wounded to death, confessed some of them.  But whilst the priests were\nbusied in confessing them, the little monkies ran all to the place where\nFriar John was, and asked him wherein he would be pleased to require their\nassistance.  To which he answered that they should cut the throats of those\nhe had thrown down upon the ground.  They presently, leaving their outer\nhabits and cowls upon the rails, began to throttle and make an end of those\nwhom he had already crushed.  Can you tell with what instruments they did\nit?  With fair gullies, which are little hulchbacked demi-knives, the iron\ntool whereof is two inches long, and the wooden handle one inch thick, and\nthree inches in length, wherewith the little boys in our country cut ripe\nwalnuts in two while they are yet in the shell, and pick out the kernel,\nand they found them very fit for the expediting of that weasand-slitting\nexploit.  In the meantime Friar John, with his formidable baton of the\ncross, got to the breach which the enemies had made, and there stood to\nsnatch up those that endeavoured to escape.  Some of the monkitos carried\nthe standards, banners, ensigns, guidons, and colours into their cells and\nchambers to make garters of them.  But when those that had been shriven\nwould have gone out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy monk quashed\nand felled them down with blows, saying, These men have had confession and\nare penitent souls; they have got their absolution and gained the pardons;\nthey go into paradise as straight as a sickle, or as the way is to Faye\n(like Crooked-Lane at Eastcheap).  Thus by his prowess and valour were\ndiscomfited all those of the army that entered into the close of the abbey,\nunto the number of thirteen thousand, six hundred, twenty and two, besides\nthe women and little children, which is always to be understood.  Never did\nMaugis the Hermit bear himself more valiantly with his bourdon or pilgrim's\nstaff against the Saracens, of whom is written in the Acts of the four sons\nof Aymon, than did this monk against his enemies with the staff of the\ncross.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXVIII.\n\nHow Picrochole stormed and took by assault the rock Clermond, and of\nGrangousier's unwillingness and aversion from the undertaking of war.\n\nWhilst the monk did thus skirmish, as we have said, against those which\nwere entered within the close, Picrochole in great haste passed the ford of\nVede--a very especial pass--with all his soldiers, and set upon the rock\nClermond, where there was made him no resistance at all; and, because it\nwas already night, he resolved to quarter himself and his army in that\ntown, and to refresh himself of his pugnative choler.  In the morning he\nstormed and took the bulwarks and castle, which afterwards he fortified\nwith rampiers, and furnished with all ammunition requisite, intending to\nmake his retreat there, if he should happen to be otherwise worsted; for it\nwas a strong place, both by art and nature, in regard of the stance and\nsituation of it.  But let us leave them there, and return to our good\nGargantua, who is at Paris very assiduous and earnest at the study of good\nletters and athletical exercitations, and to the good old man Grangousier\nhis father, who after supper warmeth his ballocks by a good, clear, great\nfire, and, waiting upon the broiling of some chestnuts, is very serious in\ndrawing scratches on the hearth, with a stick burnt at the one end,\nwherewith they did stir up the fire, telling to his wife and the rest of\nthe family pleasant old stories and tales of former times.\n\nWhilst he was thus employed, one of the shepherds which did keep the vines,\nnamed Pillot, came towards him, and to the full related the enormous abuses\nwhich were committed, and the excessive spoil that was made by Picrochole,\nKing of Lerne, upon his lands and territories, and how he had pillaged,\nwasted, and ransacked all the country, except the enclosure at Seville,\nwhich Friar John des Entoumeures to his great honour had preserved; and\nthat at the same present time the said king was in the rock Clermond, and\nthere, with great industry and circumspection, was strengthening himself\nand his whole army.  Halas, halas, alas! said Grangousier, what is this,\ngood people?  Do I dream, or is it true that they tell me?  Picrochole, my\nancient friend of old time, of my own kindred and alliance, comes he to\ninvade me?  What moves him?  What provokes him?  What sets him on?  What\ndrives him to it?  Who hath given him this counsel?  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, my\nGod, my Saviour, help me, inspire me, and advise me what I shall do!  I\nprotest, I swear before thee, so be thou favourable to me, if ever I did\nhim or his subjects any damage or displeasure, or committed any the least\nrobbery in his country; but, on the contrary, I have succoured and supplied\nhim with men, money, friendship, and counsel, upon any occasion wherein I\ncould be steadable for the improvement of his good.  That he hath therefore\nat this nick of time so outraged and wronged me, it cannot be but by the\nmalevolent and wicked spirit.  Good God, thou knowest my courage, for\nnothing can be hidden from thee.  If perhaps he be grown mad, and that thou\nhast sent him hither to me for the better recovery and re-establishment of\nhis brain, grant me power and wisdom to bring him to the yoke of thy holy\nwill by good discipline.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, my good people, my friends and my\nfaithful servants, must I hinder you from helping me?  Alas, my old age\nrequired hence-forward nothing else but rest, and all the days of my life I\nhave laboured for nothing so much as peace; but now I must, I see it well,\nload with arms my poor, weary, and feeble shoulders, and take in my\ntrembling hand the lance and horseman's mace, to succour and protect my\nhonest subjects.  Reason will have it so; for by their labour am I\nentertained, and with their sweat am I nourished, I, my children and my\nfamily.  This notwithstanding, I will not undertake war, until I have first\ntried all the ways and means of peace:  that I resolve upon.\n\nThen assembled he his council, and proposed the matter as it was indeed.\nWhereupon it was concluded that they should send some discreet man unto\nPicrochole, to know wherefore he had thus suddenly broken the peace and\ninvaded those lands unto which he had no right nor title.  Furthermore,\nthat they should send for Gargantua, and those under his command, for the\npreservation of the country, and defence thereof now at need.  All this\npleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that so it should be done.\nPresently therefore he sent the Basque his lackey to fetch Gargantua with\nall diligence, and wrote him as followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXIX.\n\nThe tenour of the letter which Grangousier wrote to his son Gargantua.\n\nThe fervency of thy studies did require that I should not in a long time\nrecall thee from that philosophical rest thou now enjoyest, if the\nconfidence reposed in our friends and ancient confederates had not at this\npresent disappointed the assurance of my old age.  But seeing such is my\nfatal destiny, that I should be now disquieted by those in whom I trusted\nmost, I am forced to call thee back to help the people and goods which by\nthe right of nature belong unto thee.  For even as arms are weak abroad, if\nthere be not counsel at home, so is that study vain and counsel\nunprofitable which in a due and convenient time is not by virtue executed\nand put in effect.  My deliberation is not to provoke, but to appease--not\nto assault, but to defend--not to conquer, but to preserve my faithful\nsubjects and hereditary dominions, into which Picrochole is entered in a\nhostile manner without any ground or cause, and from day to day pursueth\nhis furious enterprise with that height of insolence that is intolerable to\nfreeborn spirits.  I have endeavoured to moderate his tyrannical choler,\noffering him all that which I thought might give him satisfaction; and\noftentimes have I sent lovingly unto him to understand wherein, by whom,\nand how he found himself to be wronged.  But of him could I obtain no other\nanswer but a mere defiance, and that in my lands he did pretend only to the\nright of a civil correspondency and good behaviour, whereby I knew that the\neternal God hath left him to the disposure of his own free will and sensual\nappetite--which cannot choose but be wicked, if by divine grace it be not\ncontinually guided--and to contain him within his duty, and bring him to\nknow himself, hath sent him hither to me by a grievous token.  Therefore,\nmy beloved son, as soon as thou canst, upon sight of these letters, repair\nhither with all diligence, to succour not me so much, which nevertheless by\nnatural piety thou oughtest to do, as thine own people, which by reason\nthou mayest save and preserve.  The exploit shall be done with as little\neffusion of blood as may be.  And, if possible, by means far more\nexpedient, such as military policy, devices, and stratagems of war, we\nshall save all the souls, and send them home as merry as crickets unto\ntheir own houses.  My dearest son, the peace of Jesus Christ our Redeemer\nbe with thee.  Salute from me Ponocrates, Gymnastes, and Eudemon.  The\ntwentieth of September.\nThy Father Grangousier.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXX.\n\nHow Ulric Gallet was sent unto Picrochole.\n\nThe letters being dictated, signed, and sealed, Grangousier ordained that\nUlric Gallet, master of the requests, a very wise and discreet man, of\nwhose prudence and sound judgment he had made trial in several difficult\nand debateful matters, (should) go unto Picrochole, to show what had been\ndecreed amongst them.  At the same hour departed the good man Gallet, and\nhaving passed the ford, asked at the miller that dwelt there in what\ncondition Picrochole was:  who answered him that his soldiers had left him\nneither cock nor hen, that they were retired and shut up into the rock\nClermond, and that he would not advise him to go any further for fear of\nthe scouts, because they were enormously furious.  Which he easily\nbelieved, and therefore lodged that night with the miller.\n\nThe next morning he went with a trumpeter to the gate of the castle, and\nrequired the guards he might be admitted to speak with the king of somewhat\nthat concerned him.  These words being told unto the king, he would by no\nmeans consent that they should open the gate; but, getting upon the top of\nthe bulwark, said unto the ambassador, What is the news, what have you to\nsay?  Then the ambassador began to speak as followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXI.\n\nThe speech made by Gallet to Picrochole.\n\nThere cannot arise amongst men a juster cause of grief than when they\nreceive hurt and damage where they may justly expect for favour and good\nwill; and not without cause, though without reason, have many, after they\nhad fallen into such a calamitous accident, esteemed this indignity less\nsupportable than the loss of their own lives, in such sort that, if they\nhave not been able by force of arms nor any other means, by reach of wit or\nsubtlety, to stop them in their course and restrain their fury, they have\nfallen into desperation, and utterly deprived themselves of this light.  It\nis therefore no wonder if King Grangousier, my master, be full of high\ndispleasure and much disquieted in mind upon thy outrageous and hostile\ncoming; but truly it would be a marvel if he were not sensible of and moved\nwith the incomparable abuses and injuries perpetrated by thee and thine\nupon those of his country, towards whom there hath been no example of\ninhumanity omitted.  Which in itself is to him so grievous, for the cordial\naffection wherewith he hath always cherished his subjects, that more it\ncannot be to any mortal man; yet in this, above human apprehension, is it\nto him the more grievous that these wrongs and sad offences have been\ncommitted by thee and thine, who, time out of mind, from all antiquity,\nthou and thy predecessors have been in a continual league and amity with\nhim and all his ancestors; which, even until this time, you have as sacred\ntogether inviolably preserved, kept, and entertained, so well, that not he\nand his only, but the very barbarous nations of the Poictevins, Bretons,\nManceaux, and those that dwell beyond the isles of the Canaries, and that\nof Isabella, have thought it as easy to pull down the firmament, and to set\nup the depths above the clouds, as to make a breach in your alliance; and\nhave been so afraid of it in their enterprises that they have never dared\nto provoke, incense, or endamage the one for fear of the other.  Nay, which\nis more, this sacred league hath so filled the world, that there are few\nnations at this day inhabiting throughout all the continent and isles of\nthe ocean, who have not ambitiously aspired to be received into it, upon\nyour own covenants and conditions, holding your joint confederacy in as\nhigh esteem as their own territories and dominions, in such sort, that from\nthe memory of man there hath not been either prince or league so wild and\nproud that durst have offered to invade, I say not your countries, but not\nso much as those of your confederates.  And if, by rash and heady counsel,\nthey have attempted any new design against them, as soon as they heard the\nname and title of your alliance, they have suddenly desisted from their\nenterprises.  What rage and madness, therefore, doth now incite thee, all\nold alliance infringed, all amity trod under foot, and all right violated,\nthus in a hostile manner to invade his country, without having been by him\nor his in anything prejudiced, wronged, or provoked?  Where is faith?\nWhere is law?  Where is reason?  Where is humanity?  Where is the fear of\nGod?  Dost thou think that these atrocious abuses are hidden from the\neternal spirit and the supreme God who is the just rewarder of all our\nundertakings?  If thou so think, thou deceivest thyself; for all things\nshall come to pass as in his incomprehensible judgment he hath appointed.\nIs it thy fatal destiny, or influences of the stars, that would put an end\nto thy so long enjoyed ease and rest?  For that all things have their end\nand period, so as that, when they are come to the superlative point of\ntheir greatest height, they are in a trice tumbled down again, as not being\nable to abide long in that state.  This is the conclusion and end of those\nwho cannot by reason and temperance moderate their fortunes and\nprosperities.  But if it be predestinated that thy happiness and ease must\nnow come to an end, must it needs be by wronging my king,--him by whom thou\nwert established?  If thy house must come to ruin, should it therefore in\nits fall crush the heels of him that set it up?  The matter is so\nunreasonable, and so dissonant from common sense, that hardly can it be\nconceived by human understanding, and altogether incredible unto strangers,\ntill by the certain and undoubted effects thereof it be made apparent that\nnothing is either sacred or holy to those who, having emancipated\nthemselves from God and reason, do merely follow the perverse affections of\ntheir own depraved nature.  If any wrong had been done by us to thy\nsubjects and dominions--if we had favoured thy ill-willers--if we had not\nassisted thee in thy need--if thy name and reputation had been wounded by\nus--or, to speak more truly, if the calumniating spirit, tempting to induce\nthee to evil, had, by false illusions and deceitful fantasies, put into thy\nconceit the impression of a thought that we had done unto thee anything\nunworthy of our ancient correspondence and friendship, thou oughtest first\nto have inquired out the truth, and afterwards by a seasonable warning to\nadmonish us thereof; and we should have so satisfied thee, according to\nthine own heart's desire, that thou shouldst have had occasion to be\ncontented.  But, O eternal God, what is thy enterprise?  Wouldst thou, like\na perfidious tyrant, thus spoil and lay waste my master's kingdom?  Hast\nthou found him so silly and blockish, that he would not--or so destitute of\nmen and money, of counsel and skill in military discipline, that he cannot\nwithstand thy unjust invasion?  March hence presently, and to-morrow, some\ntime of the day, retreat unto thine own country, without doing any kind of\nviolence or disorderly act by the way; and pay withal a thousand besans of\ngold (which, in English money, amounteth to five thousand pounds), for\nreparation of the damages thou hast done in this country.  Half thou shalt\npay to-morrow, and the other half at the ides of May next coming, leaving\nwith us in the mean time, for hostages, the Dukes of Turnbank, Lowbuttock,\nand Smalltrash, together with the Prince of Itches and Viscount of\nSnatchbit (Tournemoule, Bas-de-fesses, Menuail, Gratelles, Morpiaille.).\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXII.\n\nHow Grangousier, to buy peace, caused the cakes to be restored.\n\nWith that the good man Gallet held his peace, but Picrochole to all his\ndiscourse answered nothing but Come and fetch them, come and fetch them,\n--they have ballocks fair and soft,--they will knead and provide some cakes\nfor you.  Then returned he to Grangousier, whom he found upon his knees\nbareheaded, crouching in a little corner of his cabinet, and humbly praying\nunto God that he would vouchsafe to assuage the choler of Picrochole, and\nbring him to the rule of reason without proceeding by force.  When the good\nman came back, he asked him, Ha, my friend, what news do you bring me?\nThere is neither hope nor remedy, said Gallet; the man is quite out of his\nwits, and forsaken of God.  Yea, but, said Grangousier, my friend, what\ncause doth he pretend for his outrages?  He did not show me any cause at\nall, said Gallet, only that in a great anger he spoke some words of cakes.\nI cannot tell if they have done any wrong to his cake-bakers.  I will know,\nsaid Grangousier, the matter thoroughly, before I resolve any more upon\nwhat is to be done.  Then sent he to learn concerning that business, and\nfound by true information that his men had taken violently some cakes from\nPicrochole's people, and that Marquet's head was broken with a slacky or\nshort cudgel; that, nevertheless, all was well paid, and that the said\nMarquet had first hurt Forgier with a stroke of his whip athwart the legs.\nAnd it seemed good to his whole council, that he should defend himself with\nall his might.  Notwithstanding all this, said Grangousier, seeing the\nquestion is but about a few cakes, I will labour to content him; for I am\nvery unwilling to wage war against him.  He inquired then what quantity of\ncakes they had taken away, and understanding that it was but some four or\nfive dozen, he commanded five cartloads of them to be baked that same\nnight; and that there should be one full of cakes made with fine butter,\nfine yolks of eggs, fine saffron, and fine spice, to be bestowed upon\nMarquet, unto whom likewise he directed to be given seven hundred thousand\nand three Philips (that is, at three shillings the piece, one hundred five\nthousand pounds and nine shillings of English money), for reparation of his\nlosses and hindrances, and for satisfaction of the chirurgeon that had\ndressed his wound; and furthermore settled upon him and his for ever in\nfreehold the apple-orchard called La Pomardiere.  For the conveyance and\npassing of all which was sent Gallet, who by the way as they went made them\ngather near the willow-trees great store of boughs, canes, and reeds,\nwherewith all the carriers were enjoined to garnish and deck their carts,\nand each of them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby\nto give all men to understand that they demanded but peace, and that they\ncame to buy it.\n\nBeing come to the gate, they required to speak with Picrochole from\nGrangousier.  Picrochole would not so much as let them in, nor go to speak\nwith them, but sent them word that he was busy, and that they should\ndeliver their mind to Captain Touquedillon, who was then planting a piece\nof ordnance upon the wall.  Then said the good man unto him, My lord, to\nease you of all this labour, and to take away all excuses why you may not\nreturn unto our former alliance, we do here presently restore unto you the\ncakes upon which the quarrel arose.  Five dozen did our people take away:\nthey were well paid for:  we love peace so well that we restore unto you\nfive cartloads, of which this cart shall be for Marquet, who doth most\ncomplain.  Besides, to content him entirely, here are seven hundred\nthousand and three Philips, which I deliver to him, and, for the losses he\nmay pretend to have sustained, I resign for ever the farm of the\nPomardiere, to be possessed in fee-simple by him and his for ever, without\nthe payment of any duty, or acknowledgement of homage, fealty, fine, or\nservice whatsoever, and here is the tenour of the deed.  And, for God's\nsake, let us live henceforward in peace, and withdraw yourselves merrily\ninto your own country from within this place, unto which you have no right\nat all, as yourselves must needs confess, and let us be good friends as\nbefore.  Touquedillon related all this to Picrochole, and more and more\nexasperated his courage, saying to him, These clowns are afraid to some\npurpose.  By G--, Grangousier conskites himself for fear, the poor drinker.\nHe is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he any stomach for it.  He knows\nbetter how to empty the flagons,--that is his art.  I am of opinion that it\nis fit we send back the carts and the money, and, for the rest, that very\nspeedily we fortify ourselves here, then prosecute our fortune.  But what!\nDo they think to have to do with a ninnywhoop, to feed you thus with cakes?\nYou may see what it is.  The good usage and great familiarity which you\nhave had with them heretofore hath made you contemptible in their eyes.\nAnoint a villain, he will prick you:  prick a villain, and he will anoint\nyou (Ungentem pungit, pungentem rusticus ungit.).\n\nSa, sa, sa, said Picrochole, by St. James you have given a true character\nof them.  One thing I will advise you, said Touquedillon.  We are here but\nbadly victualled, and furnished with mouth-harness very slenderly.  If\nGrangousier should come to besiege us, I would go presently, and pluck out\nof all your soldiers' heads and mine own all the teeth, except three to\neach of us, and with them alone we should make an end of our provision but\ntoo soon.  We shall have, said Picrochole, but too much sustenance and\nfeeding-stuff.  Came we hither to eat or to fight?  To fight, indeed, said\nTouquedillon; yet from the paunch comes the dance, and where famine rules\nforce is exiled.  Leave off your prating, said Picrochole, and forthwith\nseize upon what they have brought.  Then took they money and cakes, oxen\nand carts, and sent them away without speaking one word, only that they\nwould come no more so near, for a reason that they would give them the\nmorrow after.  Thus, without doing anything, returned they to Grangousier,\nand related the whole matter unto him, subjoining that there was no hope\nleft to draw them to peace but by sharp and fierce wars.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXIII.\n\nHow some statesmen of Picrochole, by hairbrained counsel, put him in\nextreme danger.\n\nThe carts being unloaded, and the money and cakes secured, there came\nbefore Picrochole the Duke of Smalltrash, the Earl Swashbuckler, and\nCaptain Dirt-tail (Menuail, Spadassin, Merdaille.), who said unto him, Sir,\nthis day we make you the happiest, the most warlike and chivalrous prince\nthat ever was since the death of Alexander of Macedonia.  Be covered, be\ncovered, said Picrochole.  Gramercy, said they, we do but our duty.  The\nmanner is thus.  You shall leave some captain here to have the charge of\nthis garrison, with a party competent for keeping of the place, which,\nbesides its natural strength, is made stronger by the rampiers and\nfortresses of your devising.  Your army you are to divide into two parts,\nas you know very well how to do.  One part thereof shall fall upon\nGrangousier and his forces.  By it shall he be easily at the very first\nshock routed, and then shall you get money by heaps, for the clown hath\nstore of ready coin.  Clown we call him, because a noble and generous\nprince hath never a penny, and that to hoard up treasure is but a clownish\ntrick.  The other part of the army, in the meantime, shall draw towards\nOnys, Xaintonge, Angomois, and Gascony.  Then march to Perigot, Medoc, and\nElanes, taking wherever you come, without resistance, towns, castles, and\nforts; afterwards to Bayonne, St. John de Luc, to Fontarabia, where you\nshall seize upon all the ships, and coasting along Galicia and Portugal,\nshall pillage all the maritime places, even unto Lisbon, where you shall be\nsupplied with all necessaries befitting a conqueror.  By copsody, Spain\nwill yield, for they are but a race of loobies.  Then are you to pass by\nthe Straits of Gibraltar, where you shall erect two pillars more stately\nthan those of Hercules, to the perpetual memory of your name, and the\nnarrow entrance there shall be called the Picrocholinal sea.\n\nHaving passed the Picrocholinal sea, behold, Barbarossa yields himself your\nslave.  I will, said Picrochole, give him fair quarter and spare his life.\nYea, said they, so that he be content to be christened.  And you shall\nconquer the kingdoms of Tunis, of Hippo, Argier, Bomine (Bona), Corone,\nyea, all Barbary.  Furthermore, you shall take into your hands Majorca,\nMinorca, Sardinia, Corsica, with the other islands of the Ligustic and\nBalearian seas.  Going alongst on the left hand, you shall rule all Gallia\nNarbonensis, Provence, the Allobrogians, Genoa, Florence, Lucca, and then\nGod b'w'ye, Rome.  (Our poor Monsieur the Pope dies now for fear.)  By my\nfaith, said Picrochole, I will not then kiss his pantoufle.\n\nItaly being thus taken, behold Naples, Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily, all\nransacked, and Malta too.  I wish the pleasant Knights of the Rhodes\nheretofore would but come to resist you, that we might see their urine.  I\nwould, said Picrochole, very willingly go to Loretto.  No, no, said they,\nthat shall be at our return.  From thence we will sail eastwards, and take\nCandia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and the Cyclade Islands, and set upon (the) Morea.\nIt is ours, by St. Trenian.  The Lord preserve Jerusalem; for the great\nSoldan is not comparable to you in power.  I will then, said he, cause\nSolomon's temple to be built.  No, said they, not yet, have a little\npatience, stay awhile, be never too sudden in your enterprises.  Can you\ntell what Octavian Augustus said?  Festina lente.  It is requisite that you\nfirst have the Lesser Asia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphilia, Cilicia, Lydia,\nPhrygia, Mysia, Bithynia, Carazia, Satalia, Samagaria, Castamena, Luga,\nSavasta, even unto Euphrates.  Shall we see, said Picrochole, Babylon and\nMount Sinai?  There is no need, said they, at this time.  Have we not\nhurried up and down, travelled and toiled enough, in having transfretted\nand passed over the Hircanian sea, marched alongst the two Armenias and the\nthree Arabias?  Ay, by my faith, said he, we have played the fools, and are\nundone.  Ha, poor souls!  What's the matter? said they.  What shall we\nhave, said he, to drink in these deserts?  For Julian Augustus with his\nwhole army died there for thirst, as they say.  We have already, said they,\ngiven order for that.  In the Syriac sea you have nine thousand and\nfourteen great ships laden with the best wines in the world.  They arrived\nat Port Joppa.  There they found two-and-twenty thousand camels and sixteen\nhundred elephants, which you shall have taken at one hunting about\nSigelmes, when you entered into Lybia; and, besides this, you had all the\nMecca caravan.  Did not they furnish you sufficiently with wine?  Yes, but,\nsaid he, we did not drink it fresh.  By the virtue, said they, not of a\nfish, a valiant man, a conqueror, who pretends and aspires to the monarchy\nof the world, cannot always have his ease.  God be thanked that you and\nyour men are come safe and sound unto the banks of the river Tigris.  But,\nsaid he, what doth that part of our army in the meantime which overthrows\nthat unworthy swillpot Grangousier?  They are not idle, said they.  We\nshall meet with them by-and-by.  They shall have won you Brittany,\nNormandy, Flanders, Hainault, Brabant, Artois, Holland, Zealand; they have\npassed the Rhine over the bellies of the Switzers and lansquenets, and a\nparty of these hath subdued Luxembourg, Lorraine, Champagne, and Savoy,\neven to Lyons, in which place they have met with your forces returning from\nthe naval conquests of the Mediterranean sea; and have rallied again in\nBohemia, after they had plundered and sacked Suevia, Wittemberg, Bavaria,\nAustria, Moravia, and Styria.  Then they set fiercely together upon Lubeck,\nNorway, Swedeland, Rie, Denmark, Gitland, Greenland, the Sterlins, even\nunto the frozen sea.  This done, they conquered the Isles of Orkney and\nsubdued Scotland, England, and Ireland.  From thence sailing through the\nsandy sea and by the Sarmates, they have vanquished and overcome Prussia,\nPoland, Lithuania, Russia, Wallachia, Transylvania, Hungary, Bulgaria,\nTurkeyland, and are now at Constantinople.  Come, said Picrochole, let us\ngo join with them quickly, for I will be Emperor of Trebizond also.  Shall\nwe not kill all these dogs, Turks and Mahometans?  What a devil should we\ndo else? said they.  And you shall give their goods and lands to such as\nshall have served you honestly.  Reason, said he, will have it so, that is\nbut just.  I give unto you the Caramania, Suria, and all the Palestine.\nHa, sir, said they, it is out of your goodness; gramercy, we thank you.\nGod grant you may always prosper.  There was there present at that time an\nold gentleman well experienced in the wars, a stern soldier, and who had\nbeen in many great hazards, named Echephron, who, hearing this discourse,\nsaid, I do greatly doubt that all this enterprise will be like the tale or\ninterlude of the pitcher full of milk wherewith a shoemaker made himself\nrich in conceit; but, when the pitcher was broken, he had not whereupon to\ndine.  What do you pretend by these large conquests?  What shall be the end\nof so many labours and crosses?  Thus it shall be, said Picrochole, that\nwhen we are returned we shall sit down, rest, and be merry.  But, said\nEchephron, if by chance you should never come back, for the voyage is long\nand dangerous, were it not better for us to take our rest now, than\nunnecessarily to expose ourselves to so many dangers?  O, said\nSwashbuckler, by G--, here is a good dotard; come, let us go hide ourselves\nin the corner of a chimney, and there spend the whole time of our life\namongst ladies, in threading of pearls, or spinning, like Sardanapalus.  He\nthat nothing ventures hath neither horse nor mule, says Solomon.  He who\nadventureth too much, said Echephron, loseth both horse and mule, answered\nMalchon.  Enough, said Picrochole, go forward.  I fear nothing but that\nthese devilish legions of Grangousier, whilst we are in Mesopotamia, will\ncome on our backs and charge up our rear.  What course shall we then take?\nWhat shall be our remedy?  A very good one, said Dirt-tail; a pretty little\ncommission, which you must send unto the Muscovites, shall bring you into\nthe field in an instant four hundred and fifty thousand choice men of war.\nOh that you would but make me your lieutenant-general, I should for the\nlightest faults of any inflict great punishments.  I fret, I charge, I\nstrike, I take, I kill, I slay, I play the devil.  On, on, said Picrochole,\nmake haste, my lads, and let him that loves me follow me.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXIV.\n\nHow Gargantua left the city of Paris to succour his country, and how\nGymnast encountered with the enemy.\n\nIn this same very hour Gargantua, who was gone out of Paris as soon as he\nhad read his father's letters, coming upon his great mare, had already\npassed the Nunnery-bridge, himself, Ponocrates, Gymnast, and Eudemon, who\nall three, the better to enable them to go along with him, took\npost-horses.  The rest of his train came after him by even journeys at a\nslower pace, bringing with them all his books and philosophical instruments.\nAs soon as he had alighted at Parille, he was informed by a farmer of\nGouguet how Picrochole had fortified himself within the rock Clermond, and\nhad sent Captain Tripet with a great army to set upon the wood of Vede and\nVaugaudry, and that they had already plundered the whole country, not\nleaving cock nor hen, even as far as to the winepress of Billard.  These\nstrange and almost incredible news of the enormous abuses thus committed\nover all the land, so affrighted Gargantua that he knew not what to say nor\ndo.  But Ponocrates counselled him to go unto the Lord of Vauguyon, who at\nall times had been their friend and confederate, and that by him they should\nbe better advised in their business.  Which they did incontinently, and\nfound him very willing and fully resolved to assist them, and therefore was\nof opinion that they should send some one of his company to scout along and\ndiscover the country, to learn in what condition and posture the enemy was,\nthat they might take counsel, and proceed according to the present occasion.\nGymnast offered himself to go.  Whereupon it was concluded, that for his\nsafety and the better expedition, he should have with him someone that knew\nthe ways, avenues, turnings, windings, and rivers thereabout. Then away went\nhe and Prelingot, the equerry or gentleman of Vauguyon's horse, who scouted\nand espied as narrowly as they could upon all quarters without any fear.  In\nthe meantime Gargantua took a little refreshment, ate somewhat himself, the\nlike did those who were with him, and caused to give to his mare a picotine\nof oats, that is, three score and fourteen quarters and three bushels.\nGymnast and his comrade rode so long, that at last they met with the enemy's\nforces, all scattered and out of order, plundering, stealing, robbing, and\npillaging all they could lay their hands on.  And, as far off as they could\nperceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one another in all haste\ntowards him, to unload him of his money, and untruss his portmantles.  Then\ncried he out unto them, My masters, I am a poor devil, I desire you to spare\nme.  I have yet one crown left.  Come, we must drink it, for it is aurum\npotabile, and this horse here shall be sold to pay my welcome.  Afterwards\ntake me for one of your own, for never yet was there any man that knew\nbetter how to take, lard, roast, and dress, yea, by G--, to tear asunder and\ndevour a hen, than I that am here:  and for my proficiat I drink to all good\nfellows.  With that he unscrewed his borracho (which was a great Dutch\nleathern bottle), and without putting in his nose drank very honestly.  The\nmaroufle rogues looked upon him, opening their throats a foot wide, and\nputting out their tongues like greyhounds, in hopes to drink after him; but\nCaptain Tripet, in the very nick of that their expectation, came running to\nhim to see who it was.  To him Gymnast offered his bottle, saying, Hold,\ncaptain, drink boldly and spare not; I have been thy taster, it is wine of\nLa Faye Monjau.  What! said Tripet, this fellow gibes and flouts us?  Who\nart thou? said Tripet.  I am, said Gymnast, a poor devil (pauvre diable).\nHa, said Tripet, seeing thou art a poor devil, it is reason that thou\nshouldst be permitted to go whithersoever thou wilt, for all poor devils\npass everywhere without toll or tax.  But it is not the custom of poor\ndevils to be so well mounted; therefore, sir devil, come down, and let me\nhave your horse, and if he do not carry me well, you, master devil, must do\nit:  for I love a life that such a devil as you should carry me away.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXV.\n\nHow Gymnast very souply and cunningly killed Captain Tripet and others of\nPicrochole's men.\n\nWhen they heard these words, some amongst them began to be afraid, and\nblessed themselves with both hands, thinking indeed that he had been a\ndevil disguised, insomuch that one of them, named Good John, captain of the\ntrained bands of the country bumpkins, took his psalter out of his\ncodpiece, and cried out aloud, Hagios ho theos.  If thou be of God, speak;\nif thou be of the other spirit, avoid hence, and get thee going.  Yet he\nwent not away.  Which words being heard by all the soldiers that were\nthere, divers of them being a little inwardly terrified, departed from the\nplace.  All this did Gymnast very well remark and consider, and therefore\nmaking as if he would have alighted from off his horse, as he was poising\nhimself on the mounting side, he most nimbly, with his short sword by his\nthigh, shifting his foot in the stirrup, performed the stirrup-leather\nfeat, whereby, after the inclining of his body downwards, he forthwith\nlaunched himself aloft in the air, and placed both his feet together on the\nsaddle, standing upright with his back turned towards the horse's head.\nNow, said he, my case goes backward.  Then suddenly in the same very\nposture wherein he was, he fetched a gambol upon one foot, and, turning to\nthe left hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just into its\nformer stance, without missing one jot.  Ha, said Tripet, I will not do\nthat at this time, and not without cause.  Well, said Gymnast, I have\nfailed, I will undo this leap.  Then with a marvellous strength and\nagility, turning towards the right hand, he fetched another frisking gambol\nas before, which done, he set his right-hand thumb upon the hind-bow of the\nsaddle, raised himself up, and sprung in the air, poising and upholding his\nwhole body upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb, and so turned and\nwhirled himself about three times.  At the fourth, reversing his body, and\noverturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching anything,\nhe brought himself betwixt the horse's two ears, springing with all his\nbody into the air, upon the thumb of his left hand, and in that posture,\nturning like a windmill, did most actively do that trick which is called\nthe miller's pass.  After this, clapping his right hand flat upon the\nmiddle of the saddle, he gave himself such a jerking swing that he thereby\nseated himself upon the crupper, after the manner of gentlewomen sitting on\nhorseback.  This done, he easily passed his right leg over the saddle, and\nplaced himself like one that rides in croup.  But, said he, it were better\nfor me to get into the saddle; then putting the thumbs of both hands upon\nthe crupper before him, and thereupon leaning himself, as upon the only\nsupporters of his body, he incontinently turned heels over head in the air,\nand straight found himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a good\nsettlement.  Then with a somersault springing into the air again, he fell\nto stand with both his feet close together upon the saddle, and there made\nabove a hundred frisks, turns, and demipommads, with his arms held out\nacross, and in so doing cried out aloud, I rage, I rage, devils, I am stark\nmad, devils, I am mad, hold me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold!\n\nWhilst he was thus vaulting, the rogues in great astonishment said to one\nanother, By cock's death, he is a goblin or a devil thus disguised.  Ab\nhoste maligno libera nos, Domine, and ran away in a full flight, as if they\nhad been routed, looking now and then behind them, like a dog that carrieth\naway a goose-wing in his mouth.  Then Gymnast, spying his advantage,\nalighted from his horse, drew his sword, and laid on great blows upon the\nthickset and highest crested among them, and overthrew them in great heaps,\nhurt, wounded, and bruised, being resisted by nobody, they thinking he had\nbeen a starved devil, as well in regard of his wonderful feats in vaulting,\nwhich they had seen, as for the talk Tripet had with him, calling him poor\ndevil.  Only Tripet would have traitorously cleft his head with his\nhorseman's sword, or lance-knight falchion; but he was well armed, and felt\nnothing of the blow but the weight of the stroke.  Whereupon, turning\nsuddenly about, he gave Tripet a home-thrust, and upon the back of that,\nwhilst he was about to ward his head from a slash, he ran him in at the\nbreast with a hit, which at once cut his stomach, the fifth gut called the\ncolon, and the half of his liver, wherewith he fell to the ground, and in\nfalling gushed forth above four pottles of pottage, and his soul mingled\nwith the pottage.\n\nThis done, Gymnast withdrew himself, very wisely considering that a case of\ngreat adventure and hazard should not be pursued unto its utmost period,\nand that it becomes all cavaliers modestly to use their good fortune,\nwithout troubling or stretching it too far.  Wherefore, getting to horse,\nhe gave him the spur, taking the right way unto Vauguyon, and Prelinguand\nwith him.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXVI.\n\nHow Gargantua demolished the castle at the ford of Vede, and how they\npassed the ford.\n\nAs soon as he came, he related the estate and condition wherein they had\nfound the enemy, and the stratagem which he alone had used against all\ntheir multitude, affirming that they were but rascally rogues, plunderers,\nthieves, and robbers, ignorant of all military discipline, and that they\nmight boldly set forward unto the field; it being an easy matter to fell\nand strike them down like beasts.  Then Gargantua mounted his great mare,\naccompanied as we have said before, and finding in his way a high and great\ntree, which commonly was called by the name of St. Martin's tree, because\nheretofore St. Martin planted a pilgrim's staff there, which in tract of\ntime grew to that height and greatness, said, This is that which I lacked;\nthis tree shall serve me both for a staff and lance.  With that he pulled\nit up easily, plucked off the boughs, and trimmed it at his pleasure.  In\nthe meantime his mare pissed to ease her belly, but it was in such\nabundance that it did overflow the country seven leagues, and all the piss\nof that urinal flood ran glib away towards the ford of Vede, wherewith the\nwater was so swollen that all the forces the enemy had there were with\ngreat horror drowned, except some who had taken the way on the left hand\ntowards the hills.  Gargantua, being come to the place of the wood of Vede,\nwas informed by Eudemon that there was some remainder of the enemy within\nthe castle, which to know, Gargantua cried out as loud as he was able, Are\nyou there, or are you not there?  If you be there, be there no more; and if\nyou are not there, I have no more to say.  But a ruffian gunner, whose\ncharge was to attend the portcullis over the gate, let fly a cannon-ball at\nhim, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right temple of his\nhead, yet did him no more hurt than if he had but cast a prune or kernel of\na wine-grape at him.  What is this? said Gargantua; do you throw at us\ngrape-kernels here?  The vintage shall cost you dear; thinking indeed that\nthe bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or raisin-kernel.\n\nThose who were within the castle, being till then busy at the pillage, when\nthey heard this noise ran to the towers and fortresses, from whence they\nshot at him above nine thousand and five-and-twenty falconshot and\narquebusades, aiming all at his head, and so thick did they shoot at him\nthat he cried out, Ponocrates, my friend, these flies here are like to put\nout mine eyes; give me a branch of those willow-trees to drive them away,\nthinking that the bullets and stones shot out of the great ordnance had\nbeen but dunflies.  Ponocrates looked and saw that there were no other\nflies but great shot which they had shot from the castle.  Then was it that\nhe rushed with his great tree against the castle, and with mighty blows\noverthrew both towers and fortresses, and laid all level with the ground,\nby which means all that were within were slain and broken in pieces.  Going\nfrom thence, they came to the bridge at the mill, where they found all the\nford covered with dead bodies, so thick that they had choked up the mill\nand stopped the current of its water, and these were those that were\ndestroyed in the urinal deluge of the mare.  There they were at a stand,\nconsulting how they might pass without hindrance by these dead carcasses.\nBut Gymnast said, If the devils have passed there, I will pass well enough.\nThe devils have passed there, said Eudemon, to carry away the damned souls.\nBy St. Treignan! said Ponocrates, then by necessary consequence he shall\npass there.  Yes, yes, said Gymnastes, or I shall stick in the way.  Then\nsetting spurs to his horse, he passed through freely, his horse not fearing\nnor being anything affrighted at the sight of the dead bodies; for he had\naccustomed him, according to the doctrine of Aelian, not to fear armour,\nnor the carcasses of dead men; and that not by killing men as Diomedes did\nthe Thracians, or as Ulysses did in throwing the corpses of his enemies at\nhis horse's feet, as Homer saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent amongst his\nhay, and making him go over it ordinarily when he gave him his oats.  The\nother three followed him very close, except Eudemon only, whose horse's\nfore-right or far forefoot sank up to the knee in the paunch of a great fat\nchuff who lay there upon his back drowned, and could not get it out.  There\nwas he pestered, until Gargantua, with the end of his staff, thrust down\nthe rest of the villain's tripes into the water whilst the horse pulled out\nhis foot; and, which is a wonderful thing in hippiatry, the said horse was\nthoroughly cured of a ringbone which he had in that foot by this touch of\nthe burst guts of that great looby.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXVII.\n\nHow Gargantua, in combing his head, made the great cannon-balls fall out of\nhis hair.\n\nBeing come out of the river of Vede, they came very shortly after to\nGrangousier's castle, who waited for them with great longing.  At their\ncoming they were entertained with many congees, and cherished with\nembraces.  Never was seen a more joyful company, for Supplementum\nSupplementi Chronicorum saith that Gargamelle died there with joy; for my\npart, truly I cannot tell, neither do I care very much for her, nor for\nanybody else.  The truth was, that Gargantua, in shifting his clothes, and\ncombing his head with a comb, which was nine hundred foot long of the\nJewish cane measure, and whereof the teeth were great tusks of elephants,\nwhole and entire, he made fall at every rake above seven balls of bullets,\nat a dozen the ball, that stuck in his hair at the razing of the castle of\nthe wood of Vede.  Which his father Grangousier seeing, thought they had\nbeen lice, and said unto him, What, my dear son, hast thou brought us this\nfar some short-winged hawks of the college of Montague?  I did not mean\nthat thou shouldst reside there.  Then answered Ponocrates, My sovereign\nlord, think not that I have placed him in that lousy college which they\ncall Montague; I had rather have put him amongst the grave-diggers of Sanct\nInnocent, so enormous is the cruelty and villainy that I have known there:\nfor the galley-slaves are far better used amongst the Moors and Tartars,\nthe murderers in the criminal dungeons, yea, the very dogs in your house,\nthan are the poor wretched students in the aforesaid college.  And if I\nwere King of Paris, the devil take me if I would not set it on fire, and\nburn both principal and regents, for suffering this inhumanity to be\nexercised before their eyes.  Then, taking up one of these bullets, he\nsaid, These are cannon-shot, which your son Gargantua hath lately received\nby the treachery of your enemies, as he was passing before the wood of\nVede.\n\nBut they have been so rewarded, that they are all destroyed in the ruin of\nthe castle, as were the Philistines by the policy of Samson, and those whom\nthe tower of Silohim slew, as it is written in the thirteenth of Luke.  My\nopinion is, that we pursue them whilst the luck is on our side; for\noccasion hath all her hair on her forehead; when she is passed, you may not\nrecall her,--she hath no tuft whereby you can lay hold on her, for she is\nbald in the hind-part of her head, and never returneth again.  Truly, said\nGrangousier, it shall not be at this time; for I will make you a feast\nthis night, and bid you welcome.\n\nThis said, they made ready supper, and, of extraordinary besides his daily\nfare, were roasted sixteen oxen, three heifers, two and thirty calves,\nthree score and three fat kids, four score and fifteen wethers, three\nhundred farrow pigs or sheats soused in sweet wine or must, eleven score\npartridges, seven hundred snipes and woodcocks, four hundred Loudun and\nCornwall capons, six thousand pullets, and as many pigeons, six hundred\ncrammed hens, fourteen hundred leverets, or young hares and rabbits, three\nhundred and three buzzards, and one thousand and seven hundred cockerels.\nFor venison, they could not so suddenly come by it, only eleven wild boars,\nwhich the Abbot of Turpenay sent, and eighteen fallow deer which the Lord\nof Gramount bestowed; together with seven score pheasants, which were sent\nby the Lord of Essars; and some dozens of queests, coushats, ringdoves, and\nwoodculvers; river-fowl, teals and awteals, bitterns, courtes, plovers,\nfrancolins, briganders, tyrasons, young lapwings, tame ducks, shovellers,\nwoodlanders, herons, moorhens, criels, storks, canepetiers, oranges,\nflamans, which are phaenicopters, or crimson-winged sea-fowls, terrigoles,\nturkeys, arbens, coots, solan-geese, curlews, termagants, and\nwater-wagtails, with a great deal of cream, curds, and fresh cheese, and\nstore of soup, pottages, and brewis with great variety.  Without doubt there\nwas meat enough, and it was handsomely dressed by Snapsauce, Hotchpot, and\nBrayverjuice, Grangousier's cooks.  Jenkin Trudgeapace and Cleanglass were\nvery careful to fill them drink.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXVIII.\n\nHow Gargantua did eat up six pilgrims in a salad.\n\nThe story requireth that we relate that which happened unto six pilgrims\nwho came from Sebastian near to Nantes, and who for shelter that night,\nbeing afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the garden upon the\nchichling peas, among the cabbages and lettuces.  Gargantua finding himself\nsomewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to make him a salad;\nand hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the country, for\nthey were as great as plum-trees or as walnut-trees, he would go thither\nhimself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal\ncarried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear that they did not\ndare to speak nor cough.\n\nWashing them, therefore, first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to\nanother softly, What shall we do?  We are almost drowned here amongst these\nlettuce, shall we speak?  But if we speak, he will kill us for spies.  And,\nas they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the\nlettuce into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the White\nFriars of the Cistercian order; which done, with oil, vinegar, and salt, he\nate them up, to refresh himself a little before supper, and had already\nswallowed up five of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally\nhid under a lettuce, except his bourdon or staff that appeared, and nothing\nelse.  Which Grangousier seeing, said to Gargantua, I think that is the\nhorn of a shell-snail, do not eat it.  Why not? said Gargantua, they are\ngood all this month:  which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the staff,\nand therewith taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a\nterrible draught of excellent white wine.  The pilgrims, thus devoured,\nmade shift to save themselves as well as they could, by withdrawing their\nbodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not escape\nfrom thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison.  And\nwhen Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drowned\nin his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them away into the\ngulf of his stomach.  Nevertheless, skipping with their bourdons, as St.\nMichael's palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of\nthat inundation under the banks of his teeth.  But one of them by chance,\ngroping or sounding the country with his staff, to try whether they were in\nsafety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the\nmandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw, which put Gargantua to very great\npain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he felt.  To ease himself\ntherefore of his smarting ache, he called for his toothpicker, and rubbing\ntowards a young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled you my\ngentlemen pilgrims.\n\nFor he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, another by the pocket,\nanother by the scarf, another by the band of the breeches, and the poor\nfellow that had hurt him with the bourdon, him he hooked to him by the\ncodpiece, which snatch nevertheless did him a great deal of good, for it\npierced unto him a pocky botch he had in the groin, which grievously\ntormented him ever since they were past Ancenis.  The pilgrims, thus\ndislodged, ran away athwart the plain a pretty fast pace, and the pain\nceased, even just at the time when by Eudemon he was called to supper, for\nall was ready.  I will go then, said he, and piss away my misfortune; which\nhe did do in such a copious measure, that the urine taking away the feet\nfrom the pilgrims, they were carried along with the stream unto the bank of\na tuft of trees.  Upon which, as soon as they had taken footing, and that\nfor their self-preservation they had run a little out of the road, they on\na sudden fell all six, except Fourniller, into a trap that had been made to\ntake wolves by a train, out of which, nevertheless, they escaped by the\nindustry of the said Fourniller, who broke all the snares and ropes.  Being\ngone from thence, they lay all the rest of that night in a lodge near unto\nCoudray, where they were comforted in their miseries by the gracious words\nof one of their company, called Sweer-to-go, who showed them that this\nadventure had been foretold by the prophet David, Psalm.  Quum exsurgerent\nhomines in nos, forte vivos deglutissent nos; when we were eaten in the\nsalad, with salt, oil, and vinegar.  Quum irasceretur furor eorum in nos,\nforsitan aqua absorbuisset nos; when he drank the great draught.  Torrentem\npertransivit anima nostra; when the stream of his water carried us to the\nthicket.  Forsitan pertransisset anima nostra aquam intolerabilem; that is,\nthe water of his urine, the flood whereof, cutting our way, took our feet\nfrom us.  Benedictus Dominus qui non dedit nos in captionem dentibus eorum.\nAnima nostra sicut passer erepta est de laqueo venantium; when we fell in\nthe trap.  Laqueus contritus est, by Fourniller, et nos liberati sumus.\nAdjutorium nostrum, &c.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XXXIX.\n\nHow the Monk was feasted by Gargantua, and of the jovial discourse they had\nat supper.\n\nWhen Gargantua was set down at table, after all of them had somewhat stayed\ntheir stomachs by a snatch or two of the first bits eaten heartily,\nGrangousier began to relate the source and cause of the war raised between\nhim and Picrochole; and came to tell how Friar John of the Funnels had\ntriumphed at the defence of the close of the abbey, and extolled him for\nhis valour above Camillus, Scipio, Pompey, Caesar, and Themistocles.  Then\nGargantua desired that he might be presently sent for, to the end that with\nhim they might consult of what was to be done.  Whereupon, by a joint\nconsent, his steward went for him, and brought him along merrily, with his\nstaff of the cross, upon Grangousier's mule.  When he was come, a thousand\nhuggings, a thousand embracements, a thousand good days were given.  Ha,\nFriar John, my friend Friar John, my brave cousin Friar John from the\ndevil!  Let me clip thee, my heart, about the neck; to me an armful.  I\nmust grip thee, my ballock, till thy back crack with it.  Come, my cod, let\nme coll thee till I kill thee.  And Friar John, the gladdest man in the\nworld, never was man made welcomer, never was any more courteously and\ngraciously received than Friar John.  Come, come, said Gargantua, a stool\nhere close by me at this end.  I am content, said the monk, seeing you will\nhave it so.  Some water, page; fill, my boy, fill; it is to refresh my\nliver.  Give me some, child, to gargle my throat withal.  Deposita cappa,\nsaid Gymnast, let us pull off this frock.  Ho, by G--, gentlemen, said the\nmonk, there is a chapter in Statutis Ordinis which opposeth my laying of it\ndown.  Pish! said Gymnast, a fig for your chapter!  This frock breaks both\nyour shoulders, put it off.  My friend, said the monk, let me alone with\nit; for, by G--, I'll drink the better that it is on.  It makes all my body\njocund.  If I should lay it aside, the waggish pages would cut to\nthemselves garters out of it, as I was once served at Coulaines.  And,\nwhich is worse, I shall lose my appetite.  But if in this habit I sit down\nat table, I will drink, by G--, both to thee and to thy horse, and so\ncourage, frolic, God save the company!  I have already supped, yet will I\neat never a whit the less for that; for I have a paved stomach, as hollow\nas a butt of malvoisie or St. Benedictus' boot (butt), and always open like\na lawyer's pouch.  Of all fishes but the tench take the wing of a partridge\nor the thigh of a nun.  Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a\nstiff catso?  Our prior loves exceedingly the white of a capon.  In that,\nsaid Gymnast, he doth not resemble the foxes; for of the capons, hens, and\npullets which they carry away they never eat the white.  Why? said the\nmonk.  Because, said Gymnast, they have no cooks to dress them; and, if\nthey be not competently made ready, they remain red and not white; the\nredness of meats being a token that they have not got enough of the fire,\nwhether by boiling, roasting, or otherwise, except the shrimps, lobsters,\ncrabs, and crayfishes, which are cardinalized with boiling.  By God's\nfeast-gazers, said the monk, the porter of our abbey then hath not his head\nwell boiled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an alder-tree.  The\nthigh of this leveret is good for those that have the gout.  To the purpose\nof the truel,--what is the reason that the thighs of a gentlewoman are\nalways fresh and cool?  This problem, said Gargantua, is neither in\nAristotle, in Alexander Aphrodiseus, nor in Plutarch.  There are three\ncauses, said the monk, by which that place is naturally refreshed.  Primo,\nbecause the water runs all along by it.  Secundo, because it is a shady\nplace, obscure and dark, upon which the sun never shines.  And thirdly,\nbecause it is continually flabbelled, blown upon, and aired by the north\nwinds of the hole arstick, the fan of the smock, and flipflap of the\ncodpiece.  And lusty, my lads.  Some bousing liquor, page!  So! crack,\ncrack, crack.  O how good is God, that gives us of this excellent juice!  I\ncall him to witness, if I had been in the time of Jesus Christ, I would\nhave kept him from being taken by the Jews in the garden of Olivet.  And\nthe devil fail me, if I should have failed to cut off the hams of these\ngentlemen apostles who ran away so basely after they had well supped, and\nleft their good master in the lurch.  I hate that man worse than poison\nthat offers to run away when he should fight and lay stoutly about him.  Oh\nthat I were but King of France for fourscore or a hundred years!  By G--, I\nshould whip like curtail-dogs these runaways of Pavia.  A plague take them;\nwhy did they not choose rather to die there than to leave their good prince\nin that pinch and necessity?  Is it not better and more honourable to\nperish in fighting valiantly than to live in disgrace by a cowardly running\naway?  We are like to eat no great store of goslings this year; therefore,\nfriend, reach me some of that roasted pig there.\n\nDiavolo, is there no more must?  No more sweet wine?  Germinavit radix\nJesse.  Je renie ma vie, je meurs de soif; I renounce my life, I rage for\nthirst.  This wine is none of the worst.  What wine drink you at Paris?  I\ngive myself to the devil, if I did not once keep open house at Paris for\nall comers six months together.  Do you know Friar Claude of the high\nkilderkins?  Oh the good fellow that he is!  But I do not know what fly\nhath stung him of late, he is become so hard a student.  For my part, I\nstudy not at all.  In our abbey we never study for fear of the mumps, which\ndisease in horses is called the mourning in the chine.  Our late abbot was\nwont to say that it is a monstrous thing to see a learned monk.  By G--,\nmaster, my friend, Magis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes.\nYou never saw so many hares as there are this year.  I could not anywhere\ncome by a goshawk nor tassel of falcon.  My Lord Belloniere promised me a\nlanner, but he wrote to me not long ago that he was become pursy.  The\npartridges will so multiply henceforth, that they will go near to eat up\nour ears.  I take no delight in the stalking-horse, for I catch such cold\nthat I am like to founder myself at that sport.  If I do not run, toil,\ntravel, and trot about, I am not well at ease.  True it is that in leaping\nover the hedges and bushes my frock leaves always some of its wool behind\nit.  I have recovered a dainty greyhound; I give him to the devil, if he\nsuffer a hare to escape him.  A groom was leading him to my Lord\nHuntlittle, and I robbed him of him.  Did I ill?  No, Friar John, said\nGymnast, no, by all the devils that are, no!  So, said the monk, do I\nattest these same devils so long as they last, or rather, virtue (of) G--,\nwhat could that gouty limpard have done with so fine a dog?  By the body of\nG--, he is better pleased when one presents him with a good yoke of oxen.\nHow now, said Ponocrates, you swear, Friar John.  It is only, said the\nmonk, but to grace and adorn my speech.  They are colours of a Ciceronian\nrhetoric.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XL.\n\nWhy monks are the outcasts of the world; and wherefore some have bigger\nnoses than others.\n\nBy the faith of a Christian, said Eudemon, I do wonderfully dote and enter\nin a great ecstasy when I consider the honesty and good fellowship of this\nmonk, for he makes us here all merry.  How is it, then, that they exclude\nthe monks from all good companies, calling them feast-troublers, marrers of\nmirth, and disturbers of all civil conversation, as the bees drive away the\ndrones from their hives?  Ignavum fucos pecus, said Maro, a praesepibus\narcent.  Hereunto, answered Gargantua, there is nothing so true as that the\nfrock and cowl draw unto itself the opprobries, injuries, and maledictions\nof the world, just as the wind called Cecias attracts the clouds.  The\nperemptory reason is, because they eat the ordure and excrements of the\nworld, that is to say, the sins of the people, and, like dung-chewers and\nexcrementitious eaters, they are cast into the privies and secessive\nplaces, that is, the convents and abbeys, separated from political\nconversation, as the jakes and retreats of a house are.  But if you\nconceive how an ape in a family is always mocked and provokingly incensed,\nyou shall easily apprehend how monks are shunned of all men, both young and\nold.  The ape keeps not the house as a dog doth, he draws not in the plough\nas the ox, he yields neither milk nor wool as the sheep, he carrieth no\nburden as a horse doth.  That which he doth, is only to conskite, spoil,\nand defile all, which is the cause wherefore he hath of all men mocks,\nfrumperies, and bastinadoes.\n\nAfter the same manner a monk--I mean those lither, idle, lazy monks--doth\nnot labour and work, as do the peasant and artificer; doth not ward and\ndefend the country, as doth the man of war; cureth not the sick and\ndiseased, as the physician doth; doth neither preach nor teach, as do the\nevangelical doctors and schoolmasters; doth not import commodities and\nthings necessary for the commonwealth, as the merchant doth.  Therefore is\nit that by and of all men they are hooted at, hated, and abhorred.  Yea,\nbut, said Grangousier, they pray to God for us.  Nothing less, answered\nGargantua.  True it is, that with a tingle tangle jangling of bells they\ntrouble and disquiet all their neighbours about them.  Right, said the\nmonk; a mass, a matin, a vesper well rung, are half said.  They mumble out\ngreat store of legends and psalms, by them not at all understood; they say\nmany paternosters interlarded with Ave-Maries, without thinking upon or\napprehending the meaning of what it is they say, which truly I call mocking\nof God, and not prayers.  But so help them God, as they pray for us, and\nnot for being afraid to lose their victuals, their manchots, and good fat\npottage.  All true Christians, of all estates and conditions, in all places\nand at all times, send up their prayers to God, and the Mediator prayeth\nand intercedeth for them, and God is gracious to them.  Now such a one is\nour good Friar John; therefore every man desireth to have him in his\ncompany.  He is no bigot or hypocrite; he is not torn and divided betwixt\nreality and appearance; no wretch of a rugged and peevish disposition, but\nhonest, jovial, resolute, and a good fellow.  He travels, he labours, he\ndefends the oppressed, comforts the afflicted, helps the needy, and keeps\nthe close of the abbey.  Nay, said the monk, I do a great deal more than\nthat; for whilst we are in despatching our matins and anniversaries in the\nchoir, I make withal some crossbow-strings, polish glass bottles and bolts,\nI twist lines and weave purse nets wherein to catch coneys.  I am never\nidle.  But now, hither come, some drink, some drink here!  Bring the fruit.\nThese chestnuts are of the wood of Estrox, and with good new wine are able\nto make you a fine cracker and composer of bum-sonnets.  You are not as\nyet, it seems, well moistened in this house with the sweet wine and must.\nBy G--, I drink to all men freely, and at all fords, like a proctor or\npromoter's horse.  Friar John, said Gymnast, take away the snot that hangs\nat your nose.  Ha, ha, said the monk, am not I in danger of drowning,\nseeing I am in water even to the nose?  No, no, Quare?  Quia, though some\nwater come out from thence, there never goes in any; for it is well\nantidoted with pot-proof armour and syrup of the vine-leaf.\n\nOh, my friend, he that hath winter-boots made of such leather may boldly\nfish for oysters, for they will never take water.  What is the cause, said\nGargantua, that Friar John hath such a fair nose?  Because, said\nGrangousier, that God would have it so, who frameth us in such form and for\nsuch end as is most agreeable with his divine will, even as a potter\nfashioneth his vessels.  Because, said Ponocrates, he came with the first\nto the fair of noses, and therefore made choice of the fairest and the\ngreatest.  Pish, said the monk, that is not the reason of it, but,\naccording to the true monastical philosophy, it is because my nurse had\nsoft teats, by virtue whereof, whilst she gave me suck, my nose did sink in\nas in so much butter.  The hard breasts of nurses make children\nshort-nosed.  But hey, gay, Ad formam nasi cognoscitur ad te levavi.  I\nnever eat any confections, page, whilst I am at the bibbery.  Item, bring\nme rather some toasts.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLI.\n\nHow the Monk made Gargantua sleep, and of his hours and breviaries.\n\nSupper being ended, they consulted of the business in hand, and concluded\nthat about midnight they should fall unawares upon the enemy, to know what\nmanner of watch and ward they kept, and that in the meanwhile they should\ntake a little rest the better to refresh themselves.  But Gargantua could\nnot sleep by any means, on which side soever he turned himself.  Whereupon\nthe monk said to him, I never sleep soundly but when I am at sermon or\nprayers.  Let us therefore begin, you and I, the seven penitential psalms,\nto try whether you shall not quickly fall asleep.  The conceit pleased\nGargantua very well, and, beginning the first of these psalms, as soon as\nthey came to the words Beati quorum they fell asleep, both the one and the\nother.  But the monk, for his being formerly accustomed to the hour of\nclaustral matins, failed not to awake a little before midnight, and, being\nup himself, awaked all the rest, in singing aloud, and with a full clear\nvoice, the song:\n\n  Awake, O Reinian, ho, awake!\n    Awake, O Reinian, ho!\n  Get up, you no more sleep must take;\n    Get up, for we must go.\n\nWhen they were all roused and up, he said, My masters, it is a usual\nsaying, that we begin matins with coughing and supper with drinking.  Let\nus now, in doing clean contrarily, begin our matins with drinking, and at\nnight before supper we shall cough as hard as we can.  What, said\nGargantua, to drink so soon after sleep?  This is not to live according to\nthe diet and prescript rule of the physicians, for you ought first to scour\nand cleanse your stomach of all its superfluities and excrements.  Oh, well\nphysicked, said the monk; a hundred devils leap into my body, if there be\nnot more old drunkards than old physicians!  I have made this paction and\ncovenant with my appetite, that it always lieth down and goes to bed with\nmyself, for to that I every day give very good order; then the next morning\nit also riseth with me and gets up when I am awake.  Mind you your charges,\ngentlemen, or tend your cures as much as you will.  I will get me to my\ndrawer; in terms of falconry, my tiring.  What drawer or tiring do you\nmean? said Gargantua.  My breviary, said the monk, for just as the\nfalconers, before they feed their hawks, do make them draw at a hen's leg\nto purge their brains of phlegm and sharpen them to a good appetite, so, by\ntaking this merry little breviary in the morning, I scour all my lungs and\nam presently ready to drink.\n\nAfter what manner, said Gargantua, do you say these fair hours and prayers\nof yours?  After the manner of Whipfield (Fessecamp, and corruptly Fecan.),\nsaid the monk, by three psalms and three lessons, or nothing at all, he\nthat will.  I never tie myself to hours, prayers, and sacraments; for they\nare made for the man and not the man for them.  Therefore is it that I make\nmy prayers in fashion of stirrup-leathers; I shorten or lengthen them when\nI think good.  Brevis oratio penetrat caelos et longa potatio evacuat\nscyphos.  Where is that written?  By my faith, said Ponocrates, I cannot\ntell, my pillicock, but thou art more worth than gold.  Therein, said the\nmonk, I am like you; but, venite, apotemus.  Then made they ready store of\ncarbonadoes, or rashers on the coals, and good fat soups, or brewis with\nsippets; and the monk drank what he pleased.  Some kept him company, and\nthe rest did forbear, for their stomachs were not as yet opened.\nAfterwards every man began to arm and befit himself for the field. And they\narmed the monk against his will; for he desired no other armour for back\nand breast but his frock, nor any other weapon in his hand but the staff of\nthe cross.  Yet at their pleasure was he completely armed cap-a-pie, and\nmounted upon one of the best horses in the kingdom, with a good slashing\nshable by his side, together with Gargantua, Ponocrates, Gymnast, Eudemon,\nand five-and-twenty more of the most resolute and adventurous of\nGrangousier's house, all armed at proof with their lances in their hands,\nmounted like St. George, and everyone of them having an arquebusier behind\nhim.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLII.\n\nHow the Monk encouraged his fellow-champions, and how he hanged upon a\ntree.\n\nThus went out those valiant champions on their adventure, in full\nresolution to know what enterprise they should undertake, and what to take\nheed of and look well to in the day of the great and horrible battle.  And\nthe monk encouraged them, saying, My children, do not fear nor doubt, I\nwill conduct you safely.  God and Sanct Benedict be with us!  If I had\nstrength answerable to my courage, by's death, I would plume them for you\nlike ducks.  I fear nothing but the great ordnance; yet I know of a charm\nby way of prayer, which the subsexton of our abbey taught me, that will\npreserve a man from the violence of guns and all manner of fire-weapons and\nengines; but it will do me no good, because I do not believe it.\nNevertheless, I hope my staff of the cross shall this day play devilish\npranks amongst them.  By G--, whoever of our party shall offer to play the\nduck, and shrink when blows are a-dealing, I give myself to the devil, if I\ndo not make a monk of him in my stead, and hamper him within my frock,\nwhich is a sovereign cure against cowardice.  Did you never hear of my Lord\nMeurles his greyhound, which was not worth a straw in the fields?  He put a\nfrock about his neck:  by the body of G--, there was neither hare nor fox\nthat could escape him, and, which is more, he lined all the bitches in the\ncountry, though before that he was feeble-reined and ex frigidis et\nmaleficiatis.\n\nThe monk uttering these words in choler, as he passed under a walnut-tree,\nin his way towards the causey, he broached the vizor of his helmet on the\nstump of a great branch of the said tree.  Nevertheless, he set his spurs\nso fiercely to the horse, who was full of mettle and quick on the spur,\nthat he bounded forwards, and the monk going about to ungrapple his vizor,\nlet go his hold of the bridle, and so hanged by his hand upon the bough,\nwhilst his horse stole away from under him.  By this means was the monk\nleft hanging on the walnut-tree, and crying for help, murder, murder,\nswearing also that he was betrayed.  Eudemon perceived him first, and\ncalling Gargantua said, Sir, come and see Absalom hanging.  Gargantua,\nbeing come, considered the countenance of the monk, and in what posture he\nhanged; wherefore he said to Eudemon, You were mistaken in comparing him to\nAbsalom; for Absalom hung by his hair, but this shaveling monk hangeth by\nthe ears.  Help me, said the monk, in the devil's name; is this a time for\nyou to prate?  You seem to me to be like the decretalist preachers, who say\nthat whosoever shall see his neighbour in the danger of death, ought, upon\npain of trisulk excommunication, rather choose to admonish him to make his\nconfession to a priest, and put his conscience in the state of peace, than\notherwise to help and relieve him.\n\nAnd therefore when I shall see them fallen into a river, and ready to be\ndrowned, I shall make them a fair long sermon de contemptu mundi, et fuga\nseculi; and when they are stark dead, shall then go to their aid and\nsuccour in fishing after them.  Be quiet, said Gymnast, and stir not, my\nminion.  I am now coming to unhang thee and to set thee at freedom, for\nthou art a pretty little gentle monachus.  Monachus in claustro non valet\nova duo; sed quando est extra, bene valet triginta.  I have seen above five\nhundred hanged, but I never saw any have a better countenance in his\ndangling and pendilatory swagging.  Truly, if I had so good a one, I would\nwillingly hang thus all my lifetime.  What, said the monk, have you almost\ndone preaching?  Help me, in the name of God, seeing you will not in the\nname of the other spirit, or, by the habit which I wear, you shall repent\nit, tempore et loco praelibatis.\n\nThen Gymnast alighted from his horse, and, climbing up the walnut-tree,\nlifted up the monk with one hand by the gussets of his armour under the\narmpits, and with the other undid his vizor from the stump of the broken\nbranch; which done, he let him fall to the ground and himself after.  As\nsoon as the monk was down, he put off all his armour, and threw away one\npiece after another about the field, and, taking to him again his staff of\nthe cross, remounted up to his horse, which Eudemon had caught in his\nrunning away.  Then went they on merrily, riding along on the highway.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLIII.\n\nHow the scouts and fore-party of Picrochole were met with by Gargantua, and\nhow the Monk slew Captain Drawforth (Tirevant.), and then was taken\nprisoner by his enemies.\n\nPicrochole, at the relation of those who had escaped out of the broil and\ndefeat wherein Tripet was untriped, grew very angry that the devils should\nhave so run upon his men, and held all that night a counsel of war, at\nwhich Rashcalf and Touchfaucet (Hastiveau, Touquedillon.), concluded his\npower to be such that he was able to defeat all the devils of hell if they\nshould come to jostle with his forces.  This Picrochole did not fully\nbelieve, though he doubted not much of it.  Therefore sent he under the\ncommand and conduct of the Count Drawforth, for discovering of the country,\nthe number of sixteen hundred horsemen, all well mounted upon light horses\nfor skirmish and thoroughly besprinkled with holy water; and everyone for\ntheir field-mark or cognizance had the sign of a star in his scarf, to\nserve at all adventures in case they should happen to encounter with\ndevils, that by the virtue, as well of that Gregorian water as of the stars\nwhich they wore, they might make them disappear and evanish.\n\nIn this equipage they made an excursion upon the country till they came\nnear to the Vauguyon, which is the valley of Guyon, and to the spital, but\ncould never find anybody to speak unto; whereupon they returned a little\nback, and took occasion to pass above the aforesaid hospital to try what\nintelligence they could come by in those parts.  In which resolution riding\non, and by chance in a pastoral lodge or shepherd's cottage near to Coudray\nhitting upon the five pilgrims, they carried them way-bound and manacled,\nas if they had been spies, for all the exclamations, adjurations, and\nrequests that they could make.  Being come down from thence towards\nSeville, they were heard by Gargantua, who said then unto those that were\nwith him, Comrades and fellow-soldiers, we have here met with an encounter,\nand they are ten times in number more than we.  Shall we charge them or no?\nWhat a devil, said the monk, shall we do else?  Do you esteem men by their\nnumber rather than by their valour and prowess?  With this he cried out,\nCharge, devils, charge!  Which when the enemies heard, they thought\ncertainly that they had been very devils, and therefore even then began all\nof them to run away as hard as they could drive, Drawforth only excepted,\nwho immediately settled his lance on its rest, and therewith hit the monk\nwith all his force on the very middle of his breast, but, coming against\nhis horrific frock, the point of the iron being with the blow either broke\noff or blunted, it was in matter of execution as if you had struck against\nan anvil with a little wax-candle.\n\nThen did the monk with his staff of the cross give him such a sturdy thump\nand whirret betwixt his neck and shoulders, upon the acromion bone, that he\nmade him lose both sense and motion and fall down stone dead at his horse's\nfeet; and, seeing the sign of the star which he wore scarfwise, he said\nunto Gargantua, These men are but priests, which is but the beginning of a\nmonk; by St. John, I am a perfect monk, I will kill them to you like flies.\nThen ran he after them at a swift and full gallop till he overtook the\nrear, and felled them down like tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst\nand every way.  Gymnast presently asked Gargantua if they should pursue\nthem.  To whom Gargantua answered, By no means; for, according to right\nmilitary discipline, you must never drive your enemy unto despair, for that\nsuch a strait doth multiply his force and increase his courage, which was\nbefore broken and cast down; neither is there any better help or outrage of\nrelief for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled, and spent, than to\nhope for no favour at all.  How many victories have been taken out of the\nhands of the victors by the vanquished, when they would not rest satisfied\nwith reason, but attempt to put all to the sword, and totally to destroy\ntheir enemies, without leaving so much as one to carry home news of the\ndefeat of his fellows.  Open, therefore, unto your enemies all the gates\nand ways, and make to them a bridge of silver rather than fail, that you\nmay be rid of them.  Yea, but, said Gymnast, they have the monk.  Have they\nthe monk? said Gargantua.  Upon mine honour, then, it will prove to their\ncost.  But to prevent all dangers, let us not yet retreat, but halt here\nquietly as in an ambush; for I think I do already understand the policy and\njudgment of our enemies.  They are truly more directed by chance and mere\nfortune than by good advice and counsel.  In the meanwhile, whilst these\nmade a stop under the walnut-trees, the monk pursued on the chase, charging\nall he overtook, and giving quarter to none, until he met with a trooper\nwho carried behind him one of the poor pilgrims, and there would have\nrifled him.  The pilgrim, in hope of relief at the sight of the monk, cried\nout, Ha, my lord prior, my good friend, my lord prior, save me, I beseech\nyou, save me!  Which words being heard by those that rode in the van, they\ninstantly faced about, and seeing there was nobody but the monk that made\nthis great havoc and slaughter among them, they loaded him with blows as\nthick as they use to do an ass with wood.  But of all this he felt nothing,\nespecially when they struck upon his frock, his skin was so hard.  Then\nthey committed him to two of the marshal's men to keep, and, looking about,\nsaw nobody coming against them, whereupon they thought that Gargantua and\nhis party were fled.  Then was it that they rode as hard as they could\ntowards the walnut-trees to meet with them, and left the monk there all\nalone, with his two foresaid men to guard him.  Gargantua heard the noise\nand neighing of the horses, and said to his men, Comrades, I hear the track\nand beating of the enemy's horse-feet, and withal perceive that some of\nthem come in a troop and full body against us.  Let us rally and close\nhere, then set forward in order, and by this means we shall be able to\nreceive their charge to their loss and our honour.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLIV.\n\nHow the Monk rid himself of his keepers, and how Picrochole's forlorn hope\nwas defeated.\n\nThe monk, seeing them break off thus without order, conjectured that they\nwere to set upon Gargantua and those that were with him, and was\nwonderfully grieved that he could not succour them.  Then considered he the\ncountenance of the two keepers in whose custody he was, who would have\nwillingly run after the troops to get some booty and plunder, and were\nalways looking towards the valley unto which they were going.  Farther, he\nsyllogized, saying, These men are but badly skilled in matters of war, for\nthey have not required my parole, neither have they taken my sword from me.\nSuddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horseman's sword, wherewith he\ngave the keeper which held him on the right side such a sound slash that he\ncut clean through the jugulary veins and the sphagitid or transparent\narteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the\ngargareon, even unto the two adenes, which are throat kernels; and,\nredoubling the blow, he opened the spinal marrow betwixt the second and\nthird vertebrae.  There fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground.\nThen the monk, reining his horse to the left, ran upon the other, who,\nseeing his fellow dead, and the monk to have the advantage of him, cried\nwith a loud voice, Ha, my lord prior, quarter; I yield, my lord prior,\nquarter; quarter, my good friend, my lord prior.  And the monk cried\nlikewise, My lord posterior, my friend, my lord posterior, you shall have\nit upon your posteriorums.  Ha, said the keeper, my lord prior, my minion,\nmy gentle lord prior, I pray God make you an abbot.  By the habit, said the\nmonk, which I wear, I will here make you a cardinal.  What! do you use to\npay ransoms to religious men?  You shall therefore have by-and-by a red hat\nof my giving.  And the fellow cried, Ha, my lord prior, my lord prior, my\nlord abbot that shall be, my lord cardinal, my lord all!  Ha, ha, hes, no,\nmy lord prior, my good little lord the prior, I yield, render and deliver\nmyself up to you.  And I deliver thee, said the monk, to all the devils in\nhell.  Then at one stroke he cut off his head, cutting his scalp upon the\ntemple-bones, and lifting up in the upper part of the skull the two\ntriangulary bones called sincipital, or the two bones bregmatis, together\nwith the sagittal commissure or dartlike seam which distinguisheth the\nright side of the head from the left, as also a great part of the coronal\nor forehead bone, by which terrible blow likewise he cut the two meninges\nor films which enwrap the brain, and made a deep wound in the brain's two\nposterior ventricles, and the cranium or skull abode hanging upon his\nshoulders by the skin of the pericranium behind, in form of a doctor's\nbonnet, black without and red within.  Thus fell he down also to the ground\nstark dead.\n\nAnd presently the monk gave his horse the spur, and kept the way that the\nenemy held, who had met with Gargantua and his companions in the broad\nhighway, and were so diminished of their number for the enormous slaughter\nthat Gargantua had made with his great tree amongst them, as also Gymnast,\nPonocrates, Eudemon, and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly\nand in great haste, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both sense\nand understanding, and as if they had seen the very proper species and form\nof death before their eyes; or rather, as when you see an ass with a brizze\nor gadbee under his tail, or fly that stings him, run hither and thither\nwithout keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground,\nbreaking his bridle and reins, and taking no breath nor rest, and no man\ncan tell what ails him, for they see not anything touch him.  So fled these\npeople destitute of wit, without knowing any cause of flying, only pursued\nby a panic terror which in their minds they had conceived.  The monk,\nperceiving that their whole intent was to betake themselves to their heels,\nalighted from his horse and got upon a big large rock which was in the way,\nand with his great brackmard sword laid such load upon those runaways, and\nwith main strength fetching a compass with his arm without feigning or\nsparing, slew and overthrew so many that his sword broke in two pieces.\nThen thought he within himself that he had slain and killed sufficiently,\nand that the rest should escape to carry news.  Therefore he took up a\nbattle-axe of those that lay there dead, and got upon the rock again,\npassing his time to see the enemy thus flying and to tumble himself amongst\nthe dead bodies, only that he suffered none to carry pike, sword, lance,\nnor gun with him, and those who carried the pilgrims bound he made to\nalight, and gave their horses unto the said pilgrims, keeping them there\nwith him under the hedge, and also Touchfaucet, who was then his prisoner.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLV.\n\nHow the Monk carried along with him the Pilgrims, and of the good words\nthat Grangousier gave them.\n\nThis skirmish being ended, Gargantua retreated with his men, excepting the\nmonk, and about the dawning of the day they came unto Grangousier, who in\nhis bed was praying unto God for their safety and victory.  And seeing them\nall safe and sound, he embraced them lovingly, and asked what was become of\nthe monk.  Gargantua answered him that without doubt the enemies had the\nmonk.  Then have they mischief and ill luck, said Grangousier; which was\nvery true.  Therefore is it a common proverb to this day, to give a man the\nmonk, or, as in French, lui bailler le moine, when they would express the\ndoing unto one a mischief.  Then commanded he a good breakfast to be\nprovided for their refreshment.  When all was ready, they called Gargantua,\nbut he was so aggrieved that the monk was not to be heard of that he would\nneither eat nor drink.  In the meanwhile the monk comes, and from the gate\nof the outer court cries out aloud, Fresh wine, fresh wine, Gymnast my\nfriend!  Gymnast went out and saw that it was Friar John, who brought along\nwith him five pilgrims and Touchfaucet prisoners; whereupon Gargantua\nlikewise went forth to meet him, and all of them made him the best welcome\nthat possibly they could, and brought him before Grangousier, who asked him\nof all his adventures.  The monk told him all, both how he was taken, how\nhe rid himself of his keepers, of the slaughter he had made by the way, and\nhow he had rescued the pilgrims and brought along with him Captain\nTouchfaucet.  Then did they altogether fall to banqueting most merrily.  In\nthe meantime Grangousier asked the pilgrims what countrymen they were,\nwhence they came, and whither they went.  Sweer-to-go in the name of the\nrest answered, My sovereign lord, I am of Saint Genou in Berry, this man is\nof Palvau, this other is of Onzay, this of Argy, this of St. Nazarand, and\nthis man of Villebrenin.  We come from Saint Sebastian near Nantes, and are\nnow returning, as we best may, by easy journeys.  Yea, but, said\nGrangousier, what went you to do at Saint Sebastian?  We went, said\nSweer-to-go, to offer up unto that sanct our vows against the plague.  Ah,\npoor men! said Grangousier, do you think that the plague comes from Saint\nSebastian?  Yes, truly, answered Sweer-to-go, our preachers tell us so\nindeed.  But is it so, said Grangousier, do the false prophets teach you\nsuch abuses?  Do they thus blaspheme the sancts and holy men of God, as to\nmake them like unto the devils, who do nothing but hurt unto mankind,--as\nHomer writeth, that the plague was sent into the camp of the Greeks by\nApollo, and as the poets feign a great rabble of Vejoves and mischievous\ngods.  So did a certain cafard or dissembling religionary preach at Sinay,\nthat Saint Anthony sent the fire into men's legs, that Saint Eutropius made\nmen hydropic, Saint Clidas, fools, and that Saint Genou made them goutish.\nBut I punished him so exemplarily, though he called me heretic for it, that\nsince that time no such hypocritical rogue durst set his foot within my\nterritories.  And truly I wonder that your king should suffer them in their\nsermons to publish such scandalous doctrine in his dominions; for they\ndeserve to be chastised with greater severity than those who, by magical\nart, or any other device, have brought the pestilence into a country.  The\npest killeth but the bodies, but such abominable imposters empoison our\nvery souls.  As he spake these words, in came the monk very resolute, and\nasked them, Whence are you, you poor wretches?  Of Saint Genou, said they.\nAnd how, said the monk, does the Abbot Gulligut, the good drinker,--and the\nmonks, what cheer make they?  By G-- body, they'll have a fling at your\nwives, and breast them to some purpose, whilst you are upon your roaming\nrant and gadding pilgrimage.  Hin, hen, said Sweer-to-go, I am not afraid\nof mine, for he that shall see her by day will never break his neck to come\nto her in the night-time.  Yea, marry, said the monk, now you have hit it.\nLet her be as ugly as ever was Proserpina, she will once, by the Lord G--,\nbe overturned, and get her skin-coat shaken, if there dwell any monks near\nto her; for a good carpenter will make use of any kind of timber.  Let me\nbe peppered with the pox, if you find not all your wives with child at your\nreturn; for the very shadow of the steeple of an abbey is fruitful.  It is,\nsaid Gargantua, like the water of Nilus in Egypt, if you believe Strabo and\nPliny, Lib. 7, cap. 3.  What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in\ntheir bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?\n\nThen, said Grangousier, go your ways, poor men, in the name of God the\nCreator, to whom I pray to guide you perpetually, and henceforward be not\nso ready to undertake these idle and unprofitable journeys.  Look to your\nfamilies, labour every man in his vocation, instruct your children, and\nlive as the good apostle St. Paul directeth you; in doing whereof, God, his\nangels and sancts, will guard and protect you, and no evil or plague at any\ntime shall befall you.  Then Gargantua led them into the hall to take their\nrefection; but the pilgrims did nothing but sigh, and said to Gargantua, O\nhow happy is that land which hath such a man for their lord!  We have been\nmore edified and instructed by the talk which he had with us, than by all\nthe sermons that ever were preached in our town.  This is, said Gargantua,\nthat which Plato saith, Lib. 5 de Republ., that those commonwealths are\nhappy, whose rulers philosophate, and whose philosophers rule.  Then caused\nhe their wallets to be filled with victuals and their bottles with wine,\nand gave unto each of them a horse to ease them upon the way, together with\nsome pence to live by.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLVI.\n\nHow Grangousier did very kindly entertain Touchfaucet his prisoner.\n\nTouchfaucet was presented unto Grangousier, and by him examined upon the\nenterprise and attempt of Picrochole, what it was he could pretend to, or\naim at, by the rustling stir and tumultuary coil of this his sudden\ninvasion.  Whereunto he answered, that his end and purpose was to conquer\nall the country, if he could, for the injury done to his cake-bakers.  It\nis too great an undertaking, said Grangousier; and, as the proverb is, He\nthat grips too much, holds fast but little.  The time is not now as\nformerly, to conquer the kingdoms of our neighbour princes, and to build up\nour own greatness upon the loss of our nearest Christian Brother.  This\nimitation of the ancient Herculeses, Alexanders, Hannibals, Scipios,\nCaesars, and other such heroes, is quite contrary to the profession of the\ngospel of Christ, by which we are commanded to preserve, keep, rule, and\ngovern every man his own country and lands, and not in a hostile manner to\ninvade others; and that which heretofore the Barbars and Saracens called\nprowess and valour, we do now call robbing, thievery, and wickedness.  It\nwould have been more commendable in him to have contained himself within\nthe bounds of his own territories, royally governing them, than to insult\nand domineer in mine, pillaging and plundering everywhere like a most\nunmerciful enemy; for, by ruling his own with discretion, he might have\nincreased his greatness, but by robbing me he cannot escape destruction.\nGo your ways in the name of God, prosecute good enterprises, show your king\nwhat is amiss, and never counsel him with regard unto your own particular\nprofit, for the public loss will swallow up the private benefit.  As for\nyour ransom, I do freely remit it to you, and will that your arms and horse\nbe restored to you; so should good neighbours do, and ancient friends,\nseeing this our difference is not properly war.  As Plato, Lib. 5 de\nRepub., would not have it called war, but sedition, when the Greeks took up\narms against one another, and that therefore, when such combustions should\narise amongst them, his advice was to behave themselves in the managing of\nthem with all discretion and modesty.  Although you call it war, it is but\nsuperficial; it entereth not into the closet and inmost cabinet of our\nhearts.  For neither of us hath been wronged in his honour, nor is there\nany question betwixt us in the main, but only how to redress, by the bye,\nsome petty faults committed by our men,--I mean, both yours and ours,\nwhich, although you knew, you ought to let pass; for these quarrelsome\npersons deserve rather to be contemned than mentioned, especially seeing I\noffered them satisfaction according to the wrong.  God shall be the just\njudge of our variances, whom I beseech by death rather to take me out of\nthis life, and to permit my goods to perish and be destroyed before mine\neyes, than that by me or mine he should in any sort be wronged.  These\nwords uttered, he called the monk, and before them all thus spoke unto him,\nFriar John, my good friend, it is you that took prisoner the Captain\nTouchfaucet here present?  Sir, said the monk, seeing himself is here, and\nthat he is of the years of discretion, I had rather you should know it by\nhis confession than by any words of mine.  Then said Touchfaucet, My\nsovereign lord it is he indeed that took me, and I do therefore most freely\nyield myself his prisoner.  Have you put him to any ransom? said\nGrangousier to the monk.  No, said the monk, of that I take no care.  How\nmuch would you have for having taken him?  Nothing, nothing, said the monk;\nI am not swayed by that, nor do I regard it.  Then Grangousier commanded\nthat, in presence of Touchfaucet, should be delivered to the monk for\ntaking him the sum of three score and two thousand saluts (in English\nmoney, fifteen thousand and five hundred pounds), which was done, whilst\nthey made a collation or little banquet to the said Touchfaucet, of whom\nGrangousier asked if he would stay with him, or if he loved rather to\nreturn to his king.  Touchfaucet answered that he was content to take\nwhatever course he would advise him to.  Then, said Grangousier, return\nunto your king, and God be with you.\n\nThen he gave him an excellent sword of a Vienne blade, with a golden\nscabbard wrought with vine-branch-like flourishes, of fair goldsmith's\nwork, and a collar or neck-chain of gold, weighing seven hundred and two\nthousand marks (at eight ounces each), garnished with precious stones of\nthe finest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty thousand ducats, and ten\nthousand crowns more, as an honourable donative, by way of present.\n\nAfter this talk Touchfaucet got to his horse, and Gargantua for his safety\nallowed him the guard of thirty men-at-arms and six score archers to attend\nhim, under the conduct of Gymnast, to bring him even unto the gate of the\nrock Clermond, if there were need.  As soon as he was gone, the monk\nrestored unto Grangousier the three score and two thousand saluts which he\nhad received, saying, Sir, it is not as yet the time for you to give such\ngifts; stay till this war be at an end, for none can tell what accidents\nmay occur, and war begun without good provision of money beforehand for\ngoing through with it, is but as a breathing of strength, and blast that\nwill quickly pass away.  Coin is the sinews of war.  Well then, said\nGrangousier, at the end I will content you by some honest recompense, as\nalso all those who shall do me good service.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLVII.\n\nHow Grangousier sent for his legions, and how Touchfaucet slew Rashcalf,\nand was afterwards executed by the command of Picrochole.\n\nAbout this same time those of Besse, of the Old Market, of St. James'\nBourg, of the Draggage, of Parille, of the Rivers, of the rocks St. Pol, of\nthe Vaubreton, of Pautille, of the Brehemont, of Clainbridge, of Cravant,\nof Grammont, of the town at the Badgerholes, of Huymes, of Segre, of Husse,\nof St. Lovant, of Panzoust, of the Coldraux, of Verron, of Coulaines, of\nChose, of Varenes, of Bourgueil, of the Bouchard Island, of the Croullay,\nof Narsay, of Cande, of Montsoreau, and other bordering places, sent\nambassadors unto Grangousier, to tell him that they were advised of the\ngreat wrongs which Picrochole had done him, and, in regard of their ancient\nconfederacy, offered him what assistance they could afford, both in men,\nmoney, victuals, and ammunition, and other necessaries for war.  The money\nwhich by the joint agreement of them all was sent unto him, amounted to six\nscore and fourteen millions, two crowns and a half of pure gold.  The\nforces wherewith they did assist him did consist in fifteen thousand\ncuirassiers, two-and-thirty thousand light horsemen, four score and nine\nthousand dragoons, and a hundred-and-forty thousand volunteer adventurers.\nThese had with them eleven thousand and two hundred cannons, double\ncannons, long pieces of artillery called basilisks, and smaller sized ones\nknown by the name of spirols, besides the mortar-pieces and grenadoes.  Of\npioneers they had seven-and-forty thousand, all victualled and paid for six\nmonths and four days of advance.  Which offer Gargantua did not altogether\nrefuse, nor wholly accept of; but, giving them hearty thanks, said that he\nwould compose and order the war by such a device, that there should not be\nfound great need to put so many honest men to trouble in the managing of\nit; and therefore was content at that time to give order only for bringing\nalong the legions which he maintained in his ordinary garrison towns of the\nDeviniere, of Chavigny, of Gravot, and of the Quinquenais, amounting to the\nnumber of two thousand cuirassiers, three score and six thousand\nfoot-soldiers, six-and-twenty thousand dragoons, attended by two hundred\npieces of great ordnance, two-and-twenty thousand pioneers, and six thousand\nlight horsemen, all drawn up in troops, so well befitted and accommodated\nwith their commissaries, sutlers, farriers, harness-makers, and other such\nlike necessary members in a military camp, so fully instructed in the art of\nwarfare, so perfectly knowing and following their colours, so ready to hear\nand obey their captains, so nimble to run, so strong at their charging, so\nprudent in their adventures, and every day so well disciplined, that they\nseemed rather to be a concert of organ-pipes, or mutual concord of the\nwheels of a clock, than an infantry and cavalry, or army of soldiers.\n\nTouchfaucet immediately after his return presented himself before\nPicrochole, and related unto him at large all that he had done and seen,\nand at last endeavoured to persuade him with strong and forcible arguments\nto capitulate and make an agreement with Grangousier, whom he found to be\nthe honestest man in the world; saying further, that it was neither right\nnor reason thus to trouble his neighbours, of whom they had never received\nanything but good.  And in regard of the main point, that they should never\nbe able to go through stitch with that war, but to their great damage and\nmischief; for the forces of Picrochole were not so considerable but that\nGrangousier could easily overthrow them.\n\nHe had not well done speaking when Rashcalf said out aloud, Unhappy is that\nprince which is by such men served, who are so easily corrupted, as I know\nTouchfaucet is.  For I see his courage so changed that he had willingly\njoined with our enemies to fight against us and betray us, if they would\nhave received him; but as virtue is of all, both friends and foes, praised\nand esteemed, so is wickedness soon known and suspected, and although it\nhappen the enemies to make use thereof for their profit, yet have they\nalways the wicked and the traitors in abomination.\n\nTouchfaucet being at these words very impatient, drew out his sword, and\ntherewith ran Rashcalf through the body, a little under the nipple of his\nleft side, whereof he died presently, and pulling back his sword out of his\nbody said boldly, So let him perish that shall a faithful servant blame.\nPicrochole incontinently grew furious, and seeing Touchfaucet's new sword\nand his scabbard so richly diapered with flourishes of most excellent\nworkmanship, said, Did they give thee this weapon so feloniously therewith\nto kill before my face my so good friend Rashcalf?  Then immediately\ncommanded he his guard to hew him in pieces, which was instantly done, and\nthat so cruelly that the chamber was all dyed with blood.  Afterwards he\nappointed the corpse of Rashcalf to be honourably buried, and that of\nTouchfaucet to be cast over the walls into the ditch.\n\nThe news of these excessive violences were quickly spread through all the\narmy; whereupon many began to murmur against Picrochole, in so far that\nPinchpenny said to him, My sovereign lord, I know not what the issue of\nthis enterprise will be.  I see your men much dejected, and not well\nresolved in their minds, by considering that we are here very ill provided\nof victual, and that our number is already much diminished by three or four\nsallies.  Furthermore, great supplies and recruits come daily in to your\nenemies; but we so moulder away that, if we be once besieged, I do not see\nhow we can escape a total destruction.  Tush, pish, said Picrochole, you\nare like the Melun eels, you cry before they come to you.  Let them come,\nlet them come, if they dare.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLVIII.\n\nHow Gargantua set upon Picrochole within the rock Clermond, and utterly\ndefeated the army of the said Picrochole.\n\nGargantua had the charge of the whole army, and his father Grangousier\nstayed in his castle, who, encouraging them with good words, promised great\nrewards unto those that should do any notable service.  Having thus set\nforward, as soon as they had gained the pass at the ford of Vede, with\nboats and bridges speedily made they passed over in a trice.  Then\nconsidering the situation of the town, which was on a high and advantageous\nplace, Gargantua thought fit to call his council, and pass that night in\ndeliberation upon what was to be done.  But Gymnast said unto him, My\nsovereign lord, such is the nature and complexion of the French, that they\nare worth nothing but at the first push.  Then are they more fierce than\ndevils.  But if they linger a little and be wearied with delays, they'll\nprove more faint and remiss than women.  My opinion is, therefore, that now\npresently, after your men have taken breath and some small refection, you\ngive order for a resolute assault, and that we storm them instantly.  His\nadvice was found very good, and for effectuating thereof he brought forth\nhis army into the plain field, and placed the reserves on the skirt or\nrising of a little hill.  The monk took along with him six companies of\nfoot and two hundred horsemen well armed, and with great diligence crossed\nthe marsh, and valiantly got upon the top of the green hillock even unto\nthe highway which leads to Loudun.  Whilst the assault was thus begun,\nPicrochole's men could not tell well what was best, to issue out and\nreceive the assailants, or keep within the town and not to stir.  Himself\nin the mean time, without deliberation, sallied forth in a rage with the\ncavalry of his guard, who were forthwith received and royally entertained\nwith great cannon-shot that fell upon them like hail from the high grounds\non which the artillery was planted.  Whereupon the Gargantuists betook\nthemselves unto the valleys, to give the ordnance leave to play and range\nwith the larger scope.\n\nThose of the town defended themselves as well as they could, but their shot\npassed over us without doing us any hurt at all.  Some of Picrochole's men\nthat had escaped our artillery set most fiercely upon our soldiers, but\nprevailed little; for they were all let in betwixt the files, and there\nknocked down to the ground, which their fellow-soldiers seeing, they would\nhave retreated, but the monk having seized upon the pass by the which they\nwere to return, they ran away and fled in all the disorder and confusion\nthat could be imagined.\n\nSome would have pursued after them and followed the chase, but the monk\nwithheld them, apprehending that in their pursuit the pursuers might lose\ntheir ranks, and so give occasion to the besieged to sally out of the town\nupon them.  Then staying there some space and none coming against him, he\nsent the Duke Phrontist to advise Gargantua to advance towards the hill\nupon the left hand, to hinder Picrochole's retreat at that gate; which\nGargantua did with all expedition, and sent thither four brigades under the\nconduct of Sebast, which had no sooner reached the top of the hill, but\nthey met Picrochole in the teeth, and those that were with him scattered.\n\nThen charged they upon them stoutly, yet were they much endamaged by those\nthat were upon the walls, who galled them with all manner of shot, both\nfrom the great ordnance, small guns, and bows.  Which Gargantua perceiving,\nhe went with a strong party to their relief, and with his artillery began\nto thunder so terribly upon that canton of the wall, and so long, that all\nthe strength within the town, to maintain and fill up the breach, was drawn\nthither.  The monk seeing that quarter which he kept besieged void of men\nand competent guards, and in a manner altogether naked and abandoned, did\nmost magnanimously on a sudden lead up his men towards the fort, and never\nleft it till he had got up upon it, knowing that such as come to the\nreserve in a conflict bring with them always more fear and terror than\nthose that deal about them with they hands in the fight.\n\nNevertheless, he gave no alarm till all his soldiers had got within the\nwall, except the two hundred horsemen, whom he left without to secure his\nentry.  Then did he give a most horrible shout, so did all these who were\nwith him, and immediately thereafter, without resistance, putting to the\nedge of the sword the guard that was at that gate, they opened it to the\nhorsemen, with whom most furiously they altogether ran towards the east\ngate, where all the hurlyburly was, and coming close upon them in the rear\noverthrew all their forces.\n\nThe besieged, seeing that the Gargantuists had won the town upon them, and\nthat they were like to be secure in no corner of it, submitted themselves\nunto the mercy of the monk, and asked for quarter, which the monk very\nnobly granted to them, yet made them lay down their arms; then, shutting\nthem up within churches, gave order to seize upon all the staves of the\ncrosses, and placed men at the doors to keep them from coming forth.  Then\nopening that east gate, he issued out to succour and assist Gargantua.  But\nPicrochole, thinking it had been some relief coming to him from the town,\nadventured more forwardly than before, and was upon the giving of a most\ndesperate home-charge, when Gargantua cried out, Ha, Friar John, my friend\nFriar John, you are come in a good hour.  Which unexpected accident so\naffrighted Picrochole and his men, that, giving all for lost, they betook\nthemselves to their heels, and fled on all hands.  Gargantua chased them\ntill they came near to Vaugaudry, killing and slaying all the way, and then\nsounded the retreat.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.XLIX.\n\nHow Picrochole in his flight fell into great misfortunes, and what\nGargantua did after the battle.\n\nPicrochole thus in despair fled towards the Bouchard Island, and in the way\nto Riviere his horse stumbled and fell down, whereat he on a sudden was so\nincensed, that he with his sword without more ado killed him in his choler;\nthen, not finding any that would remount him, he was about to have taken an\nass at the mill that was thereby; but the miller's men did so baste his\nbones and so soundly bethwack him that they made him both black and blue\nwith strokes; then stripping him of all his clothes, gave him a scurvy old\ncanvas jacket wherewith to cover his nakedness.  Thus went along this poor\ncholeric wretch, who, passing the water at Port-Huaulx, and relating his\nmisadventurous disasters, was foretold by an old Lourpidon hag that his\nkingdom should be restored to him at the coming of the Cocklicranes, which\nshe called Coquecigrues.  What is become of him since we cannot certainly\ntell, yet was I told that he is now a porter at Lyons, as testy and pettish\nin humour as ever he was before, and would be always with great lamentation\ninquiring at all strangers of the coming of the Cocklicranes, expecting\nassuredly, according to the old woman's prophecy, that at their coming he\nshall be re-established in his kingdom.  The first thing Gargantua did\nafter his return into the town was to call the muster-roll of his men,\nwhich when he had done, he found that there were very few either killed or\nwounded, only some few foot of Captain Tolmere's company, and Ponocrates,\nwho was shot with a musket-ball through the doublet.  Then he caused them\nall at and in their several posts and divisions to take a little\nrefreshment, which was very plenteously provided for them in the best drink\nand victuals that could be had for money, and gave order to the treasurers\nand commissaries of the army to pay for and defray that repast, and that\nthere should be no outrage at all nor abuse committed in the town, seeing\nit was his own.  And furthermore commanded, that immediately after the\nsoldiers had done with eating and drinking for that time sufficiently and\nto their own hearts' desire, a gathering should be beaten for bringing them\naltogether, to be drawn up on the piazza before the castle, there to\nreceive six months' pay completely.  All which was done.  After this, by\nhis direction, were brought before him in the said place all those that\nremained of Picrochole's party, unto whom, in the presence of the princes,\nnobles, and officers of his court and army, he spoke as followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.L.\n\nGargantua's speech to the vanquished.\n\nOur forefathers and ancestors of all times have been of this nature and\ndisposition, that, upon the winning of a battle, they have chosen rather,\nfor a sign and memorial of their triumphs and victories, to erect trophies\nand monuments in the hearts of the vanquished by clemency than by\narchitecture in the lands which they had conquered.  For they did hold in\ngreater estimation the lively remembrance of men purchased by liberality\nthan the dumb inscription of arches, pillars, and pyramids, subject to the\ninjury of storms and tempests, and to the envy of everyone.  You may very\nwell remember of the courtesy which by them was used towards the Bretons in\nthe battle of St. Aubin of Cormier and at the demolishing of Partenay.  You\nhave heard, and hearing admire, their gentle comportment towards those at\nthe barriers (the barbarians) of Spaniola, who had plundered, wasted, and\nransacked the maritime borders of Olone and Thalmondois.  All this\nhemisphere of the world was filled with the praises and congratulations\nwhich yourselves and your fathers made, when Alpharbal, King of Canarre,\nnot satisfied with his own fortunes, did most furiously invade the land of\nOnyx, and with cruel piracies molest all the Armoric Islands and confine\nregions of Britany.  Yet was he in a set naval fight justly taken and\nvanquished by my father, whom God preserve and protect.  But what?  Whereas\nother kings and emperors, yea, those who entitle themselves Catholics,\nwould have dealt roughly with him, kept him a close prisoner, and put him\nto an extreme high ransom, he entreated him very courteously, lodged him\nkindly with himself in his own palace, and out of his incredible mildness\nand gentle disposition sent him back with a safe conduct, laden with gifts,\nladen with favours, laden with all offices of friendship.  What fell out\nupon it?  Being returned into his country, he called a parliament, where\nall the princes and states of his kingdom being assembled, he showed them\nthe humanity which he had found in us, and therefore wished them to take\nsuch course by way of compensation therein as that the whole world might be\nedified by the example, as well of their honest graciousness to us as of\nour gracious honesty towards them.  The result hereof was, that it was\nvoted and decreed by an unanimous consent, that they should offer up\nentirely their lands, dominions, and kingdoms, to be disposed of by us\naccording to our pleasure.\n\nAlpharbal in his own person presently returned with nine thousand and\nthirty-eight great ships of burden, bringing with him the treasures, not\nonly of his house and royal lineage, but almost of all the country besides.\nFor he embarking himself, to set sail with a west-north-east wind, everyone\nin heaps did cast into the ship gold, silver, rings, jewels, spices, drugs,\nand aromatical perfumes, parrots, pelicans, monkeys, civet-cats,\nblack-spotted weasels, porcupines, &c.  He was accounted no good mother's\nson that did not cast in all the rare and precious things he had.\n\nBeing safely arrived, he came to my said father, and would have kissed his\nfeet.  That action was found too submissively low, and therefore was not\npermitted, but in exchange he was most cordially embraced.  He offered his\npresents; they were not received, because they were too excessive:  he\nyielded himself voluntarily a servant and vassal, and was content his whole\nposterity should be liable to the same bondage; this was not accepted of,\nbecause it seemed not equitable:  he surrendered, by virtue of the decree\nof his great parliamentary council, his whole countries and kingdoms to\nhim, offering the deed and conveyance, signed, sealed, and ratified by all\nthose that were concerned in it; this was altogether refused, and the\nparchments cast into the fire.  In end, this free goodwill and simple\nmeaning of the Canarians wrought such tenderness in my father's heart that\nhe could not abstain from shedding tears, and wept most profusely; then, by\nchoice words very congruously adapted, strove in what he could to diminish\nthe estimation of the good offices which he had done them, saying, that any\ncourtesy he had conferred upon them was not worth a rush, and what favour\nsoever he had showed them he was bound to do it.  But so much the more did\nAlpharbal augment the repute thereof.  What was the issue?  Whereas for his\nransom, in the greatest extremity of rigour and most tyrannical dealing,\ncould not have been exacted above twenty times a hundred thousand crowns,\nand his eldest sons detained as hostages till that sum had been paid, they\nmade themselves perpetual tributaries, and obliged to give us every year\ntwo millions of gold at four-and-twenty carats fine.  The first year we\nreceived the whole sum of two millions; the second year of their own accord\nthey paid freely to us three-and-twenty hundred thousand crowns; the third\nyear, six-and-twenty hundred thousand; the fourth year, three millions, and\ndo so increase it always out of their own goodwill that we shall be\nconstrained to forbid them to bring us any more.  This is the nature of\ngratitude and true thankfulness.  For time, which gnaws and diminisheth all\nthings else, augments and increaseth benefits; because a noble action of\nliberality, done to a man of reason, doth grow continually by his generous\nthinking of it and remembering it.\n\nBeing unwilling therefore any way to degenerate from the hereditary\nmildness and clemency of my parents, I do now forgive you, deliver you from\nall fines and imprisonments, fully release you, set you at liberty, and\nevery way make you as frank and free as ever you were before.  Moreover, at\nyour going out of the gate, you shall have every one of you three months'\npay to bring you home into your houses and families, and shall have a safe\nconvoy of six hundred cuirassiers and eight thousand foot under the conduct\nof Alexander, esquire of my body, that the clubmen of the country may not\ndo you any injury.  God be with you!  I am sorry from my heart that\nPicrochole is not here; for I would have given him to understand that this\nwar was undertaken against my will and without any hope to increase either\nmy goods or renown.  But seeing he is lost, and that no man can tell where\nnor how he went away, it is my will that his kingdom remain entire to his\nson; who, because he is too young, he not being yet full five years old,\nshall be brought up and instructed by the ancient princes and learned men\nof the kingdom.  And because a realm thus desolate may easily come to ruin,\nif the covetousness and avarice of those who by their places are obliged to\nadminister justice in it be not curbed and restrained, I ordain and will\nhave it so, that Ponocrates be overseer and superintendent above all his\ngovernors, with whatever power and authority is requisite thereto, and that\nhe be continually with the child until he find him able and capable to rule\nand govern by himself.\n\nNow I must tell you, that you are to understand how a too feeble and\ndissolute facility in pardoning evildoers giveth them occasion to commit\nwickedness afterwards more readily, upon this pernicious confidence of\nreceiving favour.  I consider that Moses, the meekest man that was in his\ntime upon the earth, did severely punish the mutinous and seditious people\nof Israel.  I consider likewise that Julius Caesar, who was so gracious an\nemperor that Cicero said of him that his fortune had nothing more excellent\nthan that he could, and his virtue nothing better than that he would always\nsave and pardon every man--he, notwithstanding all this, did in certain\nplaces most rigorously punish the authors of rebellion.  After the example\nof these good men, it is my will and pleasure that you deliver over unto me\nbefore you depart hence, first, that fine fellow Marquet, who was the prime\ncause, origin, and groundwork of this war by his vain presumption and\noverweening; secondly, his fellow cake-bakers, who were neglective in\nchecking and reprehending his idle hairbrained humour in the instant time;\nand lastly, all the councillors, captains, officers, and domestics of\nPicrochole, who had been incendiaries or fomenters of the war by provoking,\npraising, or counselling him to come out of his limits thus to trouble us.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LI.\n\nHow the victorious Gargantuists were recompensed after the battle.\n\nWhen Gargantua had finished his speech, the seditious men whom he required\nwere delivered up unto him, except Swashbuckler, Dirt-tail, and Smalltrash,\nwho ran away six hours before the battle--one of them as far as to\nLainiel-neck at one course, another to the valley of Vire, and the third\neven unto Logroine, without looking back or taking breath by the way--and\ntwo of the cake-bakers who were slain in the fight.  Gargantua did them no\nother hurt but that he appointed them to pull at the presses of his\nprinting-house which he had newly set up.  Then those who died there he\ncaused to be honourably buried in Black-soile valley and Burn-hag field, and\ngave order that the wounded should be dressed and had care of in his great\nhospital or nosocome.  After this, considering the great prejudice done to\nthe town and its inhabitants, he reimbursed their charges and repaired all\nthe losses that by their confession upon oath could appear they had\nsustained; and, for their better defence and security in times coming\nagainst all sudden uproars and invasions, commanded a strong citadel to be\nbuilt there with a competent garrison to maintain it.  At his departure he\ndid very graciously thank all the soldiers of the brigades that had been at\nthis overthrow, and sent them back to their winter-quarters in their several\nstations and garrisons; the decumane legion only excepted, whom in the field\non that day he saw do some great exploit, and their captains also, whom he\nbrought along with himself unto Grangousier.\n\nAt the sight and coming of them, the good man was so joyful, that it is not\npossible fully to describe it.  He made them a feast the most magnificent,\nplentiful, and delicious that ever was seen since the time of the king\nAhasuerus.  At the taking up of the table he distributed amongst them his\nwhole cupboard of plate, which weighed eight hundred thousand and fourteen\nbezants (Each bezant is worth five pounds English money.) of gold, in great\nantique vessels, huge pots, large basins, big tasses, cups, goblets,\ncandlesticks, comfit-boxes, and other such plate, all of pure massy gold,\nbesides the precious stones, enamelling, and workmanship, which by all\nmen's estimation was more worth than the matter of the gold.  Then unto\nevery one of them out of his coffers caused he to be given the sum of\ntwelve hundred thousand crowns ready money.  And, further, he gave to each\nof them for ever and in perpetuity, unless he should happen to decease\nwithout heirs, such castles and neighbouring lands of his as were most\ncommodious for them.  To Ponocrates he gave the rock Clermond; to Gymnast,\nthe Coudray; to Eudemon, Montpensier; Rivau, to Tolmere, to Ithibolle,\nMontsoreau; to Acamas, Cande; Varenes, to Chironacte; Gravot, to Sebast;\nQuinquenais, to Alexander; Legre, to Sophrone, and so of his other places.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LII.\n\nHow Gargantua caused to be built for the Monk the Abbey of Theleme.\n\nThere was left only the monk to provide for, whom Gargantua would have made\nAbbot of Seville, but he refused it.  He would have given him the Abbey of\nBourgueil, or of Sanct Florent, which was better, or both, if it pleased\nhim; but the monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never\ntake upon him the charge nor government of monks.  For how shall I be able,\nsaid he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of\nmyself?  If you think I have done you, or may hereafter do any acceptable\nservice, give me leave to found an abbey after my own mind and fancy.  The\nmotion pleased Gargantua very well, who thereupon offered him all the\ncountry of Theleme by the river of Loire till within two leagues of the\ngreat forest of Port-Huaulx.  The monk then requested Gargantua to\ninstitute his religious order contrary to all others.  First, then, said\nGargantua, you must not build a wall about your convent, for all other\nabbeys are strongly walled and mured about.  See, said the monk, and not\nwithout cause (seeing wall and mur signify but one and the same thing);\nwhere there is mur before and mur behind, there is store of murmur, envy,\nand mutual conspiracy.  Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the\nworld whereof the custom is, if any woman come in, I mean chaste and honest\nwomen, they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon;\ntherefore was it ordained, that if any man or woman entered into religious\norders should by chance come within this new abbey, all the rooms should be\nthoroughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed.  And because\nin all other monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited, and\nregulated by hours, it was decreed that in this new structure there should\nbe neither clock nor dial, but that according to the opportunities and\nincident occasions all their hours should be disposed of; for, said\nGargantua, the greatest loss of time that I know is to count the hours.\nWhat good comes of it?  Nor can there be any greater dotage in the world\nthan for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and\nnot by his own judgment and discretion.\n\nItem, Because at that time they put no women into nunneries but such as\nwere either purblind, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-favoured, misshapen,\nfools, senseless, spoiled, or corrupt; nor encloistered any men but those\nthat were either sickly, subject to defluxions, ill-bred louts, simple\nsots, or peevish trouble-houses.  But to the purpose, said the monk.  A\nwoman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she?  To make a nun\nof, said Gargantua.  Yea, said the monk, and to make shirts and smocks.\nTherefore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admitted\nno women that were not fair, well-featured, and of a sweet disposition; nor\nmen that were not comely, personable, and well conditioned.\n\nItem, Because in the convents of women men come not but underhand, privily,\nand by stealth, it was therefore enacted that in this house there shall be\nno women in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women.\n\nItem, Because both men and women that are received into religious orders\nafter the expiring of their noviciate or probation year were constrained\nand forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life, it was\ntherefore ordered that all whatever, men or women, admitted within this\nabbey, should have full leave to depart with peace and contentment\nwhensoever it should seem good to them so to do.\n\nItem, for that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three vows,\nto wit, those of chastity, poverty, and obedience, it was therefore\nconstituted and appointed that in this convent they might be honourably\nmarried, that they might be rich, and live at liberty.  In regard of the\nlegitimate time of the persons to be initiated, and years under and above\nwhich they were not capable of reception, the women were to be admitted\nfrom ten till fifteen, and the men from twelve till eighteen.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LIII.\n\nHow the abbey of the Thelemites was built and endowed.\n\nFor the fabric and furniture of the abbey Gargantua caused to be delivered\nout in ready money seven-and-twenty hundred thousand, eight hundred and\none-and-thirty of those golden rams of Berry which have a sheep stamped on\nthe one side and a flowered cross on the other; and for every year, until\nthe whole work were completed, he allotted threescore nine thousand crowns\nof the sun, and as many of the seven stars, to be charged all upon the\nreceipt of the custom.  For the foundation and maintenance thereof for\never, he settled a perpetual fee-farm-rent of three-and-twenty hundred,\nthree score and nine thousand, five hundred and fourteen rose nobles,\nexempted from all homage, fealty, service, or burden whatsoever, and\npayable every year at the gate of the abbey; and of this by letters patent\npassed a very good grant.  The architecture was in a figure hexagonal, and\nin such a fashion that in every one of the six corners there was built a\ngreat round tower of threescore foot in diameter, and were all of a like\nform and bigness.  Upon the north side ran along the river of Loire, on the\nbank whereof was situated the tower called Arctic.  Going towards the east,\nthere was another called Calaer,--the next following Anatole,--the next\nMesembrine,--the next Hesperia, and the last Criere.  Every tower was\ndistant from other the space of three hundred and twelve paces.  The whole\nedifice was everywhere six storeys high, reckoning the cellars underground\nfor one.  The second was arched after the fashion of a basket-handle; the\nrest were ceiled with pure wainscot, flourished with Flanders fretwork, in\nthe form of the foot of a lamp, and covered above with fine slates, with an\nendorsement of lead, carrying the antique figures of little puppets and\nanimals of all sorts, notably well suited to one another, and gilt,\ntogether with the gutters, which, jutting without the walls from betwixt\nthe crossbars in a diagonal figure, painted with gold and azure, reached to\nthe very ground, where they ended into great conduit-pipes, which carried\nall away unto the river from under the house.\n\nThis same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent than\never was Bonnivet, Chambourg, or Chantilly; for there were in it nine\nthousand, three hundred and two-and-thirty chambers, every one whereof had\na withdrawing-room, a handsome closet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat\npassage, leading into a great and spacious hall.  Between every tower in\nthe midst of the said body of building there was a pair of winding, such as\nwe now call lantern stairs, whereof the steps were part of porphyry, which\nis a dark red marble spotted with white, part of Numidian stone, which is a\nkind of yellowishly-streaked marble upon various colours, and part of\nserpentine marble, with light spots on a dark green ground, each of those\nsteps being two-and-twenty foot in length and three fingers thick, and the\njust number of twelve betwixt every rest, or, as we now term it,\nlanding-place.  In every resting-place were two fair antique arches where\nthe light came in:  and by those they went into a cabinet, made even with\nand of the breadth of the said winding, and the reascending above the roofs\nof the house ended conically in a pavilion.  By that vise or winding they\nentered on every side into a great hall, and from the halls into the\nchambers. From the Arctic tower unto the Criere were the fair great\nlibraries in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish,\nrespectively distributed in their several cantons, according to the\ndiversity of these languages.  In the midst there was a wonderful scalier or\nwinding-stair, the entry whereof was without the house, in a vault or arch\nsix fathom broad.  It was made in such symmetry and largeness that six\nmen-at-arms with their lances in their rests might together in a breast ride\nall up to the very top of all the palace.  From the tower Anatole to the\nMesembrine were fair spacious galleries, all coloured over and painted with\nthe ancient prowesses, histories, and descriptions of the world.  In the\nmidst thereof there was likewise such another ascent and gate as we said\nthere was on the river-side.  Upon that gate was written in great antique\nletters that which followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LIV.\n\nThe inscription set upon the great gate of Theleme.\n\nHere enter not vile bigots, hypocrites,\nExternally devoted apes, base snites,\nPuffed-up, wry-necked beasts, worse than the Huns,\nOr Ostrogoths, forerunners of baboons:\nCursed snakes, dissembled varlets, seeming sancts,\nSlipshod caffards, beggars pretending wants,\nFat chuffcats, smell-feast knockers, doltish gulls,\nOut-strouting cluster-fists, contentious bulls,\nFomenters of divisions and debates,\nElsewhere, not here, make sale of your deceits.\n\n  Your filthy trumperies\n  Stuffed with pernicious lies\n    (Not worth a bubble),\n    Would do but trouble\n  Our earthly paradise,\n  Your filthy trumperies.\n\nHere enter not attorneys, barristers,\nNor bridle-champing law-practitioners:\nClerks, commissaries, scribes, nor pharisees,\nWilful disturbers of the people's ease:\nJudges, destroyers, with an unjust breath,\nOf honest men, like dogs, even unto death.\nYour salary is at the gibbet-foot:\nGo drink there! for we do not here fly out\nOn those excessive courses, which may draw\nA waiting on your courts by suits in law.\n\n  Lawsuits, debates, and wrangling\n  Hence are exiled, and jangling.\n    Here we are very\n    Frolic and merry,\n  And free from all entangling,\n  Lawsuits, debates, and wrangling.\n\nHere enter not base pinching usurers,\nPelf-lickers, everlasting gatherers,\nGold-graspers, coin-gripers, gulpers of mists,\nNiggish deformed sots, who, though your chests\nVast sums of money should to you afford,\nWould ne'ertheless add more unto that hoard,\nAnd yet not be content,--you clunchfist dastards,\nInsatiable fiends, and Pluto's bastards,\nGreedy devourers, chichy sneakbill rogues,\nHell-mastiffs gnaw your bones, you ravenous dogs.\n\n  You beastly-looking fellows,\n  Reason doth plainly tell us\n    That we should not\n    To you allot\n  Room here, but at the gallows,\n  You beastly-looking fellows.\n\nHere enter not fond makers of demurs\nIn love adventures, peevish, jealous curs,\nSad pensive dotards, raisers of garboils,\nHags, goblins, ghosts, firebrands of household broils,\nNor drunkards, liars, cowards, cheaters, clowns,\nThieves, cannibals, faces o'ercast with frowns,\nNor lazy slugs, envious, covetous,\nNor blockish, cruel, nor too credulous,--\nHere mangy, pocky folks shall have no place,\nNo ugly lusks, nor persons of disgrace.\n\n  Grace, honour, praise, delight,\n  Here sojourn day and night.\n    Sound bodies lined\n    With a good mind,\n  Do here pursue with might\n  Grace, honour, praise, delight.\n\nHere enter you, and welcome from our hearts,\nAll noble sparks, endowed with gallant parts.\nThis is the glorious place, which bravely shall\nAfford wherewith to entertain you all.\nWere you a thousand, here you shall not want\nFor anything; for what you'll ask we'll grant.\nStay here, you lively, jovial, handsome, brisk,\nGay, witty, frolic, cheerful, merry, frisk,\nSpruce, jocund, courteous, furtherers of trades,\nAnd, in a word, all worthy gentle blades.\n\n  Blades of heroic breasts\n  Shall taste here of the feasts,\n    Both privily\n    And civilly\n  Of the celestial guests,\n  Blades of heroic breasts.\n\nHere enter you, pure, honest, faithful, true\nExpounders of the Scriptures old and new.\nWhose glosses do not blind our reason, but\nMake it to see the clearer, and who shut\nIts passages from hatred, avarice,\nPride, factions, covenants, and all sort of vice.\nCome, settle here a charitable faith,\nWhich neighbourly affection nourisheth.\nAnd whose light chaseth all corrupters hence,\nOf the blest word, from the aforesaid sense.\n\n  The holy sacred Word,\n  May it always afford\n    T' us all in common,\n    Both man and woman,\n  A spiritual shield and sword,\n  The holy sacred Word.\n\nHere enter you all ladies of high birth,\nDelicious, stately, charming, full of mirth,\nIngenious, lovely, miniard, proper, fair,\nMagnetic, graceful, splendid, pleasant, rare,\nObliging, sprightly, virtuous, young, solacious,\nKind, neat, quick, feat, bright, compt, ripe, choice, dear, precious.\nAlluring, courtly, comely, fine, complete,\nWise, personable, ravishing, and sweet,\nCome joys enjoy.

Upon the top thereof stood the three Graces, with their\ncornucopias, or horns of abundance, and did jet out the water at their\nbreasts, mouth, ears, eyes, and other open passages of the body.  The\ninside of the buildings in this lower court stood upon great pillars of\nchalcedony stone and porphyry marble made archways after a goodly antique\nfashion.  Within those were spacious galleries, long and large, adorned\nwith curious pictures, the horns of bucks and unicorns:  with rhinoceroses,\nwater-horses called hippopotames, the teeth and tusks of elephants, and\nother things well worth the beholding.  The lodging of the ladies, for so\nwe may call those gallant women, took up all from the tower Arctic unto the\ngate Mesembrine.  The men possessed the rest.  Before the said lodging of\nthe ladies, that they might have their recreation, between the two first\ntowers, on the outside, were placed the tiltyard, the barriers or lists for\ntournaments, the hippodrome or riding-court, the theatre or public\nplayhouse, and natatory or place to swim in, with most admirable baths in\nthree stages, situated above one another, well furnished with all necessary\naccommodation, and store of myrtle-water.  By the river-side was the fair\ngarden of pleasure, and in the midst of that the glorious labyrinth.\nBetween the two other towers were the courts for the tennis and the\nballoon.  Towards the tower Criere stood the orchard full of all\nfruit-trees, set and ranged in a quincuncial order.  At the end of that was\nthe great park, abounding with all sort of venison.  Betwixt the third\ncouple of towers were the butts and marks for shooting with a snapwork gun,\nan ordinary bow for common archery, or with a crossbow.  The office-houses\nwere without the tower Hesperia, of one storey high.  The stables were\nbeyond the offices, and before them stood the falconry, managed by\nostrich-keepers and falconers very expert in the art, and it was yearly\nsupplied and furnished by the Candians, Venetians, Sarmates, now called\nMuscoviters, with all sorts of most excellent hawks, eagles, gerfalcons,\ngoshawks, sacres, lanners, falcons, sparrowhawks, marlins, and other kinds\nof them, so gentle and perfectly well manned, that, flying of themselves\nsometimes from the castle for their own disport, they would not fail to\ncatch whatever they encountered.  The venery, where the beagles and hounds\nwere kept, was a little farther off, drawing towards the park.\n\nAll the halls, chambers, and closets or cabinets were richly hung with\ntapestry and hangings of divers sorts, according to the variety of the\nseasons of the year.  All the pavements and floors were covered with green\ncloth.  The beds were all embroidered.  In every back-chamber or\nwithdrawing-room there was a looking-glass of pure crystal set in a frame\nof fine gold, garnished all about with pearls, and was of such greatness\nthat it would represent to the full the whole lineaments and proportion of\nthe person that stood before it.  At the going out of the halls which\nbelong to the ladies' lodgings were the perfumers and trimmers through\nwhose hands the gallants passed when they were to visit the ladies.  Those\nsweet artificers did every morning furnish the ladies' chambers with the\nspirit of roses, orange-flower-water, and angelica; and to each of them\ngave a little precious casket vapouring forth the most odoriferous\nexhalations of the choicest aromatical scents.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LVI.\n\nHow the men and women of the religious order of Theleme were apparelled.\n\nThe ladies at the foundation of this order were apparelled after their own\npleasure and liking; but, since that of their own accord and free will they\nhave reformed themselves, their accoutrement is in manner as followeth.\nThey wore stockings of scarlet crimson, or ingrained purple dye, which\nreached just three inches above the knee, having a list beautified with\nexquisite embroideries and rare incisions of the cutter's art.  Their\ngarters were of the colour of their bracelets, and circled the knee a\nlittle both over and under.  Their shoes, pumps, and slippers were either\nof red, violet, or crimson-velvet, pinked and jagged like lobster waddles.\n\nNext to their smock they put on the pretty kirtle or vasquin of pure silk\ncamlet:  above that went the taffety or tabby farthingale, of white, red,\ntawny, grey, or of any other colour.  Above this taffety petticoat they had\nanother of cloth of tissue or brocade, embroidered with fine gold and\ninterlaced with needlework, or as they thought good, and according to the\ntemperature and disposition of the weather had their upper coats of satin,\ndamask, or velvet, and those either orange, tawny, green, ash-coloured,\nblue, yellow, bright red, crimson, or white, and so forth; or had them of\ncloth of gold, cloth of silver, or some other choice stuff, enriched with\npurl, or embroidered according to the dignity of the festival days and\ntimes wherein they wore them.\n\nTheir gowns, being still correspondent to the season, were either of cloth\nof gold frizzled with a silver-raised work; of red satin, covered with gold\npurl; of tabby, or taffety, white, blue, black, tawny, &c., of silk serge,\nsilk camlet, velvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, gold\nwire, figured velvet, or figured satin tinselled and overcast with golden\nthreads, in divers variously purfled draughts.\n\nIn the summer some days instead of gowns they wore light handsome mantles,\nmade either of the stuff of the aforesaid attire, or like Moresco rugs, of\nviolet velvet frizzled, with a raised work of gold upon silver purl, or\nwith a knotted cord-work of gold embroidery, everywhere garnished with\nlittle Indian pearls.  They always carried a fair panache, or plume of\nfeathers, of the colour of their muff, bravely adorned and tricked out with\nglistering spangles of gold.  In the winter time they had their taffety\ngowns of all colours, as above-named, and those lined with the rich\nfurrings of hind-wolves, or speckled lynxes, black-spotted weasels, martlet\nskins of Calabria, sables, and other costly furs of an inestimable value.\nTheir beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets, and neck-chains were all\nof precious stones, such as carbuncles, rubies, baleus, diamonds,\nsapphires, emeralds, turquoises, garnets, agates, beryls, and excellent\nmargarites.  Their head-dressing also varied with the season of the year,\naccording to which they decked themselves.  In winter it was of the French\nfashion; in the spring, of the Spanish; in summer, of the fashion of\nTuscany, except only upon the holy days and Sundays, at which times they\nwere accoutred in the French mode, because they accounted it more\nhonourable and better befitting the garb of a matronal pudicity.\n\nThe men were apparelled after their fashion.  Their stockings were of\ntamine or of cloth serge, of white, black, scarlet, or some other ingrained\ncolour.  Their breeches were of velvet, of the same colour with their\nstockings, or very near, embroidered and cut according to their fancy.\nTheir doublet was of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of velvet, satin,\ndamask, taffeties, &c., of the same colours, cut, embroidered, and suitably\ntrimmed up in perfection.  The points were of silk of the same colours; the\ntags were of gold well enamelled.  Their coats and jerkins were of cloth of\ngold, cloth of silver, gold, tissue or velvet embroidered, as they thought\nfit.  Their gowns were every whit as costly as those of the ladies.  Their\ngirdles were of silks, of the colour of their doublets.  Every one had a\ngallant sword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the\nscabbard of velvet, of the colour of his breeches, with a chape of gold,\nand pure goldsmith's work.  The dagger was of the same.  Their caps or\nbonnets were of black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold.\nUpon that they wore a white plume, most prettily and minion-like parted by\nso many rows of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more\nsparkling resplendency fair rubies, emeralds, diamonds, &c., but there was\nsuch a sympathy betwixt the gallants and the ladies, that every day they\nwere apparelled in the same livery.  And that they might not miss, there\nwere certain gentlemen appointed to tell the youths every morning what\nvestments the ladies would on that day wear:  for all was done according to\nthe pleasure of the ladies.  In these so handsome clothes, and habiliments\nso rich, think not that either one or other of either sex did waste any\ntime at all; for the masters of the wardrobes had all their raiments and\napparel so ready for every morning, and the chamber-ladies so well skilled,\nthat in a trice they would be dressed and completely in their clothes from\nhead to foot.  And to have those accoutrements with the more conveniency,\nthere was about the wood of Theleme a row of houses of the extent of half a\nleague, very neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the goldsmiths, lapidaries,\njewellers, embroiderers, tailors, gold-drawers, velvet-weavers,\ntapestry-makers and upholsterers, who wrought there every one in his own\ntrade, and all for the aforesaid jolly friars and nuns of the new stamp.\nThey were furnished with matter and stuff from the hands of the Lord\nNausiclete, who every year brought them seven ships from the Perlas and\nCannibal Islands, laden with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearls and\nprecious stones. And if any margarites, called unions, began to grow old and\nlose somewhat of their natural whiteness and lustre, those with their art\nthey did renew by tendering them to eat to some pretty cocks, as they use to\ngive casting unto hawks.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LVII.\n\nHow the Thelemites were governed, and of their manner of living.\n\nAll their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to\ntheir own free will and pleasure.  They rose out of their beds when they\nthought good; they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to\nit and were disposed for it.  None did awake them, none did offer to\nconstrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had\nGargantua established it.  In all their rule and strictest tie of their\norder there was but this one clause to be observed,\n\nDo What Thou Wilt;\n\nbecause men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conversant in honest\ncompanies, have naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth them unto\nvirtuous actions, and withdraws them from vice, which is called honour.\nThose same men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought\nunder and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposition by which they\nformerly were inclined to virtue, to shake off and break that bond of\nservitude wherein they are so tyrannously enslaved; for it is agreeable\nwith the nature of man to long after things forbidden and to desire what is\ndenied us.\n\nBy this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation to do all of\nthem what they saw did please one.  If any of the gallants or ladies should\nsay, Let us drink, they would all drink.  If any one of them said, Let us\nplay, they all played.  If one said, Let us go a-walking into the fields\nthey went all.  If it were to go a-hawking or a-hunting, the ladies mounted\nupon dainty well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on\ntheir lovely fists, miniardly begloved every one of them, either a\nsparrowhawk or a laneret or a marlin, and the young gallants carried the\nother kinds of hawks.  So nobly were they taught, that there was neither he\nnor she amongst them but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical\ninstruments, speak five or six several languages, and compose in them all\nvery quaintly, both in verse and prose.  Never were seen so valiant\nknights, so noble and worthy, so dexterous and skilful both on foot and\na-horse-back, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better\nhandling all manner of weapons than were there.  Never were seen ladies so\nproper and handsome, so miniard and dainty, less froward, or more ready\nwith their hand and with their needle in every honest and free action\nbelonging to that sex, than were there.  For this reason, when the time\ncame that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of his parents,\nor for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carried along with\nhim one of the ladies, namely, her whom he had before that chosen for his\nmistress, and (they) were married together.  And if they had formerly in\nTheleme lived in good devotion and amity, they did continue therein and\nincrease it to a greater height in their state of matrimony; and did\nentertain that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no less\nvigour and fervency than at the very day of their wedding.  Here must not I\nforget to set down unto you a riddle which was found under the ground as\nthey were laying the foundation of the abbey, engraven in a copper plate,\nand it was thus as followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 1.LVIII.\n\nA prophetical Riddle.\n\nPoor mortals, who wait for a happy day,\nCheer up your hearts, and hear what I shall say:\nIf it be lawful firmly to believe\nThat the celestial bodies can us give\nWisdom to judge of things that are not yet;\nOr if from heaven such wisdom we may get\nAs may with confidence make us discourse\nOf years to come, their destiny and course;\nI to my hearers give to understand\nThat this next winter, though it be at hand,\nYea and before, there shall appear a race\nOf men who, loth to sit still in one place,\nShall boldly go before all people's eyes,\nSuborning men of divers qualities\nTo draw them unto covenants and sides,\nIn such a manner that, whate'er betides,\nThey'll move you, if you give them ear, no doubt,\nWith both your friends and kindred to fall out.\nThey'll make a vassal to gain-stand his lord,\nAnd children their own parents; in a word,\nAll reverence shall then be banished,\nNo true respect to other shall be had.\nThey'll say that every man should have his turn,\nBoth in his going forth and his return;\nAnd hereupon there shall arise such woes,\nSuch jarrings, and confused to's and fro's,\nThat never were in history such coils\nSet down as yet, such tumults and garboils.\nThen shall you many gallant men see by\nValour stirr'd up, and youthful fervency,\nWho, trusting too much in their hopeful time,\nLive but a while, and perish in their prime.\nNeither shall any, who this course shall run,\nLeave off the race which he hath once begun,\nTill they the heavens with noise by their contention\nHave fill'd, and with their steps the earth's dimension.\nThen those shall have no less authority,\nThat have no faith, than those that will not lie;\nFor all shall be governed by a rude,\nBase, ignorant, and foolish multitude;\nThe veriest lout of all shall be their judge,\nO horrible and dangerous deluge!\nDeluge I call it, and that for good reason,\nFor this shall be omitted in no season;\nNor shall the earth of this foul stir be free,\nTill suddenly you in great store shall see\nThe waters issue out, with whose streams the\nMost moderate of all shall moistened be,\nAnd justly too; because they did not spare\nThe flocks of beasts that innocentest are,\nBut did their sinews and their bowels take,\nNot to the gods a sacrifice to make,\nBut usually to serve themselves for sport:\nAnd now consider, I do you exhort,\nIn such commotions so continual,\nWhat rest can take the globe terrestrial?\nMost happy then are they, that can it hold,\nAnd use it carefully as precious gold,\nBy keeping it in gaol, whence it shall have\nNo help but him who being to it gave.\nAnd to increase his mournful accident,\nThe sun, before it set in th' occident,\nShall cease to dart upon it any light,\nMore than in an eclipse, or in the night,--\nSo that at once its favour shall be gone,\nAnd liberty with it be left alone.\nAnd yet, before it come to ruin thus,\nIts quaking shall be as impetuous\nAs Aetna's was when Titan's sons lay under,\nAnd yield, when lost, a fearful sound like thunder.\nInarime did not more quickly move,\nWhen Typheus did the vast huge hills remove,\nAnd for despite into the sea them threw.\n  Thus shall it then be lost by ways not few,\nAnd changed suddenly, when those that have it\nTo other men that after come shall leave it.\nThen shall it be high time to cease from this\nSo long, so great, so tedious exercise;\nFor the great waters told you now by me,\nWill make each think where his retreat shall be;\nAnd yet, before that they be clean disperst,\nYou may behold in th' air, where nought was erst,\nThe burning heat of a great flame to rise,\nLick up the water, and the enterprise.\n  It resteth after those things to declare,\nThat those shall sit content who chosen are,\nWith all good things, and with celestial man (ne,)\nAnd richly recompensed every man:\nThe others at the last all stripp'd shall be,\nThat after this great work all men may see,\nHow each shall have his due.  This is their lot;\nO he is worthy praise that shrinketh not!\n\nNo sooner was this enigmatical monument read over, but Gargantua, fetching\na very deep sigh, said unto those that stood by, It is not now only, I\nperceive, that people called to the faith of the gospel, and convinced with\nthe certainty of evangelical truths, are persecuted.  But happy is that man\nthat shall not be scandalized, but shall always continue to the end in\naiming at that mark which God by his dear Son hath set before us, without\nbeing distracted or diverted by his carnal affections and depraved nature.\n\nThe monk then said, What do you think in your conscience is meant and\nsignified by this riddle?  What? said Gargantua,--the progress and carrying\non of the divine truth.  By St. Goderan, said the monk, that is not my\nexposition.  It is the style of the prophet Merlin.  Make upon it as many\ngrave allegories and glosses as you will, and dote upon it you and the rest\nof the world as long as you please; for my part, I can conceive no other\nmeaning in it but a description of a set at tennis in dark and obscure\nterms.  The suborners of men are the makers of matches, which are commonly\nfriends.  After the two chases are made, he that was in the upper end of\nthe tennis-court goeth out, and the other cometh in.  They believe the\nfirst that saith the ball was over or under the line.  The waters are the\nheats that the players take till they sweat again.  The cords of the\nrackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats.  The globe terrestrial is\nthe tennis-ball.  After playing, when the game is done, they refresh\nthemselves before a clear fire, and change their shirts; and very willingly\nthey make all good cheer, but most merrily those that have gained.  And so,\nfarewell!\n\n\nEnd book 1\n\n\nTHE SECOND BOOK.\n\n\n\nFor the Reader.\n\nThe Reader here may be pleased to take notice that the copy of verses by\nthe title of 'Rablophila', premised to the first book of this translation,\nbeing but a kind of mock poem, in imitation of somewhat lately published\n(as to any indifferent observer will easily appear, by the false quantities\nin the Latin, the abusive strain of the English, and extravagant\nsubscription to both), and as such, by a friend of the translator's, at the\ndesire of some frolic gentlemen of his acquaintance, more for a trial of\nskill than prejudicacy to any, composed in his jollity to please their\nfancies, was only ordained to be prefixed to a dozen of books, and no more,\nthereby to save the labour of transcribing so many as were requisite for\nsatisfying the curiosity of a company of just that number; and that,\ntherefore, the charging of the whole impression with it is merely to be\nimputed to the negligence of the pressmen, who, receiving it about the\nlatter end of the night, were so eager before the next morning to afford\ncomplete books, that, as they began, they went on, without animadverting\nwhat was recommended to their discretion.  This is hoped will suffice to\nassure the ingenuous Reader that in no treatise of the translator's,\nwhether original or translatitious, shall willingly be offered the meanest\nrub to the reputation of any worthy gentleman, and that, however providence\ndispose of him, no misfortune shall be able to induce his mind to any\ncomplacency in the disparagement of another.\n\nAgain.\n\nThe Pentateuch of Rabelais mentioned in the title-page of the first book of\nthis translation being written originally in the French tongue (as it\ncomprehendeth some of its brusquest dialects), with so much ingeniosity and\nwit, that more impressions have been sold thereof in that language than of\nany other book that hath been set forth at any time within these fifteen\nhundred years; so difficult nevertheless to be turned into any other speech\nthat many prime spirits in most of the nations of Europe, since the year\n1573, which was fourscore years ago, after having attempted it, were\nconstrained with no small regret to give it over as a thing impossible to\nbe done, is now in its translation thus far advanced, and the remainder\nfaithfully undertaken with the same hand to be rendered into English by a\nperson of quality, who (though his lands be sequestered, his house\ngarrisoned, his other goods sold, and himself detained a prisoner of war at\nLondon, for his having been at Worcester fight) hath, at the most earnest\nentreaty of some of his especial friends well acquainted with his\ninclination to the performance of conducible singularities, promised,\nbesides his version of these two already published, very speedily to offer\nup unto this Isle of Britain the virginity of the translation of the other\nthree most admirable books of the aforesaid author; provided that by the\nplurality of judicious and understanding men it be not declared he hath\nalready proceeded too far, or that the continuation of the rigour whereby\nhe is dispossessed of all his both real and personal estate, by pressing\ntoo hard upon him, be not an impediment thereto, and to other more eminent\nundertakings of his, as hath been oftentimes very fully mentioned by the\nsaid translator in several original treatises of his own penning, lately by\nhim so numerously dispersed that there is scarce any, who being skilful in\nthe English idiom, or curious of any new ingenious invention, hath not\neither read them or heard of them.\n\n\n\nMr. Hugh Salel to Rabelais.\n\nIf profit mixed with pleasure may suffice\nT' extol an author's worth above the skies,\nThou certainly for both must praised be:\nI know it; for thy judgment hath in the\nContexture of this book set down such high\nContentments, mingled with utility,\nThat (as I think) I see Democritus\nLaughing at men as things ridiculous.\n    Insist in thy design; for, though we prove\n    Ungrate on earth, thy merit is above.\n\n\n\nThe Author's Prologue.\n\nMost illustrious and thrice valorous champions, gentlemen and others, who\nwillingly apply your minds to the entertainment of pretty conceits and\nhonest harmless knacks of wit; you have not long ago seen, read, and\nunderstood the great and inestimable Chronicle of the huge and mighty giant\nGargantua, and, like upright faithfullists, have firmly believed all to be\ntrue that is contained in them, and have very often passed your time with\nthem amongst honourable ladies and gentlewomen, telling them fair long\nstories, when you were out of all other talk, for which you are worthy of\ngreat praise and sempiternal memory.  And I do heartily wish that every man\nwould lay aside his own business, meddle no more with his profession nor\ntrade, and throw all affairs concerning himself behind his back, to attend\nthis wholly, without distracting or troubling his mind with anything else,\nuntil he have learned them without book; that if by chance the art of\nprinting should cease, or in case that in time to come all books should\nperish, every man might truly teach them unto his children, and deliver\nthem over to his successors and survivors from hand to hand as a religious\ncabal; for there is in it more profit than a rabble of great pocky\nloggerheads are able to discern, who surely understand far less in these\nlittle merriments than the fool Raclet did in the Institutions of\nJustinian.\n\nI have known great and mighty lords, and of those not a few, who, going\na-deer-hunting, or a-hawking after wild ducks, when the chase had not\nencountered with the blinks that were cast in her way to retard her course,\nor that the hawk did but plain and smoothly fly without moving her wings,\nperceiving the prey by force of flight to have gained bounds of her, have\nbeen much chafed and vexed, as you understand well enough; but the comfort\nunto which they had refuge, and that they might not take cold, was to\nrelate the inestimable deeds of the said Gargantua.  There are others in\nthe world--these are no flimflam stories, nor tales of a tub--who, being\nmuch troubled with the toothache, after they had spent their goods upon\nphysicians without receiving at all any ease of their pain, have found no\nmore ready remedy than to put the said Chronicles betwixt two pieces of\nlinen cloth made somewhat hot, and so apply them to the place that\nsmarteth, sinapizing them with a little powder of projection, otherwise\ncalled doribus.\n\nBut what shall I say of those poor men that are plagued with the pox and\nthe gout?  O how often have we seen them, even immediately after they were\nanointed and thoroughly greased, till their faces did glister like the\nkeyhole of a powdering tub, their teeth dance like the jacks of a pair of\nlittle organs or virginals when they are played upon, and that they foamed\nfrom their very throats like a boar which the mongrel mastiff-hounds have\ndriven in and overthrown amongst the toils,--what did they then?  All their\nconsolation was to have some page of the said jolly book read unto them.\nAnd we have seen those who have given themselves to a hundred puncheons of\nold devils, in case that they did not feel a manifest ease and assuagement\nof pain at the hearing of the said book read, even when they were kept in a\npurgatory of torment; no more nor less than women in travail use to find\ntheir sorrow abated when the life of St. Margaret is read unto them.  Is\nthis nothing?  Find me a book in any language, in any faculty or science\nwhatsoever, that hath such virtues, properties, and prerogatives, and I\nwill be content to pay you a quart of tripes.  No, my masters, no; it is\npeerless, incomparable, and not to be matched; and this am I resolved for\never to maintain even unto the fire exclusive.  And those that will\npertinaciously hold the contrary opinion, let them be accounted abusers,\npredestinators, impostors, and seducers of the people.  It is very true\nthat there are found in some gallant and stately books, worthy of high\nestimation, certain occult and hid properties; in the number of which are\nreckoned Whippot, Orlando Furioso, Robert the Devil, Fierabras, William\nwithout Fear, Huon of Bordeaux, Monteville, and Matabrune: but they are not\ncomparable to that which we speak of, and the world hath well known by\ninfallible experience the great emolument and utility which it hath\nreceived by this Gargantuine Chronicle, for the printers have sold more of\nthem in two months' time than there will be bought of Bibles in nine years.\n\nI therefore, your humble slave, being very willing to increase your solace\nand recreation yet a little more, do offer you for a present another book\nof the same stamp, only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of\ncredit than the other was.  For think not, unless you wilfully will err\nagainst your knowledge, that I speak of it as the Jews do of the Law.  I\nwas not born under such a planet, neither did it ever befall me to lie, or\naffirm a thing for true that was not.  I speak of it like a lusty frolic\nonocrotary (Onocratal is a bird not much unlike a swan, which sings like an\nass's braying.), I should say crotenotary (Crotenotaire or notaire crotte,\ncroquenotaire or notaire croque are but allusions in derision of\nprotonotaire, which signifieth a pregnotary.) of the martyrized lovers, and\ncroquenotary of love.  Quod vidimus, testamur.  It is of the horrible and\ndreadful feats and prowesses of Pantagruel, whose menial servant I have\nbeen ever since I was a page, till this hour that by his leave I am\npermitted to visit my cow-country, and to know if any of my kindred there\nbe alive.\n\nAnd therefore, to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give myself to a\nhundred panniersful of fair devils, body and soul, tripes and guts, in case\nthat I lie so much as one single word in this whole history; after the like\nmanner, St. Anthony's fire burn you, Mahoom's disease whirl you, the\nsquinance with a stitch in your side and the wolf in your stomach truss\nyou, the bloody flux seize upon you, the cursed sharp inflammations of\nwild-fire, as slender and thin as cow's hair strengthened with quicksilver,\nenter into your fundament, and, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, may you\nfall into sulphur, fire, and bottomless pits, in case you do not firmly\nbelieve all that I shall relate unto you in this present Chronicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND BOOK.\n\n\nChapter 2.I.\n\nOf the original and antiquity of the great Pantagruel.\n\nIt will not be an idle nor unprofitable thing, seeing we are at leisure, to\nput you in mind of the fountain and original source whence is derived unto\nus the good Pantagruel.  For I see that all good historiographers have thus\nhandled their chronicles, not only the Arabians, Barbarians, and Latins,\nbut also the gentle Greeks, who were eternal drinkers.  You must therefore\nremark that at the beginning of the world--I speak of a long time; it is\nabove forty quarantains, or forty times forty nights, according to the\nsupputation of the ancient Druids--a little after that Abel was killed by\nhis brother Cain, the earth, imbrued with the blood of the just, was one\nyear so exceeding fertile in all those fruits which it usually produceth to\nus, and especially in medlars, that ever since throughout all ages it hath\nbeen called the year of the great medlars; for three of them did fill a\nbushel.  In it the kalends were found by the Grecian almanacks.  There was\nthat year nothing of the month of March in the time of Lent, and the middle\nof August was in May.  In the month of October, as I take it, or at least\nSeptember, that I may not err, for I will carefully take heed of that, was\nthe week so famous in the annals, which they call the week of the three\nThursdays; for it had three of them by means of their irregular leap-years,\ncalled Bissextiles, occasioned by the sun's having tripped and stumbled a\nlittle towards the left hand, like a debtor afraid of sergeants, coming\nright upon him to arrest him:  and the moon varied from her course above\nfive fathom, and there was manifestly seen the motion of trepidation in the\nfirmament of the fixed stars, called Aplanes, so that the middle Pleiade,\nleaving her fellows, declined towards the equinoctial, and the star named\nSpica left the constellation of the Virgin to withdraw herself towards the\nBalance, known by the name of Libra, which are cases very terrible, and\nmatters so hard and difficult that astrologians cannot set their teeth in\nthem; and indeed their teeth had been pretty long if they could have\nreached thither.\n\nHowever, account you it for a truth that everybody then did most heartily\neat of these medlars, for they were fair to the eye and in taste delicious.\nBut even as Noah, that holy man, to whom we are so much beholding, bound,\nand obliged, for that he planted to us the vine, from whence we have that\nnectarian, delicious, precious, heavenly, joyful, and deific liquor which\nthey call the piot or tiplage, was deceived in the drinking of it, for he\nwas ignorant of the great virtue and power thereof; so likewise the men and\nwomen of that time did delight much in the eating of that fair great fruit,\nbut divers and very different accidents did ensue thereupon; for there fell\nupon them all in their bodies a most terrible swelling, but not upon all in\nthe same place, for some were swollen in the belly, and their belly\nstrouted out big like a great tun, of whom it is written, Ventrem\nomnipotentem, who were all very honest men, and merry blades.  And of this\nrace came St. Fatgulch and Shrove Tuesday (Pansart, Mardigras.).  Others\ndid swell at the shoulders, who in that place were so crump and knobby that\nthey were therefore called Montifers, which is as much to say as\nHill-carriers, of whom you see some yet in the world, of divers sexes and\ndegrees.  Of this race came Aesop, some of whose excellent words and deeds\nyou have in writing.  Some other puffs did swell in length by the member\nwhich they call the labourer of nature, in such sort that it grew\nmarvellous long, fat, great, lusty, stirring, and crest-risen, in the\nantique fashion, so that they made use of it as of a girdle, winding it\nfive or six times about their waist:  but if it happened the foresaid\nmember to be in good case, spooming with a full sail bunt fair before the\nwind, then to have seen those strouting champions, you would have taken\nthem for men that had their lances settled on their rest to run at the ring\nor tilting whintam (quintain).  Of these, believe me, the race is utterly\nlost and quite extinct, as the women say; for they do lament continually\nthat there are none extant now of those great, &c.  You know the rest of\nthe song.  Others did grow in matter of ballocks so enormously that three\nof them would well fill a sack able to contain five quarters of wheat.\nFrom them are descended the ballocks of Lorraine, which never dwell in\ncodpieces, but fall down to the bottom of the breeches.  Others grew in the\nlegs, and to see them you would have said they had been cranes, or the\nreddish-long-billed-storklike-scrank-legged sea-fowls called flamans, or\nelse men walking upon stilts or scatches.  The little grammar-school boys,\nknown by the name of Grimos, called those leg-grown slangams Jambus, in\nallusion to the French word jambe, which signifieth a leg.  In others,\ntheir nose did grow so, that it seemed to be the beak of a limbeck, in\nevery part thereof most variously diapered with the twinkling sparkles of\ncrimson blisters budding forth, and purpled with pimples all enamelled with\nthickset wheals of a sanguine colour, bordered with gules; and such have\nyou seen the Canon or Prebend Panzoult, and Woodenfoot, the physician of\nAngiers.  Of which race there were few that looked the ptisane, but all of\nthem were perfect lovers of the pure Septembral juice.  Naso and Ovid had\ntheir extraction from thence, and all those of whom it is written, Ne\nreminiscaris.  Others grew in ears, which they had so big that out of one\nwould have been stuff enough got to make a doublet, a pair of breeches, and\na jacket, whilst with the other they might have covered themselves as with\na Spanish cloak:  and they say that in Bourbonnois this race remaineth yet.\nOthers grew in length of body, and of those came the Giants, and of them\nPantagruel.\n\nAnd the first was Chalbroth,\nWho begat Sarabroth,\nWho begat Faribroth,\nWho begat Hurtali, that was a brave eater of pottage, and reigned\n  in the time of the flood;\nWho begat Nembroth,\nWho begat Atlas, that with his shoulders kept the sky from falling;\nWho begat Goliah,\nWho begat Erix, that invented the hocus pocus plays of legerdemain;\nWho begat Titius,\nWho begat Eryon,\nWho begat Polyphemus,\nWho begat Cacus,\nWho begat Etion, the first man that ever had the pox, for not drinking\n  fresh in summer, as Bartachin witnesseth;\nWho begat Enceladus,\nWho begat Ceus,\nWho begat Tiphaeus,\nWho begat Alaeus,\nWho begat Othus,\nWho begat Aegeon,\nWho begat Briareus, that had a hundred hands;\nWho begat Porphyrio,\nWho begat Adamastor,\nWho begat Anteus,\nWho begat Agatho,\nWho begat Porus, against whom fought Alexander the Great;\nWho begat Aranthas,\nWho begat Gabbara, that was the first inventor of the drinking of\n  healths;\nWho begat Goliah of Secondille,\nWho begat Offot, that was terribly well nosed for drinking at the\n  barrel-head;\nWho begat Artachaeus,\nWho begat Oromedon,\nWho begat Gemmagog, the first inventor of Poulan shoes, which are\n  open on the foot and tied over the instep with a lachet;\nWho begat Sisyphus,\nWho begat the Titans, of whom Hercules was born;\nWho begat Enay, the most skilful man that ever was in matter of\n  taking the little worms (called cirons) out of the hands;\nWho begat Fierabras, that was vanquished by Oliver, peer of France\n  and Roland's comrade;\nWho begat Morgan, the first in the world that played at dice with\n  spectacles;\nWho begat Fracassus, of whom Merlin Coccaius hath written, and of\n  him was born Ferragus,\nWho begat Hapmouche, the first that ever invented the drying of\n  neat's tongues in the chimney; for, before that, people salted\n  them as they do now gammons of bacon;\nWho begat Bolivorax,\nWho begat Longis,\nWho begat Gayoffo, whose ballocks were of poplar, and his pr... of\n  the service or sorb-apple-tree;\nWho begat Maschefain,\nWho begat Bruslefer,\nWho begat Angoulevent,\nWho begat Galehaut, the inventor of flagons;\nWho begat Mirelangaut,\nWho begat Gallaffre,\nWho begat Falourdin,\nWho begat Roboast,\nWho begat Sortibrant of Conimbres,\nWho begat Brushant of Mommiere,\nWho begat Bruyer that was overcome by Ogier the Dane, peer of\n  France;\nWho begat Mabrun,\nWho begat Foutasnon,\nWho begat Haquelebac,\nWho begat Vitdegrain,\nWho begat Grangousier,\nWho begat Gargantua,\nWho begat the noble Pantagruel, my master.\n\nI know that, reading this passage, you will make a doubt within yourselves,\nand that grounded upon very good reason, which is this--how it is possible\nthat this relation can be true, seeing at the time of the flood all the\nworld was destroyed, except Noah and seven persons more with him in the\nark, into whose number Hurtali is not admitted.  Doubtless the demand is\nwell made and very apparent, but the answer shall satisfy you, or my wit is\nnot rightly caulked.  And because I was not at that time to tell you\nanything of my own fancy, I will bring unto you the authority of the\nMassorets, good honest fellows, true ballockeering blades and exact\nHebraical bagpipers, who affirm that verily the said Hurtali was not within\nthe ark of Noah, neither could he get in, for he was too big, but he sat\nastride upon it, with one leg on the one side and another on the other, as\nlittle children use to do upon their wooden horses; or as the great bull of\nBerne, which was killed at Marinian, did ride for his hackney the great\nmurdering piece called the canon-pevier, a pretty beast of a fair and\npleasant amble without all question.\n\nIn that posture, he, after God, saved the said ark from danger, for with\nhis legs he gave it the brangle that was needful, and with his foot turned\nit whither he pleased, as a ship answereth her rudder.  Those that were\nwithin sent him up victuals in abundance by a chimney, as people very\nthankfully acknowledging the good that he did them.  And sometimes they did\ntalk together as Icaromenippus did to Jupiter, according to the report of\nLucian.  Have you understood all this well?  Drink then one good draught\nwithout water, for if you believe it not,--no truly do I not, quoth she.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.II.\n\nOf the nativity of the most dread and redoubted Pantagruel.\n\nGargantua at the age of four hundred fourscore forty and four years begat\nhis son Pantagruel, upon his wife named Badebec, daughter to the king of\nthe Amaurots in Utopia, who died in childbirth; for he was so wonderfully\ngreat and lumpish that he could not possibly come forth into the light of\nthe world without thus suffocating his mother.  But that we may fully\nunderstand the cause and reason of the name of Pantagruel which at his\nbaptism was given him, you are to remark that in that year there was so\ngreat drought over all the country of Africa that there passed thirty and\nsix months, three weeks, four days, thirteen hours and a little more\nwithout rain, but with a heat so vehement that the whole earth was parched\nand withered by it.  Neither was it more scorched and dried up with heat in\nthe days of Elijah than it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be\nseen that had either leaf or bloom upon it.  The grass was without verdure\nor greenness, the rivers were drained, the fountains dried up, the poor\nfishes, abandoned and forsaken by their proper element, wandering and\ncrying upon the ground most horribly.  The birds did fall down from the air\nfor want of moisture and dew wherewith to refresh them.  The wolves, foxes,\nharts, wild boars, fallow deer, hares, coneys, weasels, brocks, badgers,\nand other such beasts, were found dead in the fields with their mouths\nopen.  In respect of men, there was the pity, you should have seen them lay\nout their tongues like hares that have been run six hours.  Many did throw\nthemselves into the wells.  Others entered within a cow's belly to be in\nthe shade; those Homer calls Alibants.  All the country was idle, and could\ndo no virtue.  It was a most lamentable case to have seen the labour of\nmortals in defending themselves from the vehemency of this horrific\ndrought; for they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the\nchurches from being wasted; but there was such order taken by the counsel\nof my lords the cardinals and of our holy Father, that none did dare to\ntake above one lick.  Yet when anyone came into the church, you should have\nseen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that was the\ndistributor of the water, and that with a wide open throat, gaping for some\nlittle drop, like the rich glutton in Luke, that might fall by, lest\nanything should be lost.  O how happy was he in that year who had a cool\ncellar under ground, well plenished with fresh wine!\n\nThe philosopher reports, in moving the question, Wherefore it is that the\nsea-water is salt, that at the time when Phoebus gave the government of his\nresplendent chariot to his son Phaeton, the said Phaeton, unskilful in the\nart, and not knowing how to keep the ecliptic line betwixt the two tropics\nof the latitude of the sun's course, strayed out of his way, and came so\nnear the earth that he dried up all the countries that were under it,\nburning a great part of the heavens which the philosophers call Via lactea,\nand the huffsnuffs St. James's way; although the most coped, lofty, and\nhigh-crested poets affirm that to be the place where Juno's milk fell when\nshe gave suck to Hercules.  The earth at that time was so excessively\nheated that it fell into an enormous sweat, yea, such a one as made it\nsweat out the sea, which is therefore salt, because all sweat is salt; and\nthis you cannot but confess to be true if you will taste of your own, or of\nthose that have the pox, when they are put into sweating, it is all one to\nme.\n\nJust such another case fell out this same year:  for on a certain Friday,\nwhen the whole people were bent upon their devotions, and had made goodly\nprocessions, with store of litanies, and fair preachings, and beseechings\nof God Almighty to look down with his eye of mercy upon their miserable and\ndisconsolate condition, there was even then visibly seen issue out of the\nground great drops of water, such as fall from a puff-bagged man in a top\nsweat, and the poor hoidens began to rejoice as if it had been a thing very\nprofitable unto them; for some said that there was not one drop of moisture\nin the air whence they might have any rain, and that the earth did supply\nthe default of that.  Other learned men said that it was a shower of the\nantipodes, as Seneca saith in his fourth book Quaestionum naturalium,\nspeaking of the source and spring of Nilus.  But they were deceived, for,\nthe procession being ended, when everyone went about to gather of this dew,\nand to drink of it with full bowls, they found that it was nothing but\npickle and the very brine of salt, more brackish in taste than the saltest\nwater of the sea.  And because in that very day Pantagruel was born, his\nfather gave him that name; for Panta in Greek is as much to say as all, and\nGruel in the Hagarene language doth signify thirsty, inferring hereby that\nat his birth the whole world was a-dry and thirsty, as likewise foreseeing\nthat he would be some day supreme lord and sovereign of the thirsty\nEthrappels, which was shown to him at that very same hour by a more evident\nsign.  For when his mother Badebec was in the bringing of him forth, and\nthat the midwives did wait to receive him, there came first out of her\nbelly three score and eight tregeneers, that is, salt-sellers, every one of\nthem leading in a halter a mule heavy laden with salt; after whom issued\nforth nine dromedaries, with great loads of gammons of bacon and dried\nneat's tongues on their backs.  Then followed seven camels loaded with\nlinks and chitterlings, hogs' puddings, and sausages.  After them came out\nfive great wains, full of leeks, garlic, onions, and chibots, drawn with\nfive-and-thirty strong cart-horses, which was six for every one, besides\nthe thiller.  At the sight hereof the said midwives were much amazed, yet\nsome of them said, Lo, here is good provision, and indeed we need it; for\nwe drink but lazily, as if our tongues walked on crutches, and not lustily\nlike Lansman Dutches.  Truly this is a good sign; there is nothing here but\nwhat is fit for us; these are the spurs of wine, that set it a-going.  As\nthey were tattling thus together after their own manner of chat, behold!\nout comes Pantagruel all hairy like a bear, whereupon one of them, inspired\nwith a prophetical spirit, said, This will be a terrible fellow; he is born\nwith all his hair; he is undoubtedly to do wonderful things, and if he live\nhe shall have age.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.III.\n\nOf the grief wherewith Gargantua was moved at the decease of his wife\nBadebec.\n\nWhen Pantagruel was born, there was none more astonished and perplexed than\nwas his father Gargantua; for of the one side seeing his wife Badebec dead,\nand on the other side his son Pantagruel born, so fair and so great, he\nknew not what to say nor what to do.  And the doubt that troubled his brain\nwas to know whether he should cry for the death of his wife or laugh for\nthe joy of his son.  He was hinc inde choked with sophistical arguments,\nfor he framed them very well in modo et figura, but he could not resolve\nthem, remaining pestered and entangled by this means, like a mouse caught\nin a trap or kite snared in a gin.  Shall I weep? said he.  Yes, for why?\nMy so good wife is dead, who was the most this, the most that, that ever\nwas in the world.  Never shall I see her, never shall I recover such\nanother; it is unto me an inestimable loss!  O my good God, what had I done\nthat thou shouldest thus punish me?  Why didst thou not take me away before\nher, seeing for me to live without her is but to languish?  Ah, Badebec,\nBadebec, my minion, my dear heart, my sugar, my sweeting, my honey, my\nlittle c-- (yet it had in circumference full six acres, three rods, five\npoles, four yards, two foot, one inch and a half of good woodland measure),\nmy tender peggy, my codpiece darling, my bob and hit, my slipshoe-lovey,\nnever shall I see thee!  Ah, poor Pantagruel, thou hast lost thy good\nmother, thy sweet nurse, thy well-beloved lady!  O false death, how\ninjurious and despiteful hast thou been to me!  How malicious and\noutrageous have I found thee in taking her from me, my well-beloved wife,\nto whom immortality did of right belong!\n\nWith these words he did cry like a cow, but on a sudden fell a-laughing\nlike a calf, when Pantagruel came into his mind.  Ha, my little son, said\nhe, my childilolly, fedlifondy, dandlichucky, my ballocky, my pretty rogue!\nO how jolly thou art, and how much am I bound to my gracious God, that hath\nbeen pleased to bestow on me a son so fair, so spriteful, so lively, so\nsmiling, so pleasant, and so gentle!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, how glad I am!  Let\nus drink, ho, and put away melancholy!  Bring of the best, rinse the\nglasses, lay the cloth, drive out these dogs, blow this fire, light\ncandles, shut that door there, cut this bread in sippets for brewis, send\naway these poor folks in giving them what they ask, hold my gown.  I will\nstrip myself into my doublet (en cuerpo), to make the gossips merry, and\nkeep them company.\n\nAs he spake this, he heard the litanies and the mementos of the priests\nthat carried his wife to be buried, upon which he left the good purpose he\nwas in, and was suddenly ravished another way, saying, Lord God! must I\nagain contrist myself?  This grieves me.  I am no longer young, I grow old,\nthe weather is dangerous; I may perhaps take an ague, then shall I be\nfoiled, if not quite undone.  By the faith of a gentleman, it were better\nto cry less, and drink more.  My wife is dead, well, by G--! (da jurandi) I\nshall not raise her again by my crying:  she is well, she is in paradise at\nleast, if she be no higher:  she prayeth to God for us, she is happy, she\nis above the sense of our miseries, nor can our calamities reach her.  What\nthough she be dead, must not we also die?  The same debt which she hath\npaid hangs over our heads; nature will require it of us, and we must all of\nus some day taste of the same sauce.  Let her pass then, and the Lord\npreserve the survivors; for I must now cast about how to get another wife.\nBut I will tell you what you shall do, said he to the midwives, in France\ncalled wise women (where be they, good folks?  I cannot see them):  Go you\nto my wife's interment, and I will the while rock my son; for I find myself\nsomewhat altered and distempered, and should otherwise be in danger of\nfalling sick; but drink one good draught first, you will be the better for\nit.  And believe me, upon mine honour, they at his request went to her\nburial and funeral obsequies.  In the meanwhile, poor Gargantua staying at\nhome, and willing to have somewhat in remembrance of her to be engraven\nupon her tomb, made this epitaph in the manner as followeth.\n\n  Dead is the noble Badebec,\n  Who had a face like a rebeck;\n  A Spanish body, and a belly\n  Of Switzerland; she died, I tell ye,\n  In childbirth.  Pray to God, that her\n  He pardon wherein she did err.\n  Here lies her body, which did live\n  Free from all vice, as I believe,\n    And did decease at my bedside,\n    The year and day in which she died.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.IV.\n\nOf the infancy of Pantagruel.\n\nI find by the ancient historiographers and poets that divers have been born\nin this world after very strange manners, which would be too long to\nrepeat; read therefore the seventh chapter of Pliny, if you have so much\nleisure.  Yet have you never heard of any so wonderful as that of\nPantagruel; for it is a very difficult matter to believe, how in the little\ntime he was in his mother's belly he grew both in body and strength.  That\nwhich Hercules did was nothing, when in his cradle he slew two serpents,\nfor those serpents were but little and weak, but Pantagruel, being yet in\nthe cradle, did far more admirable things, and more to be amazed at.  I\npass by here the relation of how at every one of his meals he supped up the\nmilk of four thousand and six hundred cows, and how, to make him a skillet\nto boil his milk in, there were set a-work all the braziers of Somure in\nAnjou, of Villedieu in Normandy, and of Bramont in Lorraine.  And they\nserved in this whitepot-meat to him in a huge great bell, which is yet to\nbe seen in the city of Bourges in Berry, near the palace, but his teeth\nwere already so well grown, and so strengthened with vigour, that of the\nsaid bell he bit off a great morsel, as very plainly doth appear till this\nhour.\n\nOne day in the morning, when they would have made him suck one of his cows\n--for he never had any other nurse, as the history tells us--he got one of\nhis arms loose from the swaddling bands wherewith he was kept fast in the\ncradle, laid hold on the said cow under the left foreham, and grasping her\nto him ate up her udder and half of her paunch, with the liver and the\nkidneys, and had devoured all up if she had not cried out most horribly, as\nif the wolves had held her by the legs, at which noise company came in and\ntook away the said cow from Pantagruel.  Yet could they not so well do it\nbut that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in his hand, of which\nquarter he gulped up the flesh in a trice, even with as much ease as you\nwould eat a sausage, and that so greedily with desire of more, that, when\nthey would have taken away the bone from him, he swallowed it down whole,\nas a cormorant would do a little fish; and afterwards began fumblingly to\nsay, Good, good, good--for he could not yet speak plain--giving them to\nunderstand thereby that he had found it very good, and that he did lack but\nso much more.  Which when they saw that attended him, they bound him with\ngreat cable-ropes, like those that are made at Tain for the carriage of\nsalt to Lyons, or such as those are whereby the great French ship rides at\nanchor in the road of Newhaven in Normandy.  But, on a certain time, a\ngreat bear, which his father had bred, got loose, came towards him, began\nto lick his face, for his nurses had not thoroughly wiped his chaps, at\nwhich unexpected approach being on a sudden offended, he as lightly rid\nhimself of those great cables as Samson did of the hawser ropes wherewith\nthe Philistines had tied him, and, by your leave, takes me up my lord the\nbear, and tears him to you in pieces like a pullet, which served him for a\ngorgeful or good warm bit for that meal.\n\nWhereupon Gargantua, fearing lest the child should hurt himself, caused\nfour great chains of iron to be made to bind him, and so many strong wooden\narches unto his cradle, most firmly stocked and morticed in huge frames.\nOf those chains you have one at Rochelle, which they draw up at night\nbetwixt the two great towers of the haven.  Another is at Lyons,--a third\nat Angiers,--and the fourth was carried away by the devils to bind Lucifer,\nwho broke his chains in those days by reason of a colic that did\nextraordinarily torment him, taken with eating a sergeant's soul fried for\nhis breakfast.  And therefore you may believe that which Nicholas de Lyra\nsaith upon that place of the Psalter where it is written, Et Og Regem\nBasan, that the said Og, being yet little, was so strong and robustious,\nthat they were fain to bind him with chains of iron in his cradle.  Thus\ncontinued Pantagruel for a while very calm and quiet, for he was not able\nso easily to break those chains, especially having no room in the cradle to\ngive a swing with his arms.  But see what happened once upon a great\nholiday that his father Gargantua made a sumptuous banquet to all the\nprinces of his court.  I am apt to believe that the menial officers of the\nhouse were so embusied in waiting each on his proper service at the feast,\nthat nobody took care of poor Pantagruel, who was left a reculorum,\nbehindhand, all alone, and as forsaken.  What did he?  Hark what he did,\ngood people.  He strove and essayed to break the chains of the cradle with\nhis arms, but could not, for they were too strong for him.  Then did he\nkeep with his feet such a stamping stir, and so long, that at last he beat\nout the lower end of his cradle, which notwithstanding was made of a great\npost five foot in square; and as soon as he had gotten out his feet, he\nslid down as well as he could till he had got his soles to the ground, and\nthen with a mighty force he rose up, carrying his cradle upon his back,\nbound to him like a tortoise that crawls up against a wall; and to have\nseen him, you would have thought it had been a great carrick of five\nhundred tons upon one end.  In this manner he entered into the great hall\nwhere they were banqueting, and that very boldly, which did much affright\nthe company; yet, because his arms were tied in, he could not reach\nanything to eat, but with great pain stooped now and then a little to take\nwith the whole flat of his tongue some lick, good bit, or morsel.  Which\nwhen his father saw, he knew well enough that they had left him without\ngiving him anything to eat, and therefore commanded that he should be\nloosed from the said chains, by the counsel of the princes and lords there\npresent.  Besides that also the physicians of Gargantua said that, if they\ndid thus keep him in the cradle, he would be all his lifetime subject to\nthe stone.  When he was unchained, they made him to sit down, where, after\nhe had fed very well, he took his cradle and broke it into more than five\nhundred thousand pieces with one blow of his fist that he struck in the\nmidst of it, swearing that he would never come into it again.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.V.\n\nOf the acts of the noble Pantagruel in his youthful age.\n\nThus grew Pantagruel from day to day, and to everyone's eye waxed more and\nmore in all his dimensions, which made his father to rejoice by a natural\naffection.  Therefore caused he to be made for him, whilst he was yet\nlittle, a pretty crossbow wherewith to shoot at small birds, which now they\ncall the great crossbow at Chantelle.  Then he sent him to the school to\nlearn, and to spend his youth in virtue.  In the prosecution of which\ndesign he came first to Poictiers, where, as he studied and profited very\nmuch, he saw that the scholars were oftentimes at leisure and knew not how\nto bestow their time, which moved him to take such compassion on them, that\none day he took from a long ledge of rocks, called there Passelourdin, a\nhuge great stone, of about twelve fathom square and fourteen handfuls\nthick, and with great ease set it upon four pillars in the midst of a\nfield, to no other end but that the said scholars, when they had nothing\nelse to do, might pass their time in getting up on that stone, and feast it\nwith store of gammons, pasties, and flagons, and carve their names upon it\nwith a knife, in token of which deed till this hour the stone is called the\nlifted stone.  And in remembrance hereof there is none entered into the\nregister and matricular book of the said university, or accounted capable\nof taking any degree therein, till he have first drunk in the caballine\nfountain of Croustelles, passed at Passelourdin, and got up upon the lifted\nstone.\n\nAfterwards, reading the delectable chronicles of his ancestors, he found\nthat Geoffrey of Lusignan, called Geoffrey with the great tooth,\ngrandfather to the cousin-in-law of the eldest sister of the aunt of the\nson-in-law of the uncle of the good daughter of his stepmother, was\ninterred at Maillezais; therefore one day he took campos (which is a little\nvacation from study to play a while), that he might give him a visit as\nunto an honest man.  And going from Poictiers with some of his companions,\nthey passed by the Guge (Leguge), visiting the noble Abbot Ardillon; then\nby Lusignan, by Sansay, by Celles, by Coolonges, by Fontenay-le-Comte,\nsaluting the learned Tiraqueau, and from thence arrived at Maillezais,\nwhere he went to see the sepulchre of the said Geoffrey with the great\ntooth; which made him somewhat afraid, looking upon the picture, whose\nlively draughts did set him forth in the representation of a man in an\nextreme fury, drawing his great Malchus falchion half way out of his\nscabbard.  When the reason hereof was demanded, the canons of the said\nplace told him that there was no other cause of it but that Pictoribus\natque Poetis, &c., that is to say, that painters and poets have liberty to\npaint and devise what they list after their own fancy.  But he was not\nsatisfied with their answer, and said, He is not thus painted without a\ncause, and I suspect that at his death there was some wrong done him,\nwhereof he requireth his kindred to take revenge.  I will inquire further\ninto it, and then do what shall be reasonable.  Then he returned not to\nPoictiers, but would take a view of the other universities of France.\nTherefore, going to Rochelle, he took shipping and arrived at Bordeaux,\nwhere he found no great exercise, only now and then he would see some\nmariners and lightermen a-wrestling on the quay or strand by the\nriver-side.  From thence he came to Toulouse, where he learned to dance very\nwell, and to play with the two-handed sword, as the fashion of the scholars\nof the said university is to bestir themselves in games whereof they may\nhave their hands full; but he stayed not long there when he saw that they\ndid cause burn their regents alive like red herring, saying, Now God forbid\nthat I should die this death! for I am by nature sufficiently dry already,\nwithout heating myself any further.\n\nHe went then to Montpellier, where he met with the good wives of Mirevaux,\nand good jovial company withal, and thought to have set himself to the\nstudy of physic; but he considered that that calling was too troublesome\nand melancholic, and that physicians did smell of glisters like old devils.\nTherefore he resolved he would study the laws; but seeing that there were\nbut three scald- and one bald-pated legist in that place, he departed from\nthence, and in his way made the bridge of Guard and the amphitheatre of\nNimes in less than three hours, which, nevertheless, seems to be a more\ndivine than human work.  After that he came to Avignon, where he was not\nabove three days before he fell in love; for the women there take great\ndelight in playing at the close-buttock game, because it is papal ground.\nWhich his tutor and pedagogue Epistemon perceiving, he drew him out of that\nplace, and brought him to Valence in the Dauphiny, where he saw no great\nmatter of recreation, only that the lubbers of the town did beat the\nscholars, which so incensed him with anger, that when, upon a certain very\nfair Sunday, the people being at their public dancing in the streets, and\none of the scholars offering to put himself into the ring to partake of\nthat sport, the foresaid lubberly fellows would not permit him the\nadmittance into their society, he, taking the scholar's part, so belaboured\nthem with blows, and laid such load upon them, that he drove them all\nbefore him, even to the brink of the river Rhone, and would have there\ndrowned them, but that they did squat to the ground, and there lay close a\nfull half-league under the river.  The hole is to be seen there yet.\n\nAfter that he departed from thence, and in three strides and one leap came\nto Angiers, where he found himself very well, and would have continued\nthere some space, but that the plague drove them away.  So from thence he\ncame to Bourges, where he studied a good long time, and profited very much\nin the faculty of the laws, and would sometimes say that the books of the\ncivil law were like unto a wonderfully precious, royal, and triumphant robe\nof cloth of gold edged with dirt; for in the world are no goodlier books to\nbe seen, more ornate, nor more eloquent than the texts of the Pandects, but\nthe bordering of them, that is to say, the gloss of Accursius, is so\nscurvy, vile, base, and unsavoury, that it is nothing but filthiness and\nvillainy.\n\nGoing from Bourges, he came to Orleans, where he found store of swaggering\nscholars that made him great entertainment at his coming, and with whom he\nlearned to play at tennis so well that he was a master at that game.  For\nthe students of the said place make a prime exercise of it; and sometimes\nthey carried him unto Cupid's houses of commerce (in that city termed\nislands, because of their being most ordinarily environed with other\nhouses, and not contiguous to any), there to recreate his person at the\nsport of poussavant, which the wenches of London call the ferkers in and\nin.  As for breaking his head with over-much study, he had an especial care\nnot to do it in any case, for fear of spoiling his eyes.  Which he the\nrather observed, for that it was told him by one of his teachers, there\ncalled regents, that the pain of the eyes was the most hurtful thing of any\nto the sight.  For this cause, when he one day was made a licentiate, or\ngraduate in law, one of the scholars of his acquaintance, who of learning\nhad not much more than his burden, though instead of that he could dance\nvery well and play at tennis, made the blazon and device of the licentiates\nin the said university, saying,\n\n  So you have in your hand a racket,\n  A tennis-ball in your cod-placket,\n  A Pandect law in your cap's tippet,\n  And that you have the skill to trip it\n  In a low dance, you will b' allowed\n  The grant of the licentiate's hood.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.VI.\n\nHow Pantagruel met with a Limousin, who too affectedly did counterfeit the\nFrench language.\n\nUpon a certain day, I know not when, Pantagruel walking after supper with\nsome of his fellow-students without that gate of the city through which we\nenter on the road to Paris, encountered with a young spruce-like scholar\nthat was coming upon the same very way, and, after they had saluted one\nanother, asked him thus, My friend, from whence comest thou now?  The\nscholar answered him, From the alme, inclyte, and celebrate academy, which\nis vocitated Lutetia.  What is the meaning of this? said Pantagruel to one\nof his men.  It is, answered he, from Paris.  Thou comest from Paris then,\nsaid Pantagruel; and how do you spend your time there, you my masters the\nstudents of Paris?  The scholar answered, We transfretate the Sequan at the\ndilucul and crepuscul; we deambulate by the compites and quadrives of the\nurb; we despumate the Latial verbocination; and, like verisimilary\namorabons, we captat the benevolence of the omnijugal, omniform and\nomnigenal feminine sex.  Upon certain diecules we invisat the lupanares,\nand in a venerian ecstasy inculcate our veretres into the penitissime\nrecesses of the pudends of these amicabilissim meretricules.  Then do we\ncauponisate in the meritory taberns of the Pineapple, the Castle, the\nMagdalene, and the Mule, goodly vervecine spatules perforaminated with\npetrocile.  And if by fortune there be rarity or penury of pecune in our\nmarsupies, and that they be exhausted of ferruginean metal, for the shot we\ndimit our codices and oppignerat our vestments, whilst we prestolate the\ncoming of the tabellaries from the Penates and patriotic Lares.  To which\nPantagruel answered, What devilish language is this?  By the Lord, I think\nthou art some kind of heretick.  My lord, no, said the scholar; for\nlibentissimally, as soon as it illucesceth any minutule slice of the day, I\ndemigrate into one of these so well architected minsters, and there,\nirrorating myself with fair lustral water, I mumble off little parcels of\nsome missic precation of our sacrificuls, and, submurmurating my horary\nprecules, I elevate and absterge my anime from its nocturnal inquinations.\nI revere the Olympicols.  I latrially venere the supernal Astripotent.  I\ndilige and redame my proxims.  I observe the decalogical precepts, and,\naccording to the facultatule of my vires, I do not discede from them one\nlate unguicule.  Nevertheless, it is veriform, that because Mammona doth\nnot supergurgitate anything in my loculs, that I am somewhat rare and lent\nto supererogate the elemosynes to those egents that hostially queritate\ntheir stipe.\n\nPrut, tut, said Pantagruel, what doth this fool mean to say?  I think he is\nupon the forging of some diabolical tongue, and that enchanter-like he\nwould charm us.  To whom one of his men said, Without doubt, sir, this\nfellow would counterfeit the language of the Parisians, but he doth only\nflay the Latin, imagining by so doing that he doth highly Pindarize it in\nmost eloquent terms, and strongly conceiteth himself to be therefore a\ngreat orator in the French, because he disdaineth the common manner of\nspeaking.  To which Pantagruel said, Is it true?  The scholar answered, My\nworshipful lord, my genie is not apt nate to that which this flagitious\nnebulon saith, to excoriate the cut(ic)ule of our vernacular Gallic, but\nvice-versally I gnave opere, and by veles and rames enite to locupletate it\nwith the Latinicome redundance.  By G--, said Pantagruel, I will teach you\nto speak.  But first come hither, and tell me whence thou art.  To this the\nscholar answered, The primeval origin of my aves and ataves was indigenary\nof the Lemovic regions, where requiesceth the corpor of the hagiotat St.\nMartial.  I understand thee very well, said Pantagruel.  When all comes to\nall, thou art a Limousin, and thou wilt here by thy affected speech\ncounterfeit the Parisians.  Well now, come hither, I must show thee a new\ntrick, and handsomely give thee the combfeat.  With this he took him by the\nthroat, saying to him, Thou flayest the Latin; by St. John, I will make\nthee flay the fox, for I will now flay thee alive.  Then began the poor\nLimousin to cry, Haw, gwid maaster! haw, Laord, my halp, and St. Marshaw!\nhaw, I'm worried.  Haw, my thropple, the bean of my cragg is bruck!  Haw,\nfor gauad's seck lawt my lean, mawster; waw, waw, waw.  Now, said\nPantagruel, thou speakest naturally, and so let him go, for the poor\nLimousin had totally bewrayed and thoroughly conshit his breeches, which\nwere not deep and large enough, but round straight cannioned gregs, having\nin the seat a piece like a keeling's tail, and therefore in French called,\nde chausses a queue de merlus.  Then, said Pantagruel, St. Alipantin, what\ncivet?  Fie! to the devil with this turnip-eater, as he stinks! and so let\nhim go.  But this hug of Pantagruel's was such a terror to him all the days\nof his life, and took such deep impression in his fancy, that very often,\ndistracted with sudden affrightments, he would startle and say that\nPantagruel held him by the neck.  Besides that, it procured him a continual\ndrought and desire to drink, so that after some few years he died of the\ndeath Roland, in plain English called thirst, a work of divine vengeance,\nshowing us that which saith the philosopher and Aulus Gellius, that it\nbecometh us to speak according to the common language; and that we should,\nas said Octavian Augustus, strive to shun all strange and unknown terms\nwith as much heedfulness and circumspection as pilots of ships use to avoid\nthe rocks and banks in the sea.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.VII.\n\nHow Pantagruel came to Paris, and of the choice books of the Library of St.\nVictor.\n\nAfter that Pantagruel had studied very well at Orleans, he resolved to see\nthe great University at Paris; but, before his departure, he was informed\nthat there was a huge big bell at St. Anian in the said town of Orleans,\nunder the ground, which had been there above two hundred and fourteen\nyears, for it was so great that they could not by any device get it so much\nas above the ground, although they used all the means that are found in\nVitruvius de Architectura, Albertus de Re Aedificatoria, Euclid, Theon,\nArchimedes, and Hero de Ingeniis; for all that was to no purpose.\nWherefore, condescending heartily to the humble request of the citizens and\ninhabitants of the said town, he determined to remove it to the tower that\nwas erected for it.  With that he came to the place where it was, and\nlifted it out of the ground with his little finger as easily as you would\nhave done a hawk's bell or bellwether's tingle-tangle; but, before he would\ncarry it to the foresaid tower or steeple appointed for it, he would needs\nmake some music with it about the town, and ring it alongst all the streets\nas he carried it in his hand, wherewith all the people were very glad.  But\nthere happened one great inconveniency, for with carrying it so, and\nringing it about the streets, all the good Orleans wine turned instantly,\nwaxed flat and was spoiled, which nobody there did perceive till the night\nfollowing; for every man found himself so altered and a-dry with drinking\nthese flat wines, that they did nothing but spit, and that as white as\nMalta cotton, saying, We have of the Pantagruel, and our very throats are\nsalted.  This done, he came to Paris with his retinue.  And at his entry\neveryone came out to see him--as you know well enough that the people of\nParis is sottish by nature, by B flat and B sharp--and beheld him with\ngreat astonishment, mixed with no less fear that he would carry away the\npalace into some other country, a remotis, and far from them, as his father\nformerly had done the great peal of bells at Our Lady's Church to tie about\nhis mare's neck.  Now after he had stayed there a pretty space, and studied\nvery well in all the seven liberal arts, he said it was a good town to live\nin, but not to die; for that the grave-digging rogues of St. Innocent used\nin frosty nights to warm their bums with dead men's bones.  In his abode\nthere he found the library of St. Victor a very stately and magnific one,\nespecially in some books which were there, of which followeth the Repertory\nand Catalogue, Et primo,\n\nThe for Godsake of Salvation.\nThe Codpiece of the Law.\nThe Slipshoe of the Decretals.\nThe Pomegranate of Vice.\nThe Clew-bottom of Theology.\nThe Duster or Foxtail-flap of Preachers, composed by Turlupin.\nThe Churning Ballock of the Valiant.\nThe Henbane of the Bishops.\nMarmotretus de baboonis et apis, cum Commento Dorbellis.\nDecretum Universitatis Parisiensis super gorgiasitate muliercularum\n  ad placitum.\nThe Apparition of Sancte Geltrude to a Nun of Poissy, being in\n  travail at the bringing forth of a child.\nArs honeste fartandi in societate, per Marcum Corvinum (Ortuinum).\nThe Mustard-pot of Penance.\nThe Gamashes, alias the Boots of Patience.\nFormicarium artium.\nDe brodiorum usu, et honestate quartandi, per Sylvestrem Prioratem\n  Jacobinum.\nThe Cosened or Gulled in Court.\nThe Frail of the Scriveners.\nThe Marriage-packet.\nThe Cruizy or Crucible of Contemplation.\nThe Flimflams of the Law.\nThe Prickle of Wine.\nThe Spur of Cheese.\nRuboffatorium (Decrotatorium) scholarium.\nTartaretus de modo cacandi.\nThe Bravades of Rome.\nBricot de Differentiis Browsarum.\nThe Tailpiece-Cushion, or Close-breech of Discipline.\nThe Cobbled Shoe of Humility.\nThe Trivet of good Thoughts.\nThe Kettle of Magnanimity.\nThe Cavilling Entanglements of Confessors.\nThe Snatchfare of the Curates.\nReverendi patris fratris Lubini, provincialis Bavardiae, de gulpendis\n  lardslicionibus libri tres.\nPasquilli Doctoris Marmorei, de capreolis cum artichoketa comedendis,\n  tempore Papali ab Ecclesia interdicto.\nThe Invention of the Holy Cross, personated by six wily Priests.\nThe Spectacles of Pilgrims bound for Rome.\nMajoris de modo faciendi puddinos.\nThe Bagpipe of the Prelates.\nBeda de optimitate triparum.\nThe Complaint of the Barristers upon the Reformation of Comfits.\nThe Furred Cat of the Solicitors and Attorneys.\nOf Peas and Bacon, cum Commento.\nThe Small Vales or Drinking Money of the Indulgences.\nPraeclarissimi juris utriusque Doctoris Maistre Pilloti, &c.,\n  Scrap-farthingi de botchandis glossae Accursianae Triflis repetitio\n  enucidi-luculidissima.\nStratagemata Francharchiaeri de Baniolet.\nCarlbumpkinus de Re Militari cum Figuris Tevoti.\nDe usu et utilitate flayandi equos et equas, authore Magistro nostro\n  de Quebecu.\nThe Sauciness of Country-Stewards.\nM.N.

And, as he was there abiding one day, he\nreceived a letter from his father in manner as followeth.\n\nMost dear Son,--Amongst the gifts, graces, and prerogatives, with which the\nsovereign plasmator God Almighty hath endowed and adorned human nature at\nthe beginning, that seems to me most singular and excellent by which we may\nin a mortal state attain to a kind of immortality, and in the course of\nthis transitory life perpetuate our name and seed, which is done by a\nprogeny issued from us in the lawful bonds of matrimony.  Whereby that in\nsome measure is restored unto us which was taken from us by the sin of our\nfirst parents, to whom it was said that, because they had not obeyed the\ncommandment of God their Creator, they should die, and by death should be\nbrought to nought that so stately frame and plasmature wherein the man at\nfirst had been created.\n\nBut by this means of seminal propagation there (\"Which continueth\" in the\nold copy.) continueth in the children what was lost in the parents, and in\nthe grandchildren that which perished in their fathers, and so successively\nuntil the day of the last judgment, when Jesus Christ shall have rendered\nup to God the Father his kingdom in a peaceable condition, out of all\ndanger and contamination of sin; for then shall cease all generations and\ncorruptions, and the elements leave off their continual transmutations,\nseeing the so much desired peace shall be attained unto and enjoyed, and\nthat all things shall be brought to their end and period.  And, therefore,\nnot without just and reasonable cause do I give thanks to God my Saviour\nand Preserver, for that he hath enabled me to see my bald old age\nreflourish in thy youth; for when, at his good pleasure, who rules and\ngoverns all things, my soul shall leave this mortal habitation, I shall not\naccount myself wholly to die, but to pass from one place unto another,\nconsidering that, in and by that, I continue in my visible image living in\nthe world, visiting and conversing with people of honour, and other my good\nfriends, as I was wont to do.  Which conversation of mine, although it was\nnot without sin, because we are all of us trespassers, and therefore ought\ncontinually to beseech his divine majesty to blot our transgressions out of\nhis memory, yet was it, by the help and grace of God, without all manner of\nreproach before men.\n\nWherefore, if those qualities of the mind but shine in thee wherewith I am\nendowed, as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my body, thou wilt be\nesteemed by all men to be the perfect guardian and treasure of the\nimmortality of our name.  But, if otherwise, I shall truly take but small\npleasure to see it, considering that the lesser part of me, which is the\nbody, would abide in thee, and the best, to wit, that which is the soul,\nand by which our name continues blessed amongst men, would be degenerate\nand abastardized.  This I do not speak out of any distrust that I have of\nthy virtue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee\nyet more earnestly to proceed from good to better.  And that which I now\nwrite unto thee is not so much that thou shouldst live in this virtuous\ncourse, as that thou shouldst rejoice in so living and having lived, and\ncheer up thyself with the like resolution in time to come; to the\nprosecution and accomplishment of which enterprise and generous undertaking\nthou mayst easily remember how that I have spared nothing, but have so\nhelped thee, as if I had had no other treasure in this world but to see\nthee once in my life completely well-bred and accomplished, as well in\nvirtue, honesty, and valour, as in all liberal knowledge and civility, and\nso to leave thee after my death as a mirror representing the person of me\nthy father, and if not so excellent, and such in deed as I do wish thee,\nyet such in my desire.\n\nBut although my deceased father of happy memory, Grangousier, had bent his\nbest endeavours to make me profit in all perfection and political\nknowledge, and that my labour and study was fully correspondent to, yea,\nwent beyond his desire, nevertheless, as thou mayest well understand, the\ntime then was not so proper and fit for learning as it is at present,\nneither had I plenty of such good masters as thou hast had.  For that time\nwas darksome, obscured with clouds of ignorance, and savouring a little of\nthe infelicity and calamity of the Goths, who had, wherever they set\nfooting, destroyed all good literature, which in my age hath by the divine\ngoodness been restored unto its former light and dignity, and that with\nsuch amendment and increase of the knowledge, that now hardly should I be\nadmitted unto the first form of the little grammar-schoolboys--I say, I,\nwho in my youthful days was, and that justly, reputed the most learned of\nthat age.  Which I do not speak in vain boasting, although I might lawfully\ndo it in writing unto thee--in verification whereof thou hast the authority\nof Marcus Tullius in his book of old age, and the sentence of Plutarch in\nthe book entitled How a man may praise himself without envy--but to give\nthee an emulous encouragement to strive yet further.\n\nNow is it that the minds of men are qualified with all manner of\ndiscipline, and the old sciences revived which for many ages were extinct.\nNow it is that the learned languages are to their pristine purity restored,\nviz., Greek, without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a\nscholar, Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaean, and Latin.  Printing likewise is now in\nuse, so elegant and so correct that better cannot be imagined, although it\nwas found out but in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical\nsuggestion on the other side was the invention of ordnance.  All the world\nis full of knowing men, of most learned schoolmasters, and vast libraries;\nand it appears to me as a truth, that neither in Plato's time, nor\nCicero's, nor Papinian's, there was ever such conveniency for studying as\nwe see at this day there is.  Nor must any adventure henceforward to come\nin public, or present himself in company, that hath not been pretty well\npolished in the shop of Minerva.  I see robbers, hangmen, freebooters,\ntapsters, ostlers, and such like, of the very rubbish of the people, more\nlearned now than the doctors and preachers were in my time.\n\nWhat shall I say?  The very women and children have aspired to this praise\nand celestial manner of good learning.  Yet so it is that, in the age I am\nnow of, I have been constrained to learn the Greek tongue--which I\ncontemned not like Cato, but had not the leisure in my younger years to\nattend the study of it--and take much delight in the reading of Plutarch's\nMorals, the pleasant Dialogues of Plato, the Monuments of Pausanias, and\nthe Antiquities of Athenaeus, in waiting on the hour wherein God my Creator\nshall call me and command me to depart from this earth and transitory\npilgrimage.  Wherefore, my son, I admonish thee to employ thy youth to\nprofit as well as thou canst, both in thy studies and in virtue.  Thou art\nat Paris, where the laudable examples of many brave men may stir up thy\nmind to gallant actions, and hast likewise for thy tutor and pedagogue the\nlearned Epistemon, who by his lively and vocal documents may instruct thee\nin the arts and sciences.\n\nI intend, and will have it so, that thou learn the languages perfectly;\nfirst of all the Greek, as Quintilian will have it; secondly, the Latin;\nand then the Hebrew, for the Holy Scripture sake; and then the Chaldee and\nArabic likewise, and that thou frame thy style in Greek in imitation of\nPlato, and for the Latin after Cicero.  Let there be no history which thou\nshalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting of which design,\nbooks of cosmography will be very conducible and help thee much.  Of the\nliberal arts of geometry, arithmetic, and music, I gave thee some taste\nwhen thou wert yet little, and not above five or six years old.  Proceed\nfurther in them, and learn the remainder if thou canst.  As for astronomy,\nstudy all the rules thereof.  Let pass, nevertheless, the divining and\njudicial astrology, and the art of Lullius, as being nothing else but plain\nabuses and vanities.  As for the civil law, of that I would have thee to\nknow the texts by heart, and then to confer them with philosophy.\n\nNow, in matter of the knowledge of the works of nature, I would have thee\nto study that exactly, and that so there be no sea, river, nor fountain, of\nwhich thou dost not know the fishes; all the fowls of the air; all the\nseveral kinds of shrubs and trees, whether in forests or orchards; all the\nsorts of herbs and flowers that grow upon the ground; all the various\nmetals that are hid within the bowels of the earth; together with all the\ndiversity of precious stones that are to be seen in the orient and south\nparts of the world.  Let nothing of all these be hidden from thee.  Then\nfail not most carefully to peruse the books of the Greek, Arabian, and\nLatin physicians, not despising the Talmudists and Cabalists; and by\nfrequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world,\ncalled the microcosm, which is man.  And at some hours of the day apply thy\nmind to the study of the Holy Scriptures; first in Greek, the New\nTestament, with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in\nHebrew.  In brief, let me see thee an abyss and bottomless pit of\nknowledge; for from henceforward, as thou growest great and becomest a man,\nthou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou must learn\nchivalry, warfare, and the exercises of the field, the better thereby to\ndefend my house and our friends, and to succour and protect them at all\ntheir needs against the invasion and assaults of evildoers.\n\nFurthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited,\nwhich thou canst not better do than by maintaining publicly theses and\nconclusions in all arts against all persons whatsoever, and by haunting the\ncompany of learned men, both at Paris and otherwhere.  But because, as the\nwise man Solomon saith, Wisdom entereth not into a malicious mind, and that\nknowledge without conscience is but the ruin of the soul, it behoveth thee\nto serve, to love, to fear God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all\nthy hope, and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him, so that thou\nmayst never be separated from him by thy sins.  Suspect the abuses of the\nworld.  Set not thy heart upon vanity, for this life is transitory, but the\nWord of the Lord endureth for ever.  Be serviceable to all thy neighbours,\nand love them as thyself.  Reverence thy preceptors:  shun the conversation\nof those whom thou desirest not to resemble, and receive not in vain the\ngraces which God hath bestowed upon thee.  And, when thou shalt see that\nthou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that\npart, return unto me, that I may see thee and give thee my blessing before\nI die.  My son, the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee.  Amen.\n\n    Thy father Gargantua.\n\n  From Utopia the 17th day of the month of March.\n\nThese letters being received and read, Pantagruel plucked up his heart,\ntook a fresh courage to him, and was inflamed with a desire to profit in\nhis studies more than ever, so that if you had seen him, how he took pains,\nand how he advanced in learning, you would have said that the vivacity of\nhis spirit amidst the books was like a great fire amongst dry wood, so\nactive it was, vigorous and indefatigable.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.IX.\n\nHow Pantagruel found Panurge, whom he loved all his lifetime.\n\nOne day, as Pantagruel was taking a walk without the city, towards St.\nAnthony's abbey, discoursing and philosophating with his own servants and\nsome other scholars, (he) met with a young man of very comely stature and\nsurpassing handsome in all the lineaments of his body, but in several parts\nthereof most pitifully wounded; in such bad equipage in matter of his\napparel, which was but tatters and rags, and every way so far out of order\nthat he seemed to have been a-fighting with mastiff-dogs, from whose fury\nhe had made an escape; or to say better, he looked, in the condition\nwherein he then was, like an apple-gatherer of the country of Perche.\n\nAs far off as Pantagruel saw him, he said to those that stood by, Do you\nsee that man there, who is a-coming hither upon the road from Charenton\nbridge?  By my faith, he is only poor in fortune; for I may assure you that\nby his physiognomy it appeareth that nature hath extracted him from some\nrich and noble race, and that too much curiosity hath thrown him upon\nadventures which possibly have reduced him to this indigence, want, and\npenury.  Now as he was just amongst them, Pantagruel said unto him, Let me\nentreat you, friend, that you may be pleased to stop here a little and\nanswer me to that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you will not\nthink your time ill bestowed; for I have an extreme desire, according to my\nability, to give you some supply in this distress wherein I see you are;\nbecause I do very much commiserate your case, which truly moves me to great\npity.  Therefore, my friend, tell me who you are; whence you come; whither\nyou go; what you desire; and what your name is.  The companion answered him\nin the German (The first edition reads \"Dutch.\") tongue, thus:\n\n'Junker, Gott geb euch gluck und heil.  Furwahr, lieber Junker, ich lasz\neuch wissen, das da ihr mich von fragt, ist ein arm und erbarmlich Ding,\nund wer viel darvon zu sagen, welches euch verdrussig zu horen, und mir zu\nerzelen wer, wiewol die Poeten und Oratorn vorzeiten haben gesagt in ihren\nSpruchen und Sentenzen, dasz die gedechtniss des Elends und Armuth\nvorlangst erlitten ist eine grosse Lust.'  My friend, said Pantagruel, I\nhave no skill in that gibberish of yours; therefore, if you would have us\nto understand you, speak to us in some other language.  Then did the droll\nanswer him thus:\n\n'Albarildim gotfano dechmin brin alabo dordio falbroth ringuam albaras.\nNin portzadikin almucatin milko prin alelmin en thoth dalheben ensouim;\nkuthim al dum alkatim nim broth dechoth porth min michais im endoth, pruch\ndalmaisoulum hol moth danfrihim lupaldas in voldemoth.  Nin hur diavosth\nmnarbotim dalgousch palfrapin duch im scoth pruch galeth dal chinon, min\nfoulchrich al conin brutathen doth dal prin.'  Do you understand none of\nthis? said Pantagruel to the company.  I believe, said Epistemon, that this\nis the language of the Antipodes, and such a hard one that the devil\nhimself knows not what to make of it.  Then said Pantagruel, Gossip, I know\nnot if the walls do comprehend the meaning of your words, but none of us\nhere doth so much as understand one syllable of them.  Then said my blade\nagain:\n\n'Signor mio, voi vedete per essempio, che la cornamusa non suona mai,\ns'ella non ha il ventre pieno.  Cosi io parimente non vi saprei contare le\nmie fortune, se prima il tribulato ventre non ha la solita refettione.  Al\nquale e adviso che le mani et li denti habbiano perso il loro ordine\nnaturale et del tutto annichilati.'  To which Epistemon answered, As much\nof the one as of the other, and nothing of either.  Then said Panurge:\n\n'Lord, if you be so virtuous of intelligence as you be naturally relieved\nto the body, you should have pity of me.  For nature hath made us equal,\nbut fortune hath some exalted and others deprived; nevertheless is virtue\noften deprived and the virtuous men despised; for before the last end none\nis good.'  (The following is the passage as it stands in the first edition.\nUrquhart seems to have rendered Rabelais' indifferent English into worse\nScotch, and this, with probably the use of contractions in his MS., or 'the\noddness' of handwriting which he owns to in his Logopandecteision (p.419,\nMait. Club. Edit.), has led to a chaotic jumble, which it is nearly\nimpossible to reduce to order.--Instead of any attempt to do so, it is here\ngiven verbatim: 'Lard gestholb besua virtuisbe intelligence:  ass yi body\nscalbisbe natural reloth cholb suld osme pety have; for natur hass visse\nequaly maide bot fortune sum exaiti hesse andoyis deprevit:  non yeless\niviss mou virtiuss deprevit, and virtuiss men decreviss for anen ye\nladeniss non quid.'  Here is a morsel for critical ingenuity to fix its\nteeth in.--M.)  Yet less, said Pantagruel.  Then said my jolly Panurge:\n\n'Jona andie guaussa goussy etan beharda er remedio beharde versela ysser\nlanda.  Anbat es otoy y es nausu ey nessassust gourray proposian ordine\nden.  Non yssena bayta facheria egabe gen herassy badia sadassu noura\nassia.  Aran hondavan gualde cydassu naydassuna.  Estou oussyc eg vinan\nsoury hien er darstura eguy harm.  Genicoa plasar vadu.'  Are you there,\nsaid Eudemon, Genicoa?  To this said Carpalim, St. Trinian's rammer\nunstitch your bum, for I had almost understood it.  Then answered Panurge:\n\n'Prust frest frinst sorgdmand strochdi drhds pag brlelang Gravot Chavigny\nPomardiere rusth pkaldracg Deviniere pres Nays.  Couille kalmuch monach\ndrupp del meupplist rincq drlnd dodelb up drent loch minc stz rinq jald de\nvins ders cordelis bur jocst stzampenards.'  Do you speak Christian, said\nEpistemon, or the buffoon language, otherwise called Patelinois?  Nay, it\nis the puzlatory tongue, said another, which some call Lanternois.  Then\nsaid Panurge:\n\n'Heere, ik en spreeke anders geen taele dan kersten taele:  my dunkt\nnoghtans, al en seg ik u niet een wordt, mynen noot verklaert genoegh wat\nik begeere:  geeft my uyt bermhertigheit yets waar van ik gevoet magh zyn.'\nTo which answered Pantagruel, As much of that.  Then said Panurge:\n\n'Sennor, de tanto hablar yo soy cansado, porque yo suplico a vuestra\nreverentia que mire a los preceptos evangelicos, para que ellos movan\nvuestra reverentia a lo que es de conscientia; y si ellos non bastaren,\npara mouer vuestra reverentia a piedad, yo suplico que mire a la piedad\nnatural, la qual yo creo que le movera como es de razon: y con esso non\ndigo mas.'  Truly, my friend, (said Pantagruel,) I doubt not but you can\nspeak divers languages; but tell us that which you would have us to do for\nyou in some tongue which you conceive we may understand.  Then said the\ncompanion:\n\n'Min Herre, endog ieg med ingen tunge talede, ligesom baern, oc uskellige\ncreatuure:  Mine klaedebon oc mit legoms magerhed uduiser alligeuel klarlig\nhuad ting mig best behof gioris, som er sandelig mad oc dricke:  Huorfor\nforbarme dig ofuer mig, oc befal at giue mig noguet, af huilcket ieg kand\nslyre min giaeendis mage, ligeruiis som mand Cerbero en suppe forsetter:\nSaa skalt du lefue laenge oc lycksalig.'  I think really, said Eusthenes,\nthat the Goths spoke thus of old, and that, if it pleased God, we would all\nof us speak so with our tails.  Then again said Panurge:\n\n'Adon, scalom lecha:  im ischar harob hal hebdeca bimeherah thithen li\nkikar lehem:  chanchat ub laah al Adonai cho nen ral.'  To which answered\nEpistemon, At this time have I understood him very well; for it is the\nHebrew tongue most rhetorically pronounced.  Then again said the gallant:\n\n'Despota tinyn panagathe, diati sy mi ouk artodotis? horas gar limo\nanaliscomenon eme athlion, ke en to metaxy me ouk eleis oudamos, zetis de\npar emou ha ou chre.  Ke homos philologi pantes homologousi tote logous te\nke remata peritta hyparchin, hopote pragma afto pasi delon esti.  Entha gar\nanankei monon logi isin, hina pragmata (hon peri amphisbetoumen), me\nprosphoros epiphenete.'  What?  Said Carpalim, Pantagruel's footman, It is\nGreek, I have understood him.  And how? hast thou dwelt any while in\nGreece?  Then said the droll again:\n\n'Agonou dont oussys vous desdagnez algorou:  nou den farou zamist vous\nmariston ulbrou, fousques voubrol tant bredaguez moupreton dengoulhoust,\ndaguez daguez non cropys fost pardonnoflist nougrou.  Agou paston tol\nnalprissys hourtou los echatonous, prou dhouquys brol pany gou den bascrou\nnoudous caguons goulfren goul oustaroppassou.'  (In this and the preceding\nspeeches of Panurge, the Paris Variorum Edition of 1823 has been followed\nin correcting Urquhart's text, which is full of inaccuracies.--M.)\nMethinks I understand him, said Pantagruel; for either it is the language\nof my country of Utopia, or sounds very like it.  And, as he was about to\nhave begun some purpose, the companion said:\n\n'Jam toties vos per sacra, perque deos deasque omnes obtestatus sum, ut si\nquae vos pietas permovet, egestatem meam solaremini, nec hilum proficio\nclamans et ejulans.  Sinite, quaeso, sinite, viri impii, quo me fata vocant\nabire; nec ultra vanis vestris interpellationibus obtundatis, memores\nveteris illius adagii, quo venter famelicus auriculis carere dicitur.'\nWell, my friend, said Pantagruel, but cannot you speak French?  That I can\ndo, sir, very well, said the companion, God be thanked.  It is my natural\nlanguage and mother tongue, for I was born and bred in my younger years in\nthe garden of France, to wit, Touraine.  Then, said Pantagruel, tell us\nwhat is your name, and from whence you are come; for, by my faith, I have\nalready stamped in my mind such a deep impression of love towards you,\nthat, if you will condescend unto my will, you shall not depart out of my\ncompany, and you and I shall make up another couple of friends such as\nAeneas and Achates were.  Sir, said the companion, my true and proper\nChristian name is Panurge, and now I come out of Turkey, to which country I\nwas carried away prisoner at that time when they went to Metelin with a\nmischief.  And willingly would I relate unto you my fortunes, which are\nmore wonderful than those of Ulysses were; but, seeing that it pleaseth you\nto retain me with you, I most heartily accept of the offer, protesting\nnever to leave you should you go to all the devils in hell.  We shall have\ntherefore more leisure at another time, and a fitter opportunity wherein to\nreport them; for at this present I am in a very urgent necessity to feed;\nmy teeth are sharp, my belly empty, my throat dry, and my stomach fierce\nand burning, all is ready.  If you will but set me to work, it will be as\ngood as a balsamum for sore eyes to see me gulch and raven it.  For God's\nsake, give order for it.  Then Pantagruel commanded that they should carry\nhim home and provide him good store of victuals; which being done, he ate\nvery well that evening, and, capon-like, went early to bed; then slept\nuntil dinner-time the next day, so that he made but three steps and one\nleap from the bed to the board.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.X.\n\nHow Pantagruel judged so equitably of a controversy, which was wonderfully\nobscure and difficult, that, by reason of his just decree therein, he was\nreputed to have a most admirable judgment.\n\nPantagruel, very well remembering his father's letter and admonitions,\nwould one day make trial of his knowledge.  Thereupon, in all the\ncarrefours, that is, throughout all the four quarters, streets, and corners\nof the city, he set up conclusions to the number of nine thousand seven\nhundred sixty and four, in all manner of learning, touching in them the\nhardest doubts that are in any science.  And first of all, in the Fodder\nStreet he held dispute against all the regents or fellows of colleges,\nartists or masters of arts, and orators, and did so gallantly that he\noverthrew them and set them all upon their tails.  He went afterwards to\nthe Sorbonne, where he maintained argument against all the theologians or\ndivines, for the space of six weeks, from four o'clock in the morning until\nsix in the evening, except an interval of two hours to refresh themselves\nand take their repast.  And at this were present the greatest part of the\nlords of the court, the masters of requests, presidents, counsellors, those\nof the accompts, secretaries, advocates, and others; as also the sheriffs\nof the said town, with the physicians and professors of the canon law.\nAmongst which, it is to be remarked, that the greatest part were stubborn\njades, and in their opinions obstinate; but he took such course with them\nthat, for all their ergoes and fallacies, he put their backs to the wall,\ngravelled them in the deepest questions, and made it visibly appear to the\nworld that, compared to him, they were but monkeys and a knot of muffled\ncalves.  Whereupon everybody began to keep a bustling noise and talk of his\nso marvellous knowledge, through all degrees of persons of both sexes, even\nto the very laundresses, brokers, roast-meat sellers, penknife makers, and\nothers, who, when he passed along in the street, would say, This is he! in\nwhich he took delight, as Demosthenes, the prince of Greek orators, did,\nwhen an old crouching wife, pointing at him with her fingers, said, That is\nthe man.\n\nNow at this same very time there was a process or suit in law depending in\ncourt between two great lords, of which one was called my Lord Kissbreech,\nplaintiff of one side, and the other my Lord Suckfist, defendant of the\nother; whose controversy was so high and difficult in law that the court of\nparliament could make nothing of it.  And therefore, by the commandment of\nthe king, there were assembled four of the greatest and most learned of all\nthe parliaments of France, together with the great council, and all the\nprincipal regents of the universities, not only of France, but of England\nalso and Italy, such as Jason, Philippus Decius, Petrus de Petronibus, and\na rabble of other old Rabbinists.  Who being thus met together, after they\nhad thereupon consulted for the space of six-and-forty weeks, finding that\nthey could not fasten their teeth in it, nor with such clearness understand\nthe case as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it, or\ntake up the difference betwixt the two aforesaid parties, it did so\ngrievously vex them that they most villainously conshit themselves for\nshame.  In this great extremity one amongst them, named Du Douhet, the\nlearnedest of all, and more expert and prudent than any of the rest, whilst\none day they were thus at their wits' end, all-to-be-dunced and\nphilogrobolized in their brains, said unto them, We have been here, my\nmasters, a good long space, without doing anything else than trifle away\nboth our time and money, and can nevertheless find neither brim nor bottom\nin this matter, for the more we study about it the less we understand\ntherein, which is a great shame and disgrace to us, and a heavy burden to\nour consciences; yea, such that in my opinion we shall not rid ourselves of\nit without dishonour, unless we take some other course; for we do nothing\nbut dote in our consultations.\n\nSee, therefore, what I have thought upon.  You have heard much talking of\nthat worthy personage named Master Pantagruel, who hath been found to be\nlearned above the capacity of this present age, by the proofs he gave in\nthose great disputations which he held publicly against all men.  My\nopinion is, that we send for him to confer with him about this business;\nfor never any man will encompass the bringing of it to an end if he do it\nnot.\n\nHereunto all the counsellors and doctors willingly agreed, and according to\nthat their result having instantly sent for him, they entreated him to be\npleased to canvass the process and sift it thoroughly, that, after a deep\nsearch and narrow examination of all the points thereof, he might forthwith\nmake the report unto them such as he shall think good in true and legal\nknowledge.  To this effect they delivered into his hands the bags wherein\nwere the writs and pancarts concerning that suit, which for bulk and weight\nwere almost enough to lade four great couillard or stoned asses. But\nPantagruel said unto them, Are the two lords between whom this debate and\nprocess is yet living?  It was answered him, Yes.  To what a devil, then,\nsaid he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which\nyou give me?  Is it not better to hear their controversy from their own\nmouths whilst they are face to face before us, than to read these vile\nfopperies, which are nothing but trumperies, deceits, diabolical cozenages\nof Cepola, pernicious slights and subversions of equity?  For I am sure\nthat you, and all those through whose hands this process has passed, have\nby your devices added what you could to it pro et contra in such sort that,\nalthough their difference perhaps was clear and easy enough to determine at\nfirst, you have obscured it and made it more intricate by the frivolous,\nsottish, unreasonable, and foolish reasons and opinions of Accursius,\nBaldus, Bartolus, de Castro, de Imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin,\nAlexander, Curtius, and those other old mastiffs, who never understood the\nleast law of the Pandects, they being but mere blockheads and great tithe\ncalves, ignorant of all that which was needful for the understanding of the\nlaws; for, as it is most certain, they had not the knowledge either of the\nGreek or Latin tongue, but only of the Gothic and barbarian.  The laws,\nnevertheless, were first taken from the Greeks, according to the testimony\nof Ulpian, L. poster. de origine juris, which we likewise may perceive by\nthat all the laws are full of Greek words and sentences.  And then we find\nthat they are reduced into a Latin style the most elegant and ornate that\nwhole language is able to afford, without excepting that of any that ever\nwrote therein, nay, not of Sallust, Varro, Cicero, Seneca, Titus Livius,\nnor Quintilian.  How then could these old dotards be able to understand\naright the text of the laws who never in their time had looked upon a good\nLatin book, as doth evidently enough appear by the rudeness of their style,\nwhich is fitter for a chimney-sweeper, or for a cook or a scullion, than\nfor a jurisconsult and doctor in the laws?\n\nFurthermore, seeing the laws are excerpted out of the middle of moral and\nnatural philosophy, how should these fools have understood it, that have,\nby G--, studied less in philosophy than my mule?  In respect of human\nlearning and the knowledge of antiquities and history they were truly laden\nwith those faculties as a toad is with feathers.  And yet of all this the\nlaws are so full that without it they cannot be understood, as I intend\nmore fully to show unto you in a peculiar treatise which on that purpose I\nam about to publish.  Therefore, if you will that I take any meddling in\nthis process, first cause all these papers to be burnt; secondly, make the\ntwo gentlemen come personally before me, and afterwards, when I shall have\nheard them, I will tell you my opinion freely without any feignedness or\ndissimulation whatsoever.\n\nSome amongst them did contradict this motion, as you know that in all\ncompanies there are more fools than wise men, and that the greater part\nalways surmounts the better, as saith Titus Livius in speaking of the\nCarthaginians.  But the foresaid Du Douhet held the contrary opinion,\nmaintaining that Pantagruel had said well, and what was right, in affirming\nthat these records, bills of inquest, replies, rejoinders, exceptions,\ndepositions, and other such diableries of truth-entangling writs, were but\nengines wherewith to overthrow justice and unnecessarily to prolong such\nsuits as did depend before them; and that, therefore, the devil would carry\nthem all away to hell if they did not take another course and proceeded not\nin times coming according to the prescripts of evangelical and\nphilosophical equity.  In fine, all the papers were burnt, and the two\ngentlemen summoned and personally convented.  At whose appearance before\nthe court Pantagruel said unto them, Are you they that have this great\ndifference betwixt you?  Yes, my lord, said they.  Which of you, said\nPantagruel, is the plaintiff?  It is I, said my Lord Kissbreech.  Go to,\nthen, my friend, said he, and relate your matter unto me from point to\npoint, according to the real truth, or else, by cock's body, if I find you\nto lie so much as in one word, I will make you shorter by the head, and\ntake it from off your shoulders to show others by your example that in\njustice and judgment men ought to speak nothing but the truth.  Therefore\ntake heed you do not add nor impair anything in the narration of your case.\nBegin.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XI.\n\nHow the Lords of Kissbreech and Suckfist did plead before Pantagruel\nwithout an attorney.\n\nThen began Kissbreech in manner as followeth.  My lord, it is true that a\ngood woman of my house carried eggs to the market to sell.  Be covered,\nKissbreech, said Pantagruel.  Thanks to you, my lord, said the Lord\nKissbreech; but to the purpose.  There passed betwixt the two tropics the\nsum of threepence towards the zenith and a halfpenny, forasmuch as the\nRiphaean mountains had been that year oppressed with a great sterility of\ncounterfeit gudgeons and shows without substance, by means of the babbling\ntattle and fond fibs seditiously raised between the gibblegabblers and\nAccursian gibberish-mongers for the rebellion of the Switzers, who had\nassembled themselves to the full number of the bumbees and myrmidons to go\na-handsel-getting on the first day of the new year, at that very time when\nthey give brewis to the oxen and deliver the key of the coals to the\ncountry-girls for serving in of the oats to the dogs.  All the night long\nthey did nothing else, keeping their hands still upon the pot, but\ndespatch, both on foot and horseback, leaden-sealed writs or letters, to\nwit, papal commissions commonly called bulls, to stop the boats; for the\ntailors and seamsters would have made of the stolen shreds and clippings a\ngoodly sagbut to cover the face of the ocean, which then was great with\nchild of a potful of cabbage, according to the opinion of the\nhay-bundle-makers.  But the physicians said that by the urine they\ncould discern no manifest sign of the bustard's pace, nor how to eat\ndouble-tongued mattocks with mustard, unless the lords and gentlemen of the\ncourt should be pleased to give by B.mol express command to the pox not to\nrun about any longer in gleaning up of coppersmiths and tinkers; for the\njobbernolls had already a pretty good beginning in their dance of the\nBritish jig called the estrindore, to a perfect diapason, with one foot in\nthe fire, and their head in the middle, as goodman Ragot was wont to say.\n\nHa, my masters, God moderates all things, and disposeth of them at his\npleasure, so that against unlucky fortune a carter broke his frisking whip,\nwhich was all the wind-instrument he had.  This was done at his return from\nthe little paltry town, even then when Master Antitus of Cressplots was\nlicentiated, and had passed his degrees in all dullery and blockishness,\naccording to this sentence of the canonists, Beati Dunces, quoniam ipsi\nstumblaverunt.  But that which makes Lent to be so high, by St. Fiacre of\nBry, is for nothing else but that the Pentecost never comes but to my cost;\nyet, on afore there, ho! a little rain stills a great wind, and we must\nthink so, seeing that the sergeant hath propounded the matter so far above\nmy reach, that the clerks and secondaries could not with the benefit\nthereof lick their fingers, feathered with ganders, so orbicularly as they\nwere wont in other things to do.  And we do manifestly see that everyone\nacknowledgeth himself to be in the error wherewith another hath been\ncharged, reserving only those cases whereby we are obliged to take an\nocular inspection in a perspective glass of these things towards the place\nin the chimney where hangeth the sign of the wine of forty girths, which\nhave been always accounted very necessary for the number of twenty pannels\nand pack-saddles of the bankrupt protectionaries of five years' respite.\nHowsoever, at least, he that would not let fly the fowl before the\ncheesecakes ought in law to have discovered his reason why not, for the\nmemory is often lost with a wayward shoeing.  Well, God keep Theobald\nMitain from all danger!  Then said Pantagruel, Hold there!  Ho, my friend,\nsoft and fair, speak at leisure and soberly without putting yourself in\ncholer.  I understand the case,--go on.  Now then, my lord, said\nKissbreech, the foresaid good woman saying her gaudez and audi nos, could\nnot cover herself with a treacherous backblow, ascending by the wounds and\npassions of the privileges of the universities, unless by the virtue of a\nwarming-pan she had angelically fomented every part of her body in covering\nthem with a hedge of garden-beds; then giving in a swift unavoidable thirst\n(thrust) very near to the place where they sell the old rags whereof the\npainters of Flanders make great use when they are about neatly to clap on\nshoes on grasshoppers, locusts, cigals, and such like fly-fowls, so strange\nto us that I am wonderfully astonished why the world doth not lay, seeing\nit is so good to hatch.\n\nHere the Lord of Suckfist would have interrupted him and spoken somewhat,\nwhereupon Pantagruel said unto him, St! by St. Anthony's belly, doth it\nbecome thee to speak without command?  I sweat here with the extremity of\nlabour and exceeding toil I take to understand the proceeding of your\nmutual difference, and yet thou comest to trouble and disquiet me.  Peace,\nin the devil's name, peace.  Thou shalt be permitted to speak thy bellyful\nwhen this man hath done, and no sooner.  Go on, said he to Kissbreech;\nspeak calmly, and do not overheat yourself with too much haste.\n\nI perceiving, then, said Kissbreech, that the Pragmatical Sanction did make\nno mention of it, and that the holy Pope to everyone gave liberty to fart\nat his own ease, if that the blankets had no streaks wherein the liars were\nto be crossed with a ruffian-like crew, and, the rainbow being newly\nsharpened at Milan to bring forth larks, gave his full consent that the\ngood woman should tread down the heel of the hip-gut pangs, by virtue of a\nsolemn protestation put in by the little testiculated or codsted fishes,\nwhich, to tell the truth, were at that time very necessary for\nunderstanding the syntax and construction of old boots.  Therefore John\nCalf, her cousin gervais once removed with a log from the woodstack, very\nseriously advised her not to put herself into the hazard of quagswagging in\nthe lee, to be scoured with a buck of linen clothes till first she had\nkindled the paper.  This counsel she laid hold on, because he desired her\nto take nothing and throw out, for Non de ponte vadit, qui cum sapientia\ncadit.  Matters thus standing, seeing the masters of the chamber of\naccompts or members of that committee did not fully agree amongst\nthemselves in casting up the number of the Almany whistles, whereof were\nframed those spectacles for princes which have been lately printed at\nAntwerp, I must needs think that it makes a bad return of the writ, and\nthat the adverse party is not to be believed, in sacer verbo dotis.  For\nthat, having a great desire to obey the pleasure of the king, I armed\nmyself from toe to top with belly furniture, of the soles of good\nvenison-pasties, to go see how my grape-gatherers and vintagers had pinked\nand cut full of small holes their high-coped caps, to lecher it the better,\nand play at in and in.  And indeed the time was very dangerous in coming\nfrom the fair, in so far that many trained bowmen were cast at the muster\nand quite rejected, although the chimney-tops were high enough, according to\nthe proportion of the windgalls in the legs of horses, or of the malanders,\nwhich in the esteem of expert farriers is no better disease, or else the\nstory of Ronypatifam or Lamibaudichon, interpreted by some to be the tale of\na tub or of a roasted horse, savours of apocrypha, and is not an authentic\nhistory.  And by this means there was that year great abundance, throughout\nall the country of Artois, of tawny buzzing beetles, to the no small profit\nof the gentlemen-great-stick-faggot-carriers, when they did eat without\ndisdaining the cocklicranes, till their belly was like to crack with it\nagain.  As for my own part, such is my Christian charity towards my\nneighbours, that I could wish from my heart everyone had as good a voice; it\nwould make us play the better at the tennis and the balloon.  And truly, my\nlord, to express the real truth without dissimulation, I cannot but say that\nthose petty subtle devices which are found out in the etymologizing of\npattens would descend more easily into the river of Seine, to serve for ever\nat the millers' bridge upon the said water, as it was heretofore decreed by\nthe king of the Canarians, according to the sentence or judgment given\nthereupon, which is to be seen in the registry and records within the\nclerk's office of this house.\n\nAnd, therefore, my lord, I do most humbly require, that by your lordship\nthere may be said and declared upon the case what is reasonable, with\ncosts, damages, and interests.  Then said Pantagruel, My friend, is this\nall you have to say?  Kissbreech answered, Yes, my lord, for I have told\nall the tu autem, and have not varied at all upon mine honour in so much as\none single word.  You then, said Pantagruel, my Lord of Suckfist, say what\nyou will, and be brief, without omitting, nevertheless, anything that may\nserve to the purpose.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XII.\n\nHow the Lord of Suckfist pleaded before Pantagruel.\n\nThen began the Lord Suckfist in manner as followeth.  My lord, and you my\nmasters, if the iniquity of men were as easily seen in categorical judgment\nas we can discern flies in a milkpot, the world's four oxen had not been so\neaten up with rats, nor had so many ears upon the earth been nibbled away\nso scurvily.  For although all that my adversary hath spoken be of a very\nsoft and downy truth, in so much as concerns the letter and history of the\nfactum, yet nevertheless the crafty slights, cunning subtleties, sly\ncozenages, and little troubling entanglements are hid under the rosepot,\nthe common cloak and cover of all fraudulent deceits.\n\nShould I endure that, when I am eating my pottage equal with the best, and\nthat without either thinking or speaking any manner of ill, they rudely\ncome to vex, trouble, and perplex my brains with that antique proverb which\nsaith,\n\n  Who in his pottage-eating drinks will not,\n  When he is dead and buried, see one jot.\n\nAnd, good lady, how many great captains have we seen in the day of battle,\nwhen in open field the sacrament was distributed in luncheons of the\nsanctified bread of the confraternity, the more honestly to nod their\nheads, play on the lute, and crack with their tails, to make pretty little\nplatform leaps in keeping level by the ground?  But now the world is\nunshackled from the corners of the packs of Leicester.  One flies out\nlewdly and becomes debauched; another, likewise, five, four, and two, and\nthat at such random that, if the court take not some course therein, it\nwill make as bad a season in matter of gleaning this year as ever it made,\nor it will make goblets.  If any poor creature go to the stoves to\nilluminate his muzzle with a cowsherd or to buy winter-boots, and that the\nsergeants passing by, or those of the watch, happen to receive the\ndecoction of a clyster or the fecal matter of a close-stool upon their\nrustling-wrangling-clutter-keeping masterships, should any because of that\nmake bold to clip the shillings and testers and fry the wooden dishes?\nSometimes, when we think one thing, God does another; and when the sun is\nwholly set all beasts are in the shade.  Let me never be believed again, if\nI do not gallantly prove it by several people who have seen the light of\nthe day.\n\nIn the year thirty and six, buying a Dutch curtail, which was a middle-sized\nhorse, both high and short, of a wool good enough and dyed in grain, as the\ngoldsmiths assured me, although the notary put an &c. in it, I told really\nthat I was not a clerk of so much learning as to snatch at the moon with my\nteeth; but, as for the butter-firkin where Vulcanian deeds and evidences\nwere sealed, the rumour was, and the report thereof went current, that\nsalt-beef will make one find the way to the wine without a candle, though it\nwere hid in the bottom of a collier's sack, and that with his drawers on he\nwere mounted on a barbed horse furnished with a fronstal, and such arms,\nthighs, and leg-pieces as are requisite for the well frying and broiling of\na swaggering sauciness.  Here is a sheep's head, and it is well they make a\nproverb of this, that it is good to see black cows in burnt wood when one\nattains to the enjoyment of his love.  I had a consultation upon this point\nwith my masters the clerks, who for resolution concluded in frisesomorum\nthat there is nothing like to mowing in the summer, and sweeping clean away\nin water, well garnished with paper, ink, pens, and penknives, of Lyons upon\nthe river of Rhone, dolopym dolopof, tarabin tarabas, tut, prut, pish; for,\nincontinently after that armour begins to smell of garlic, the rust will go\nnear to eat the liver, not of him that wears it, and then do they nothing\nelse but withstand others' courses, and wryneckedly set up their bristles\n'gainst one another, in lightly passing over their afternoon's sleep, and\nthis is that which maketh salt so dear. My lords, believe not when the said\ngood woman had with birdlime caught the shoveler fowl, the better before a\nsergeant's witness to deliver the younger son's portion to him, that the\nsheep's pluck or hog's haslet did dodge and shrink back in the usurers'\npurses, or that there could be anything better to preserve one from the\ncannibals than to take a rope of onions, knit with three hundred turnips,\nand a little of a calf's chaldern of the best allay that the alchemists have\nprovided, (and) that they daub and do over with clay, as also calcinate and\nburn to dust these pantoufles, muff in muff out, mouflin mouflard, with the\nfine sauce of the juice of the rabble rout, whilst they hide themselves in\nsome petty mouldwarphole, saving always the little slices of bacon.  Now, if\nthe dice will not favour you with any other throw but ambes-ace and the\nchance of three at the great end, mark well the ace, then take me your dame,\nsettle her in a corner of the bed, and whisk me her up drilletrille, there,\nthere, toureloura la la; which when you have done, take a hearty draught of\nthe best, despicando grenovillibus, in despite of the frogs, whose fair\ncoarse bebuskined stockings shall be set apart for the little green geese or\nmewed goslings, which, fattened in a coop, take delight to sport themselves\nat the wagtail game, waiting for the beating of the metal and heating of the\nwax by the slavering drivellers of consolation.\n\nVery true it is, that the four oxen which are in debate, and whereof\nmention was made, were somewhat short in memory.  Nevertheless, to\nunderstand the game aright, they feared neither the cormorant nor mallard\nof Savoy, which put the good people of my country in great hope that their\nchildren some time should become very skilful in algorism.  Therefore is\nit, that by a law rubric and special sentence thereof, that we cannot fail\nto take the wolf if we make our hedges higher than the windmill, whereof\nsomewhat was spoken by the plaintiff.  But the great devil did envy it, and\nby that means put the High Dutches far behind, who played the devils in\nswilling down and tippling at the good liquor, trink, mein herr, trink,\ntrink, by two of my table-men in the corner-point I have gained the lurch.\nFor it is not probable, nor is there any appearance of truth in this\nsaying, that at Paris upon a little bridge the hen is proportionable, and\nwere they as copped and high-crested as marsh whoops, if veritably they did\nnot sacrifice the printer's pumpet-balls at Moreb, with a new edge set upon\nthem by text letters or those of a swift-writing hand, it is all one to me,\nso that the headband of the book breed not moths or worms in it.  And put\nthe case that, at the coupling together of the buckhounds, the little\npuppies shall have waxed proud before the notary could have given an\naccount of the serving of his writ by the cabalistic art, it will\nnecessarily follow, under correction of the better judgment of the court,\nthat six acres of meadow ground of the greatest breadth will make three\nbutts of fine ink, without paying ready money; considering that, at the\nfuneral of King Charles, we might have had the fathom in open market for\none and two, that is, deuce ace.  This I may affirm with a safe conscience,\nupon my oath of wool.\n\nAnd I see ordinarily in all good bagpipes, that, when they go to the\ncounterfeiting of the chirping of small birds, by swinging a broom three\ntimes about a chimney, and putting his name upon record, they do nothing\nbut bend a crossbow backwards, and wind a horn, if perhaps it be too hot,\nand that, by making it fast to a rope he was to draw, immediately after the\nsight of the letters, the cows were restored to him.  Such another sentence\nafter the homeliest manner was pronounced in the seventeenth year, because\nof the bad government of Louzefougarouse, whereunto it may please the court\nto have regard.  I desire to be rightly understood; for truly, I say not\nbut that in all equity, and with an upright conscience, those may very well\nbe dispossessed who drink holy water as one would do a weaver's shuttle,\nwhereof suppositories are made to those that will not resign, but on the\nterms of ell and tell and giving of one thing for another.  Tunc, my lords,\nquid juris pro minoribus?  For the common custom of the Salic law is such,\nthat the first incendiary or firebrand of sedition that flays the cow and\nwipes his nose in a full concert of music without blowing in the cobbler's\nstitches, should in the time of the nightmare sublimate the penury of his\nmember by moss gathered when people are like to founder themselves at the\nmess at midnight, to give the estrapade to these white wines of Anjou that\ndo the fear of the leg in lifting it by horsemen called the gambetta, and\nthat neck to neck after the fashion of Brittany, concluding as before with\ncosts, damages, and interests.\n\nAfter that the Lord of Suckfist had ended, Pantagruel said to the Lord of\nKissbreech, My friend, have you a mind to make any reply to what is said?\nNo, my lord, answered Kissbreech; for I have spoke all I intended, and\nnothing but the truth.  Therefore, put an end for God's sake to our\ndifference, for we are here at great charge.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel gave judgment upon the difference of the two lords.\n\nThen Pantagruel, rising up, assembled all the presidents, counsellors, and\ndoctors that were there, and said unto them, Come now, my masters, you have\nheard vivae vocis oraculo, the controversy that is in question; what do you\nthink of it?  They answered him, We have indeed heard it, but have not\nunderstood the devil so much as one circumstance of the case; and therefore\nwe beseech you, una voce, and in courtesy request you that you would give\nsentence as you think good, and, ex nunc prout ex tunc, we are satisfied\nwith it, and do ratify it with our full consents.  Well, my masters, said\nPantagruel, seeing you are so pleased, I will do it; but I do not truly\nfind the case so difficult as you make it.  Your paragraph Caton, the law\nFrater, the law Gallus, the law Quinque pedum, the law Vinum, the law Si\nDominus, the law Mater, the law Mulier bona, to the law Si quis, the law\nPomponius, the law Fundi, the law Emptor, the law Praetor, the law\nVenditor, and a great many others, are far more intricate in my opinion.\nAfter he had spoke this, he walked a turn or two about the hall, plodding\nvery profoundly, as one may think; for he did groan like an ass whilst they\ngirth him too hard, with the very intensiveness of considering how he was\nbound in conscience to do right to both parties, without varying or\naccepting of persons.  Then he returned, sat down, and began to pronounce\nsentence as followeth.\n\nHaving seen, heard, calculated, and well considered of the difference\nbetween the Lords of Kissbreech and Suckfist, the court saith unto them,\nthat in regard of the sudden quaking, shivering, and hoariness of the\nflickermouse, bravely declining from the estival solstice, to attempt by\nprivate means the surprisal of toyish trifles in those who are a little\nunwell for having taken a draught too much, through the lewd demeanour and\nvexation of the beetles that inhabit the diarodal (diarhomal) climate of an\nhypocritical ape on horseback, bending a crossbow backwards, the plaintiff\ntruly had just cause to calfet, or with oakum to stop the chinks of the\ngalleon which the good woman blew up with wind, having one foot shod and\nthe other bare, reimbursing and restoring to him, low and stiff in his\nconscience, as many bladder-nuts and wild pistaches as there is of hair in\neighteen cows, with as much for the embroiderer, and so much for that.  He\nis likewise declared innocent of the case privileged from the knapdardies,\ninto the danger whereof it was thought he had incurred; because he could\nnot jocundly and with fulness of freedom untruss and dung, by the decision\nof a pair of gloves perfumed with the scent of bum-gunshot at the\nwalnut-tree taper, as is usual in his country of Mirebalais.  Slacking,\ntherefore, the topsail, and letting go the bowline with the brazen bullets,\nwherewith the mariners did by way of protestation bake in pastemeat great\nstore of pulse interquilted with the dormouse, whose hawk's-bells were made\nwith a puntinaria, after the manner of Hungary or Flanders lace, and which\nhis brother-in-law carried in a pannier, lying near to three chevrons or\nbordered gules, whilst he was clean out of heart, drooping and crestfallen\nby the too narrow sifting, canvassing, and curious examining of the matter\nin the angularly doghole of nasty scoundrels, from whence we shoot at the\nvermiformal popinjay with the flap made of a foxtail.\n\nBut in that he chargeth the defendant that he was a botcher, cheese-eater,\nand trimmer of man's flesh embalmed, which in the arsiversy swagfall tumble\nwas not found true, as by the defendant was very well discussed.\n\nThe court, therefore, doth condemn and amerce him in three porringers of\ncurds, well cemented and closed together, shining like pearls, and\ncodpieced after the fashion of the country, to be paid unto the said\ndefendant about the middle of August in May.  But, on the other part, the\ndefendant shall be bound to furnish him with hay and stubble for stopping\nthe caltrops of his throat, troubled and impulregafized, with gabardines\ngarbled shufflingly, and friends as before, without costs and for cause.\n\nWhich sentence being pronounced, the two parties departed both contented\nwith the decree, which was a thing almost incredible.  For it never came to\npass since the great rain, nor shall the like occur in thirteen jubilees\nhereafter, that two parties contradictorily contending in judgment be\nequally satisfied and well pleased with the definitive sentence.  As for\nthe counsellors and other doctors in the law that were there present, they\nwere all so ravished with admiration at the more than human wisdom of\nPantagruel, which they did most clearly perceive to be in him by his so\naccurate decision of this so difficult and thorny cause, that their spirits\nwith the extremity of the rapture being elevated above the pitch of\nactuating the organs of the body, they fell into a trance and sudden\necstasy, wherein they stayed for the space of three long hours, and had\nbeen so as yet in that condition had not some good people fetched store of\nvinegar and rose-water to bring them again unto their former sense and\nunderstanding, for the which God be praised everywhere.  And so be it.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XIV.\n\nHow Panurge related the manner how he escaped out of the hands of the\nTurks.\n\nThe great wit and judgment of Pantagruel was immediately after this made\nknown unto all the world by setting forth his praises in print, and putting\nupon record this late wonderful proof he hath given thereof amongst the\nrolls of the crown and registers of the palace, in such sort that everybody\nbegan to say that Solomon, who by a probable guess only, without any\nfurther certainty, caused the child to be delivered to its own mother,\nshowed never in his time such a masterpiece of wisdom as the good\nPantagruel hath done.  Happy are we, therefore, that have him in our\ncountry.  And indeed they would have made him thereupon master of the\nrequests and president in the court; but he refused all, very graciously\nthanking them for their offer.  For, said he, there is too much slavery in\nthese offices, and very hardly can they be saved that do exercise them,\nconsidering the great corruption that is amongst men.  Which makes me\nbelieve, if the empty seats of angels be not filled with other kind of\npeople than those, we shall not have the final judgment these seven\nthousand, sixty and seven jubilees yet to come, and so Cusanus will be\ndeceived in his conjecture.  Remember that I have told you of it, and given\nyou fair advertisement in time and place convenient.\n\nBut if you have any hogsheads of good wine, I willingly will accept of a\npresent of that.  Which they very heartily did do, in sending him of the\nbest that was in the city, and he drank reasonably well, but poor Panurge\nbibbed and boused of it most villainously, for he was as dry as a\nred-herring, as lean as a rake, and, like a poor, lank, slender cat, walked\ngingerly as if he had trod upon eggs.  So that by someone being admonished,\nin the midst of his draught of a large deep bowl full of excellent claret\nwith these words--Fair and softly, gossip, you suck up as if you were mad\n--I give thee to the devil, said he; thou hast not found here thy little\ntippling sippers of Paris, that drink no more than the little bird called a\nspink or chaffinch, and never take in their beakful of liquor till they be\nbobbed on the tails after the manner of the sparrows.  O companion! if I\ncould mount up as well as I can get down, I had been long ere this above\nthe sphere of the moon with Empedocles.  But I cannot tell what a devil\nthis means.  This wine is so good and delicious, that the more I drink\nthereof the more I am athirst.  I believe that the shadow of my master\nPantagruel engendereth the altered and thirsty men, as the moon doth the\ncatarrhs and defluxions.  At which word the company began to laugh, which\nPantagruel perceiving, said, Panurge, what is that which moves you to laugh\nso?  Sir, said he, I was telling them that these devilish Turks are very\nunhappy in that they never drink one drop of wine, and that though there\nwere no other harm in all Mahomet's Alcoran, yet for this one base point of\nabstinence from wine which therein is commanded, I would not submit myself\nunto their law.  But now tell me, said Pantagruel, how you escaped out of\ntheir hands. By G--, sir, said Panurge, I will not lie to you in one word.\n\nThe rascally Turks had broached me upon a spit all larded like a rabbit,\nfor I was so dry and meagre that otherwise of my flesh they would have made\nbut very bad meat, and in this manner began to roast me alive.  As they\nwere thus roasting me, I recommended myself unto the divine grace, having\nin my mind the good St. Lawrence, and always hoped in God that he would\ndeliver me out of this torment.  Which came to pass, and that very\nstrangely.  For as I did commit myself with all my heart unto God, crying,\nLord God, help me!  Lord God, save me!  Lord God, take me out of this pain\nand hellish torture, wherein these traitorous dogs detain me for my\nsincerity in the maintenance of thy law!  The roaster or turnspit fell\nasleep by the divine will, or else by the virtue of some good Mercury, who\ncunningly brought Argus into a sleep for all his hundred eyes.  When I saw\nthat he did no longer turn me in roasting, I looked upon him, and perceived\nthat he was fast asleep.  Then took I up in my teeth a firebrand by the end\nwhere it was not burnt, and cast it into the lap of my roaster, and another\ndid I throw as well as I could under a field-couch that was placed near to\nthe chimney, wherein was the straw-bed of my master turnspit.  Presently\nthe fire took hold in the straw, and from the straw to the bed, and from\nthe bed to the loft, which was planked and ceiled with fir, after the\nfashion of the foot of a lamp.  But the best was, that the fire which I had\ncast into the lap of my paltry roaster burnt all his groin, and was\nbeginning to cease (seize) upon his cullions, when he became sensible of\nthe danger, for his smelling was not so bad but that he felt it sooner than\nhe could have seen daylight.  Then suddenly getting up, and in a great\namazement running to the window, he cried out to the streets as high as he\ncould, Dal baroth, dal baroth, dal baroth, which is as much to say as Fire,\nfire, fire.  Incontinently turning about, he came straight towards me to\nthrow me quite into the fire, and to that effect had already cut the ropes\nwherewith my hands were tied, and was undoing the cords from off my feet,\nwhen the master of the house hearing him cry Fire, and smelling the smoke\nfrom the very street where he was walking with some other Bashaws and\nMustaphas, ran with all the speed he had to save what he could, and to\ncarry away his jewels.  Yet such was his rage, before he could well resolve\nhow to go about it, that he caught the broach whereon I was spitted and\ntherewith killed my roaster stark dead, of which wound he died there for\nwant of government or otherwise; for he ran him in with the spit a little\nabove the navel, towards the right flank, till he pierced the third lappet\nof his liver, and the blow slanting upwards from the midriff or diaphragm,\nthrough which it had made penetration, the spit passed athwart the\npericardium or capsule of his heart, and came out above at his shoulders,\nbetwixt the spondyls or turning joints of the chine of the back and the\nleft homoplat, which we call the shoulder-blade.\n\nTrue it is, for I will not lie, that, in drawing the spit out of my body I\nfell to the ground near unto the andirons, and so by the fall took some\nhurt, which indeed had been greater, but that the lardons, or little slices\nof bacon wherewith I was stuck, kept off the blow.  My Bashaw then seeing\nthe case to be desperate, his house burnt without remission, and all his\ngoods lost, gave himself over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon\nsome of them by their names, Grilgoth, Astaroth, Rappalus, and Gribouillis,\nnine several times.  Which when I saw, I had above sixpence' worth of fear,\ndreading that the devils would come even then to carry away this fool, and,\nseeing me so near him, would perhaps snatch me up to.  I am already,\nthought I, half roasted, and my lardons will be the cause of my mischief;\nfor these devils are very liquorous of lardons, according to the authority\nwhich you have of the philosopher Jamblicus, and Murmault, in the Apology\nof Bossutis, adulterated pro magistros nostros.  But for my better security\nI made the sign of the cross, crying, Hageos, athanatos, ho theos, and none\ncame.  At which my rogue Bashaw being very much aggrieved would, in\ntranspiercing his heart with my spit, have killed himself, and to that\npurpose had set it against his breast, but it could not enter, because it\nwas not sharp enough.  Whereupon I perceiving that he was not like to work\nupon his body the effect which he intended, although he did not spare all\nthe force he had to thrust it forward, came up to him and said, Master\nBugrino, thou dost here but trifle away thy time, or rashly lose it, for\nthou wilt never kill thyself thus as thou doest.  Well, thou mayst hurt or\nbruise somewhat within thee, so as to make thee languish all thy lifetime\nmost pitifully amongst the hands of the chirurgeons; but if thou wilt be\ncounselled by me, I will kill thee clear outright, so that thou shalt not\nso much as feel it, and trust me, for I have killed a great many others,\nwho have found themselves very well after it.  Ha, my friend, said he, I\nprithee do so, and for thy pains I will give thee my codpiece (budget);\ntake, here it is, there are six hundred seraphs in it, and some fine\ndiamonds and most excellent rubies.  And where are they? said Epistemon.\nBy St. John, said Panurge, they are a good way hence, if they always keep\ngoing.  But where is the last year's snow?  This was the greatest care that\nVillon the Parisian poet took.  Make an end, said Pantagruel, that we may\nknow how thou didst dress thy Bashaw.  By the faith of an honest man, said\nPanurge, I do not lie in one word.  I swaddled him in a scurvy\nswathel-binding which I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tied\nhim roister-like both hand and foot, in such sort that he was not able to\nwince; then passed my spit through his throat, and hanged him thereon,\nfastening the end thereof at two great hooks or crampirons, upon which they\ndid hang their halberds; and then, kindling a fair fire under him, did flame\nyou up my Milourt, as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney.  With this,\ntaking his budget and a little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks, I\nran away a fair gallop-rake, and God he knows how I did smell my shoulder of\nmutton.\n\nWhen I was come down into the street, I found everybody come to put out the\nfire with store of water, and seeing me so half-roasted, they did naturally\npity my case, and threw all their water upon me, which, by a most joyful\nrefreshing of me, did me very much good.  Then did they present me with\nsome victuals, but I could not eat much, because they gave me nothing to\ndrink but water after their fashion.  Other hurt they did me none, only one\nlittle villainous Turkey knobbreasted rogue came thiefteously to snatch\naway some of my lardons, but I gave him such a sturdy thump and sound rap\non the fingers with all the weight of my javelin, that he came no more the\nsecond time.  Shortly after this there came towards me a pretty young\nCorinthian wench, who brought me a boxful of conserves, of round Mirabolan\nplums, called emblicks, and looked upon my poor robin with an eye of great\ncompassion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked with the sparkles of the fire\nfrom whence it came, for it reached no farther in length, believe me, than\nmy knees.  But note that this roasting cured me entirely of a sciatica,\nwhereunto I had been subject above seven years before, upon that side which\nmy roaster by falling asleep suffered to be burnt.\n\nNow, whilst they were thus busy about me, the fire triumphed, never ask\nhow?  For it took hold on above two thousand houses, which one of them\nespying cried out, saying, By Mahoom's belly, all the city is on fire, and\nwe do nevertheless stand gazing here, without offering to make any relief.\nUpon this everyone ran to save his own; for my part, I took my way towards\nthe gate.  When I was got upon the knap of a little hillock not far off, I\nturned me about as did Lot's wife, and, looking back, saw all the city\nburning in a fair fire, whereat I was so glad that I had almost beshit\nmyself for joy.  But God punished me well for it.  How? said Pantagruel.\nThus, said Panurge; for when with pleasure I beheld this jolly fire,\njesting with myself, and saying--Ha! poor flies, ha! poor mice, you will\nhave a bad winter of it this year; the fire is in your reeks, it is in your\nbed-straw--out come more than six, yea, more than thirteen hundred and\neleven dogs, great and small, altogether out of the town, flying away from\nthe fire.  At the first approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by\nthe scent of my lecherous half-roasted flesh, and had even then devoured me\nin a trice, if my good angel had not well inspired me with the instruction\nof a remedy very sovereign against the toothache.  And wherefore, said\nPantagruel, wert thou afraid of the toothache or pain of the teeth?  Wert\nthou not cured of thy rheums?  By Palm Sunday, said Panurge, is there any\ngreater pain of the teeth than when the dogs have you by the legs?  But on\na sudden, as my good angel directed me, I thought upon my lardons, and\nthrew them into the midst of the field amongst them.  Then did the dogs\nrun, and fight with one another at fair teeth which should have the\nlardons.  By this means they left me, and I left them also bustling with\nand hairing one another.  Thus did I escape frolic and lively, gramercy\nroastmeat and cookery.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XV.\n\nHow Panurge showed a very new way to build the walls of Paris.\n\nPantagruel one day, to refresh himself of his study, went a-walking towards\nSt. Marcel's suburbs, to see the extravagancy of the Gobeline building, and\nto taste of their spiced bread.  Panurge was with him, having always a\nflagon under his gown and a good slice of a gammon of bacon; for without\nthis he never went, saying that it was as a yeoman of the guard to him, to\npreserve his body from harm.  Other sword carried he none; and, when\nPantagruel would have given him one, he answered that he needed none, for\nthat it would but heat his milt.  Yea but, said Epistemon, if thou shouldst\nbe set upon, how wouldst thou defend thyself?  With great buskinades or\nbrodkin blows, answered he, provided thrusts were forbidden.  At their\nreturn, Panurge considered the walls of the city of Paris, and in derision\nsaid to Pantagruel, See what fair walls here are!  O how strong they are,\nand well fitted to keep geese in a mew or coop to fatten them!  By my\nbeard, they are competently scurvy for such a city as this is; for a cow\nwith one fart would go near to overthrow above six fathoms of them.  O my\nfriend, said Pantagruel, dost thou know what Agesilaus said when he was\nasked why the great city of Lacedaemon was not enclosed with walls?  Lo\nhere, said he, the walls of the city! in showing them the inhabitants and\ncitizens thereof, so strong, so well armed, and so expert in military\ndiscipline; signifying thereby that there is no wall but of bones, and that\ntowns and cities cannot have a surer wall nor better fortification than the\nprowess and virtue of the citizens and inhabitants.  So is this city so\nstrong, by the great number of warlike people that are in it, that they\ncare not for making any other walls.  Besides, whosoever would go about to\nwall it, as Strasbourg, Orleans, or Ferrara, would find it almost\nimpossible, the cost and charges would be so excessive.  Yea but, said\nPanurge, it is good, nevertheless, to have an outside of stone when we are\ninvaded by our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there?  As for the\nenormous expense which you say would be needful for undertaking the great\nwork of walling this city about, if the gentlemen of the town will be\npleased to give me a good rough cup of wine, I will show them a pretty,\nstrange, and new way, how they may build them good cheap.  How? said\nPantagruel.  Do not speak of it then, answered Panurge, and I will tell it\nyou.  I see that the sine quo nons, kallibistris, or contrapunctums of the\nwomen of this country are better cheap than stones.  Of them should the\nwalls be built, ranging them in good symmetry by the rules of architecture,\nand placing the largest in the first ranks, then sloping downwards\nridge-wise, like the back of an ass.  The middle-sized ones must be ranked\nnext, and last of all the least and smallest.  This done, there must be a\nfine little interlacing of them, like points of diamonds, as is to be seen\nin the great tower of Bourges, with a like number of the nudinnudos,\nnilnisistandos, and stiff bracmards, that dwell in amongst the claustral\ncodpieces.  What devil were able to overthrow such walls?  There is no metal\nlike it to resist blows, in so far that, if culverin-shot should come to\ngraze upon it, you would incontinently see distil from thence the blessed\nfruit of the great pox as small as rain.  Beware, in the name of the devils,\nand hold off.  Furthermore, no thunderbolt or lightning would fall upon it.\nFor why?  They are all either blest or consecrated.  I see but one\ninconveniency in it.  Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha! said Pantagruel, and what is that?\nIt is, that the flies would be so liquorish of them that you would wonder,\nand would quickly gather there together, and there leave their ordure and\nexcretions, and so all the work would be spoiled.  But see how that might be\nremedied:  they must be wiped and made rid of the flies with fair foxtails,\nor great good viedazes, which are ass-pizzles, of Provence.  And to this\npurpose I will tell you, as we go to supper, a brave example set down by\nFrater Lubinus, Libro de compotationibus mendicantium.\n\nIn the time that the beasts did speak, which is not yet three days since, a\npoor lion, walking through the forest of Bieure, and saying his own little\nprivate devotions, passed under a tree where there was a roguish collier\ngotten up to cut down wood, who, seeing the lion, cast his hatchet at him\nand wounded him enormously in one of his legs; whereupon the lion halting,\nhe so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roaming up and down the forest\nto find help, that at last he met with a carpenter, who willingly looked\nupon his wound, cleansed it as well as he could, and filled it with moss,\ntelling him that he must wipe his wound well that the flies might not do\ntheir excrements in it, whilst he should go search for some yarrow or\nmillefoil, commonly called the carpenter's herb.  The lion, being thus\nhealed, walked along in the forest at what time a sempiternous crone and\nold hag was picking up and gathering some sticks in the said forest, who,\nseeing the lion coming towards her, for fear fell down backwards, in such\nsort that the wind blew up her gown, coats, and smock, even as far as above\nher shoulders; which the lion perceiving, for pity ran to see whether she\nhad taken any hurt by the fall, and thereupon considering her how do you\ncall it, said, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee?  Which words when\nhe had spoken, he espied a fox, whom he called to come to him saying,\nGossip Reynard, hau, hither, hither, and for cause!  When the fox was come,\nhe said unto him, My gossip and friend, they have hurt this good woman here\nbetween the legs most villainously, and there is a manifest solution of\ncontinuity.  See how great a wound it is, even from the tail up to the\nnavel, in measure four, nay full five handfuls and a half.  This is the\nblow of a hatchet, I doubt me; it is an old wound, and therefore, that the\nflies may not get into it, wipe it lustily well and hard, I prithee, both\nwithin and without; thou hast a good tail, and long.  Wipe, my friend,\nwipe, I beseech thee, and in the meanwhile I will go get some moss to put\ninto it; for thus ought we to succour and help one another.  Wipe it hard,\nthus, my friend; wipe it well, for this wound must be often wiped,\notherwise the party cannot be at ease.  Go to, wipe well, my little gossip,\nwipe; God hath furnished thee with a tail; thou hast a long one, and of a\nbigness proportionable; wipe hard, and be not weary.  A good wiper, who, in\nwiping continually, wipeth with his wipard, by wasps shall never be\nwounded.  Wipe, my pretty minion; wipe, my little bully; I will not stay\nlong.  Then went he to get store of moss; and when he was a little way off,\nhe cried out in speaking to the fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip, wipe,\nand let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little gossip; I will put\nthee into service to be wiper to Don Pedro de Castile; wipe, only wipe, and\nno more.  The poor fox wiped as hard as he could, here and there, within\nand without; but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist that she stunk\nlike a hundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great deal of ill ease,\nfor he knew not to what side to turn himself to escape the unsavoury\nperfume of this old woman's postern blasts.  And whilst to that effect he\nwas shifting hither and thither, without knowing how to shun the annoyance\nof those unwholesome gusts, he saw that behind there was yet another hole,\nnot so great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and\ninfectious air.  The lion at last returned, bringing with him of moss more\nthan eighteen packs would hold, and began to put into the wound with a\nstaff which he had provided for that purpose, and had already put in full\nsixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed.  What a devil! said he,\nthis wound is very deep; it would hold above two cartloads of moss.  The\nfox, perceiving this, said unto the lion, O gossip lion, my friend, I pray\nthee do not put in all thy moss there; keep somewhat, for there is yet here\nanother little hole, that stinks like five hundred devils; I am almost\nchoked with the smell thereof, it is so pestiferous and empoisoning.\n\nThus must these walls be kept from the flies, and wages allowed to some for\nwiping of them.  Then said Pantagruel, How dost thou know that the privy\nparts of women are at such a cheap rate?  For in this city there are many\nvirtuous, honest, and chaste women besides the maids.  Et ubi prenus? said\nPanurge.  I will give you my opinion of it, and that upon certain and\nassured knowledge.  I do not brag that I have bumbasted four hundred and\nseventeen since I came into this city, though it be but nine days ago; but\nthis very morning I met with a good fellow, who, in a wallet such as\nAesop's was, carried two little girls of two or three years old at the\nmost, one before and the other behind.  He demanded alms of me, but I made\nhim answer that I had more cods than pence.  Afterwards I asked him, Good\nman, these two girls, are they maids?  Brother, said he, I have carried\nthem thus these two years, and in regard of her that is before, whom I see\ncontinually, in my opinion she is a virgin, nevertheless I will not put my\nfinger in the fire for it; as for her that is behind, doubtless I can say\nnothing.\n\nIndeed, said Pantagruel, thou art a gentle companion; I will have thee to\nbe apparelled in my livery.  And therefore caused him to be clothed most\ngallantly according to the fashion that then was, only that Panurge would\nhave the codpiece of his breeches three foot long, and in shape square, not\nround; which was done, and was well worth the seeing.  Oftentimes was he\nwont to say, that the world had not yet known the emolument and utility\nthat is in wearing great codpieces; but time would one day teach it them,\nas all things have been invented in time.  God keep from hurt, said he, the\ngood fellow whose long codpiece or braguet hath saved his life!  God keep\nfrom hurt him whose long braguet hath been worth to him in one day one\nhundred threescore thousand and nine crowns!  God keep from hurt him who by\nhis long braguet hath saved a whole city from dying by famine!  And, by G-,\nI will make a book of the commodity of long braguets when I shall have more\nleisure.  And indeed he composed a fair great book with figures, but it is\nnot printed as yet that I know of.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XVI.\n\nOf the qualities and conditions of Panurge.\n\nPanurge was of a middle stature, not too high nor too low, and had somewhat\nan aquiline nose, made like the handle of a razor.  He was at that time\nfive and thirty years old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden\ndagger--for he was a notable cheater and coney-catcher--he was a very\ngallant and proper man of his person, only that he was a little lecherous,\nand naturally subject to a kind of disease which at that time they called\nlack of money--it is an incomparable grief, yet, notwithstanding, he had\nthree score and three tricks to come by it at his need, of which the most\nhonourable and most ordinary was in manner of thieving, secret purloining\nand filching, for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a cozener, drinker, roister,\nrover, and a very dissolute and debauched fellow, if there were any in\nParis; otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most virtuous man\nin the world; and he was still contriving some plot, and devising mischief\nagainst the sergeants and the watch.\n\nAt one time he assembled three or four especial good hacksters and roaring\nboys, made them in the evening drink like Templars, afterwards led them\ntill they came under St. Genevieve, or about the college of Navarre, and,\nat the hour that the watch was coming up that way--which he knew by putting\nhis sword upon the pavement, and his ear by it, and, when he heard his\nsword shake, it was an infallible sign that the watch was near at that\ninstant--then he and his companions took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and gave\nit the brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and so\noverthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon the other\nside; for in less than two days he knew all the streets, lanes, and\nturnings in Paris as well as his Deus det.\n\nAt another time he made in some fair place, where the said watch was to\npass, a train of gunpowder, and, at the very instant that they went along,\nset fire to it, and then made himself sport to see what good grace they had\nin running away, thinking that St. Anthony's fire had caught them by the\nlegs.  As for the poor masters of arts, he did persecute them above all\nothers.  When he encountered with any of them upon the street, he would not\nnever fail to put some trick or other upon them, sometimes putting the bit\nof a fried turd in their graduate hoods, at other times pinning on little\nfoxtails or hares'-ears behind them, or some such other roguish prank.  One\nday that they were appointed all to meet in the Fodder Street (Sorbonne),\nhe made a Borbonesa tart, or filthy and slovenly compound, made of store of\ngarlic, of assafoetida, of castoreum, of dogs' turds very warm, which he\nsteeped, tempered, and liquefied in the corrupt matter of pocky boils and\npestiferous botches; and, very early in the morning therewith anointed all\nthe pavement, in such sort that the devil could not have endured it, which\nmade all these good people there to lay up their gorges, and vomit what was\nupon their stomachs before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox;\nand ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers,\neighteen grew lousy, and about seven and twenty had the pox, but he did not\ncare a button for it.  He commonly carried a whip under his gown, wherewith\nhe whipped without remission the pages whom he found carrying wine to their\nmasters, to make them mend their pace.  In his coat he had above six and\ntwenty little fobs and pockets always full; one with some lead-water, and a\nlittle knife as sharp as a glover's needle, wherewith he used to cut\npurses; another with some kind of bitter stuff, which he threw into the\neyes of those he met; another with clotburrs, penned with little geese' or\ncapon's feathers, which he cast upon the gowns and caps of honest people,\nand often made them fair horns, which they wore about all the city,\nsometimes all their life.  Very often, also, upon the women's French hoods\nwould he stick in the hind part somewhat made in the shape of a man's\nmember.  In another, he had a great many little horns full of fleas and\nlice, which he borrowed from the beggars of St. Innocent, and cast them\nwith small canes or quills to write with into the necks of the daintiest\ngentlewomen that he could find, yea, even in the church, for he never\nseated himself above in the choir, but always sat in the body of the church\namongst the women, both at mass, at vespers, and at sermon.  In another, he\nused to have good store of hooks and buckles, wherewith he would couple men\nand women together that sat in company close to one another, but especially\nthose that wore gowns of crimson taffeties, that, when they were about to\ngo away, they might rend all their gowns.  In another, he had a squib\nfurnished with tinder, matches, stones to strike fire, and all other\ntackling necessary for it.  In another, two or three burning glasses,\nwherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad, and in the church put\nthem quite out of countenance; for he said that there was but an\nantistrophe, or little more difference than of a literal inversion, between\na woman folle a la messe and molle a la fesse, that is, foolish at the mass\nand of a pliant buttock.\n\nIn another, he had a good deal of needles and thread, wherewith he did a\nthousand little devilish pranks.  One time, at the entry of the palace unto\nthe great hall, where a certain grey friar or cordelier was to say mass to\nthe counsellors, he did help to apparel him and put on his vestments, but\nin the accoutring of him he sewed on his alb, surplice, or stole, to his\ngown and shirt, and then withdrew himself when the said lords of the court\nor counsellors came to hear the said mass; but when it came to the Ite,\nmissa est, that the poor frater would have laid by his stole or surplice,\nas the fashion then was, he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt,\nwhich were well sewed together, and thereby stripping himself up to the\nvery shoulders showed his bel vedere to all the world, together with his\nDon Cypriano, which was no small one, as you may imagine.  And the friar\nstill kept haling, but so much the more did he discover himself and lay\nopen his back parts, till one of the lords of the court said, How now!\nwhat's the matter?  Will this fair father make us here an offering of his\ntail to kiss it?  Nay, St. Anthony's fire kiss it for us!  From thenceforth\nit was ordained that the poor fathers should never disrobe themselves any\nmore before the world, but in their vestry-room, or sextry, as they call\nit; especially in the presence of women, lest it should tempt them to the\nsin of longing and disordinate desire.  The people then asked why it was\nthe friars had so long and large genitories?  The said Panurge resolved the\nproblem very neatly, saying, That which makes asses to have such great ears\nis that their dams did put no biggins on their heads, as Alliaco mentioneth\nin his Suppositions.  By the like reason, that which makes the genitories\nor generation-tools of those so fair fraters so long is, for that they wear\nno bottomed breeches, and therefore their jolly member, having no\nimpediment, hangeth dangling at liberty as far as it can reach, with a\nwiggle-waggle down to their knees, as women carry their paternoster beads.\nand the cause wherefore they have it so correspondently great is, that in\nthis constant wig-wagging the humours of the body descend into the said\nmember.  For, according to the Legists, agitation and continual motion is\ncause of attraction.\n\nItem, he had another pocket full of itching powder, called stone-alum,\nwhereof he would cast some into the backs of those women whom he judged to\nbe most beautiful and stately, which did so ticklishly gall them, that some\nwould strip themselves in the open view of the world, and others dance like\na cock upon hot embers, or a drumstick on a tabor.  Others, again, ran\nabout the streets, and he would run after them.  To such as were in the\nstripping vein he would very civilly come to offer his attendance, and\ncover them with his cloak, like a courteous and very gracious man.\n\nItem, in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oil, wherewith,\nwhen he saw any man or woman in a rich new handsome suit, he would grease,\nsmutch, and spoil all the best parts of it under colour and pretence of\ntouching them, saying, This is good cloth; this is good satin; good\ntaffeties!  Madam, God give you all that your noble heart desireth!  You\nhave a new suit, pretty sir;--and you a new gown, sweet mistress;--God give\nyou joy of it, and maintain you in all prosperity!  And with this would lay\nhis hand upon their shoulder, at which touch such a villainous spot was\nleft behind, so enormously engraven to perpetuity in the very soul, body,\nand reputation, that the devil himself could never have taken it away.\nThen, upon his departing, he would say, Madam, take heed you do not fall,\nfor there is a filthy great hole before you, whereinto if you put your\nfoot, you will quite spoil yourself.\n\nAnother he had all full of euphorbium, very finely pulverized.  In that\npowder did he lay a fair handkerchief curiously wrought, which he had\nstolen from a pretty seamstress of the palace, in taking away a louse from\noff her bosom which he had put there himself, and, when he came into the\ncompany of some good ladies, he would trifle them into a discourse of some\nfine workmanship of bone-lace, then immediately put his hand into their\nbosom, asking them, And this work, is it of Flanders, or of Hainault? and\nthen drew out his handkerchief, and said, Hold, hold, look what work here\nis, it is of Foutignan or of Fontarabia, and shaking it hard at their nose,\nmade them sneeze for four hours without ceasing.  In the meanwhile he would\nfart like a horse, and the women would laugh and say, How now, do you fart,\nPanurge?  No, no, madam, said he, I do but tune my tail to the plain song\nof the music which you make with your nose.  In another he had a picklock,\na pelican, a crampiron, a crook, and some other iron tools, wherewith there\nwas no door nor coffer which he would not pick open.  He had another full\nof little cups, wherewith he played very artificially, for he had his\nfingers made to his hand, like those of Minerva or Arachne, and had\nheretofore cried treacle.  And when he changed a teston, cardecu, or any\nother piece of money, the changer had been more subtle than a fox if\nPanurge had not at every time made five or six sols (that is, some six or\nseven pence,) vanish away invisibly, openly, and manifestly, without making\nany hurt or lesion, whereof the changer should have felt nothing but the\nwind.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XVII.\n\nHow Panurge gained the pardons, and married the old women, and of the suit\nin law which he had at Paris.\n\nOne day I found Panurge very much out of countenance, melancholic, and\nsilent; which made me suspect that he had no money; whereupon I said unto\nhim, Panurge, you are sick, as I do very well perceive by your physiognomy,\nand I know the disease.  You have a flux in your purse; but take no care.\nI have yet sevenpence halfpenny that never saw father nor mother, which\nshall not be wanting, no more than the pox, in your necessity.  Whereunto\nhe answered me, Well, well; for money one day I shall have but too much,\nfor I have a philosopher's stone which attracts money out of men's purses\nas the adamant doth iron.  But will you go with me to gain the pardons?\nsaid he.  By my faith, said I, I am no great pardon-taker in this world--if\nI shall be any such in the other, I cannot tell; yet let us go, in God's\nname; it is but one farthing more or less; But, said he, lend me then a\nfarthing upon interest.  No, no, said I; I will give it you freely, and\nfrom my heart.  Grates vobis dominos, said he.\n\nSo we went along, beginning at St. Gervase, and I got the pardons at the\nfirst box only, for in those matters very little contenteth me.  Then did I\nsay my small suffrages and the prayers of St. Brigid; but he gained them\nall at the boxes, and always gave money to everyone of the pardoners.  From\nthence we went to Our Lady's Church, to St. John's, to St. Anthony's, and\nso to the other churches, where there was a banquet (bank) of pardons.  For\nmy part, I gained no more of them, but he at all the boxes kissed the\nrelics, and gave at everyone.  To be brief, when we were returned, he\nbrought me to drink at the castle-tavern, and there showed me ten or twelve\nof his little bags full of money, at which I blessed myself, and made the\nsign of the cross, saying, Where have you recovered so much money in so\nlittle time?  Unto which he answered me that he had taken it out of the\nbasins of the pardons.  For in giving them the first farthing, said he, I\nput it in with such sleight of hand and so dexterously that it appeared to\nbe a threepence; thus with one hand I took threepence, ninepence, or\nsixpence at the least, and with the other as much, and so through all the\nchurches where we have been.  Yea but, said I, you damn yourself like a\nsnake, and are withal a thief and sacrilegious person.  True, said he, in\nyour opinion, but I am not of that mind; for the pardoners do give me it,\nwhen they say unto me in presenting the relics to kiss, Centuplum accipies,\nthat is, that for one penny I should take a hundred; for accipies is spoken\naccording to the manner of the Hebrews, who use the future tense instead of\nthe imperative, as you have in the law, Diliges Dominum, that is, Dilige.\nEven so, when the pardon-bearer says to me, Centuplum accipies, his meaning\nis, Centuplum accipe; and so doth Rabbi Kimy and Rabbi Aben Ezra expound\nit, and all the Massorets, et ibi Bartholus.  Moreover, Pope Sixtus gave me\nfifteen hundred francs of yearly pension, which in English money is a\nhundred and fifty pounds, upon his ecclesiastical revenues and treasure,\nfor having cured him of a cankerous botch, which did so torment him that he\nthought to have been a cripple by it all his life.  Thus I do pay myself at\nmy own hand, for otherwise I get nothing upon the said ecclesiastical\ntreasure.  Ho, my friend! said he, if thou didst know what advantage I\nmade, and how well I feathered my nest, by the Pope's bull of the crusade,\nthou wouldst wonder exceedingly.  It was worth to me above six thousand\nflorins, in English coin six hundred pounds.  And what a devil is become of\nthem? said I; for of that money thou hast not one halfpenny.  They returned\nfrom whence they came, said he; they did no more but change their master.\n\nBut I employed at least three thousand of them, that is, three hundred\npounds English, in marrying--not young virgins, for they find but too many\nhusbands--but great old sempiternous trots which had not so much as one\ntooth in their heads; and that out of the consideration I had that these\ngood old women had very well spent the time of their youth in playing at\nthe close-buttock game to all comers, serving the foremost first, till no\nman would have any more dealing with them.  And, by G--, I will have their\nskin-coat shaken once yet before they die.  By this means, to one I gave a\nhundred florins, to another six score, to another three hundred, according\nto that they were infamous, detestable, and abominable.  For, by how much\nthe more horrible and execrable they were, so much the more must I needs\nhave given them, otherwise the devil would not have jummed them.  Presently\nI went to some great and fat wood-porter, or such like, and did myself make\nthe match.  But, before I did show him the old hags, I made a fair muster\nto him of the crowns, saying, Good fellow, see what I will give thee if\nthou wilt but condescend to duffle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good\ntime.  Then began the poor rogues to gape like old mules, and I caused to\nbe provided for them a banquet, with drink of the best, and store of\nspiceries, to put the old women in rut and heat of lust.  To be short, they\noccupied all, like good souls; only, to those that were horribly ugly and\nill-favoured, I caused their head to be put within a bag, to hide their\nface.\n\nBesides all this, I have lost a great deal in suits of law.  And what\nlawsuits couldst thou have? said I; thou hast neither house nor lands.  My\nfriend, said he, the gentlewomen of this city had found out, by the\ninstigation of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mounted bands and\nneckerchiefs for women, which did so closely cover their bosoms that men\ncould no more put their hands under.  For they had put the slit behind, and\nthose neckcloths were wholly shut before, whereat the poor sad\ncontemplative lovers were much discontented.  Upon a fair Tuesday I\npresented a petition to the court, making myself a party against the said\ngentlewomen, and showing the great interest that I pretended therein,\nprotesting that by the same reason I would cause the codpiece of my\nbreeches to be sewed behind, if the court would not take order for it.  In\nsum, the gentlewomen put in their defences, showing the grounds they went\nupon, and constituted their attorney for the prosecuting of the cause.  But\nI pursued them so vigorously, that by a sentence of the court it was\ndecreed those high neckcloths should be no longer worn if they were not a\nlittle cleft and open before; but it cost me a good sum of money.  I had\nanother very filthy and beastly process against the dung-farmer called\nMaster Fifi and his deputies, that they should no more read privily the\npipe, puncheon, nor quart of sentences, but in fair full day, and that in\nthe Fodder schools, in face of the Arrian (Artitian) sophisters, where I\nwas ordained to pay the charges, by reason of some clause mistaken in the\nrelation of the sergeant.  Another time I framed a complaint to the court\nagainst the mules of the presidents, counsellors, and others, tending to\nthis purpose, that, when in the lower court of the palace they left them to\nchamp on their bridles, some bibs were made for them (by the counsellors'\nwives), that with their drivelling they might not spoil the pavement; to\nthe end that the pages of the palace what play upon it with their dice, or\nat the game of coxbody, at their own ease, without spoiling their breeches\nat the knees.  And for this I had a fair decree, but it cost me dear.  Now\nreckon up what expense I was at in little banquets which from day to day I\nmade to the pages of the palace.  And to what end? said I.  My friend, said\nhe, thou hast no pastime at all in this world.  I have more than the king,\nand if thou wilt join thyself with me, we will do the devil together.  No,\nno, said I; by St. Adauras, that will I not, for thou wilt be hanged one\ntime or another.  And thou, said he, wilt be interred some time or other.\nNow which is most honourable, the air or the earth?  Ho, grosse pecore!\n\nWhilst the pages are at their banqueting, I keep their mules, and to\nsomeone I cut the stirrup-leather of the mounting side till it hang but by\na thin strap or thread, that when the great puffguts of the counsellor or\nsome other hath taken his swing to get up, he may fall flat on his side\nlike a pork, and so furnish the spectators with more than a hundred francs'\nworth of laughter.  But I laugh yet further to think how at his home-coming\nthe master-page is to be whipped like green rye, which makes me not to\nrepent what I have bestowed in feasting them.  In brief, he had, as I said\nbefore, three score and three ways to acquire money, but he had two hundred\nand fourteen to spend it, besides his drinking.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XVIII.\n\nHow a great scholar of England would have argued against Pantagruel, and\nwas overcome by Panurge.\n\nIn that same time a certain learned man named Thaumast, hearing the fame\nand renown of Pantagruel's incomparable knowledge, came out of his own\ncountry of England with an intent only to see him, to try thereby and prove\nwhether his knowledge in effect was so great as it was reported to be.  In\nthis resolution being arrived at Paris, he went forthwith unto the house of\nthe said Pantagruel, who was lodged in the palace of St. Denis, and was\nthen walking in the garden thereof with Panurge, philosophizing after the\nfashion of the Peripatetics.  At his first entrance he startled, and was\nalmost out of his wits for fear, seeing him so great and so tall.  Then did\nhe salute him courteously as the manner is, and said unto him, Very true it\nis, saith Plato the prince of philosophers, that if the image and knowledge\nof wisdom were corporeal and visible to the eyes of mortals, it would stir\nup all the world to admire her.  Which we may the rather believe that the\nvery bare report thereof, scattered in the air, if it happen to be received\ninto the ears of men, who, for being studious and lovers of virtuous things\nare called philosophers, doth not suffer them to sleep nor rest in quiet,\nbut so pricketh them up and sets them on fire to run unto the place where\nthe person is, in whom the said knowledge is said to have built her temple\nand uttered her oracles.  As it was manifestly shown unto us in the Queen\nof Sheba, who came from the utmost borders of the East and Persian Sea, to\nsee the order of Solomon's house and to hear his wisdom; in Anacharsis, who\ncame out of Scythia, even unto Athens, to see Solon; in Pythagoras, who\ntravelled far to visit the memphitical vaticinators; in Plato, who went a\ngreat way off to see the magicians of Egypt, and Architus of Tarentum; in\nApollonius Tyaneus, who went as far as unto Mount Caucasus, passed along\nthe Scythians, the Massagetes, the Indians, and sailed over the great river\nPhison, even to the Brachmans to see Hiarchus; as likewise unto Babylon,\nChaldea, Media, Assyria, Parthia, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Palestina, and\nAlexandria, even unto Aethiopia, to see the Gymnosophists.  The like\nexample have we of Titus Livius, whom to see and hear divers studious\npersons came to Rome from the confines of France and Spain.  I dare not\nreckon myself in the number of those so excellent persons, but well would\nbe called studious, and a lover, not only of learning, but of learned men\nalso.  And indeed, having heard the report of your so inestimable\nknowledge, I have left my country, my friends, my kindred, and my house,\nand am come thus far, valuing at nothing the length of the way, the\ntediousness of the sea, nor strangeness of the land, and that only to see\nyou and to confer with you about some passages in philosophy, of geomancy,\nand of the cabalistic art, whereof I am doubtful and cannot satisfy my\nmind; which if you can resolve, I yield myself unto you for a slave\nhenceforward, together with all my posterity, for other gift have I none\nthat I can esteem a recompense sufficient for so great a favour.  I will\nreduce them into writing, and to-morrow publish them to all the learned men\nin the city, that we may dispute publicly before them.\n\nBut see in what manner I mean that we shall dispute.  I will not argue pro\net contra, as do the sottish sophisters of this town and other places.\nLikewise I will not dispute after the manner of the Academics by\ndeclamation; nor yet by numbers, as Pythagoras was wont to do, and as Picus\nde la Mirandula did of late at Rome.  But I will dispute by signs only\nwithout speaking, for the matters are so abstruse, hard, and arduous, that\nwords proceeding from the mouth of man will never be sufficient for\nunfolding of them to my liking.  May it, therefore, please your\nmagnificence to be there; it shall be at the great hall of Navarre at seven\no'clock in the morning.  When he had spoken these words, Pantagruel very\nhonourably said unto him:  Sir, of the graces that God hath bestowed upon\nme, I would not deny to communicate unto any man to my power.  For whatever\ncomes from him is good, and his pleasure is that it should be increased\nwhen we come amongst men worthy and fit to receive this celestial manna of\nhonest literature.  In which number, because that in this time, as I do\nalready very plainly perceive, thou holdest the first rank, I give thee\nnotice that at all hours thou shalt find me ready to condescend to every\none of thy requests according to my poor ability; although I ought rather\nto learn of thee than thou of me.  But, as thou hast protested, we will\nconfer of these doubts together, and will seek out the resolution, even\nunto the bottom of that undrainable well where Heraclitus says the truth\nlies hidden.  And I do highly commend the manner of arguing which thou hast\nproposed, to wit, by signs without speaking; for by this means thou and I\nshall understand one another well enough, and yet shall be free from this\nclapping of hands which these blockish sophisters make when any of the\narguers hath gotten the better of the argument.  Now to-morrow I will not\nfail to meet thee at the place and hour that thou hast appointed, but let\nme entreat thee that there be not any strife or uproar between us, and that\nwe seek not the honour and applause of men, but the truth only.  To which\nThaumast answered:  The Lord God maintain you in his favour and grace, and,\ninstead of my thankfulness to you, pour down his blessings upon you, for\nthat your highness and magnificent greatness hath not disdained to descend\nto the grant of the request of my poor baseness.  So farewell till\nto-morrow!  Farewell, said Pantagruel.\n\nGentlemen, you that read this present discourse, think not that ever men\nwere more elevated and transported in their thoughts than all this night\nwere both Thaumast and Pantagruel; for the said Thaumast said to the keeper\nof the house of Cluny, where he was lodged, that in all his life he had\nnever known himself so dry as he was that night.  I think, said he, that\nPantagruel held me by the throat.  Give order, I pray you, that we may have\nsome drink, and see that some fresh water be brought to us, to gargle my\npalate.  On the other side, Pantagruel stretched his wits as high as he\ncould, entering into very deep and serious meditations, and did nothing all\nthat night but dote upon and turn over the book of Beda, De numeris et\nsignis; Plotin's book, De inenarrabilibus; the book of Proclus, De magia;\nthe book of Artemidorus peri Oneirokritikon; of Anaxagoras, peri Zemeion;\nDinarius, peri Aphaton; the books of Philiston; Hipponax, peri\nAnekphoneton, and a rabble of others, so long, that Panurge said unto him:\n\nMy lord, leave all these thoughts and go to bed; for I perceive your\nspirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bending of them, that you may\neasily fall into some quotidian fever with this so excessive thinking and\nplodding.  But, having first drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts,\nretire yourself and sleep your fill, for in the morning I will argue\nagainst and answer my master the Englishman, and if I drive him not ad\nmetam non loqui, then call me knave.  Yea but, said he, my friend Panurge,\nhe is marvellously learned; how wilt thou be able to answer him?  Very\nwell, answered Panurge; I pray you talk no more of it, but let me alone.\nIs any man so learned as the devils are?  No, indeed, said Pantagruel,\nwithout God's especial grace.  Yet for all that, said Panurge, I have\nargued against them, gravelled and blanked them in disputation, and laid\nthem so squat upon their tails that I have made them look like monkeys.\nTherefore be assured that to-morrow I will make this vain-glorious\nEnglishman to skite vinegar before all the world.  So Panurge spent the\nnight with tippling amongst the pages, and played away all the points of\nhis breeches at primus secundus and at peck point, in French called La\nVergette.  Yet, when the condescended on time was come, he failed not to\nconduct his master Pantagruel to the appointed place, unto which, believe\nme, there was neither great nor small in Paris but came, thinking with\nthemselves that this devilish Pantagruel, who had overthrown and vanquished\nin dispute all these doting fresh-water sophisters, would now get full\npayment and be tickled to some purpose.  For this Englishman is a terrible\nbustler and horrible coil-keeper.  We will see who will be conqueror, for\nhe never met with his match before.\n\nThus all being assembled, Thaumast stayed for them, and then, when\nPantagruel and Panurge came into the hall, all the schoolboys, professors\nof arts, senior sophisters, and bachelors began to clap their hands, as\ntheir scurvy custom is.  But Pantagruel cried out with a loud voice, as if\nit had been the sound of a double cannon, saying, Peace, with a devil to\nyou, peace!  By G--, you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the\nheads of everyone of you.  At which words they remained all daunted and\nastonished like so many ducks, and durst not do so much as cough, although\nthey had swallowed fifteen pounds of feathers.  Withal they grew so dry\nwith this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a full half foot\nbeyond their mouths, as if Pantagruel had salted all their throats.  Then\nbegan Panurge to speak, saying to the Englishman, Sir, are you come hither\nto dispute contentiously in those propositions you have set down, or,\notherwise, but to learn and know the truth?  To which answered Thaumast,\nSir, no other thing brought me hither but the great desire I had to learn\nand to know that of which I have doubted all my life long, and have neither\nfound book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts\nwhich I have proposed.  And, as for disputing contentiously, I will not do\nit, for it is too base a thing, and therefore leave it to those sottish\nsophisters who in their disputes do not search for the truth, but for\ncontradiction only and debate.  Then said Panurge, If I, who am but a mean\nand inconsiderable disciple of my master my lord Pantagruel, content and\nsatisfy you in all and everything, it were a thing below my said master\nwherewith to trouble him.  Therefore is it fitter that he be chairman, and\nsit as a judge and moderator of our discourse and purpose, and give you\nsatisfaction in many things wherein perhaps I shall be wanting to your\nexpectation.  Truly, said Thaumast, it is very well said; begin then.  Now\nyou must note that Panurge had set at the end of his long codpiece a pretty\ntuft of red silk, as also of white, green, and blue, and within it had put\na fair orange.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XIX.\n\nHow Panurge put to a nonplus the Englishman that argued by signs.\n\nEverybody then taking heed, and hearkening with great silence, the\nEnglishman lift up on high into the air his two hands severally, clunching\nin all the tops of his fingers together, after the manner which, a la\nChinonnese, they call the hen's arse, and struck the one hand on the other\nby the nails four several times.  Then he, opening them, struck the one\nwith the flat of the other till it yielded a clashing noise, and that only\nonce.  Again, in joining them as before, he struck twice, and afterwards\nfour times in opening them.  Then did he lay them joined, and extended the\none towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers\nunto God.  Panurge suddenly lifted up in the air his right hand, and put\nthe thumb thereof into the nostril of the same side, holding his four\nfingers straight out, and closed orderly in a parallel line to the point of\nhis nose, shutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a\nprofound depression of the eyebrows and eyelids.  Then lifted he up his\nleft hand, with hard wringing and stretching forth his four fingers and\nelevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correspondent to the\nsituation of his right hand, with the distance of a cubit and a half\nbetween them.  This done, in the same form he abased towards the ground\nabout the one and the other hand.  Lastly, he held them in the midst, as\naiming right at the Englishman's nose.  And if Mercury,--said the\nEnglishman.  There Panurge interrupted him, and said, You have spoken,\nMask.\n\nThen made the Englishman this sign.  His left hand all open he lifted up\ninto the air, then instantly shut into his fist the four fingers thereof,\nand his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose.\nPresently after, he lifted up his right hand all open, and all open abased\nand bent it downwards, putting the thumb thereof in the very place where\nthe little finger of the left hand did close in the fist, and the four\nright-hand fingers he softly moved in the air.  Then contrarily he did with\nthe right hand what he had done with the left, and with the left what he\nhad done with the right.\n\nPanurge, being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the air his\ntrismegist codpiece with the left hand, and with his right drew forth a\ntruncheon of a white ox-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like form, one of\nblack ebony and the other of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the\nfingers of that hand in good symmetry; then, knocking them together, made\nsuch a noise as the lepers of Brittany use to do with their clappering\nclickets, yet better resounding and far more harmonious, and with his\ntongue contracted in his mouth did very merrily warble it, always looking\nfixedly upon the Englishman.  The divines, physicians, and chirurgeons that\nwere there thought that by this sign he would have inferred that the\nEnglishman was a leper.  The counsellors, lawyers, and decretalists\nconceived that by doing this he would have concluded some kind of mortal\nfelicity to consist in leprosy, as the Lord maintained heretofore.\n\nThe Englishman for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two\nhands in the air, kept them in such form that he closed the three\nmaster-fingers in his fist, and passing his thumbs through his indical or\nforemost and middle fingers, his auriculary or little fingers remained\nextended and stretched out, and so presented he them to Panurge.  Then\njoined he them so that the right thumb touched the left, and the left little\nfinger touched the right.  Hereat Panurge, without speaking one word, lift\nup his hands and made this sign.\n\nHe put the nail of the forefinger of his left hand to the nail of the thumb\nof the same, making in the middle of the distance as it were a buckle, and\nof his right hand shut up all the fingers into his fist, except the\nforefinger, which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of\nthe left hand.  Then stretched he out the forefinger and middle finger or\nmedical of his right hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and\nthrusting them towards Thaumast.  Then did he put the thumb of his left\nhand upon the corner of his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the\nwing of a bird or the fin of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way\nand that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his\nright eye.  Thaumast began then to wax somewhat pale, and to tremble, and\nmade him this sign.\n\nWith the middle finger of his right hand he struck against the muscle of\nthe palm or pulp which is under the thumb.  Then put he the forefinger of\nthe right hand in the like buckle of the left, but he put it under, and not\nover, as Panurge did.  Then Panurge knocked one hand against another, and\nblowed in his palm, and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the\noverture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out.  Then held he\nout his chin, most intentively looking upon Thaumast.  The people there,\nwhich understood nothing in the other signs, knew very well that therein he\ndemanded, without speaking a word to Thaumast, What do you mean by that?\nIn effect, Thaumast then began to sweat great drops, and seemed to all the\nspectators a man strangely ravished in high contemplation.  Then he\nbethought himself, and put all the nails of his left hand against those of\nhis right, opening his fingers as if they had been semicircles, and with\nthis sign lift up his hands as high as he could.  Whereupon Panurge\npresently put the thumb of his right hand under his jaws, and the little\nfinger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this posture made his\nteeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower.  With this\nThaumast, with great toil and vexation of spirit, rose up, but in rising\nlet a great baker's fart, for the bran came after, and pissing withal very\nstrong vinegar, stunk like all the devils in hell.  The company began to\nstop their noses; for he had conskited himself with mere anguish and\nperplexity.  Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in such sort\nthat he brought the ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left\nhand he laid flat upon his breast.  Whereat Panurge drew out his long\ncodpiece with his tuff, and stretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding\nit in the air with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange,\nand, casting it up into the air seven times, at the eighth he hid it in the\nfist of his right hand, holding it steadily up on high, and then began to\nshake his fair codpiece, showing it to Thaumast.\n\nAfter that, Thaumast began to puff up his two cheeks like a player on a\nbagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puff up a pig's bladder.  Whereupon\nPanurge put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by some called\nSt. Patrick's hole, and with his mouth sucked in the air, in such a manner\nas when one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up our broth.  This\ndone, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand flat upon it,\nmaking therewith a great and a deep sound, as if it came from the\nsuperficies of the midriff through the trachiartery or pipe of the lungs,\nand this he did for sixteen times; but Thaumast did always keep blowing\nlike a goose.  Then Panurge put the forefinger of his right hand into his\nmouth, pressing it very hard to the muscles thereof; then he drew it out,\nand withal made a great noise, as when little boys shoot pellets out of the\npot-cannons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an alder-tree, and\nhe did it nine times.\n\nThen Thaumast cried out, Ha, my masters, a great secret!  With this he put\nin his hand up to the elbow, then drew out a dagger that he had, holding it\nby the point downwards.  Whereat Panurge took his long codpiece, and shook\nit as hard as he could against his thighs; then put his two hands entwined\nin manner of a comb upon his head, laying out his tongue as far as he was\nable, and turning his eyes in his head like a goat that is ready to die.\nHa, I understand, said Thaumast, but what? making such a sign that he put\nthe haft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the point thereof the\nflat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fingers.  Whereat\nPanurge held down his head on the left side, and put his middle finger into\nhis right ear, holding up his thumb bolt upright.  Then he crossed his two\narms upon his breast and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he\nstruck his right foot against the ground.  Then he lift up his left arm,\nand closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumb against his\nforehead, striking with his right hand six times against his breast.  But\nThaumast, as not content therewith, put the thumb of his left hand upon the\ntop of his nose, shutting the rest of his said hand, whereupon Panurge set\nhis two master-fingers upon each side of his mouth, drawing it as much as\nhe was able, and widening it so that he showed all his teeth, and with his\ntwo thumbs plucked down his two eyelids very low, making therewith a very\nill-favoured countenance, as it seemed to the company.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XX.\n\nHow Thaumast relateth the virtues and knowledge of Panurge.\n\nThen Panurge rose up, and, putting off his cap, did very kindly thank the\nsaid Panurge, and with a loud voice said unto all the people that were\nthere:  My lords, gentlemen, and others, at this time may I to some good\npurpose speak that evangelical word, Et ecce plus quam Salomon hic!  You\nhave here in your presence an incomparable treasure, that is, my lord\nPantagruel, whose great renown hath brought me hither, out of the very\nheart of England, to confer with him about the insoluble problems, both in\nmagic, alchemy, the cabal, geomancy, astrology, and philosophy, which I had\nin my mind.  But at present I am angry even with fame itself, which I think\nwas envious to him, for that it did not declare the thousandth part of the\nworth that indeed is in him.  You have seen how his disciple only hath\nsatisfied me, and hath told me more than I asked of him.  Besides, he hath\nopened unto me, and resolved other inestimable doubts, wherein I can assure\nyou he hath to me discovered the very true well, fountain, and abyss of the\nencyclopaedia of learning; yea, in such a sort that I did not think I\nshould ever have found a man that could have made his skill appear in so\nmuch as the first elements of that concerning which we disputed by signs,\nwithout speaking either word or half word.  But, in fine, I will reduce\ninto writing that which we have said and concluded, that the world may not\ntake them to be fooleries, and will thereafter cause them to be printed,\nthat everyone may learn as I have done.  Judge, then, what the master had\nbeen able to say, seeing the disciple hath done so valiantly; for, Non est\ndiscipulus super magistrum.  Howsoever, God be praised! and I do very\nhumbly thank you for the honour that you have done us at this act.  God\nreward you for it eternally!  The like thanks gave Pantagruel to all the\ncompany, and, going from thence, he carried Thaumast to dinner with him,\nand believe that they drank as much as their skins could hold, or, as the\nphrase is, with unbuttoned bellies (for in that age they made fast their\nbellies with buttons, as we do now the collars of our doublets or jerkins),\neven till they neither knew where they were nor whence they came.  Blessed\nLady, how they did carouse it, and pluck, as we say, at the kid's leather!\nAnd flagons to trot, and they to toot, Draw; give, page, some wine here;\nreach hither; fill with a devil, so!  There was not one but did drink five\nand twenty or thirty pipes.  Can you tell how?  Even sicut terra sine aqua;\nfor the weather was hot, and, besides that, they were very dry.  In matter\nof the exposition of the propositions set down by Thaumast, and the\nsignification of the signs which they used in their disputation, I would\nhave set them down for you according to their own relation, but I have been\ntold that Thaumast made a great book of it, imprinted at London, wherein he\nhath set down all, without omitting anything, and therefore at this time I\ndo pass by it.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXI.\n\nHow Panurge was in love with a lady of Paris.\n\nPanurge began to be in great reputation in the city of Paris by means of\nthis disputation wherein he prevailed against the Englishman, and from\nthenceforth made his codpiece to be very useful to him.  To which effect he\nhad it pinked with pretty little embroideries after the Romanesca fashion.\nAnd the world did praise him publicly, in so far that there was a song made\nof him, which little children did use to sing when they were to fetch\nmustard.  He was withal made welcome in all companies of ladies and\ngentlewomen, so that at last he became presumptuous, and went about to\nbring to his lure one of the greatest ladies in the city.  And, indeed,\nleaving a rabble of long prologues and protestations, which ordinarily\nthese dolent contemplative lent-lovers make who never meddle with the\nflesh, one day he said unto her, Madam, it would be a very great benefit to\nthe commonwealth, delightful to you, honourable to your progeny, and\nnecessary for me, that I cover you for the propagating of my race, and\nbelieve it, for experience will teach it you.  The lady at this word thrust\nhim back above a hundred leagues, saying, You mischievous fool, is it for\nyou to talk thus unto me?  Whom do you think you have in hand?  Begone,\nnever to come in my sight again; for, if one thing were not, I would have\nyour legs and arms cut off.  Well, said he, that were all one to me, to\nwant both legs and arms, provided you and I had but one merry bout together\nat the brangle-buttock game; for herewithin is--in showing her his long\ncodpiece--Master John Thursday, who will play you such an antic that you\nshall feel the sweetness thereof even to the very marrow of your bones.  He\nis a gallant, and doth so well know how to find out all the corners,\ncreeks, and ingrained inmates in your carnal trap, that after him there\nneeds no broom, he'll sweep so well before, and leave nothing to his\nfollowers to work upon.  Whereunto the lady answered, Go, villain, go.  If\nyou speak to me one such word more, I will cry out and make you to be\nknocked down with blows.  Ha, said he, you are not so bad as you say--no,\nor else I am deceived in your physiognomy.  For sooner shall the earth\nmount up unto the heavens, and the highest heavens descend unto the hells,\nand all the course of nature be quite perverted, than that in so great\nbeauty and neatness as in you is there should be one drop of gall or\nmalice.  They say, indeed, that hardly shall a man ever see a fair woman\nthat is not also stubborn.  Yet that is spoke only of those vulgar\nbeauties; but yours is so excellent, so singular, and so heavenly, that I\nbelieve nature hath given it you as a paragon and masterpiece of her art,\nto make us know what she can do when she will employ all her skill and all\nher power.  There is nothing in you but honey, but sugar, but a sweet and\ncelestial manna.  To you it was to whom Paris ought to have adjudged the\ngolden apple, not to Venus, no, nor to Juno, nor to Minerva, for never was\nthere so much magnificence in Juno, so much wisdom in Minerva, nor so much\ncomeliness in Venus as there is in you.  O heavenly gods and goddesses!\nHow happy shall that man be to whom you will grant the favour to embrace\nher, to kiss her, and to rub his bacon with hers!  By G--, that shall be I,\nI know it well; for she loves me already her bellyful, I am sure of it, and\nso was I predestinated to it by the fairies.  And therefore, that we lose\nno time, put on, thrust out your gammons!--and would have embraced her, but\nshe made as if she would put out her head at the window to call her\nneighbours for help.  Then Panurge on a sudden ran out, and in his running\naway said, Madam, stay here till I come again; I will go call them myself;\ndo not you take so much pains.  Thus went he away, not much caring for the\nrepulse he had got, nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it.  The next\nday he came to the church at the time she went to mass.  At the door he\ngave her some of the holy water, bowing himself very low before her.\nAfterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly and said unto her, Madam,\nknow that I am so amorous of you that I can neither piss nor dung for love.\nI do not know, lady, what you mean, but if I should take any hurt by it,\nhow much you would be to blame!  Go, said she, go!  I do not care; let me\nalone to say my prayers.  Ay but, said he, equivocate upon this:  a beau\nmont le viconte, or, to fair mount the prick-cunts.  I cannot, said she.\nIt is, said he, a beau con le vit monte, or to a fair c. . .the pr. .\n.mounts.  And upon this, pray to God to give you that which your noble\nheart desireth, and I pray you give me these paternosters.  Take them, said\nshe, and trouble me no longer.  This done, she would have taken off her\npaternosters, which were made of a kind of yellow stone called cestrin, and\nadorned with great spots of gold, but Panurge nimbly drew out one of his\nknives, wherewith he cut them off very handsomely, and whilst he was going\naway to carry them to the brokers, he said to her, Will you have my knife?\nNo, no, said she.  But, said he, to the purpose.  I am at your commandment,\nbody and goods, tripes and bowels.\n\nIn the meantime the lady was not very well content with the want of her\npaternosters, for they were one of her implements to keep her countenance\nby in the church; then thought with herself, This bold flouting roister is\nsome giddy, fantastical, light-headed fool of a strange country.  I shall\nnever recover my paternosters again.  What will my husband say?  He will no\ndoubt be angry with me.  But I will tell him that a thief hath cut them off\nfrom my hands in the church, which he will easily believe, seeing the end\nof the ribbon left at my girdle.  After dinner Panurge went to see her,\ncarrying in his sleeve a great purse full of palace-crowns, called\ncounters, and began to say unto her, Which of us two loveth other best, you\nme, or I you?  Whereunto she answered, As for me, I do not hate you; for,\nas God commands, I love all the world.  But to the purpose, said he; are\nnot you in love with me?  I have, said she, told you so many times already\nthat you should talk so no more to me, and if you speak of it again I will\nteach you that I am not one to be talked unto dishonestly.  Get you hence\npacking, and deliver me my paternosters, that my husband may not ask me for\nthem.\n\nHow now, madam, said he, your paternosters?  Nay, by mine oath, I will not\ndo so, but I will give you others.  Had you rather have them of gold well\nenamelled in great round knobs, or after the manner of love-knots, or,\notherwise, all massive, like great ingots, or if you had rather have them\nof ebony, of jacinth, or of grained gold, with the marks of fine\nturquoises, or of fair topazes, marked with fine sapphires, or of baleu\nrubies, with great marks of diamonds of eight and twenty squares?  No, no,\nall this is too little.  I know a fair bracelet of fine emeralds, marked\nwith spotted ambergris, and at the buckle a Persian pearl as big as an\norange.  It will not cost above five and twenty thousand ducats.  I will\nmake you a present of it, for I have ready coin enough,--and withal he made\na noise with his counters, as if they had been French crowns.\n\nWill you have a piece of velvet, either of the violet colour or of crimson\ndyed in grain, or a piece of broached or crimson satin?  Will you have\nchains, gold, tablets, rings?  You need no more but say, Yes; so far as\nfifty thousand ducats may reach, it is but as nothing to me.  By the virtue\nof which words he made the water come in her mouth; but she said unto him,\nNo, I thank you, I will have nothing of you.  By G--, said he, but I will\nhave somewhat of you; yet shall it be that which shall cost you nothing,\nneither shall you have a jot the less when you have given it.  Hold!\n--showing his long codpiece--this is Master John Goodfellow, that asks for\nlodging!--and with that would have embraced her; but she began to cry out,\nyet not very loud.  Then Panurge put off his counterfeit garb, changed his\nfalse visage, and said unto her, You will not then otherwise let me do a\nlittle?  A turd for you!  You do not deserve so much good, nor so much\nhonour; but, by G--, I will make the dogs ride you;--and with this he ran\naway as fast as he could, for fear of blows, whereof he was naturally\nfearful.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXII.\n\nHow Panurge served a Parisian lady a trick that pleased her not very well.\n\nNow you must note that the next day was the great festival of Corpus\nChristi, called the Sacre, wherein all women put on their best apparel, and\non that day the said lady was clothed in a rich gown of crimson satin,\nunder which she wore a very costly white velvet petticoat.\n\nThe day of the eve, called the vigil, Panurge searched so long of one side\nand another that he found a hot or salt bitch, which, when he had tied her\nwith his girdle, he led to his chamber and fed her very well all that day\nand night.  In the morning thereafter he killed her, and took that part of\nher which the Greek geomancers know, and cut it into several small pieces\nas small as he could.  Then, carrying it away as close as might be, he went\nto the place where the lady was to come along to follow the procession, as\nthe custom is upon the said holy day; and when she came in Panurge\nsprinkled some holy water on her, saluting her very courteously.  Then, a\nlittle while after she had said her petty devotions, he sat down close by\nher upon the same bench, and gave her this roundelay in writing, in manner\nas followeth.\n\n  A Roundelay.\n\n  For this one time, that I to you my love\n  Discovered, you did too cruel prove,\n  To send me packing, hopeless, and so soon,\n  Who never any wrong to you had done,\n  In any kind of action, word, or thought:\n  So that, if my suit liked you not, you ought\n  T' have spoke more civilly, and to this sense,\n  My friend, be pleased to depart from hence,\n    For this one time.\n\n  What hurt do I, to wish you to remark,\n  With favour and compassion, how a spark\n  Of your great beauty hath inflamed my heart\n  With deep affection, and that, for my part,\n  I only ask that you with me would dance\n  The brangle gay in feats of dalliance,\n    For this one time?\n\nAnd, as she was opening this paper to see what it was, Panurge very\npromptly and lightly scattered the drug that he had upon her in divers\nplaces, but especially in the plaits of her sleeves and of her gown.  Then\nsaid he unto her, Madam, the poor lovers are not always at ease.  As for\nme, I hope that those heavy nights, those pains and troubles, which I\nsuffer for love of you, shall be a deduction to me of so much pain in\npurgatory; yet, at the least, pray to God to give me patience in my misery.\nPanurge had no sooner spoke this but all the dogs that were in the church\ncame running to this lady with the smell of the drugs that he had strewed\nupon her, both small and great, big and little, all came, laying out their\nmember, smelling to her, and pissing everywhere upon her--it was the\ngreatest villainy in the world.  Panurge made the fashion of driving them\naway; then took his leave of her and withdrew himself into some chapel or\noratory of the said church to see the sport; for these villainous dogs did\ncompiss all her habiliments, and left none of her attire unbesprinkled with\ntheir staling; insomuch that a tall greyhound pissed upon her head, others\nin her sleeves, others on her crupper-piece, and the little ones pissed\nupon her pataines; so that all the women that were round about her had much\nado to save her.  Whereat Panurge very heartily laughing, he said to one of\nthe lords of the city, I believe that same lady is hot, or else that some\ngreyhound hath covered her lately.  And when he saw that all the dogs were\nflocking about her, yarring at the retardment of their access to her, and\nevery way keeping such a coil with her as they are wont to do about a proud\nor salt bitch, he forthwith departed from thence, and went to call\nPantagruel, not forgetting in his way alongst the streets through which he\nwent, where he found any dogs to give them a bang with his foot, saying,\nWill you not go with your fellows to the wedding?  Away, hence, avant,\navant, with a devil avant!  And being come home, he said to Pantagruel,\nMaster, I pray you come and see all the dogs of the country, how they are\nassembled about a lady, the fairest in the city, and would duffle and line\nher.  Whereunto Pantagruel willingly condescended, and saw the mystery,\nwhich he found very pretty and strange.  But the best was at the\nprocession, in which were seen above six hundred thousand and fourteen dogs\nabout her, which did very much trouble and molest her, and whithersoever\nshe passed, those dogs that came afresh, tracing her footsteps, followed\nher at the heels, and pissed in the way where her gown had touched.  All\nthe world stood gazing at this spectacle, considering the countenance of\nthose dogs, who, leaping up, got about her neck and spoiled all her\ngorgeous accoutrements, for the which she could find no remedy but to\nretire unto her house, which was a palace.  Thither she went, and the dogs\nafter her; she ran to hide herself, but the chambermaids could not abstain\nfrom laughing.  When she was entered into the house and had shut the door\nupon herself, all the dogs came running of half a league round, and did so\nwell bepiss the gate of her house that there they made a stream with their\nurine wherein a duck might have very well swimmed, and it is the same\ncurrent that now runs at St. Victor, in which Gobelin dyeth scarlet, for\nthe specifical virtue of these piss-dogs, as our master Doribus did\nheretofore preach publicly.  So may God help you, a mill would have ground\ncorn with it.  Yet not so much as those of Basacle at Toulouse.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel departed from Paris, hearing news that the Dipsodes had\ninvaded the land of the Amaurots; and the cause wherefore the leagues are\nso short in France.\n\nA little while after Pantagruel heard news that his father Gargantua had\nbeen translated into the land of the fairies by Morgue, as heretofore were\nOgier and Arthur; as also, (In the original edition it stands 'together,\nand that.'--M.) that the report of his translation being spread abroad, the\nDipsodes had issued out beyond their borders, with inroads had wasted a\ngreat part of Utopia, and at that very time had besieged the great city of\nthe Amaurots.  Whereupon departing from Paris without bidding any man\nfarewell, for the business required diligence, he came to Rouen.\n\nNow Pantagruel in his journey seeing that the leagues of that little\nterritory about Paris called France were very short in regard of those of\nother countries, demanded the cause and reason of it from Panurge, who told\nhim a story which Marotus of the Lac, monachus, set down in the Acts of the\nKings of Canarre, saying that in old times countries were not distinguished\ninto leagues, miles, furlongs, nor parasangs, until that King Pharamond\ndivided them, which was done in manner as followeth.  The said king chose\nat Paris a hundred fair, gallant, lusty, brisk young men, all resolute and\nbold adventurers in Cupid's duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty,\nhandsome, lovely and well-complexioned wenches of Picardy, all which he\ncaused to be well entertained and highly fed for the space of eight days.\nThen having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young men his\nwench, with store of money to defray their charges, and this injunction\nbesides, to go unto divers places here and there.  And wheresoever they\nshould biscot and thrum their wenches, that, they setting a stone there, it\nshould be accounted for a league.  Thus went away those brave fellows and\nsprightly blades most merrily, and because they were fresh and had been at\nrest, they very often jummed and fanfreluched almost at every field's end,\nand this is the cause why the leagues about Paris are so short.  But when\nthey had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the\noil in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chink and duffle so\noften, but contented themselves (I mean for the men's part) with one scurvy\npaltry bout in a day, and this is that which makes the leagues in Brittany,\nDelanes, Germany, and other more remote countries so long.  Other men give\nother reasons for it, but this seems to me of all other the best.  To which\nPantagruel willingly adhered.  Parting from Rouen, they arrived at\nHonfleur, where they took shipping, Pantagruel, Panurge, Epistemon,\nEusthenes, and Carpalin.\n\nIn which place, waiting for a favourable wind, and caulking their ship,\nhe received from a lady of Paris, which I (he) had formerly kept and\nentertained a good long time, a letter directed on the outside thus,\n--To the best beloved of the fair women, and least loyal of the valiant men\n--P.N.T.G.R.L.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXIV.\n\nA letter which a messenger brought to Pantagruel from a lady of Paris,\ntogether with the exposition of a posy written in a gold ring.\n\nWhen Pantagruel had read the superscription he was much amazed, and\ntherefore demanded of the said messenger the name of her that had sent it.\nThen opened he the letter, and found nothing written in it, nor otherwise\nenclosed, but only a gold ring, with a square table diamond.  Wondering at\nthis, he called Panurge to him, and showed him the case.  Whereupon Panurge\ntold him that the leaf of paper was written upon, but with such cunning and\nartifice that no man could see the writing at the first sight. Therefore,\nto find it out, he set it by the fire to see if it was made with sal\nammoniac soaked in water.  Then put he it into the water, to see if the\nletter was written with the juice of tithymalle.  After that he held it up\nagainst the candle, to see if it was written with the juice of white\nonions.\n\nThen he rubbed one part of it with oil of nuts, to see if it were not\nwritten with the lee of a fig-tree, and another part of it with the milk of\na woman giving suck to her eldest daughter, to see if it was written with\nthe blood of red toads or green earth-frogs.  Afterwards he rubbed one\ncorner with the ashes of a swallow's nest, to see if it were not written\nwith the dew that is found within the herb alcakengy, called the\nwinter-cherry.  He rubbed, after that, one end with ear-wax, to see if it\nwere not written with the gall of a raven.  Then did he dip it into vinegar,\nto try if it was not written with the juice of the garden spurge.  After\nthat he greased it with the fat of a bat or flittermouse, to see if it was\nnot written with the sperm of a whale, which some call ambergris.  Then put\nit very fairly into a basinful of fresh water, and forthwith took it out, to\nsee whether it were written with stone-alum.  But after all experiments,\nwhen he perceived that he could find out nothing, he called the messenger\nand asked him, Good fellow, the lady that sent thee hither, did she not give\nthee a staff to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the\nconceit whereof Aulus Gellius maketh mention.  And the messenger answered\nhim, No, sir.  Then Panurge would have caused his head to be shaven, to see\nwhether the lady had written upon his bald pate, with the hard lye whereof\nsoap is made, that which she meant; but, perceiving that his hair was very\nlong, he forbore, considering that it could not have grown to so great a\nlength in so short a time.\n\nThen he said to Pantagruel, Master, by the virtue of G--, I cannot tell\nwhat to do nor say in it.  For, to know whether there be anything written\nupon this or no, I have made use of a good part of that which Master\nFrancisco di Nianto, the Tuscan, sets down, who hath written the manner of\nreading letters that do not appear; that which Zoroastes published, Peri\ngrammaton acriton; and Calphurnius Bassus, De literis illegibilibus.  But I\ncan see nothing, nor do I believe that there is anything else in it than\nthe ring.  Let us, therefore, look upon it.  Which when they had done, they\nfound this in Hebrew written within, Lamach saba(ch)thani; whereupon they\ncalled Epistemon, and asked him what that meant.  To which he answered that\nthey were Hebrew words, signifying, Wherefore hast thou forsaken me?  Upon\nthat Panurge suddenly replied, I know the mystery.  Do you see this\ndiamond?  It is a false one.  This, then, is the exposition of that which\nthe lady means, Diamant faux, that is, false lover, why hast thou forsaken\nme?  Which interpretation Pantagruel presently understood, and withal\nremembering that at his departure he had not bid the lady farewell, he was\nvery sorry, and would fain have returned to Paris to make his peace with\nher.  But Epistemon put him in mind of Aeneas's departure from Dido, and\nthe saying of Heraclitus of Tarentum, That the ship being at anchor, when\nneed requireth we must cut the cable rather than lose time about untying of\nit,--and that he should lay aside all other thoughts to succour the city of\nhis nativity, which was then in danger.  And, indeed, within an hour after\nthat the wind arose at the north-north-west, wherewith they hoist sail, and\nput out, even into the main sea, so that within few days, passing by Porto\nSancto and by the Madeiras, they went ashore in the Canary Islands.\nParting from thence, they passed by Capobianco, by Senege, by Capoverde, by\nGambre, by Sagres, by Melli, by the Cap di Buona Speranza, and set ashore\nagain in the kingdom of Melinda.  Parting from thence, they sailed away\nwith a tramontane or northerly wind, passing by Meden, by Uti, by Uden, by\nGelasim, by the Isles of the Fairies, and alongst the kingdom of Achorie,\ntill at last they arrived at the port of Utopia, distant from the city of\nthe Amaurots three leagues and somewhat more.\n\nWhen they were ashore, and pretty well refreshed, Pantagruel said,\nGentlemen, the city is not far from hence; therefore, were it not amiss,\nbefore we set forward, to advise well what is to be done, that we be not\nlike the Athenians, who never took counsel until after the fact?  Are you\nresolved to live and die with me?  Yes, sir, said they all, and be as\nconfident of us as of your own fingers.  Well, said he, there is but one\nthing that keeps my mind in great doubt and suspense, which is this, that I\nknow not in what order nor of what number the enemy is that layeth siege to\nthe city; for, if I were certain of that, I should go forward and set on\nwith the better assurance.  Let us therefore consult together, and bethink\nourselves by what means we may come to this intelligence.  Whereunto they\nall said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us; for this\nvery day, without further respite, do we make account to bring you a\ncertain report thereof.\n\nMyself, said Panurge, will undertake to enter into their camp, within the\nvery midst of their guards, unespied by their watch, and merrily feast and\nlecher it at their cost, without being known of any, to see the artillery\nand the tents of all the captains, and thrust myself in with a grave and\nmagnific carriage amongst all their troops and companies, without being\ndiscovered.  The devil would not be able to peck me out with all his\ncircumventions, for I am of the race of Zopyrus.\n\nAnd I, said Epistemon, know all the plots and strategems of the valiant\ncaptains and warlike champions of former ages, together with all the tricks\nand subtleties of the art of war.  I will go, and, though I be detected and\nrevealed, I will escape by making them believe of you whatever I please,\nfor I am of the race of Sinon.\n\nI, said Eusthenes, will enter and set upon them in their trenches, in spite\nof their sentries and all their guards; for I will tread upon their bellies\nand break their legs and arms, yea, though they were every whit as strong\nas the devil himself, for I am of the race of Hercules.\n\nAnd I, said Carpalin, will get in there if the birds can enter, for I am so\nnimble of body, and light withal, that I shall have leaped over their\ntrenches, and ran clean through all their camp, before that they perceive\nme; neither do I fear shot, nor arrow, nor horse, how swift soever, were he\nthe Pegasus of Perseus or Pacolet, being assured that I shall be able to\nmake a safe and sound escape before them all without any hurt.  I will\nundertake to walk upon the ears of corn or grass in the meadows, without\nmaking either of them do so much as bow under me, for I am of the race of\nCamilla the Amazon.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXV.\n\nHow Panurge, Carpalin, Eusthenes, and Epistemon, the gentlemen attendants\nof Pantagruel, vanquished and discomfited six hundred and threescore\nhorsemen very cunningly.\n\nAs he was speaking this, they perceived six hundred and threescore light\nhorsemen, gallantly mounted, who made an outroad thither to see what ship\nit was that was newly arrived in the harbour, and came in a full gallop to\ntake them if they had been able.  Then said Pantagruel, My lads, retire\nyourselves unto the ship; here are some of our enemies coming apace, but I\nwill kill them here before you like beasts, although they were ten times so\nmany; in the meantime, withdraw yourselves, and take your sport at it.\nThen answered Panurge, No, sir; there is no reason that you should do so,\nbut, on the contrary, retire you unto the ship, both you and the rest, for\nI alone will here discomfit them; but we must not linger; come, set\nforward.  Whereunto the others said, It is well advised, sir; withdraw\nyourself, and we will help Panurge here, so shall you know what we are able\nto do.  Then said Pantagruel, Well, I am content; but, if that you be too\nweak, I will not fail to come to your assistance.  With this Panurge took\ntwo great cables of the ship and tied them to the kemstock or capstan which\nwas on the deck towards the hatches, and fastened them in the ground,\nmaking a long circuit, the one further off, the other within that.  Then\nsaid he to Epistemon, Go aboard the ship, and, when I give you a call, turn\nabout the capstan upon the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the two\ncable-ropes; and said to Eusthenes and to Carpalin, My bullies, stay you\nhere, and offer yourselves freely to your enemies.  Do as they bid you, and\nmake as if you would yield unto them, but take heed you come not within the\ncompass of the ropes--be sure to keep yourselves free of them.  And\npresently he went aboard the ship, and took a bundle of straw and a barrel\nof gunpowder, strewed it round about the compass of the cords, and stood by\nwith a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand.  Presently came the\nhorsemen with great fury, and the foremost ran almost home to the ship,\nand, by reason of the slipperiness of the bank, they fell, they and their\nhorses, to the number of four and forty; which the rest seeing, came on,\nthinking that resistance had been made them at their arrival.  But Panurge\nsaid unto them, My masters, I believe that you have hurt yourselves; I pray\nyou pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the slipperiness of the\nsea-water that is always flowing; we submit ourselves to your good pleasure.\nSo said likewise his two other fellows, and Epistemon that was upon the\ndeck.  In the meantime Panurge withdrew himself, and seeing that they were\nall within the compass of the cables, and that his two companions were\nretired, making room for all those horses which came in a crowd, thronging\nupon the neck of one another to see the ship and such as were in it, cried\nout on a sudden to Epistemon, Draw, draw!  Then began Epistemon to wind\nabout the capstan, by doing whereof the two cables so entangled and\nempestered the legs of the horses, that they were all of them thrown down\nto the ground easily, together with their riders.  But they, seeing that,\ndrew their swords, and would have cut them; whereupon Panurge set fire to\nthe train, and there burnt them up all like damned souls, both men and\nhorses, not one escaping save one alone, who being mounted on a fleet\nTurkey courser, by mere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of\nthe ropes.  But when Carpalin perceived him, he ran after him with such\nnimbleness and celerity that he overtook him in less than a hundred paces;\nthen, leaping close behind him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped him\nin his arms, and brought him back to the ship.\n\nThis exploit being ended, Pantagruel was very jovial, and wondrously\ncommended the industry of these gentlemen, whom he called his\nfellow-soldiers, and made them refresh themselves and feed well and merrily\nupon the seashore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground,\nand their prisoner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity; only\nthat the poor devil was somewhat afraid that Pantagruel would have eaten him\nup whole, which, considering the wideness of his mouth and capacity of his\nthroat was no great matter for him to have done; for he could have done it\nas easily as you would eat a small comfit, he showing no more in his throat\nthan would a grain of millet-seed in the mouth of an ass.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXVI.\n\nHow Pantagruel and his company were weary in eating still salt meats; and\nhow Carpalin went a-hunting to have some venison.\n\nThus as they talked and chatted together, Carpalin said, And, by the belly\nof St. Quenet, shall we never eat any venison?  This salt meat makes me\nhorribly dry.  I will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which\nwe have burnt; it is well roasted already.  As he was rising up to go about\nit, he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roebuck, which was\ncome out of his fort, as I conceive, at the sight of Panurge's fire.  Him\ndid he pursue and run after with as much vigour and swiftness as if it had\nbeen a bolt out of a crossbow, and caught him in a moment; and whilst he\nwas in his course he with his hands took in the air four great bustards,\nseven bitterns, six and twenty grey partridges, two and thirty red-legged\nones, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two and thirty\ncushats and ringdoves; and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and\nrabbits, which were then at relief and pretty big withal, eighteen rails in\na knot together, with fifteen young wild-boars, two little beavers, and\nthree great foxes.  So, striking the kid with his falchion athwart the\nhead, he killed him, and, bearing him on his back, he in his return took up\nhis hares, rails, and young wild-boars, and, as far off as he could be\nheard, cried out and said, Panurge, my friend, vinegar, vinegar!  Then the\ngood Pantagruel, thinking he had fainted, commanded them to provide him\nsome vinegar; but Panurge knew well that there was some good prey in hands,\nand forthwith showed unto noble Pantagruel how he was bearing upon his back\na fair roebuck, and all his girdle bordered with hares.  Then immediately\ndid Epistemon make, in the name of the nine Muses, nine antique wooden\nspits.  Eusthenes did help to flay, and Panurge placed two great cuirassier\nsaddles in such sort that they served for andirons, and making their\nprisoner to be their cook, they roasted their venison by the fire wherein\nthe horsemen were burnt; and making great cheer with a good deal of\nvinegar, the devil a one of them did forbear from his victuals--it was a\ntriumphant and incomparable spectacle to see how they ravened and devoured.\nThen said Pantagruel, Would to God every one of you had two pairs of little\nanthem or sacring bells hanging at your chin, and that I had at mine the\ngreat clocks of Rennes, of Poictiers, of Tours, and of Cambray, to see what\na peal they would ring with the wagging of our chaps.  But, said Panurge,\nit were better we thought a little upon our business, and by what means we\nmight get the upper hand of our enemies.  That is well remembered, said\nPantagruel.  Therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner, My friend, tell us\nhere the truth, and do not lie to us at all, if thou wouldst not be flayed\nalive, for it is I that eat the little children.  Relate unto us at full\nthe order, the number, and the strength of the army.  To which the prisoner\nanswered, Sir, know for a truth that in the army there are three hundred\ngiants, all armed with armour of proof, and wonderful great.  Nevertheless,\nnot fully so great as you, except one that is their head, named Loupgarou,\nwho is armed from head to foot with cyclopical anvils.  Furthermore, one\nhundred three score and three thousand foot, all armed with the skins of\nhobgoblins, strong and valiant men; eleven thousand four hundred\nmen-at-arms or cuirassiers; three thousand six hundred double cannons, and\narquebusiers without number; four score and fourteen thousand pioneers; one\nhundred and fifty thousand whores, fair like goddesses--(That is for me,\nsaid Panurge)--whereof some are Amazons, some Lionnoises, others\nParisiennes, Taurangelles, Angevines, Poictevines, Normandes, and High\nDutch--there are of them of all countries and all languages.\n\nYea but, said Pantagruel, is the king there?  Yes, sir, said the prisoner;\nhe is there in person, and we call him Anarchus, king of the Dipsodes,\nwhich is as much to say as thirsty people, for you never saw men more\nthirsty, nor more willing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the giants.\nIt is enough, said Pantagruel.  Come, brave boys, are you resolved to go\nwith me?  To which Panurge answered, God confound him that leaves you!  I\nhave already bethought myself how I will kill them all like pigs, and so\nthe devil one leg of them shall escape.  But I am somewhat troubled about\none thing.  And what is that? said Pantagruel.  It is, said Panurge, how I\nshall be able to set forward to the justling and bragmardizing of all the\nwhores that be there this afternoon, in such sort that there escape not one\nunbumped by me, breasted and jummed after the ordinary fashion of man and\nwomen in the Venetian conflict.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, said Pantagruel.\n\nAnd Carpalin said:  The devil take these sink-holes, if, by G--, I do not\nbumbaste some one of them.  Then said Eusthenes:  What! shall not I have\nany, whose paces, since we came from Rouen, were never so well winded up as\nthat my needle could mount to ten or eleven o'clock, till now that I have\nit hard, stiff, and strong, like a hundred devils?  Truly, said Panurge,\nthou shalt have of the fattest, and of those that are most plump and in the\nbest case.\n\nHow now! said Epistemon; everyone shall ride, and I must lead the ass?  The\ndevil take him that will do so.  We will make use of the right of war, Qui\npotest capere, capiat.  No, no, said Panurge, but tie thine ass to a crook,\nand ride as the world doth.  And the good Pantagruel laughed at all this,\nand said unto them, You reckon without your host.  I am much afraid that,\nbefore it be night, I shall see you in such taking that you will have no\ngreat stomach to ride, but more like to be rode upon with sound blows of\npike and lance.  Baste, said Epistemon, enough of that!  I will not fail to\nbring them to you, either to roast or boil, to fry or put in paste.  They\nare not so many in number as were in the army of Xerxes, for he had thirty\nhundred thousand fighting-men, if you will believe Herodotus and Trogus\nPompeius, and yet Themistocles with a few men overthrew them all.  For\nGod's sake, take you no care for that.  Cobsminny, cobsminny, said Panurge;\nmy codpiece alone shall suffice to overthrow all the men; and my St.\nSweephole, that dwells within it, shall lay all the women squat upon their\nbacks.  Up then, my lads, said Pantagruel, and let us march along.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel set up one trophy in memorial of their valour, and Panurge\nanother in remembrance of the hares.  How Pantagruel likewise with his\nfarts begat little men, and with his fisgs little women; and how Panurge\nbroke a great staff over two glasses.\n\nBefore we depart hence, said Pantagruel, in remembrance of the exploit that\nyou have now performed I will in this place erect a fair trophy.  Then\nevery man amongst them, with great joy and fine little country songs, set\nup a huge big post, whereunto they hanged a great cuirassier saddle, the\nfronstal of a barbed horse, bridle-bosses, pulley-pieces for the knees,\nstirrup-leathers, spurs, stirrups, a coat of mail, a corslet tempered with\nsteel, a battle-axe, a strong, short, and sharp horseman's sword, a\ngauntlet, a horseman's mace, gushet-armour for the armpits, leg-harness,\nand a gorget, with all other furniture needful for the decorement of a\ntriumphant arch, in sign of a trophy.  And then Pantagruel, for an eternal\nmemorial, wrote this victorial ditton, as followeth:--\n\n  Here was the prowess made apparent of\n  Four brave and valiant champions of proof,\n  Who, without any arms but wit, at once,\n  Like Fabius, or the two Scipions,\n  Burnt in a fire six hundred and threescore\n  Crablice, strong rogues ne'er vanquished before.\n  By this each king may learn, rook, pawn, and knight,\n  That sleight is much more prevalent than might.\n\n    For victory,\n    As all men see,\n    Hangs on the ditty\n    Of that committee\n    Where the great God\n    Hath his abode.\n\n  Nor doth he it to strong and great men give,\n  But to his elect, as we must believe;\n  Therefore shall he obtain wealth and esteem,\n  Who thorough faith doth put his trust in him.\n\nWhilst Pantagruel was writing these foresaid verses, Panurge halved and\nfixed upon a great stake the horns of a roebuck, together with the skin and\nthe right forefoot thereof, the ears of three leverets, the chine of a\nconey, the jaws of a hare, the wings of two bustards, the feet of four\nqueest-doves, a bottle or borracho full of vinegar, a horn wherein to put\nsalt, a wooden spit, a larding stick, a scurvy kettle full of holes, a\ndripping-pan to make sauce in, an earthen salt-cellar, and a goblet of\nBeauvais.  Then, in imitation of Pantagruel's verses and trophy, wrote that\nwhich followeth:--\n\n  Here was it that four jovial blades sat down\n  To a profound carousing, and to crown\n  Their banquet with those wines which please best great\n  Bacchus, the monarch of their drinking state.\n  Then were the reins and furch of a young hare,\n  With salt and vinegar, displayed there,\n  Of which to snatch a bit or two at once\n  They all fell on like hungry scorpions.\n\n    For th' Inventories\n    Of Defensories\n    Say that in heat\n    We must drink neat\n    All out, and of\n    The choicest stuff.\n\n  But it is bad to eat of young hare's flesh,\n  Unless with vinegar we it refresh.\n  Receive this tenet, then, without control,\n  That vinegar of that meat is the soul.\n\nThen said Pantagruel, Come, my lads, let us begone! we have stayed here too\nlong about our victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out that the greatest\neaters do the most martial exploits.  There is no shadow like that of\nflying colours, no smoke like that of horses, no clattering like that of\narmour.  At this Epistemon began to smile, and said, There is no shadow\nlike that of the kitchen, no smoke like that of pasties, and no clattering\nlike that of goblets.  Unto which answered Panurge, There is no shadow like\nthat of curtains, no smoke like that of women's breasts, and no clattering\nlike that of ballocks.  Then forthwith rising up he gave a fart, a leap,\nand a whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, Ever live Pantagruel!\nWhen Pantagruel saw that, he would have done as much; but with the fart\nthat he let the earth trembled nine leagues about, wherewith and with the\ncorrupted air he begot above three and fifty thousand little men,\nill-favoured dwarfs, and with one fisg that he let he made as many little\nwomen, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow\nbut like cow's tails, downwards, or, like the Limosin radishes, round.  How\nnow! said Panurge, are your farts so fertile and fruitful?  By G--, here be\nbrave farted men and fisgued women; let them be married together; they will\nbeget fine hornets and dorflies.  So did Pantagruel, and called them\npigmies.  Those he sent to live in an island thereby, where since that time\nthey are increased mightily.  But the cranes make war with them\ncontinually, against which they do most courageously defend themselves; for\nthese little ends of men and dandiprats (whom in Scotland they call\nwhiphandles and knots of a tar-barrel) are commonly very testy and\ncholeric; the physical reason whereof is, because their heart is near their\nspleen.\n\nAt this same time Panurge took two drinking glasses that were there, both\nof one bigness, and filled them with water up to the brim, and set one of\nthem upon one stool and the other upon another, placing them about one foot\nfrom one another.  Then he took the staff of a javelin, about five foot and\na half long, and put it upon the two glasses, so that the two ends of the\nstaff did come just to the brims of the glasses.  This done, he took a\ngreat stake or billet of wood, and said to Pantagruel and to the rest, My\nmasters, behold how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies; for\njust as I shall break this staff here upon these glasses, without either\nbreaking or crazing of them, nay, which is more, without spilling one drop\nof the water that is within them, even so shall we break the heads of our\nDipsodes without receiving any of us any wound or loss in our person or\ngoods.  But, that you may not think there is any witchcraft in this, hold!\nsaid he to Eusthenes, strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this\nlog.  Eusthenes did so, and the staff broke in two pieces, and not one drop\nof the water fell out of the glasses.  Then said he, I know a great many\nsuch other tricks; let us now therefore march boldly and with assurance.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXVIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel got the victory very strangely over the Dipsodes and the\nGiants.\n\nAfter all this talk, Pantagruel took the prisoner to him and sent him away,\nsaying, Go thou unto thy king in his camp, and tell him tidings of what\nthou hast seen, and let him resolve to feast me to-morrow about noon; for,\nas soon as my galleys shall come, which will be to-morrow at furthest, I\nwill prove unto him by eighteen hundred thousand fighting-men and seven\nthousand giants, all of them greater than I am, that he hath done foolishly\nand against reason thus to invade my country.  Wherein Pantagruel feigned\nthat he had an army at sea.  But the prisoner answered that he would yield\nhimself to be his slave, and that he was content never to return to his own\npeople, but rather with Pantagruel to fight against them, and for God's\nsake besought him that he might be permitted so to do.  Whereunto\nPantagruel would not give consent, but commanded him to depart thence\nspeedily and begone as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a\nboxful of euphorbium, together with some grains of the black chameleon\nthistle, steeped into aqua vitae, and made up into the condiment of a wet\nsucket, commanding him to carry it to his king, and to say unto him, that\nif he were able to eat one ounce of that without drinking after it, he\nmight then be able to resist him without any fear or apprehension of\ndanger.\n\nThe prisoner then besought him with joined hands that in the hour of the\nbattle he would have compassion upon him.  Whereat Pantagruel said unto\nhim, After that thou hast delivered all unto the king, put thy whole\nconfidence in God, and he will not forsake thee; because, although for my\npart I be mighty, as thou mayst see, and have an infinite number of men in\narms, I do nevertheless trust neither in my force nor in mine industry, but\nall my confidence is in God my protector, who doth never forsake those that\nin him do put their trust and confidence.  This done, the prisoner\nrequested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his\nransom.  To which Pantagruel answered, that his end was not to rob nor\nransom men, but to enrich them and reduce them to total liberty.  Go thy\nway, said he, in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil\ncompany, lest some mischief befall thee.  The prisoner being gone,\nPantagruel said to his men, Gentlemen, I have made this prisoner believe\nthat we have an army at sea; as also that we will not assault them till\nto-morrow at noon, to the end that they, doubting of the great arrival of\nour men, may spend this night in providing and strengthening themselves,\nbut in the meantime my intention is that we charge them about the hour\nof the first sleep.\n\nLet us leave Pantagruel here with his apostles, and speak of King Anarchus\nand his army.  When the prisoner was come he went unto the king and told\nhim how there was a great giant come, called Pantagruel, who had overthrown\nand made to be cruelly roasted all the six hundred and nine and fifty\nhorsemen, and he alone escaped to bring the news.  Besides that, he was\ncharged by the said giant to tell him that the next day, about noon, he\nmust make a dinner ready for him, for at that hour he was resolved to set\nupon him.  Then did he give him that box wherein were those confitures.\nBut as soon as he had swallowed down one spoonful of them, he was taken\nwith such a heat in the throat, together with an ulceration in the flap of\nthe top of the windpipe, that his tongue peeled with it in such sort that,\nfor all they could do unto him, he found no ease at all but by drinking\nonly without cessation; for as soon as ever he took the goblet from his\nhead, his tongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but still\npour in wine into his throat with a funnel.  Which when his captains,\nbashaws, and guard of his body did see, they tasted of the same drugs to\ntry whether they were so thirst-procuring and alterative or no.  But it so\nbefell them as it had done their king, and they plied the flagon so well\nthat the noise ran throughout all the camp, how the prisoner was returned;\nthat the next day they were to have an assault; that the king and his\ncaptains did already prepare themselves for it, together with his guards,\nand that with carousing lustily and quaffing as hard as they could.  Every\nman, therefore, in the army began to tipple, ply the pot, swill and guzzle\nit as fast as they could.  In sum, they drunk so much, and so long, that\nthey fell asleep like pigs, all out of order throughout the whole camp.\n\nLet us now return to the good Pantagruel, and relate how he carried himself\nin this business.  Departing from the place of the trophies, he took the\nmast of their ship in his hand like a pilgrim's staff, and put within the\ntop of it two hundred and seven and thirty puncheons of white wine of\nAnjou, the rest was of Rouen, and tied up to his girdle the bark all full\nof salt, as easily as the lansquenets carry their little panniers, and so\nset onward on his way with his fellow-soldiers.  When he was come near to\nthe enemy's camp, Panurge said unto him, Sir, if you would do well, let\ndown this white wine of Anjou from the scuttle of the mast of the ship,\nthat we may all drink thereof, like Bretons.\n\nHereunto Pantagruel very willingly consented, and they drank so neat that\nthere was not so much as one poor drop left of two hundred and seven and\nthirty puncheons, except one boracho or leathern bottle of Tours which\nPanurge filled for himself, for he called that his vademecum, and some\nscurvy lees of wine in the bottom, which served him instead of vinegar.\nAfter they had whittled and curried the can pretty handsomely, Panurge gave\nPantagruel to eat some devilish drugs compounded of lithotripton, which is\na stone-dissolving ingredient, nephrocatarticon, that purgeth the reins,\nthe marmalade of quinces, called codiniac, a confection of cantharides,\nwhich are green flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees, and other kinds\nof diuretic or piss-procuring simples.  This done, Pantagruel said to\nCarpalin, Go into the city, scrambling like a cat against the wall, as you\ncan well do, and tell them that now presently they come out and charge\ntheir enemies as rudely as they can, and having said so, come down, taking\na lighted torch with you, wherewith you shall set on fire all the tents and\npavilions in the camp; then cry as loud as you are able with your great\nvoice, and then come away from thence.  Yea but, said Carpalin, were it not\ngood to cloy all their ordnance?  No, no, said Pantagruel, only blow up all\ntheir powder.  Carpalin, obeying him, departed suddenly and did as he was\nappointed by Pantagruel, and all the combatants came forth that were in the\ncity, and when he had set fire in the tents and pavilions, he passed so\nlightly through them, and so highly and profoundly did they snort and\nsleep, that they never perceived him.  He came to the place where their\nartillery was, and set their munition on fire.  But here was the danger.\nThe fire was so sudden that poor Carpalin had almost been burnt.  And had\nit not been for his wonderful agility he had been fried like a roasting\npig.  But he departed away so speedily that a bolt or arrow out of a\ncrossbow could not have had a swifter motion.  When he was clear of their\ntrenches, he shouted aloud, and cried out so dreadfully, and with such\namazement to the hearers, that it seemed all the devils of hell had been\nlet loose.  At which noise the enemies awaked, but can you tell how?  Even\nno less astonished than are monks at the ringing of the first peal to\nmatins, which in Lusonnois is called rub-ballock.\n\nIn the meantime Pantagruel began to sow the salt that he had in his bark,\nand because they slept with an open gaping mouth, he filled all their\nthroats with it, so that those poor wretches were by it made to cough like\nfoxes.  Ha, Pantagruel, how thou addest greater heat to the firebrand that\nis in us!  Suddenly Pantagruel had will to piss, by means of the drugs\nwhich Panurge had given him, and pissed amidst the camp so well and so\ncopiously that he drowned them all, and there was a particular deluge ten\nleagues round about, of such considerable depth that the history saith, if\nhis father's great mare had been there, and pissed likewise, it would\nundoubtedly have been a more enormous deluge than that of Deucalion; for\nshe did never piss but she made a river greater than is either the Rhone or\nthe Danube.  Which those that were come out of the city seeing, said, They\nare all cruelly slain; see how the blood runs along.  But they were\ndeceived in thinking Pantagruel's urine had been the blood of their\nenemies, for they could not see but by the light of the fire of the\npavilions and some small light of the moon.\n\nThe enemies, after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the fire in\nthe camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal deluge, could not\ntell what to say nor what to think.  Some said that it was the end of the\nworld and the final judgment, which ought to be by fire.  Others again\nthought that the sea-gods, Neptune, Proteus, Triton, and the rest of them,\ndid persecute them, for that indeed they found it to be like sea-water and\nsalt.\n\nO who were able now condignly to relate how Pantagruel did demean himself\nagainst the three hundred giants!  O my Muse, my Calliope, my Thalia,\ninspire me at this time, restore unto me my spirits; for this is the\nlogical bridge of asses!  Here is the pitfall, here is the difficulty, to\nhave ability enough to express the horrible battle that was fought.  Ah,\nwould to God that I had now a bottle of the best wine that ever those drank\nwho shall read this so veridical history!\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel discomfited the three hundred giants armed with free-stone,\nand Loupgarou their captain.\n\nThe giants, seeing all their camp drowned, carried away their king Anarchus\nupon their backs as well as they could out of the fort, as Aeneas did to\nhis father Anchises, in the time of the conflagration of Troy.  When\nPanurge perceived them, he said to Pantagruel, Sir, yonder are the giants\ncoming forth against you; lay on them with your mast gallantly, like an old\nfencer; for now is the time that you must show yourself a brave man and an\nhonest.  And for our part we will not fail you.  I myself will kill to you\na good many boldly enough; for why, David killed Goliath very easily; and\nthen this great lecher, Eusthenes, who is stronger than four oxen, will not\nspare himself.  Be of good courage, therefore, and valiant; charge amongst\nthem with point and edge, and by all manner of means.  Well, said\nPantagruel, of courage I have more than for fifty francs, but let us be\nwise, for Hercules first never undertook against two.  That is well cacked,\nwell scummered, said Panurge; do you compare yourself with Hercules?  You\nhave, by G--, more strength in your teeth, and more scent in your bum, than\never Hercules had in all his body and soul.  So much is a man worth as he\nesteems himself.  Whilst they spake those words, behold! Loupgarou was come\nwith all his giants, who, seeing Pantagruel in a manner alone, was carried\naway with temerity and presumption, for hopes that he had to kill the good\nman.  Whereupon he said to his companions the giants, You wenchers of the\nlow country, by Mahoom! if any of you undertake to fight against these men\nhere, I will put you cruelly to death.  It is my will that you let me fight\nsingle.  In the meantime you shall have good sport to look upon us.\n\nThen all the other giants retired with their king to the place where the\nflagons stood, and Panurge and his comrades with them, who counterfeited\nthose that have had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth, shrunk up his\nfingers, and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake -od,\nfellow-soldiers, if I would have it to be believed that we make any war at\nall.  Give us somewhat to eat with you whilest our masters fight against\none another.  To this the king and giants jointly condescended, and\naccordingly made them to banquet with them.  In the meantime Panurge told\nthem the follies of Turpin, the examples of St. Nicholas, and the tale of a\ntub.  Loupgarou then set forward towards Pantagruel, with a mace all of\nsteel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred\nquintals and two quarterons, at the end whereof were thirteen pointed\ndiamonds, the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of Our Lady's\nChurch at Paris--there might want perhaps the thickness of a nail, or at\nmost, that I may not lie, of the back of those knives which they call\ncutlugs or earcutters, but for a little off or on, more or less, it is no\nmatter--and it was enchanted in such sort that it could never break, but,\ncontrarily, all that it did touch did break immediately.  Thus, then, as he\napproached with great fierceness and pride of heart, Pantagruel, casting up\nhis eyes to heaven, recommended himself to God with all his soul, making\nsuch a vow as followeth.\n\nO thou Lord God, who hast always been my protector and my saviour! thou\nseest the distress wherein I am at this time.  Nothing brings me hither but\na natural zeal, which thou hast permitted unto mortals, to keep and defend\nthemselves, their wives and children, country and family, in case thy own\nproper cause were not in question, which is the faith; for in such a\nbusiness thou wilt have no coadjutors, only a catholic confession and\nservice of thy word, and hast forbidden us all arming and defence.  For\nthou art the Almighty, who in thine own cause, and where thine own business\nis taken to heart, canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive,\nthou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of millions of legions of\nangels, the least of which is able to kill all mortal men, and turn about\nthe heavens and earth at his pleasure, as heretofore it very plainly\nappeared in the army of Sennacherib.  If it may please thee, therefore, at\nthis time to assist me, as my whole trust and confidence is in thee alone,\nI vow unto thee, that in all countries whatsoever wherein I shall have any\npower or authority, whether in this of Utopia or elsewhere, I will cause\nthy holy gospel to be purely, simply, and entirely preached, so that the\nabuses of a rabble of hypocrites and false prophets, who by human\nconstitutions and depraved inventions have empoisoned all the world, shall\nbe quite exterminated from about me.\n\nThis vow was no sooner made, but there was heard a voice from heaven\nsaying, Hoc fac et vinces; that is to say, Do this, and thou shalt\novercome.  Then Pantagruel, seeing that Loupgarou with his mouth wide open\nwas drawing near to him, went against him boldly, and cried out as loud as\nhe was able, Thou diest, villain, thou diest! purposing by his horrible cry\nto make him afraid, according to the discipline of the Lacedaemonians.\nWithal, he immediately cast at him out of his bark, which he wore at his\ngirdle, eighteen cags and four bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both\nhis mouth, throat, nose, and eyes.  At this Loupgarou was so highly\nincensed that, most fiercely setting upon him, he thought even then with a\nblow of his mace to have beat out his brains.  But Pantagruel was very\nnimble, and had always a quick foot and a quick eye, and therefore with his\nleft foot did he step back one pace, yet not so nimbly but that the blow,\nfalling upon the bark, broke it in four thousand four score and six pieces,\nand threw all the rest of the salt about the ground.  Pantagruel, seeing\nthat, most gallantly displayed the vigour of his arms, and, according to\nthe art of the axe, gave him with the great end of his mast a homethrust a\nlittle above the breast; then, bringing along the blow to the left side,\nwith a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders.  After that,\nadvancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon the couillons with the\nupper end of his said mast, wherewith breaking the scuttle on the top\nthereof, he spilt three or four puncheons of wine that were left therein.\n\nUpon that Loupgarou thought that he had pierced his bladder, and that the\nwine that came forth had been his urine.  Pantagruel, being not content\nwith this, would have doubled it by a side-blow; but Loupgarou, lifting\nup his mace, advanced one step upon him, and with all his force would\nhave dashed it upon Pantagruel, wherein, to speak the truth, he so\nsprightfully carried himself, that, if God had not succoured the good\nPantagruel, he had been cloven from the top of his head to the bottom of\nhis milt.  But the blow glanced to the right side by the brisk nimbleness\nof Pantagruel, and his mace sank into the ground above threescore and\nthirteen foot, through a huge rock, out of which the fire did issue greater\nthan nine thousand and six tons.  Pantagruel, seeing him busy about\nplucking out his mace, which stuck in the ground between the rocks, ran\nupon him, and would have clean cut off his head, if by mischance his mast\nhad not touched a little against the stock of Loupgarou's mace, which was\nenchanted, as we have said before.  By this means his mast broke off about\nthree handfuls above his hand, whereat he stood amazed like a bell-founder,\nand cried out, Ah, Panurge, where art thou?  Panurge, seeing that, said to\nthe king and the giants, By G--, they will hurt one another if they be not\nparted.  But the giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding.\nThen Carpalin would have risen from thence to help his master; but one of\nthe giants said unto him, By Golfarin, the nephew of Mahoom, if thou stir\nhence I will put thee in the bottom of my breeches instead of a\nsuppository, which cannot choose but do me good.  For in my belly I am very\ncostive, and cannot well cagar without gnashing my teeth and making many\nfilthy faces.  Then Pantagruel, thus destitute of a staff, took up the end\nof his mast, striking athwart and alongst upon the giant, but he did him no\nmore hurt than you would do with a fillip upon a smith's anvil.  In the\n(mean) time Loupgarou was drawing his mace out of the ground, and, having\nalready plucked it out, was ready therewith to have struck Pantagruel, who,\nbeing very quick in turning, avoided all his blows in taking only the\ndefensive part in hand, until on a sudden he saw that Loupgarou did\nthreaten him with these words, saying, Now, villain, will not I fail to\nchop thee as small as minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from ever\nmaking any more poor men athirst!  For then, without any more ado,\nPantagruel struck him such a blow with his foot against the belly that he\nmade him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and dragged him thus\nalong at flay-buttock above a flight-shot.  Then Loupgarou cried out,\nbleeding at the throat, Mahoom, Mahoom, Mahoom! at which noise all the\ngiants arose to succour him.  But Panurge said unto them, Gentlemen, do not\ngo, if will believe me, for our master is mad, and strikes athwart and\nalongst, he cares not where; he will do you a mischief.  But the giants\nmade no account of it, seeing that Pantagruel had never a staff.\n\nAnd when Pantagruel saw those giants approach very near unto him, he took\nLoupgarou by the two feet, and lift up his body like a pike in the air,\nwherewith, it being harnessed with anvils, he laid such heavy load amongst\nthose giants armed with free-stone, that, striking them down as a mason\ndoth little knobs of stones, there was not one of them that stood before\nhim whom he threw not flat to the ground.  And by the breaking of this\nstony armour there was made such a horrible rumble as put me in mind of the\nfall of the butter-tower of St. Stephen's at Bourges when it melted before\nthe sun.  Panurge, with Carpalin and Eusthenes, did cut in the mean time\nthe throats of those that were struck down, in such sort that there escaped\nnot one.  Pantagruel to any man's sight was like a mower, who with his\nscythe, which was Loupgarou, cut down the meadow grass, to wit, the giants;\nbut with this fencing of Pantagruel's Loupgarou lost his head, which\nhappened when Pantagruel struck down one whose name was Riflandouille, or\nPudding-plunderer, who was armed cap-a-pie with Grison stones, one chip\nwhereof splintering abroad cut off Epistemon's neck clean and fair.  For\notherwise the most part of them were but lightly armed with a kind of sandy\nbrittle stone, and the rest with slates.  At last, when he saw that they\nwere all dead, he threw the body of Loupgarou as hard as he could against\nthe city, where falling like a frog upon his belly in the great Piazza\nthereof, he with the said fall killed a singed he-cat, a wet she-cat, a\nfarting duck, and a bridled goose.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXX.\n\nHow Epistemon, who had his head cut off, was finely healed by Panurge, and\nof the news which he brought from the devils, and of the damned people in\nhell.\n\nThis gigantal victory being ended, Pantagruel withdrew himself to the place\nof the flagons, and called for Panurge and the rest, who came unto him safe\nand sound, except Eusthenes, whom one of the giants had scratched a little\nin the face whilst he was about the cutting of his throat, and Epistemon,\nwho appeared not at all.  Whereat Pantagruel was so aggrieved that he would\nhave killed himself.  But Panurge said unto him, Nay, sir, stay a while,\nand we will search for him amongst the dead, and find out the truth of all.\nThus as they went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, with his\nhead between his arms all bloody.  Then Eusthenes cried out, Ah, cruel\ndeath! hast thou taken from me the perfectest amongst men?  At which words\nPantagruel rose up with the greatest grief that ever any man did see, and\nsaid to Panurge, Ha, my friend! the prophecy of your two glasses and the\njavelin staff was a great deal too deceitful.  But Panurge answered, My\ndear bullies all, weep not one drop more, for, he being yet all hot, I will\nmake him as sound as ever he was.  In saying this, he took the head and\nheld it warm foregainst his codpiece, that the wind might not enter into\nit.  Eusthenes and Carpalin carried the body to the place where they had\nbanqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover, but that\nPantagruel might see it.\n\nNevertheless Panurge gave him very good comfort, saying, If I do not heal\nhim, I will be content to lose my head, which is a fool's wager.  Leave\noff, therefore, crying, and help me.  Then cleansed he his neck very well\nwith pure white wine, and, after that, took his head, and into it synapised\nsome powder of diamerdis, which he always carried about him in one of his\nbags.  Afterwards he anointed it with I know not what ointment, and set it\non very just, vein against vein, sinew against sinew, and spondyle against\nspondyle, that he might not be wry-necked--for such people he mortally\nhated.  This done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen stitches\nwith a needle that it might not fall off again; then, on all sides and\neverywhere, he put a little ointment on it, which he called resuscitative.\n\nSuddenly Epistemon began to breathe, then opened his eyes, yawned, sneezed,\nand afterwards let a great household fart.  Whereupon Panurge said, Now,\ncertainly, he is healed,--and therefore gave him to drink a large full\nglass of strong white wine, with a sugared toast.  In this fashion was\nEpistemon finely healed, only that he was somewhat hoarse for above three\nweeks together, and had a dry cough of which he could not be rid but by the\nforce of continual drinking.  And now he began to speak, and said that he\nhad seen the devil, had spoken with Lucifer familiarly, and had been very\nmerry in hell and in the Elysian fields, affirming very seriously before\nthem all that the devils were boon companions and merry fellows.  But, in\nrespect of the damned, he said he was very sorry that Panurge had so soon\ncalled him back into this world again; for, said he, I took wonderful\ndelight to see them.  How so? said Pantagruel.  Because they do not use\nthem there, said Epistemon, so badly as you think they do.  Their estate\nand condition of living is but only changed after a very strange manner;\nfor I saw Alexander the Great there amending and patching on clouts upon\nold breeches and stockings, whereby he got but a very poor living.\n\nXerxes was a crier of mustard.\nRomulus, a salter and patcher of pattens.\nNuma, a nailsmith.\nTarquin, a porter.\nPiso, a clownish swain.\nSylla, a ferryman.\nCyrus, a cowherd.\nThemistocles, a glass-maker.\nEpaminondas, a maker of mirrors or looking-glasses.\nBrutus and Cassius, surveyors or measurers of land.\nDemosthenes, a vine-dresser.\nCicero, a fire-kindler.\nFabius, a threader of beads.\nArtaxerxes, a rope-maker.\nAeneas, a miller.\nAchilles was a scaldpated maker of hay-bundles.\nAgamemnon, a lick-box.\nUlysses, a hay-mower.\nNestor, a door-keeper or forester.\nDarius, a gold-finder or jakes-farmer.\nAncus Martius, a ship-trimmer.\nCamillus, a foot-post.\nMarcellus, a sheller of beans.\nDrusus, a taker of money at the doors of playhouses.\nScipio Africanus, a crier of lee in a wooden slipper.\nAsdrubal, a lantern-maker.\nHannibal, a kettlemaker and seller of eggshells.\nPriamus, a seller of old clouts.\nLancelot of the Lake was a flayer of dead horses.\n\nAll the Knights of the Round Table were poor day-labourers, employed to row\nover the rivers of Cocytus, Phlegeton, Styx, Acheron, and Lethe, when my\nlords the devils had a mind to recreate themselves upon the water, as in\nthe like occasion are hired the boatmen at Lyons, the gondoliers of Venice,\nand oars at London.  But with this difference, that these poor knights have\nonly for their fare a bob or flirt on the nose, and in the evening a morsel\nof coarse mouldy bread.\n\nTrajan was a fisher of frogs.\nAntoninus, a lackey.\nCommodus, a jet-maker.\nPertinax, a peeler of walnuts.\nLucullus, a maker of rattles and hawks'-bells.\nJustinian, a pedlar.\nHector, a snap-sauce scullion.\nParis was a poor beggar.\nCambyses, a mule-driver.\n\nNero, a base blind fiddler, or player on that instrument which is called a\nwindbroach.  Fierabras was his serving-man, who did him a thousand\nmischievous tricks, and would make him eat of the brown bread and drink of\nthe turned wine when himself did both eat and drink of the best.\n\nJulius Caesar and Pompey were boat-wrights and tighters of ships.\n\nValentine and Orson did serve in the stoves of hell, and were sweat-rubbers\nin hot houses.\n\nGiglan and Govian (Gauvin) were poor swineherds.\n\nGeoffrey with the great tooth was a tinder-maker and seller of matches.\n\nGodfrey de Bouillon, a hood-maker.\nJason was a bracelet-maker.\nDon Pietro de Castille, a carrier of indulgences.\nMorgan, a beer-brewer.\nHuon of Bordeaux, a hooper of barrels.\nPyrrhus, a kitchen-scullion.\nAntiochus, a chimney-sweeper.\nOctavian, a scraper of parchment.\nNerva, a mariner.\n\nPope Julius was a crier of pudding-pies, but he left off wearing there his\ngreat buggerly beard.\n\nJohn of Paris was a greaser of boots.\nArthur of Britain, an ungreaser of caps.\nPerce-Forest, a carrier of faggots.\nPope Boniface the Eighth, a scummer of pots.\nPope Nicholas the Third, a maker of paper.\nPope Alexander, a ratcatcher.\nPope Sixtus, an anointer of those that have the pox.\n\nWhat, said Pantagruel, have they the pox there too?  Surely, said\nEpistemon, I never saw so many:  there are there, I think, above a hundred\nmillions; for believe, that those who have not had the pox in this world\nmust have it in the other.\n\nCotsbody, said Panurge, then I am free; for I have been as far as the hole\nof Gibraltar, reached unto the outmost bounds of Hercules, and gathered of\nthe ripest.\n\nOgier the Dane was a furbisher of armour.\nThe King Tigranes, a mender of thatched houses.\nGalien Restored, a taker of moldwarps.\nThe four sons of Aymon were all toothdrawers.\nPope Calixtus was a barber of a woman's sine qua non.\nPope Urban, a bacon-picker.\nMelusina was a kitchen drudge-wench.\nMatabrune, a laundress.\nCleopatra, a crier of onions.\nHelen, a broker for chambermaids.\nSemiramis, the beggars' lice-killer.\nDido did sell mushrooms.\nPenthesilea sold cresses.\nLucretia was an alehouse-keeper.\nHortensia, a spinstress.\nLivia, a grater of verdigris.\n\nAfter this manner, those that had been great lords and ladies here, got but\na poor scurvy wretched living there below.  And, on the contrary, the\nphilosophers and others, who in this world had been altogether indigent and\nwanting, were great lords there in their turn.  I saw Diogenes there strut\nit out most pompously, and in great magnificence, with a rich purple gown\non him, and a golden sceptre in his right hand.  And, which is more, he\nwould now and then make Alexander the Great mad, so enormously would he\nabuse him when he had not well patched his breeches; for he used to pay his\nskin with sound bastinadoes.  I saw Epictetus there, most gallantly\napparelled after the French fashion, sitting under a pleasant arbour, with\nstore of handsome gentlewomen, frolicking, drinking, dancing, and making\ngood cheer, with abundance of crowns of the sun.  Above the lattice were\nwritten these verses for his device:\n\n  To leap and dance, to sport and play,\n    And drink good wine both white and brown,\n  Or nothing else do all the day\n    But tell bags full of many a crown.\n\nWhen he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and I\nbeing willing to be entreated, we tippled and chopined together most\ntheologically.  In the meantime came Cyrus to beg one farthing of him for\nthe honour of Mercury, therewith to buy a few onions for his supper.  No,\nno, said Epictetus, I do not use in my almsgiving to bestow farthings.\nHold, thou varlet, there's a crown for thee; be an honest man.  Cyrus was\nexceeding glad to have met with such a booty; but the other poor rogues,\nthe kings that are there below, as Alexander, Darius, and others, stole it\naway from him by night.  I saw Pathelin, the treasurer of Rhadamanthus,\nwho, in cheapening the pudding-pies that Pope Julius cried, asked him how\nmuch a dozen.  Three blanks, said the Pope.  Nay, said Pathelin, three\nblows with a cudgel.  Lay them down here, you rascal, and go fetch more.\nThe poor Pope went away weeping, who, when he came to his master, the\npie-maker, told him that they had taken away his pudding-pies.  Whereupon\nhis master gave him such a sound lash with an eel-skin, that his own would\nhave been worth nothing to make bag-pipe-bags of.  I saw Master John Le\nMaire there personate the Pope in such fashion that he made all the poor\nkings and popes of this world kiss his feet, and, taking great state upon\nhim, gave them his benediction, saying, Get the pardons, rogues, get the\npardons; they are good cheap.  I absolve you of bread and pottage, and\ndispense with you to be never good for anything.  Then, calling Caillet and\nTriboulet to him, he spoke these words, My lords the cardinals, despatch\ntheir bulls, to wit, to each of them a blow with a cudgel upon the reins.\nWhich accordingly was forthwith performed.  I heard Master Francis Villon\nask Xerxes, How much the mess of mustard?  A farthing, said Xerxes.  To\nwhich the said Villon answered, The pox take thee for a villain!  As much of\nsquare-eared wheat is not worth half that price, and now thou offerest to\nenhance the price of victuals.  With this he pissed in his pot, as the\nmustard-makers of Paris used to do.  I saw the trained bowman of the bathing\ntub, known by the name of the Francarcher de Baignolet, who, being one of\nthe trustees of the Inquisition, when he saw Perce-Forest making water\nagainst a wall in which was painted the fire of St. Anthony, declared him\nheretic, and would have caused him to be burnt alive had it not been for\nMorgant, who, for his proficiat and other small fees, gave him nine tuns of\nbeer.\n\nWell, said Pantagruel, reserve all these fair stories for another time,\nonly tell us how the usurers are there handled.  I saw them, said\nEpistemon, all very busily employed in seeking of rusty pins and old nails\nin the kennels of the streets, as you see poor wretched rogues do in this\nworld.  But the quintal, or hundredweight, of this old ironware is there\nvalued but at the price of a cantle of bread, and yet they have but a very\nbad despatch and riddance in the sale of it.  Thus the poor misers are\nsometimes three whole weeks without eating one morsel or crumb of bread,\nand yet work both day and night, looking for the fair to come.\nNevertheless, of all this labour, toil, and misery, they reckon nothing, so\ncursedly active they are in the prosecution of that their base calling, in\nhopes, at the end of the year, to earn some scurvy penny by it.\n\nCome, said Pantagruel, let us now make ourselves merry one bout, and drink,\nmy lads, I beseech you, for it is very good drinking all this month.  Then\ndid they uncase their flagons by heaps and dozens, and with their\nleaguer-provision made excellent good cheer.  But the poor King Anarchus\ncould not all this while settle himself towards any fit of mirth; whereupon\nPanurge said, Of what trade shall we make my lord the king here, that he may\nbe skilful in the art when he goes thither to sojourn amongst all the devils\nof hell?  Indeed, said Pantagruel, that was well advised of thee.  Do with\nhim what thou wilt, I give him to thee.  Gramercy, said Panurge, the present\nis not to be refused, and I love it from you.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXXI.\n\nHow Pantagruel entered into the city of the Amaurots, and how Panurge\nmarried King Anarchus to an old lantern-carrying hag, and made him a crier\nof green sauce.\n\nAfter this wonderful victory, Pantagruel sent Carpalin unto the city of the\nAmaurots to declare and signify unto them how the King Anarchus was taken\nprisoner and all the enemies of the city overthrown.  Which news when they\nheard all the inhabitants of the city came forth to meet him in good order,\nand with a great triumphant pomp, conducting him with a heavenly joy into\nthe city, where innumerable bonfires were set on through all the parts\nthereof, and fair round tables, which were furnished with store of good\nvictuals, set out in the middle of the streets.  This was a renewing of the\ngolden age in the time of Saturn, so good was the cheer which then they\nmade.\n\nBut Pantagruel, having assembled the whole senate and common councilmen of\nthe town, said, My masters, we must now strike the iron whilst it is hot.\nIt is therefore my will that, before we frolic it any longer, we advise how\nto assault and take the whole kingdom of the Dipsodes.  To which effect let\nthose that will go with me provide themselves against to-morrow after\ndrinking, for then will I begin to march.  Not that I need any more men\nthan I have to help me to conquer it, for I could make it as sure that way\nas if I had it already; but I see this city is so full of inhabitants that\nthey scarce can turn in the streets.  I will, therefore, carry them as a\ncolony into Dipsody, and will give them all that country, which is fair,\nwealthy, fruitful, and pleasant, above all other countries in the world, as\nmany of you can tell who have been there heretofore.  Everyone of you,\ntherefore, that will go along, let him provide himself as I have said.\nThis counsel and resolution being published in the city, the next morning\nthere assembled in the piazza before the palace to the number of eighteen\nhundred fifty-six thousand and eleven, besides women and little children.\nThus began they to march straight into Dipsody, in such good order as did\nthe people of Israel when they departed out of Egypt to pass over the Red\nSea.\n\nBut before we proceed any further in this purpose, I will tell you how\nPanurge handled his prisoner the King Anarchus; for, having remembered that\nwhich Epistemon had related, how the kings and rich men in this world were\nused in the Elysian fields, and how they got their living there by base and\nignoble trades, he, therefore, one day apparelled his king in a pretty\nlittle canvas doublet, all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light\nhorseman's cap, together with a pair of large mariner's breeches, and\nstockings without shoes,--For, said he, they would but spoil his sight,\n--and a little peach-coloured bonnet with a great capon's feather in it--I\nlie, for I think he had two--and a very handsome girdle of a sky-colour and\ngreen (in French called pers et vert), saying that such a livery did become\nhim well, for that he had always been perverse, and in this plight bringing\nhim before Pantagruel, said unto him, Do you know this roister?  No,\nindeed, said Pantagruel.  It is, said Panurge, my lord the king of the\nthree batches, or threadbare sovereign.  I intend to make him an honest\nman.  These devilish kings which we have here are but as so many calves;\nthey know nothing and are good for nothing but to do a thousand mischiefs\nto their poor subjects, and to trouble all the world with war for their\nunjust and detestable pleasure.  I will put him to a trade, and make him a\ncrier of green sauce.  Go to, begin and cry, Do you lack any green sauce?\nand the poor devil cried.  That is too low, said Panurge; then took him by\nthe ear, saying, Sing higher in Ge, sol, re, ut.  So, so poor devil, thou\nhast a good throat; thou wert never so happy as to be no longer king.  And\nPantagruel made himself merry with all this; for I dare boldly say that he\nwas the best little gaffer that was to be seen between this and the end of\na staff.  Thus was Anarchus made a good crier of green sauce.  Two days\nthereafter Panurge married him with an old lantern-carrying hag, and he\nhimself made the wedding with fine sheep's heads, brave haslets with\nmustard, gallant salligots with garlic, of which he sent five horseloads\nunto Pantagruel, which he ate up all, he found them so appetizing.\nAnd for their drink they had a kind of small well-watered wine, and some\nsorbapple-cider.  And, to make them dance, he hired a blind man that\nmade music to them with a wind-broach.\n\nAfter dinner he led them to the palace and showed them to Pantagruel, and\nsaid, pointing to the married woman, You need not fear that she will crack.\nWhy? said Pantagruel.  Because, said Panurge, she is well slit and broke up\nalready.  What do you mean by that? said Pantagruel.  Do not you see, said\nPanurge, that the chestnuts which are roasted in the fire, if they be whole\nthey crack as if they were mad, and, to keep them from cracking, they make\nan incision in them and slit them?  So this new bride is in her lower parts\nwell slit before, and therefore will not crack behind.\n\nPantagruel gave them a little lodge near the lower street and a mortar of\nstone wherein to bray and pound their sauce, and in this manner did they do\ntheir little business, he being as pretty a crier of green sauce as ever\nwas seen in the country of Utopia.  But I have been told since that his\nwife doth beat him like plaister, and the poor sot dare not defend himself,\nhe is so simple.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXXII.\n\nHow Pantagruel with his tongue covered a whole army, and what the author\nsaw in his mouth.\n\nThus, as Pantagruel with all his army had entered into the country of the\nDipsodes, everyone was glad of it, and incontinently rendered themselves\nunto him, bringing him out of their own good wills the keys of all the\ncities where he went, the Almirods only excepted, who, being resolved to\nhold out against him, made answer to his heralds that they would not yield\nbut upon very honourable and good conditions.\n\nWhat! said Pantagruel, do they ask any better terms than the hand at the\npot and the glass in their fist?  Come, let us go sack them, and put them\nall to the sword.  Then did they put themselves in good order, as being\nfully determined to give an assault, but by the way, passing through a\nlarge field, they were overtaken with a great shower of rain, whereat they\nbegan to shiver and tremble, to crowd, press, and thrust close to one\nanother.  When Pantagruel saw that, he made their captains tell them that\nit was nothing, and that he saw well above the clouds that it would be\nnothing but a little dew; but, howsoever, that they should put themselves\nin order, and he would cover them.  Then did they put themselves in a close\norder, and stood as near to (each) other as they could, and Pantagruel drew\nout his tongue only half-way and covered them all, as a hen doth her\nchickens.  In the meantime, I, who relate to you these so veritable\nstories, hid myself under a burdock-leaf, which was not much less in\nlargeness than the arch of the bridge of Montrible, but when I saw them\nthus covered, I went towards them to shelter myself likewise; which I could\nnot do, for that they were so, as the saying is, At the yard's end there is\nno cloth left.  Then, as well as I could, I got upon it, and went along\nfull two leagues upon his tongue, and so long marched that at last I came\ninto his mouth.  But, O gods and goddesses! what did I see there?  Jupiter\nconfound me with his trisulc lightning if I lie!  I walked there as they do\nin Sophia (at) Constantinople, and saw there great rocks, like the\nmountains in Denmark--I believe that those were his teeth.  I saw also fair\nmeadows, large forests, great and strong cities not a jot less than Lyons\nor Poictiers.  The first man I met with there was a good honest fellow\nplanting coleworts, whereat being very much amazed, I asked him, My friend,\nwhat dost thou make here?  I plant coleworts, said he.  But how, and\nwherewith? said I.  Ha, sir, said he, everyone cannot have his ballocks as\nheavy as a mortar, neither can we be all rich.  Thus do I get my poor\nliving, and carry them to the market to sell in the city which is here\nbehind.  Jesus! said I, is there here a new world?  Sure, said he, it is\nnever a jot new, but it is commonly reported that, without this, there is\nan earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a sun and a moon, and\nthat it is full of and replenished with very good commodities; but yet this\nis more ancient than that.  Yea but, said I, my friend, what is the name of\nthat city whither thou carriest thy coleworts to sell?  It is called\nAspharage, said he, and all the indwellers are Christians, very honest men,\nand will make you good cheer.  To be brief, I resolved to go thither.  Now,\nin my way, I met with a fellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons, of\nwhom I asked, My friend, from whence come these pigeons?  Sir, said he,\nthey come from the other world.  Then I thought that, when Pantagruel\nyawned, the pigeons went into his mouth in whole flocks, thinking that it\nhad been a pigeon-house.\n\nThen I went into the city, which I found fair, very strong, and seated in a\ngood air; but at my entry the guard demanded of me my pass or ticket.\nWhereat I was much astonished, and asked them, My masters, is there any\ndanger of the plague here?  O Lord! said they, they die hard by here so\nfast that the cart runs about the streets.  Good God! said I, and where?\nWhereunto they answered that it was in Larynx and Pharynx, which are two\ngreat cities such as Rouen and Nantes, rich and of great trading.  And the\ncause of the plague was by a stinking and infectious exhalation which\nlately vapoured out of the abysms, whereof there have died above two and\ntwenty hundred and threescore thousand and sixteen persons within this\nsevennight.  Then I considered, calculated, and found that it was a rank\nand unsavoury breathing which came out of Pantagruel's stomach when he did\neat so much garlic, as we have aforesaid.\n\nParting from thence, I passed amongst the rocks, which were his teeth, and\nnever left walking till I got up on one of them; and there I found the\npleasantest places in the world, great large tennis-courts, fair galleries,\nsweet meadows, store of vines, and an infinite number of banqueting summer\nouthouses in the fields, after the Italian fashion, full of pleasure and\ndelight, where I stayed full four months, and never made better cheer in my\nlife as then.  After that I went down by the hinder teeth to come to the\nchaps.  But in the way I was robbed by thieves in a great forest that is in\nthe territory towards the ears.  Then, after a little further travelling, I\nfell upon a pretty petty village--truly I have forgot the name of it--where\nI was yet merrier than ever, and got some certain money to live by.  Can\nyou tell how?  By sleeping.  For there they hire men by the day to sleep,\nand they get by it sixpence a day, but they that can snort hard get at\nleast ninepence.  How I had been robbed in the valley I informed the\nsenators, who told me that, in very truth, the people of that side were bad\nlivers and naturally thievish, whereby I perceived well that, as we have\nwith us the countries Cisalpine and Transalpine, that is, behither and\nbeyond the mountains, so have they there the countries Cidentine and\nTradentine, that is, behither and beyond the teeth.  But it is far better\nliving on this side, and the air is purer.  Then I began to think that it\nis very true which is commonly said, that the one half of the world knoweth\nnot how the other half liveth; seeing none before myself had ever written\nof that country, wherein are above five-and-twenty kingdoms inhabited,\nbesides deserts, and a great arm of the sea.  Concerning which purpose I\nhave composed a great book, entitled, The History of the Throttias, because\nthey dwell in the throat of my master Pantagruel.\n\nAt last I was willing to return, and, passing by his beard, I cast myself\nupon his shoulders, and from thence slid down to the ground, and fell\nbefore him.  As soon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest\nthou, Alcofribas?  I answered him, Out of your mouth, my lord.  And how\nlong hast thou been there? said he.  Since the time, said I, that you went\nagainst the Almirods.  That is about six months ago, said he.  And\nwherewith didst thou live?  What didst thou drink?  I answered, My lord, of\nthe same that you did, and of the daintiest morsels that passed through\nyour throat I took toll.  Yea but, said he, where didst thou shite?  In\nyour throat, my lord, said I.  Ha, ha! thou art a merry fellow, said he.\nWe have with the help of God conquered all the land of the Dipsodes; I will\ngive thee the Chastelleine, or Lairdship of Salmigondin.  Gramercy, my\nlord, said I, you gratify me beyond all that I have deserved of you.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXXIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel became sick, and the manner how he was recovered.\n\nA while after this the good Pantagruel fell sick, and had such an\nobstruction in his stomach that he could neither eat nor drink; and,\nbecause mischief seldom comes alone, a hot piss seized on him, which\ntormented him more than you would believe.  His physicians nevertheless\nhelped him very well, and with store of lenitives and diuretic drugs made\nhim piss away his pain.  His urine was so hot that since that time it is\nnot yet cold, and you have of it in divers places of France, according to\nthe course that it took, and they are called the hot baths, as--\n\n    At Coderets.\n    At Limous.\n    At Dast.\n    At Ballervie (Balleruc).\n    At Neric.\n  At Bourbonansie, and elsewhere in Italy.\n    At Mongros.\n    At Appone.\n  At Sancto Petro de Padua.\n    At St. Helen.\n    At Casa Nuova.\n  At St. Bartholomew, in the county of Boulogne.\n  At the Porrette, and a thousand other places.\n\nAnd I wonder much at a rabble of foolish philosophers and physicians, who\nspend their time in disputing whence the heat of the said waters cometh,\nwhether it be by reason of borax, or sulphur, or alum, or saltpetre, that\nis within the mine.  For they do nothing but dote, and better were it for\nthem to rub their arse against a thistle than to waste away their time thus\nin disputing of that whereof they know not the original; for the resolution\nis easy, neither need we to inquire any further than that the said baths\ncame by a hot piss of the good Pantagruel.\n\nNow to tell you after what manner he was cured of his principal disease.  I\nlet pass how for a minorative or gentle potion he took four hundred pound\nweight of colophoniac scammony, six score and eighteen cartloads of cassia,\nan eleven thousand and nine hundred pound weight of rhubarb, besides other\nconfuse jumblings of sundry drugs.  You must understand that by the advice\nof the physicians it was ordained that what did offend his stomach should\nbe taken away; and therefore they made seventeen great balls of copper,\neach whereof was bigger than that which is to be seen on the top of St.\nPeter's needle at Rome, and in such sort that they did open in the midst\nand shut with a spring.  Into one of them entered one of his men carrying a\nlantern and a torch lighted, and so Pantagruel swallowed him down like a\nlittle pill.  Into seven others went seven country-fellows, having every\none of them a shovel on his neck.  Into nine others entered nine\nwood-carriers, having each of them a basket hung at his neck, and so were\nthey swallowed down like pills.  When they were in his stomach, every one\nundid his spring, and came out of their cabins.  The first whereof was he\nthat carried the lantern, and so they fell more than half a league into a\nmost horrible gulf, more stinking and infectious than ever was Mephitis, or\nthe marshes of the Camerina, or the abominably unsavoury lake of Sorbona,\nwhereof Strabo maketh mention.  And had it not been that they had very well\nantidoted their stomach, heart, and wine-pot, which is called the noddle,\nthey had been altogether suffocated and choked with these detestable\nvapours.  O what a perfume!  O what an evaporation wherewith to bewray the\nmasks or mufflers of young mangy queans.  After that, with groping and\nsmelling they came near to the faecal matter and the corrupted humours.\nFinally, they found a montjoy or heap of ordure and filth.  Then fell the\npioneers to work to dig it up, and the rest with their shovels filled the\nbaskets; and when all was cleansed every one retired himself into his ball.\n\nThis done, Pantagruel enforcing himself to vomit, very easily brought them\nout, and they made no more show in his mouth than a fart in yours.  But,\nwhen they came merrily out of their pills, I thought upon the Grecians\ncoming out of the Trojan horse.  By this means was he healed and brought\nunto his former state and convalescence; and of these brazen pills, or\nrather copper balls, you have one at Orleans, upon the steeple of the Holy\nCross Church.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.XXXIV.\n\nThe conclusion of this present book, and the excuse of the author.\n\nNow, my masters, you have heard a beginning of the horrific history of my\nlord and master Pantagruel.  Here will I make an end of the first book.  My\nhead aches a little, and I perceive that the registers of my brain are\nsomewhat jumbled and disordered with this Septembral juice.  You shall have\nthe rest of the history at Frankfort mart next coming, and there shall you\nsee how Panurge was married and made a cuckold within a month after his\nwedding; how Pantagruel found out the philosopher's stone, the manner how\nhe found it, and the way how to use it; how he passed over the Caspian\nmountains, and how he sailed through the Atlantic sea, defeated the\nCannibals, and conquered the isles of Pearls; how he married the daughter\nof the King of India, called Presthan; how he fought against the devil and\nburnt up five chambers of hell, ransacked the great black chamber, threw\nProserpina into the fire, broke five teeth to Lucifer, and the horn that\nwas in his arse; how he visited the regions of the moon to know whether\nindeed the moon were not entire and whole, or if the women had three\nquarters of it in their heads, and a thousand other little merriments all\nveritable.  These are brave things truly.  Good night, gentlemen.\nPerdonate mi, and think not so much upon my faults that you forget your\nown.\n\nIf you say to me, Master, it would seem that you were not very wise in\nwriting to us these flimflam stories and pleasant fooleries; I answer you,\nthat you are not much wiser to spend your time in reading them.\nNevertheless, if you read them to make yourselves merry, as in manner of\npastime I wrote them, you and I both are far more worthy of pardon than a\ngreat rabble of squint-minded fellows, dissembling and counterfeit saints,\ndemure lookers, hypocrites, pretended zealots, tough friars, buskin-monks,\nand other such sects of men, who disguise themselves like masquers to\ndeceive the world.  For, whilst they give the common people to understand\nthat they are busied about nothing but contemplation and devotion in\nfastings and maceration of their sensuality--and that only to sustain and\naliment the small frailty of their humanity--it is so far otherwise that,\non the contrary, God knows what cheer they make; Et Curios simulant, sed\nBacchanalia vivunt.  You may read it in great letters in the colouring of\ntheir red snouts, and gulching bellies as big as a tun, unless it be when\nthey perfume themselves with sulphur.  As for their study, it is wholly\ntaken up in reading of Pantagruelian books, not so much to pass the time\nmerrily as to hurt someone or other mischievously, to wit, in articling,\nsole-articling, wry-neckifying, buttock-stirring, ballocking, and\ndiabliculating, that is, calumniating.  Wherein they are like unto the poor\nrogues of a village that are busy in stirring up and scraping in the ordure\nand filth of little children, in the season of cherries and guinds, and\nthat only to find the kernels, that they may sell them to the druggists to\nmake thereof pomander oil.  Fly from these men, abhor and hate them as much\nas I do, and upon my faith you will find yourselves the better for it.  And\nif you desire to be good Pantagruelists, that is to say, to live in peace,\njoy, health, making yourselves always merry, never trust those men that\nalways peep out at one hole.\n\nEnd of Book II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\nTHE THIRD BOOK\n\n\nFrancois Rabelais to the Soul of the Deceased Queen of Navarre.\n\n  Abstracted soul, ravished with ecstasies,\n  Gone back, and now familiar in the skies,\n  Thy former host, thy body, leaving quite,\n  Which to obey thee always took delight,--\n  Obsequious, ready,--now from motion free,\n  Senseless, and as it were in apathy,\n  Wouldst thou not issue forth for a short space,\n  From that divine, eternal, heavenly place,\n  To see the third part, in this earthy cell,\n  Of the brave acts of good Pantagruel?\n\n\n\nThe Author's Prologue.\n\nGood people, most illustrious drinkers, and you, thrice precious gouty\ngentlemen, did you ever see Diogenes, and cynic philosopher?  If you have\nseen him, you then had your eyes in your head, or I am very much out of my\nunderstanding and logical sense.  It is a gallant thing to see the\nclearness of (wine, gold,) the sun.  I'll be judged by the blind born so\nrenowned in the sacred Scriptures, who, having at his choice to ask\nwhatever he would from him who is Almighty, and whose word in an instant is\neffectually performed, asked nothing else but that he might see.  Item, you\nare not young, which is a competent quality for you to philosophate more\nthan physically in wine, not in vain, and henceforwards to be of the\nBacchic Council; to the end that, opining there, you may give your opinion\nfaithfully of the substance, colour, excellent odour, eminency, propriety,\nfaculty, virtue, and effectual dignity of the said blessed and desired\nliquor.\n\nIf you have not seen him, as I am easily induced to believe that you have\nnot, at least you have heard some talk of him.  For through the air, and\nthe whole extent of this hemisphere of the heavens, hath his report and\nfame, even until this present time, remained very memorable and renowned.\nThen all of you are derived from the Phrygian blood, if I be not deceived.\nIf you have not so many crowns as Midas had, yet have you something, I know\nnot what, of him, which the Persians of old esteemed more of in all their\notacusts, and which was more desired by the Emperor Antonine, and gave\noccasion thereafter to the Basilico at Rohan to be surnamed Goodly Ears.\nIf you have not heard of him, I will presently tell you a story to make\nyour wine relish.  Drink then,--so, to the purpose.  Hearken now whilst I\ngive you notice, to the end that you may not, like infidels, be by your\nsimplicity abused, that in his time he was a rare philosopher and the\ncheerfullest of a thousand.  If he had some imperfection, so have you, so\nhave we; for there is nothing, but God, that is perfect.  Yet so it was,\nthat by Alexander the Great, although he had Aristotle for his instructor\nand domestic, was he held in such estimation, that he wished, if he had not\nbeen Alexander, to have been Diogenes the Sinopian.\n\nWhen Philip, King of Macedon, enterprised the siege and ruin of Corinth,\nthe Corinthians having received certain intelligence by their spies that he\nwith a numerous army in battle-rank was coming against them, were all of\nthem, not without cause, most terribly afraid; and therefore were not\nneglective of their duty in doing their best endeavours to put themselves\nin a fit posture to resist his hostile approach and defend their own city.\n\nSome from the fields brought into the fortified places their movables,\nbestial, corn, wine, fruit, victuals, and other necessary provision.\n\nOthers did fortify and rampire their walls, set up little fortresses,\nbastions, squared ravelins, digged trenches, cleansed countermines, fenced\nthemselves with gabions, contrived platforms, emptied casemates, barricaded\nthe false brays, erected the cavaliers, repaired the counterscarps,\nplastered the curtains, lengthened ravelins, stopped parapets, morticed\nbarbacans, assured the portcullises, fastened the herses, sarasinesques,\nand cataracts, placed their sentries, and doubled their patrol.  Everyone\ndid watch and ward, and not one was exempted from carrying the basket.\nSome polished corslets, varnished backs and breasts, cleaned the\nheadpieces, mail-coats, brigandines, salads, helmets, morions, jacks,\ngushets, gorgets, hoguines, brassars, and cuissars, corslets, haubergeons,\nshields, bucklers, targets, greaves, gauntlets, and spurs.  Others made\nready bows, slings, crossbows, pellets, catapults, migrains or fire-balls,\nfirebrands, balists, scorpions, and other such warlike engines expugnatory\nand destructive to the Hellepolides.  They sharpened and prepared spears,\nstaves, pikes, brown bills, halberds, long hooks, lances, zagayes,\nquarterstaves, eelspears, partisans, troutstaves, clubs, battle-axes,\nmaces, darts, dartlets, glaives, javelins, javelots, and truncheons.  They\nset edges upon scimitars, cutlasses, badelairs, backswords, tucks, rapiers,\nbayonets, arrow-heads, dags, daggers, mandousians, poniards, whinyards,\nknives, skeans, shables, chipping knives, and raillons.\n\nEvery man exercised his weapon, every man scoured off the rust from his\nnatural hanger; nor was there a woman amongst them, though never so\nreserved or old, who made not her harness to be well furbished; as you know\nthe Corinthian women of old were reputed very courageous combatants.\n\nDiogenes seeing them all so warm at work, and himself not employed by the\nmagistrates in any business whatsoever, he did very seriously, for many\ndays together, without speaking one word, consider and contemplate the\ncountenance of his fellow-citizens.\n\nThen on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and inspired by a martial\nspirit, he girded his cloak scarfwise about his left arm, tucked up his\nsleeves to the elbow, trussed himself like a clown gathering apples, and,\ngiving to one of his old acquaintance his wallet, books, and opistographs,\naway went he out of town towards a little hill or promontory of Corinth\ncalled (the) Cranie; and there on the strand, a pretty level place, did he\nroll his jolly tub, which served him for a house to shelter him from the\ninjuries of the weather:  there, I say, in a great vehemency of spirit, did\nhe turn it, veer it, wheel it, whirl it, frisk it, jumble it, shuffle it,\nhuddle it, tumble it, hurry it, jolt it, justle it, overthrow it, evert it,\ninvert it, subvert it, overturn it, beat it, thwack it, bump it, batter it,\nknock it, thrust it, push it, jerk it, shock it, shake it, toss it, throw\nit, overthrow it, upside down, topsy-turvy, arsiturvy, tread it, trample\nit, stamp it, tap it, ting it, ring it, tingle it, towl it, sound it,\nresound it, stop it, shut it, unbung it, close it, unstopple it.  And then\nagain in a mighty bustle he bandied it, slubbered it, hacked it, whittled\nit, wayed it, darted it, hurled it, staggered it, reeled it, swinged it,\nbrangled it, tottered it, lifted it, heaved it, transformed it,\ntransfigured it, transposed it, transplaced it, reared it, raised it,\nhoised it, washed it, dighted it, cleansed it, rinsed it, nailed it,\nsettled it, fastened it, shackled it, fettered it, levelled it, blocked it,\ntugged it, tewed it, carried it, bedashed it, bewrayed it, parched it,\nmounted it, broached it, nicked it, notched it, bespattered it, decked it,\nadorned it, trimmed it, garnished it, gauged it, furnished it, bored it,\npierced it, trapped it, rumbled it, slid it down the hill, and precipitated\nit from the very height of the Cranie; then from the foot to the top (like\nanother Sisyphus with his stone) bore it up again, and every way so banged\nit and belaboured it that it was ten thousand to one he had not struck the\nbottom of it out.\n\nWhich when one of his friends had seen, and asked him why he did so toil\nhis body, perplex his spirit, and torment his tub, the philosopher's answer\nwas that, not being employed in any other charge by the Republic, he\nthought it expedient to thunder and storm it so tempestuously upon his tub,\nthat amongst a people so fervently busy and earnest at work he alone might\nnot seem a loitering slug and lazy fellow.  To the same purpose may I say\nof myself,\n\n  Though I be rid from fear,\n  I am not void of care.\n\nFor, perceiving no account to be made of me towards the discharge of a\ntrust of any great concernment, and considering that through all the parts\nof this most noble kingdom of France, both on this and on the other side of\nthe mountains, everyone is most diligently exercised and busied, some in\nthe fortifying of their own native country for its defence, others in the\nrepulsing of their enemies by an offensive war; and all this with a policy\nso excellent and such admirable order, so manifestly profitable for the\nfuture, whereby France shall have its frontiers most magnifically enlarged,\nand the French assured of a long and well-grounded peace, that very little\nwithholds me from the opinion of good Heraclitus, which affirmeth war to be\nthe father of all good things; and therefore do I believe that war is in\nLatin called bellum, not by antiphrasis, as some patchers of old rusty\nLatin would have us to think, because in war there is little beauty to be\nseen, but absolutely and simply; for that in war appeareth all that is good\nand graceful, and that by the wars is purged out all manner of wickedness\nand deformity.  For proof whereof the wise and pacific Solomon could no\nbetter represent the unspeakable perfection of the divine wisdom, than by\ncomparing it to the due disposure and ranking of an army in battle array,\nwell provided and ordered.\n\nTherefore, by reason of my weakness and inability, being reputed by my\ncompatriots unfit for the offensive part of warfare; and on the other side,\nbeing no way employed in matter of the defensive, although it had been but\nto carry burthens, fill ditches, or break clods, either whereof had been to\nme indifferent, I held it not a little disgraceful to be only an idle\nspectator of so many valorous, eloquent, and warlike persons, who in the\nview and sight of all Europe act this notable interlude or tragi-comedy,\nand not make some effort towards the performance of this, nothing at all\nremains for me to be done ('And not exert myself, and contribute thereto\nthis nothing, my all, which remained for me to do.'--Ozell.).  In my\nopinion, little honour is due to such as are mere lookers-on, liberal of\ntheir eyes, and of their crowns, and hide their silver; scratching their\nhead with one finger like grumbling puppies, gaping at the flies like tithe\ncalves; clapping down their ears like Arcadian asses at the melody of\nmusicians, who with their very countenances in the depth of silence express\ntheir consent to the prosopopoeia.  Having made this choice and election,\nit seemed to me that my exercise therein would be neither unprofitable nor\ntroublesome to any, whilst I should thus set a-going my Diogenical tub,\nwhich is all that is left me safe from the shipwreck of my former\nmisfortunes.\n\nAt this dingle dangle wagging of my tub, what would you have me to do?  By\nthe Virgin that tucks up her sleeve, I know not as yet.  Stay a little,\ntill I suck up a draught of this bottle; it is my true and only Helicon; it\nis my Caballine fountain; it is my sole enthusiasm.  Drinking thus, I\nmeditate, discourse, resolve, and conclude.  After that the epilogue is\nmade, I laugh, I write, I compose, and drink again.  Ennius drinking wrote,\nand writing drank.  Aeschylus, if Plutarch in his Symposiacs merit any\nfaith, drank composing, and drinking composed.  Homer never wrote fasting,\nand Cato never wrote till after he had drunk.  These passages I have\nbrought before you to the end you may not say that I lived without the\nexample of men well praised and better prized.  It is good and fresh\nenough, even as if you would say it is entering upon the second degree.\nGod, the good God Sabaoth, that is to say, the God of armies, be praised\nfor it eternally!  If you after the same manner would take one great\ndraught, or two little ones, whilst you have your gown about you, I truly\nfind no kind of inconveniency in it, provided you send up to God for all\nsome small scantling of thanks.\n\nSince then my luck or destiny is such as you have heard--for it is not for\neverybody to go to Corinth--I am fully resolved to be so little idle and\nunprofitable, that I will set myself to serve the one and the other sort of\npeople.  Amongst the diggers, pioneers, and rampire-builders, I will do as\ndid Neptune and Apollo at Troy under Laomedon, or as did Renault of\nMontauban in his latter days:  I will serve the masons, I'll set on the pot\nto boil for the bricklayers; and, whilst the minced meat is making ready at\nthe sound of my small pipe, I'll measure the muzzle of the musing dotards.\nThus did Amphion with the melody of his harp found, build, and finish the\ngreat and renowned city of Thebes.\n\nFor the use of the warriors I am about to broach of new my barrel to give\nthem a taste (which by two former volumes of mine, if by the deceitfulness\nand falsehood of printers they had not been jumbled, marred, and spoiled,\nyou would have very well relished), and draw unto them, of the growth of\nour own trippery pastimes, a gallant third part of a gallon, and\nconsequently a jolly cheerful quart of Pantagruelic sentences, which you\nmay lawfully call, if you please, Diogenical:  and shall have me, seeing I\ncannot be their fellow-soldier, for their faithful butler, refreshing and\ncheering, according to my little power, their return from the alarms of the\nenemy; as also for an indefatigable extoller of their martial exploits and\nglorious achievements.  I shall not fail therein, par lapathium acutum de\ndieu; if Mars fail not in Lent, which the cunning lecher, I warrant you,\nwill be loth to do.\n\nI remember nevertheless to have read, that Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, one\nday, amongst the many spoils and booties which by his victories he had\nacquired, presenting to the Egyptians, in the open view of the people, a\nBactrian camel all black, and a party-coloured slave, in such sort as that\nthe one half of his body was black and the other white, not in partition of\nbreadth by the diaphragma, as was that woman consecrated to the Indian\nVenus whom the Tyanean philosopher did see between the river Hydaspes and\nMount Caucasus, but in a perpendicular dimension of altitude; which were\nthings never before that seen in Egypt.  He expected by the show of these\nnovelties to win the love of the people.  But what happened thereupon?  At\nthe production of the camel they were all affrighted, and offended at the\nsight of the party-coloured man--some scoffed at him as a detestable\nmonster brought forth by the error of nature; in a word, of the hope which\nhe had to please these Egyptians, and by such means to increase the\naffection which they naturally bore him, he was altogether frustrate and\ndisappointed; understanding fully by their deportments that they took more\npleasure and delight in things that were proper, handsome, and perfect,\nthan in misshapen, monstrous, and ridiculous creatures.  Since which time\nhe had both the slave and the camel in such dislike, that very shortly\nthereafter, either through negligence, or for want of ordinary sustenance,\nthey did exchange their life with death.\n\nThis example putteth me in a suspense between hope and fear, misdoubting\nthat, for the contentment which I aim at, I will but reap what shall be\nmost distasteful to me:  my cake will be dough, and for my Venus I shall\nhave but some deformed puppy:  instead of serving them, I shall but vex\nthem, and offend them whom I purpose to exhilarate; resembling in this\ndubious adventure Euclion's cook, so renowned by Plautus in his Pot, and by\nAusonius in his Griphon, and by divers others; which cook, for having by\nhis scraping discovered a treasure, had his hide well curried.  Put the\ncase I get no anger by it, though formerly such things fell out, and the\nlike may occur again.  Yet, by Hercules! it will not.  So I perceive in\nthem all one and the same specifical form, and the like individual\nproperties, which our ancestors called Pantagruelism; by virtue whereof\nthey will bear with anything that floweth from a good, free, and loyal\nheart.  I have seen them ordinarily take goodwill in part of payment, and\nremain satisfied therewith when one was not able to do better.  Having\ndespatched this point, I return to my barrel.\n\nUp, my lads, to this wine, spare it not!  Drink, boys, and trowl it off at\nfull bowls!  If you do not think it good, let it alone.  I am not like\nthose officious and importunate sots, who by force, outrage, and violence,\nconstrain an easy good-natured fellow to whiffle, quaff, carouse, and what\nis worse.  All honest tipplers, all honest gouty men, all such as are\na-dry, coming to this little barrel of mine, need not drink thereof if it\nplease them not; but if they have a mind to it, and that the wine prove\nagreeable to the tastes of their worshipful worships, let them drink,\nfrankly, freely, and boldly, without paying anything, and welcome.  This is\nmy decree, my statute and ordinance.\n\nAnd let none fear there shall be any want of wine, as at the marriage of\nCana in Galilee; for how much soever you shall draw forth at the faucet, so\nmuch shall I tun in at the bung.  Thus shall the barrel remain\ninexhaustible; it hath a lively spring and perpetual current.  Such was the\nbeverage contained within the cup of Tantalus, which was figuratively\nrepresented amongst the Brachman sages.  Such was in Iberia the mountain of\nsalt so highly written of by Cato.  Such was the branch of gold consecrated\nto the subterranean goddess, which Virgil treats of so sublimely.  It is a\ntrue cornucopia of merriment and raillery.  If at any time it seem to you\nto be emptied to the very lees, yet shall it not for all that be drawn\nwholly dry.  Good hope remains there at the bottom, as in Pandora's bottle;\nand not despair, as in the puncheon of the Danaids.  Remark well what I\nhave said, and what manner of people they be whom I do invite; for, to the\nend that none be deceived, I, in imitation of Lucilius, who did protest\nthat he wrote only to his own Tarentines and Consentines, have not pierced\nthis vessel for any else but you honest men, who are drinkers of the first\nedition, and gouty blades of the highest degree.  The great dorophages,\nbribe-mongers, have on their hands occupation enough, and enough on the\nhooks for their venison.  There may they follow their prey; here is no\ngarbage for them.  You pettifoggers, garblers, and masters of chicanery,\nspeak not to me, I beseech you, in the name of, and for the reverence you\nbear to the four hips that engendered you and to the quickening peg which\nat that time conjoined them.  As for hypocrites, much less; although they\nwere all of them unsound in body, pockified, scurvy, furnished with\nunquenchable thirst and insatiable eating.  (And wherefore?)  Because\nindeed they are not of good but of evil, and of that evil from which we\ndaily pray to God to deliver us.  And albeit we see them sometimes\ncounterfeit devotion, yet never did old ape make pretty moppet.  Hence,\nmastiffs; dogs in a doublet, get you behind; aloof, villains, out of my\nsunshine; curs, to the devil!  Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to\npant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?  Look, here is the cudgel which\nDiogenes, in his last will, ordained to be set by him after his death, for\nbeating away, crushing the reins, and breaking the backs of these bustuary\nhobgoblins and Cerberian hellhounds.  Pack you hence, therefore, you\nhypocrites, to your sheep-dogs; get you gone, you dissemblers, to the\ndevil!  Hay!  What, are you there yet?  I renounce my part of Papimanie, if\nI snatch you, Grr, Grrr, Grrrrrr.  Avaunt, avaunt!  Will you not be gone?\nMay you never shit till you be soundly lashed with stirrup leather, never\npiss but by the strapado, nor be otherwise warmed than by the bastinado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD BOOK.\n\n\nChapter 3.I.\n\nHow Pantagruel transported a colony of Utopians into Dipsody.\n\nPantagruel, having wholly subdued the land of Dipsody, transported\nthereunto a colony of Utopians, to the number of 9,876,543,210 men, besides\nthe women and little children, artificers of all trades, and professors of\nall sciences, to people, cultivate, and improve that country, which\notherwise was ill inhabited, and in the greatest part thereof but a mere\ndesert and wilderness; and did transport them (not) so much for the\nexcessive multitude of men and women, which were in Utopia multiplied, for\nnumber, like grasshoppers upon the face of the land.  You understand well\nenough, nor is it needful further to explain it to you, that the Utopian\nmen had so rank and fruitful genitories, and that the Utopian women carried\nmatrixes so ample, so gluttonous, so tenaciously retentive, and so\narchitectonically cellulated, that at the end of every ninth month seven\nchildren at the least, what male what female, were brought forth by every\nmarried woman, in imitation of the people of Israel in Egypt, if Anthony\n(Nicholas) de Lyra be to be trusted.  Nor yet was this transplantation made\nso much for the fertility of the soil, the wholesomeness of the air, or\ncommodity of the country of Dipsody, as to retain that rebellious people\nwithin the bounds of their duty and obedience, by this new transport of his\nancient and most faithful subjects, who, from all time out of mind, never\nknew, acknowledged, owned, or served any other sovereign lord but him; and\nwho likewise, from the very instant of their birth, as soon as they were\nentered into this world, had, with the milk of their mothers and nurses,\nsucked in the sweetness, humanity, and mildness of his government, to which\nthey were all of them so nourished and habituated, that there was nothing\nsurer than that they would sooner abandon their lives than swerve from this\nsingular and primitive obedience naturally due to their prince,\nwhithersoever they should be dispersed or removed.\n\nAnd not only should they, and their children successively descending from\ntheir blood, be such, but also would keep and maintain in this same fealty\nand obsequious observance all the nations lately annexed to his empire;\nwhich so truly came to pass that therein he was not disappointed of his\nintent.  For if the Utopians were before their transplantation thither\ndutiful and faithful subjects, the Dipsodes, after some few days conversing\nwith them, were every whit as, if not more, loyal than they; and that by\nvirtue of I know not what natural fervency incident to all human creatures\nat the beginning of any labour wherein they take delight:  solemnly\nattesting the heavens and supreme intelligences of their being only sorry\nthat no sooner unto their knowledge had arrived the great renown of the\ngood Pantagruel.\n\nRemark therefore here, honest drinkers, that the manner of preserving and\nretaining countries newly conquered in obedience is not, as hath been the\nerroneous opinion of some tyrannical spirits to their own detriment and\ndishonour, to pillage, plunder, force, spoil, trouble, oppress, vex,\ndisquiet, ruin and destroy the people, ruling, governing and keeping them\nin awe with rods of iron; and, in a word, eating and devouring them, after\nthe fashion that Homer calls an unjust and wicked king, Demoboron, that is\nto say, a devourer of his people.\n\nI will not bring you to this purpose the testimony of ancient writers.  It\nshall suffice to put you in mind of what your fathers have seen thereof,\nand yourselves too, if you be not very babes.  Newborn, they must be given\nsuck to, rocked in a cradle, and dandled.  Trees newly planted must be\nsupported, underpropped, strengthened and defended against all tempests,\nmischiefs, injuries, and calamities.  And one lately saved from a long and\ndangerous sickness, and new upon his recovery, must be forborn, spared, and\ncherished, in such sort that they may harbour in their own breasts this\nopinion, that there is not in the world a king or a prince who does not\ndesire fewer enemies and more friends.  Thus Osiris, the great king of the\nEgyptians, conquered almost the whole earth, not so much by force of arms\nas by easing the people of their troubles, teaching them how to live well,\nand honestly giving them good laws, and using them with all possible\naffability, courtesy, gentleness, and liberality.  Therefore was he by all\nmen deservedly entitled the Great King Euergetes, that is to say,\nBenefactor, which style he obtained by virtue of the command of Jupiter to\n(one) Pamyla.\n\nAnd in effect, Hesiod, in his Hierarchy, placed the good demons (call them\nangels if you will, or geniuses,) as intercessors and mediators betwixt the\ngods and men, they being of a degree inferior to the gods, but superior to\nmen.  And for that through their hands the riches and benefits we get from\nheaven are dealt to us, and that they are continually doing us good and\nstill protecting us from evil, he saith that they exercise the offices of\nkings; because to do always good, and never ill, is an act most singularly\nroyal.\n\nJust such another was the emperor of the universe, Alexander the\nMacedonian.  After this manner was Hercules sovereign possessor of the\nwhole continent, relieving men from monstrous oppressions, exactions, and\ntyrannies; governing them with discretion, maintaining them in equity and\njustice, instructing them with seasonable policies and wholesome laws,\nconvenient for and suitable to the soil, climate, and disposition of the\ncountry, supplying what was wanting, abating what was superfluous, and\npardoning all that was past, with a sempiternal forgetfulness of all\npreceding offences, as was the amnesty of the Athenians, when by the\nprowess, valour, and industry of Thrasybulus the tyrants were\nexterminated; afterwards at Rome by Cicero exposed, and renewed under the\nEmperor Aurelian.  These are the philtres, allurements, iynges,\ninveiglements, baits, and enticements of love, by the means whereof that\nmay be peaceably revived which was painfully acquired.  Nor can a\nconqueror reign more happily, whether he be a monarch, emperor, king,\nprince, or philosopher, than by making his justice to second his valour.\nHis valour shows itself in victory and conquest; his justice will appear\nin the goodwill and affection of the people, when he maketh laws,\npublisheth ordinances, establisheth religion, and doth what is right to\neveryone, as the noble poet Virgil writes of Octavian Augustus:\n\n    Victorque volentes\n  Per populos dat jura.\n\nTherefore is it that Homer in his Iliads calleth a good prince and great\nking Kosmetora laon, that is, the ornament of the people.\n\nSuch was the consideration of Numa Pompilius, the second king of the\nRomans, a just politician and wise philosopher, when he ordained that to\ngod Terminus, on the day of his festival called Terminales, nothing should\nbe sacrificed that had died; teaching us thereby that the bounds, limits,\nand frontiers of kingdoms should be guarded, and preserved in peace, amity,\nand meekness, without polluting our hands with blood and robbery.  Who doth\notherwise, shall not only lose what he hath gained, but also be loaded with\nthis scandal and reproach, that he is an unjust and wicked purchaser, and\nhis acquests perish with him; Juxta illud, male parta, male dilabuntur.\nAnd although during his whole lifetime he should have peaceable possession\nthereof, yet if what hath been so acquired moulder away in the hands of his\nheirs, the same opprobry, scandal, and imputation will be charged upon the\ndefunct, and his memory remain accursed for his unjust and unwarrantable\nconquest; Juxta illud, de male quaesitis vix gaudet tertius haeres.\n\nRemark, likewise, gentlemen, you gouty feoffees, in this main point worthy\nof your observation, how by these means Pantagruel of one angel made two,\nwhich was a contingency opposite to the counsel of Charlemagne, who made\ntwo devils of one when he transplanted the Saxons into Flanders and the\nFlemings into Saxony.  For, not being able to keep in such subjection the\nSaxons, whose dominion he had joined to the empire, but that ever and anon\nthey would break forth into open rebellion if he should casually be drawn\ninto Spain or other remote kingdoms, he caused them to be brought unto his\nown country of Flanders, the inhabitants whereof did naturally obey him,\nand transported the Hainaults and Flemings, his ancient loving subjects,\ninto Saxony, not mistrusting their loyalty now that they were transplanted\ninto a strange land.  But it happened that the Saxons persisted in their\nrebellion and primitive obstinacy, and the Flemings dwelling in Saxony did\nimbibe the stubborn manners and conditions of the Saxons.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.II.\n\nHow Panurge was made Laird of Salmigondin in Dipsody, and did waste his\nrevenue before it came in.\n\nWhilst Pantagruel was giving order for the government of all Dipsody, he\nassigned to Panurge the lairdship of Salmigondin, which was yearly worth\n6,789,106,789 reals of certain rent, besides the uncertain revenue of the\nlocusts and periwinkles, amounting, one year with another, to the value of\n435,768, or 2,435,769 French crowns of Berry.  Sometimes it did amount to\n1,230,554,321 seraphs, when it was a good year, and that locusts and\nperiwinkles were in request; but that was not every year.\n\nNow his worship, the new laird, husbanded this his estate so providently\nwell and prudently, that in less than fourteen days he wasted and\ndilapidated all the certain and uncertain revenue of his lairdship for\nthree whole years.  Yet did not he properly dilapidate it, as you might\nsay, in founding of monasteries, building of churches, erecting of\ncolleges, and setting up of hospitals, or casting his bacon-flitches to the\ndogs; but spent it in a thousand little banquets and jolly collations,\nkeeping open house for all comers and goers; yea, to all good fellows,\nyoung girls, and pretty wenches; felling timber, burning great logs for the\nsale of the ashes, borrowing money beforehand, buying dear, selling cheap,\nand eating his corn, as it were, whilst it was but grass.\n\nPantagruel, being advertised of this his lavishness, was in good sooth no\nway offended at the matter, angry nor sorry; for I once told you, and again\ntell it you, that he was the best, little, great goodman that ever girded a\nsword to his side.  He took all things in good part, and interpreted every\naction to the best sense.  He never vexed nor disquieted himself with the\nleast pretence of dislike to anything, because he knew that he must have\nmost grossly abandoned the divine mansion of reason if he had permitted his\nmind to be never so little grieved, afflicted, or altered at any occasion\nwhatsoever.  For all the goods that the heaven covereth, and that the earth\ncontaineth, in all their dimensions of height, depth, breadth, and length,\nare not of so much worth as that we should for them disturb or disorder our\naffections, trouble or perplex our senses or spirits.\n\nHe drew only Panurge aside, and then, making to him a sweet remonstrance\nand mild admonition, very gently represented before him in strong\narguments, that, if he should continue in such an unthrifty course of\nliving, and not become a better mesnagier, it would prove altogether\nimpossible for him, or at least hugely difficult, at any time to make him\nrich.  Rich! answered Panurge; have you fixed your thoughts there?  Have\nyou undertaken the task to enrich me in this world?  Set your mind to live\nmerrily, in the name of God and good folks; let no other cark nor care be\nharboured within the sacrosanctified domicile of your celestial brain.  May\nthe calmness and tranquillity thereof be never incommodated with, or\novershadowed by any frowning clouds of sullen imaginations and displeasing\nannoyance!  For if you live joyful, merry, jocund, and glad, I cannot be\nbut rich enough.  Everybody cries up thrift, thrift, and good husbandry.\nBut many speak of Robin Hood that never shot in his bow, and talk of that\nvirtue of mesnagery who know not what belongs to it.  It is by me that they\nmust be advised.  From me, therefore, take this advertisement and\ninformation, that what is imputed to me for a vice hath been done in\nimitation of the university and parliament of Paris, places in which is to\nbe found the true spring and source of the lively idea of Pantheology and\nall manner of justice.  Let him be counted a heretic that doubteth thereof,\nand doth not firmly believe it.  Yet they in one day eat up their bishop,\nor the revenue of the bishopric--is it not all one?--for a whole year, yea,\nsometimes for two.  This is done on the day he makes his entry, and is\ninstalled.  Nor is there any place for an excuse; for he cannot avoid it,\nunless he would be hooted at and stoned for his parsimony.\n\nIt hath been also esteemed an act flowing from the habit of the four\ncardinal virtues.  Of prudence in borrowing money beforehand; for none\nknows what may fall out.  Who is able to tell if the world shall last yet\nthree years?  But although it should continue longer, is there any man so\nfoolish as to have the confidence to promise himself three years?\n\n  What fool so confident to say,\n  That he shall live one other day?\n\nOf commutative justice, in buying dear, I say, upon trust, and selling\ngoods cheap, that is, for ready money.  What says Cato in his Book of\nHusbandry to this purpose?  The father of a family, says he, must be a\nperpetual seller; by which means it is impossible but that at last he shall\nbecome rich, if he have of vendible ware enough still ready for sale.\n\nOf distributive justice it doth partake, in giving entertainment to good\n--remark, good--and gentle fellows, whom fortune had shipwrecked, like\nUlysses, upon the rock of a hungry stomach without provision of sustenance;\nand likewise to the good--remark, the good--and young wenches.  For,\naccording to the sentence of Hippocrates, Youth is impatient of hunger,\nchiefly if it be vigorous, lively, frolic, brisk, stirring, and bouncing.\nWhich wanton lasses willingly and heartily devote themselves to the\npleasure of honest men; and are in so far both Platonic and Ciceronian,\nthat they do acknowledge their being born into this world not to be for\nthemselves alone, but that in their proper persons their acquaintance may\nclaim one share, and their friends another.\n\nThe virtue of fortitude appears therein by the cutting down and\noverthrowing of the great trees, like a second Milo making havoc of the\ndark forest, which did serve only to furnish dens, caves, and shelter to\nwolves, wild boars, and foxes, and afford receptacles, withdrawing corners,\nand refuges to robbers, thieves, and murderers, lurking holes and skulking\nplaces for cutthroat assassinators, secret obscure shops for coiners of\nfalse money, and safe retreats for heretics, laying them even and level\nwith the plain champaign fields and pleasant heathy ground, at the sound of\nthe hautboys and bagpipes playing reeks with the high and stately timber,\nand preparing seats and benches for the eve of the dreadful day of\njudgment.\n\nI gave thereby proof of my temperance in eating my corn whilst it was but\ngrass, like a hermit feeding upon salads and roots, that, so affranchising\nmyself from the yoke of sensual appetites to the utter disclaiming of their\nsovereignty, I might the better reserve somewhat in store for the relief of\nthe lame, blind, crippled, maimed, needy, poor, and wanting wretches.\n\nIn taking this course I save the expense of the weed-grubbers, who gain\nmoney,--of the reapers in harvest-time, who drink lustily, and without\nwater,--of gleaners, who will expect their cakes and bannocks,--of\nthreshers, who leave no garlic, scallions, leeks, nor onions in our\ngardens, by the authority of Thestilis in Virgil,--and of the millers, who\nare generally thieves,--and of the bakers, who are little better.  Is this\nsmall saving or frugality?  Besides the mischief and damage of the\nfield-mice, the decay of barns, and the destruction usually made by\nweasels and other vermin.\n\nOf corn in the blade you may make good green sauce of a light concoction\nand easy digestion, which recreates the brain and exhilarates the animal\nspirits, rejoiceth the sight, openeth the appetite, delighteth the taste,\ncomforteth the heart, tickleth the tongue, cheereth the countenance,\nstriking a fresh and lively colour, strengthening the muscles, tempers the\nblood, disburdens the midriff, refresheth the liver, disobstructs the\nspleen, easeth the kidneys, suppleth the reins, quickens the joints of the\nback, cleanseth the urine-conduits, dilates the spermatic vessels, shortens\nthe cremasters, purgeth the bladder, puffeth up the genitories, correcteth\nthe prepuce, hardens the nut, and rectifies the member.  It will make you\nhave a current belly to trot, fart, dung, piss, sneeze, cough, spit, belch,\nspew, yawn, snuff, blow, breathe, snort, sweat, and set taut your Robin,\nwith a thousand other rare advantages.  I understand you very well, says\nPantagruel; you would thereby infer that those of a mean spirit and shallow\ncapacity have not the skill to spend much in a short time.  You are not the\nfirst in whose conceit that heresy hath entered.  Nero maintained it, and\nabove all mortals admired most his uncle Caius Caligula, for having in a\nfew days, by a most wonderfully pregnant invention, totally spent all the\ngoods and patrimony which Tiberius had left him.\n\nBut, instead of observing the sumptuous supper-curbing laws of the Romans\n--to wit, the Orchia, the Fannia, the Didia, the Licinia, the Cornelia,\nthe Lepidiana, the Antia, and of the Corinthians--by the which they were\ninhibited, under pain of great punishment, not to spend more in one year\nthan their annual revenue did amount to, you have offered up the oblation\nof Protervia, which was with the Romans such a sacrifice as the paschal\nlamb was amongst the Jews, wherein all that was eatable was to be eaten,\nand the remainder to be thrown into the fire, without reserving anything\nfor the next day.  I may very justly say of you, as Cato did of Albidius,\nwho after that he had by a most extravagant expense wasted all the means\nand possessions he had to one only house, he fairly set it on fire, that he\nmight the better say, Consummatum est.  Even just as since his time St.\nThomas Aquinas did, when he had eaten up the whole lamprey, although there\nwas no necessity in it.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.III.\n\nHow Panurge praiseth the debtors and borrowers.\n\nBut, quoth Pantagruel, when will you be out of debt?  At the next ensuing\nterm of the Greek kalends, answered Panurge, when all the world shall be\ncontent, and that it be your fate to become your own heir.  The Lord forbid\nthat I should be out of debt, as if, indeed, I could not be trusted.  Who\nleaves not some leaven over night, will hardly have paste the next morning.\n\nBe still indebted to somebody or other, that there may be somebody always\nto pray for you, that the giver of all good things may grant unto you a\nblessed, long, and prosperous life; fearing, if fortune should deal crossly\nwith you, that it might be his chance to come short of being paid by you,\nhe will always speak good of you in every company, ever and anon purchase\nnew creditors unto you; to the end, that through their means you may make a\nshift by borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, and with other folk's earth fill\nup his ditch.  When of old, in the region of the Gauls, by the institution\nof the Druids, the servants, slaves, and bondmen were burnt quick at the\nfunerals and obsequies of their lords and masters, had not they fear\nenough, think you, that their lords and masters should die?  For, perforce,\nthey were to die with them for company.  Did not they incessantly send up\ntheir supplications to their great god Mercury, as likewise unto Dis, the\nfather of wealth, to lengthen out their days, and to preserve them long in\nhealth?  Were not they very careful to entertain them well, punctually to\nlook unto them, and to attend them faithfully and circumspectly?  For by\nthose means were they to live together at least until the hour of death.\nBelieve me, your creditors with a more fervent devotion will beseech\nAlmighty God to prolong your life, they being of nothing more afraid than\nthat you should die; for that they are more concerned for the sleeve than\nthe arm, and love silver better than their own lives.  As it evidently\nappeareth by the usurers of Landerousse, who not long since hanged\nthemselves because the price of the corn and wines was fallen by the return\nof a gracious season.  To this Pantagruel answering nothing, Panurge went\non in his discourse, saying, Truly and in good sooth, sir, when I ponder my\ndestiny aright, and think well upon it, you put me shrewdly to my plunges,\nand have me at a bay in twitting me with the reproach of my debts and\ncreditors.  And yet did I, in this only respect and consideration of being\na debtor, esteem myself worshipful, reverend, and formidable.  For against\nthe opinion of most philosophers, that of nothing ariseth nothing, yet,\nwithout having bottomed on so much as that which is called the First\nMatter, did I out of nothing become such (a) maker and creator, that I have\ncreated--what?--a gay number of fair and jolly creditors.  Nay, creditors,\nI will maintain it, even to the very fire itself exclusively, are fair and\ngoodly creatures.  Who lendeth nothing is an ugly and wicked creature, and\nan accursed imp of the infernal Old Nick.  And there is made--what?  Debts.\nA thing most precious and dainty, of great use and antiquity.  Debts, I\nsay, surmounting the number of syllables which may result from the\ncombinations of all the consonants, with each of the vowels heretofore\nprojected, reckoned, and calculated by the noble Xenocrates.  To judge of\nthe perfection of debtors by the numerosity of their creditors is the\nreadiest way for entering into the mysteries of practical arithmetic.\n\nYou can hardly imagine how glad I am, when every morning I perceive myself\nenvironed and surrounded with brigades of creditors--humble, fawning, and\nfull of their reverences.  And whilst I remark that, as I look more\nfavourably upon and give a cheerfuller countenance to one than to another,\nthe fellow thereupon buildeth a conceit that he shall be the first\ndespatched and the foremost in the date of payment, and he valueth my\nsmiles at the rate of ready money, it seemeth unto me that I then act and\npersonate the god of the passion of Saumure, accompanied with his angels\nand cherubims.\n\nThese are my flatterers, my soothers, my clawbacks, my smoothers, my\nparasites, my saluters, my givers of good-morrows, and perpetual orators;\nwhich makes me verily think that the supremest height of heroic virtue\ndescribed by Hesiod consisteth in being a debtor, wherein I held the first\ndegree in my commencement.  Which dignity, though all human creatures seem\nto aim at and aspire thereto, few nevertheless, because of the difficulties\nin the way and encumbrances of hard passages, are able to reach it, as is\neasily perceivable by the ardent desire and vehement longing harboured in\nthe breast of everyone to be still creating more debts and new creditors.\n\nYet doth it not lie in the power of everyone to be a debtor.  To acquire\ncreditors is not at the disposure of each man's arbitrament.  You\nnevertheless would deprive me of this sublime felicity.  You ask me when I\nwill be out of debt.  Well, to go yet further on, and possibly worse in\nyour conceit, may Saint Bablin, the good saint, snatch me, if I have not\nall my lifetime held debt to be as a union or conjunction of the heavens\nwith the earth, and the whole cement whereby the race of mankind is kept\ntogether; yea, of such virtue and efficacy that, I say, the whole progeny\nof Adam would very suddenly perish without it.  Therefore, perhaps, I do\nnot think amiss, when I repute it to be the great soul of the universe,\nwhich, according to the opinion of the Academics, vivifieth all manner of\nthings.  In confirmation whereof, that you may the better believe it to be\nso, represent unto yourself, without any prejudicacy of spirit, in a clear\nand serene fancy, the idea and form of some other world than this; take, if\nyou please, and lay hold on the thirtieth of those which the philosopher\nMetrodorus did enumerate, wherein it is to be supposed there is no debtor\nor creditor, that is to say, a world without debts.\n\nThere amongst the planets will be no regular course, all will be in\ndisorder.  Jupiter, reckoning himself to be nothing indebted unto Saturn,\nwill go near to detrude him out of his sphere, and with the Homeric chain\nwill be like to hang up the intelligences, gods, heavens, demons, heroes,\ndevils, earth and sea, together with the other elements.  Saturn, no doubt,\ncombining with Mars will reduce that so disturbed world into a chaos of\nconfusion.\n\nMercury then would be no more subjected to the other planets; he would\nscorn to be any longer their Camillus, as he was of old termed in the\nEtrurian tongue.  For it is to be imagined that he is no way a debtor to\nthem.\n\nVenus will be no more venerable, because she shall have lent nothing.  The\nmoon will remain bloody and obscure.  For to what end should the sun impart\nunto her any of his light?  He owed her nothing.  Nor yet will the sun\nshine upon the earth, nor the stars send down any good influence, because\nthe terrestrial globe hath desisted from sending up their wonted\nnourishment by vapours and exhalations, wherewith Heraclitus said, the\nStoics proved, Cicero maintained, they were cherished and alimented.  There\nwould likewise be in such a world no manner of symbolization, alteration,\nnor transmutation amongst the elements; for the one will not esteem itself\nobliged to the other, as having borrowed nothing at all from it.  Earth\nthen will not become water, water will not be changed into air, of air will\nbe made no fire, and fire will afford no heat unto the earth; the earth\nwill produce nothing but monsters, Titans, giants; no rain will descend\nupon it, nor light shine thereon; no wind will blow there, nor will there\nbe in it any summer or harvest.  Lucifer will break loose, and issuing\nforth of the depth of hell, accompanied with his furies, fiends, and horned\ndevils, will go about to unnestle and drive out of heaven all the gods, as\nwell of the greater as of the lesser nations.  Such a world without lending\nwill be no better than a dog-kennel, a place of contention and wrangling,\nmore unruly and irregular than that of the rector of Paris; a devil of an\nhurlyburly, and more disordered confusion than that of the plagues of\nDouay.  Men will not then salute one another; it will be but lost labour to\nexpect aid or succour from any, or to cry fire, water, murder, for none\nwill put to their helping hand.  Why?  He lent no money, there is nothing\ndue to him.  Nobody is concerned in his burning, in his shipwreck, in his\nruin, or in his death; and that because he hitherto had lent nothing, and\nwould never thereafter have lent anything.  In short, Faith, Hope, and\nCharity would be quite banished from such a world--for men are born to\nrelieve and assist one another; and in their stead should succeed and be\nintroduced Defiance, Disdain, and Rancour, with the most execrable troop of\nall evils, all imprecations, and all miseries.  Whereupon you will think,\nand that not amiss, that Pandora had there spilt her unlucky bottle.  Men\nunto men will be wolves, hobthrushers, and goblins (as were Lycaon,\nBellerophon, Nebuchodonosor), plunderers, highway robbers, cutthroats,\nrapparees, murderers, poisoners, assassinators, lewd, wicked, malevolent,\npernicious haters, set against everybody, like to Ishmael, Metabus, or\nTimon the Athenian, who for that cause was named Misanthropos, in such\nsort that it would prove much more easy in nature to have fish entertained\nin the air and bullocks fed in the bottom of the ocean, than to support or\ntolerate a rascally rabble of people that will not lend.  These fellows, I\nvow, do I hate with a perfect hatred; and if, conform to the pattern of\nthis grievous, peevish, and perverse world which lendeth nothing, you\nfigure and liken the little world, which is man, you will find in him a\nterrible justling coil and clutter.  The head will not lend the sight of\nhis eyes to guide the feet and hands; the legs will refuse to bear up the\nbody; the hands will leave off working any more for the rest of the\nmembers; the heart will be weary of its continual motion for the beating of\nthe pulse, and will no longer lend his assistance; the lungs will withdraw\nthe use of their bellows; the liver will desist from convoying any more\nblood through the veins for the good of the whole; the bladder will not be\nindebted to the kidneys, so that the urine thereby will be totally stopped.\nThe brains, in the interim, considering this unnatural course, will fall\ninto a raving dotage, and withhold all feeling from the sinews and motion\nfrom the muscles.  Briefly, in such a world without order and array, owing\nnothing, lending nothing, and borrowing nothing, you would see a more\ndangerous conspiration than that which Aesop exposed in his Apologue.  Such\na world will perish undoubtedly; and not only perish, but perish very\nquickly.  Were it Aesculapius himself, his body would immediately rot, and\nthe chafing soul, full of indignation, take its flight to all the devils of\nhell after my money.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.IV.\n\nPanurge continueth his discourse in the praise of borrowers and lenders.\n\nOn the contrary, be pleased to represent unto your fancy another world,\nwherein everyone lendeth and everyone oweth, all are debtors and all\ncreditors.  O how great will that harmony be, which shall thereby result\nfrom the regular motions of the heavens!  Methinks I hear it every whit as\nwell as ever Plato did.  What sympathy will there be amongst the elements!\nO how delectable then unto nature will be our own works and productions!\nWhilst Ceres appeareth laden with corn, Bacchus with wines, Flora with\nflowers, Pomona with fruits, and Juno fair in a clear air, wholesome and\npleasant.  I lose myself in this high contemplation.\n\nThen will among the race of mankind peace, love, benevolence, fidelity,\ntranquillity, rest, banquets, feastings, joy, gladness, gold, silver,\nsingle money, chains, rings, with other ware and chaffer of that nature be\nfound to trot from hand to hand.  No suits at law, no wars, no strife,\ndebate, nor wrangling; none will be there a usurer, none will be there a\npinch-penny, a scrape-good wretch, or churlish hard-hearted refuser.  Good\nGod!  Will not this be the golden age in the reign of Saturn? the true idea\nof the Olympic regions, wherein all (other) virtues cease, charity alone\nruleth, governeth, domineereth, and triumpheth?  All will be fair and\ngoodly people there, all just and virtuous.\n\nO happy world!  O people of that world most happy!  Yea, thrice and four\ntimes blessed is that people!  I think in very deed that I am amongst them,\nand swear to you, by my good forsooth, that if this glorious aforesaid\nworld had a pope, abounding with cardinals, that so he might have the\nassociation of a sacred college, in the space of very few years you should\nbe sure to see the saints much thicker in the roll, more numerous,\nwonder-working and mirific, more services, more vows, more staves and\nwax-candles than are all those in the nine bishoprics of Britany, St. Yves\nonly excepted.  Consider, sir, I pray you, how the noble Patelin, having a\nmind to deify and extol even to the third heavens the father of William\nJosseaulme, said no more but this, And he did lend his goods to those who\nwere desirous of them.\n\nO the fine saying!  Now let our microcosm be fancied conform to this model\nin all its members; lending, borrowing, and owing, that is to say,\naccording to its own nature.  For nature hath not to any other end created\nman, but to owe, borrow, and lend; no greater is the harmony amongst the\nheavenly spheres than that which shall be found in its well-ordered policy.\nThe intention of the founder of this microcosm is, to have a soul therein\nto be entertained, which is lodged there, as a guest with its host, (that)\nit may live there for a while.  Life consisteth in blood, blood is the seat\nof the soul; therefore the chiefest work of the microcosm is, to be making\nblood continually.\n\nAt this forge are exercised all the members of the body; none is exempted\nfrom labour, each operates apart, and doth its proper office.  And such is\ntheir heirarchy, that perpetually the one borrows from the other, the one\nlends the other, and the one is the other's debtor.  The stuff and matter\nconvenient, which nature giveth to be turned into blood, is bread and wine.\nAll kind of nourishing victuals is understood to be comprehended in these\ntwo, and from hence in the Gothish tongue is called companage.  To find out\nthis meat and drink, to prepare and boil it, the hands are put to work, the\nfeet do walk and bear up the whole bulk of the corporal mass; the eyes\nguide and conduct all; the appetite in the orifice of the stomach, by means\nof (a) little sourish black humour, called melancholy, which is transmitted\nthereto from the milt, giveth warning to shut in the food.  The tongue doth\nmake the first essay, and tastes it; the teeth do chew it, and the stomach\ndoth receive, digest, and chylify it.  The mesaraic veins suck out of it\nwhat is good and fit, leaving behind the excrements, which are, through\nspecial conduits for that purpose, voided by an expulsive faculty.\nThereafter it is carried to the liver, where it being changed again, it by\nthe virtue of that new transmutation becomes blood.  What joy, conjecture\nyou, will then be found amongst those officers when they see this rivulet\nof gold, which is their sole restorative?  No greater is the joy of\nalchemists, when after long travail, toil, and expense they see in their\nfurnaces the transmutation.  Then is it that every member doth prepare\nitself, and strive anew to purify and to refine this treasure.  The kidneys\nthrough the emulgent veins draw that aquosity from thence which you call\nurine, and there send it away through the ureters to be slipped downwards;\nwhere, in a lower receptacle, and proper for it, to wit, the bladder, it is\nkept, and stayeth there until an opportunity to void it out in his due\ntime.  The spleen draweth from the blood its terrestrial part, viz., the\ngrounds, lees, or thick substance settled in the bottom thereof, which you\nterm melancholy.  The bottle of the gall subtracts from thence all the\nsuperfluous choler; whence it is brought to another shop or work-house to\nbe yet better purified and fined, that is, the heart, which by its\nagitation of diastolic and systolic motions so neatly subtilizeth and\ninflames it, that in the right side ventricle it is brought to perfection,\nand through the veins is sent to all the members.  Each parcel of the body\ndraws it then unto itself, and after its own fashion is cherished and\nalimented by it.  Feet, hands, thighs, arms, eyes, ears, back, breast, yea,\nall; and then it is, that who before were lenders, now become debtors.  The\nheart doth in its left side ventricle so thinnify the blood, that it\nthereby obtains the name of spiritual; which being sent through the\narteries to all the members of the body, serveth to warm and winnow the\nother blood which runneth through the veins.  The lights never cease with\nits lappets and bellows to cool and refresh it, in acknowledgment of which\ngood the heart, through the arterial vein, imparts unto it the choicest of\nits blood.  At last it is made so fine and subtle within the rete mirabile,\nthat thereafter those animal spirits are framed and composed of it, by\nmeans whereof the imagination, discourse, judgment, resolution,\ndeliberation, ratiocination, and memory have their rise, actings, and\noperations.\n\nCops body, I sink, I drown, I perish, I wander astray, and quite fly out of\nmyself when I enter into the consideration of the profound abyss of this\nworld, thus lending, thus owing.  Believe me, it is a divine thing to\nlend,--to owe, an heroic virtue.  Yet is not this all.  This little world\nthus lending, owing, and borrowing, is so good and charitable, that no\nsooner is the above-specified alimentation finished, but that it forthwith\nprojecteth, and hath already forecast, how it shall lend to those who are\nnot as yet born, and by that loan endeavour what it may to eternize itself,\nand multiply in images like the pattern, that is, children.  To this end\nevery member doth of the choicest and most precious of its nourishment pare\nand cut off a portion, then instantly despatcheth it downwards to that\nplace where nature hath prepared for it very fit vessels and receptacles,\nthrough which descending to the genitories by long ambages, circuits, and\nflexuosities, it receiveth a competent form, and rooms apt enough both in\nman and woman for the future conservation and perpetuating of human kind.\nAll this is done by loans and debts of the one unto the other; and hence\nhave we this word, the debt of marriage.  Nature doth reckon pain to the\nrefuser, with a most grievous vexation to his members and an outrageous\nfury amidst his senses.  But, on the other part, to the lender a set\nreward, accompanied with pleasure, joy, solace, mirth, and merry glee.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.V.\n\nHow Pantagruel altogether abhorreth the debtors and borrowers.\n\nI understand you very well, quoth Pantagruel, and take you to be very good\nat topics, and thoroughly affectioned to your own cause.  But preach it up,\nand patrocinate it, prattle on it, and defend it as much as you will, even\nfrom hence to the next Whitsuntide, if you please so to do, yet in the end\nyou will be astonished to find how you shall have gained no ground at all\nupon me, nor persuaded me by your fair speeches and smooth talk to enter\nnever so little into the thraldom of debt.  You shall owe to none, saith\nthe holy Apostle, anything save love, friendship, and a mutual benevolence.\n\nYou serve me here, I confess, with fine graphides and diatyposes,\ndescriptions and figures, which truly please me very well.  But let me tell\nyou, if you will represent unto your fancy an impudent blustering bully and\nan importunate borrower, entering afresh and newly into a town already\nadvertised of his manners, you shall find that at his ingress the citizens\nwill be more hideously affrighted and amazed, and in a greater terror and\nfear, dread, and trembling, than if the pest itself should step into it in\nthe very same garb and accoutrement wherein the Tyanean philosopher found\nit within the city of Ephesus.  And I am fully confirmed in the opinion,\nthat the Persians erred not when they said that the second vice was to lie,\nthe first being that of owing money.  For, in very truth, debts and lying\nare ordinarily joined together.  I will nevertheless not from hence infer\nthat none must owe anything or lend anything.  For who so rich can be that\nsometimes may not owe, or who can be so poor that sometimes may not lend?\n\nLet the occasion, notwithstanding, in that case, as Plato very wisely\nsayeth and ordaineth in his laws, be such that none be permitted to draw\nany water out of his neighbour's well until first they by continual digging\nand delving into their own proper ground shall have hit upon a kind of\npotter's earth, which is called ceramite, and there had found no source or\ndrop of water; for that sort of earth, by reason of its substance, which is\nfat, strong, firm, and close, so retaineth its humidity, that it doth not\neasily evaporate it by any outward excursion or evaporation.\n\nIn good sooth, it is a great shame to choose rather to be still borrowing\nin all places from everyone, than to work and win.  Then only in my\njudgment should one lend, when the diligent, toiling, and industrious\nperson is no longer able by his labour to make any purchase unto himself,\nor otherwise, when by mischance he hath suddenly fallen into an unexpected\nloss of his goods.\n\nHowsoever, let us leave this discourse, and from henceforwards do not hang\nupon creditors, nor tie yourself to them.  I make account for the time past\nto rid you freely of them, and from their bondage to deliver you.  The\nleast I should in this point, quoth Panurge, is to thank you, though it be\nthe most I can do.  And if gratitude and thanksgiving be to be estimated\nand prized by the affection of the benefactor, that is to be done\ninfinitely and sempiternally; for the love which you bear me of your own\naccord and free grace, without any merit of mine, goeth far beyond the\nreach of any price or value.  It transcends all weight, all number, all\nmeasure; it is endless and everlasting; therefore, should I offer to\ncommensurate and adjust it, either to the size and proportion of your own\nnoble and gracious deeds, or yet to the contentment and delight of the\nobliged receivers, I would come off but very faintly and flaggingly.  You\nhave verily done me a great deal of good, and multiplied your favours on me\nmore frequently than was fitting to one of my condition.  You have been\nmore bountiful towards me than I have deserved, and your courtesies have by\nfar surpassed the extent of my merits, I must needs confess it.  But it is\nnot, as you suppose, in the proposed matter.  For there it is not where I\nitch, it is not there where it fretteth, hurts, or vexeth me; for,\nhenceforth being quit and out of debt, what countenance will I be able to\nkeep?  You may imagine that it will become me very ill for the first month,\nbecause I have never hitherto been brought up or accustomed to it.  I am\nvery much afraid of it.  Furthermore, there shall not one hereafter, native\nof the country of Salmigondy, but he shall level the shot towards my nose.\nAll the back-cracking fellows of the world, in discharging of their postern\npetarades, use commonly to say, Voila pour les quittes, that is, For the\nquit.  My life will be of very short continuance, I do foresee it.  I\nrecommend to you the making of my epitaph; for I perceive I will die\nconfected in the very stench of farts.  If, at any time to come, by way of\nrestorative to such good women as shall happen to be troubled with the\ngrievous pain of the wind-colic, the ordinary medicaments prove nothing\neffectual, the mummy of all my befarted body will straight be as a present\nremedy appointed by the physicians; whereof they, taking any small modicum,\nit will incontinently for their ease afford them a rattle of bumshot, like\na sal of muskets.\n\nTherefore would I beseech you to leave me some few centuries of debts; as\nKing Louis the Eleventh, exempting from suits in law the Reverend Miles\nd'Illiers, Bishop of Chartres, was by the said bishop most earnestly\nsolicited to leave him some few for the exercise of his mind.  I had rather\ngive them all my revenue of the periwinkles, together with the other\nincomes of the locusts, albeit I should not thereby have any parcel abated\nfrom off the principal sums which I owe.  Let us waive this matter, quoth\nPantagruel, I have told it you over again.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.VI.\n\nWhy new married men were privileged from going to the wars.\n\nBut, in the interim, asked Panurge, by what law was it constituted,\nordained, and established, that such as should plant a new vineyard, those\nthat should build a new house, and the new married men, should be exempted\nand discharged from the duty of warfare for the first year?  By the law,\nanswered Pantagruel, of Moses.  Why, replied Panurge, the lately married?\nAs for the vine-planters, I am now too old to reflect on them; my\ncondition, at this present, induceth me to remain satisfied with the care\nof vintage, finishing and turning the grapes into wine.  Nor are these\npretty new builders of dead stones written or pricked down in my Book of\nLife.  It is all with live stones that I set up and erect the fabrics of my\narchitecture, to wit, men.  It was, according to my opinion, quoth\nPantagruel, to the end, first, that the fresh married folks should for the\nfirst year reap a full and complete fruition of their pleasures in their\nmutual exercise of the act of love, in such sort, that in waiting more at\nleisure on the production of posterity and propagating of their progeny,\nthey might the better increase their race and make provision of new heirs.\nThat if, in the years thereafter, the men should, upon their undergoing of\nsome military adventure, happen to be killed, their names and coats-of-arms\nmight continue with their children in the same families.  And next, that,\nthe wives thereby coming to know whether they were barren or fruitful--for\none year's trial, in regard of the maturity of age wherein of old they\nmarried, was held sufficient for the discovery--they might pitch the more\nsuitably, in case of their first husband's decease, upon a second match.\nThe fertile women to be wedded to those who desire to multiply their issue;\nand the sterile ones to such other mates, as, misregarding the storing of\ntheir own lineage, choose them only for their virtues, learning, genteel\nbehaviour, domestic consolation, management of the house, and matrimonial\nconveniences and comforts, and such like.  The preachers of Varennes, saith\nPanurge, detest and abhor the second marriages, as altogether foolish and\ndishonest.\n\nFoolish and dishonest? quoth Pantagruel.  A plague take such preachers!\nYea but, quoth Panurge, the like mischief also befall the Friar Charmer,\nwho, in a full auditory making a sermon at Pereilly, and therein\nabominating the reiteration of marriage and the entering again in the bonds\nof a nuptial tie, did swear and heartily give himself to the swiftest devil\nin hell, if he had not rather choose, and would much more willingly\nundertake the unmaidening or depucelating of a hundred virgins, than the\nsimple drudgery of one widow.  Truly I find your reason in that point right\ngood and strongly grounded.\n\nBut what would you think, if the cause why this exemption or immunity was\ngranted had no other foundation but that, during the whole space of the\nsaid first year, they so lustily bobbed it with their female consorts, as\nboth reason and equity require they should do, that they had drained and\nevacuated their spermatic vessels; and were become thereby altogether\nfeeble, weak, emasculated, drooping, and flaggingly pithless; yea, in such\nsort that they in the day of battle, like ducks which plunge over head and\nears, would sooner hide themselves behind the baggage, than, in the company\nof valiant fighters and daring military combatants, appear where stern\nBellona deals her blows and moves a bustling noise of thwacks and thumps?\nNor is it to be thought that, under the standard of Mars, they will so much\nas once strike a fair stroke, because their most considerable knocks have\nbeen already jerked and whirrited within the curtains of his sweetheart\nVenus.\n\nIn confirmation whereof, amongst other relics and monuments of antiquity,\nwe now as yet often see, that in all great houses, after the expiring of\nsome few days, these young married blades are readily sent away to visit\ntheir uncles, that in the absence of their wives reposing themselves a\nlittle they may recover their decayed strength by the recruit of a fresh\nsupply, the more vigorous to return again and face about to renew the\nduelling shock and conflict of an amorous dalliance, albeit for the greater\npart they have neither uncle nor aunt to go to.\n\nJust so did the King Crackart, after the battle of the Cornets, not cashier\nus (speaking properly), I mean me and the Quail-caller, but for our\nrefreshment remanded us to our houses; and he is as yet seeking after his\nown.  My grandfather's godmother was wont to say to me when I was a boy,--\n\n  Patenostres et oraisons\n  Sont pour ceux-la, qui les retiennent.\n  Ung fiffre en fenaisons\n  Est plus fort que deux qui en viennent.\n\n  Not orisons nor patenotres\n  Shall ever disorder my brain.\n  One cadet, to the field as he flutters,\n  Is worth two, when they end the campaign.\n\nThat which prompteth me to that opinion is, that the vine-planters did\nseldom eat of the grapes, or drink of the wine of their labour, till the\nfirst year was wholly elapsed.  During all which time also the builders did\nhardly inhabit their new-structured dwelling-places, for fear of dying\nsuffocated through want of respiration; as Galen hath most learnedly\nremarked, in the second book of the Difficulty of Breathing.  Under favour,\nsir, I have not asked this question without cause causing and reason truly\nvery ratiocinant.  Be not offended, I pray you.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.VII.\n\nHow Panurge had a flea in his ear, and forbore to wear any longer his\nmagnificent codpiece.\n\nPanurge, the day thereafter, caused pierce his right ear after the Jewish\nfashion, and thereto clasped a little gold ring, of a ferny-like kind of\nworkmanship, in the beazil or collet whereof was set and enchased a flea;\nand, to the end you may be rid of all doubts, you are to know that the flea\nwas black.  O, what a brave thing it is, in every case and circumstance of\na matter, to be thoroughly well informed!  The sum of the expense hereof,\nbeing cast up, brought in, and laid down upon his council-board carpet, was\nfound to amount to no more quarterly than the charge of the nuptials of a\nHircanian tigress; even, as you would say, 600,000 maravedis.  At these\nvast costs and excessive disbursements, as soon as he perceived himself to\nbe out of debt, he fretted much; and afterwards, as tyrants and lawyers use\nto do, he nourished and fed her with the sweat and blood of his subjects\nand clients.\n\nHe then took four French ells of a coarse brown russet cloth, and therein\napparelling himself, as with a long, plain-seamed, and single-stitched\ngown, left off the wearing of his breeches, and tied a pair of spectacles\nto his cap.  In this equipage did he present himself before Pantagruel; to\nwhom this disguise appeared the more strange, that he did not, as before,\nsee that goodly, fair, and stately codpiece, which was the sole anchor of\nhope wherein he was wonted to rely, and last refuge he had midst all the\nwaves and boisterous billows which a stormy cloud in a cross fortune would\nraise up against him.  Honest Pantagruel, not understanding the mystery,\nasked him, by way of interrogatory, what he did intend to personate in that\nnew-fangled prosopopoeia.  I have, answered Panurge, a flea in mine ear,\nand have a mind to marry.  In a good time, quoth Pantagruel, you have told\nme joyful tidings.  Yet would not I hold a red-hot iron in my hand for all\nthe gladness of them.  But it is not the fashion of lovers to be accoutred\nin such dangling vestments, so as to have their shirts flagging down over\ntheir knees, without breeches, and with a long robe of a dark brown mingled\nhue, which is a colour never used in Talarian garments amongst any persons\nof honour, quality, or virtue.  If some heretical persons and schismatical\nsectaries have at any time formerly been so arrayed and clothed (though\nmany have imputed such a kind of dress to cosenage, cheat, imposture, and\nan affectation of tyranny upon credulous minds of the rude multitude), I\nwill nevertheless not blame them for it, nor in that point judge rashly or\nsinistrously of them.  Everyone overflowingly aboundeth in his own sense\nand fancy; yea, in things of a foreign consideration, altogether\nextrinsical and indifferent, which in and of themselves are neither\ncommendable nor bad, because they proceed not from the interior of the\nthoughts and heart, which is the shop of all good and evil; of goodness, if\nit be upright, and that its affections be regulated by the pure and clean\nspirit of righteousness; and, on the other side, of wickedness, if its\ninclinations, straying beyond the bounds of equity, be corrupted and\ndepraved by the malice and suggestions of the devil.  It is only the\nnovelty and new-fangledness thereof which I dislike, together with the\ncontempt of common custom and the fashion which is in use.\n\nThe colour, answered Panurge, is convenient, for it is conform to that\nof my council-board carpet; therefore will I henceforth hold me with it,\nand more narrowly and circumspectly than ever hitherto I have done look to\nmy affairs and business.  Seeing I am once out of debt, you never yet saw\nman more unpleasing than I will be, if God help me not.  Lo, here be my\nspectacles.  To see me afar off, you would readily say that it were Friar\n(John) Burgess.  I believe certainly that in the next ensuing year I shall\nonce more preach the Crusade.  Bounce, buckram.  Do you see this russet?\nDoubt not but there lurketh under it some hid property and occult virtue\nknown to very few in the world.  I did not take it on before this morning,\nand, nevertheless, am already in a rage of lust, mad after a wife, and\nvehemently hot upon untying the codpiece-point; I itch, I tingle, I\nwriggle, and long exceedingly to be married, that, without the danger of\ncudgel-blows, I may labour my female copes-mate with the hard push of a\nbull-horned devil.  O the provident and thrifty husband that I then will\nbe!  After my death, with all honour and respect due to my frugality, will\nthey burn the sacred bulk of my body, of purpose to preserve the ashes\nthereof, in memory of the choicest pattern that ever was of a perfectly\nwary and complete householder.  Cops body, this is not the carpet whereon\nmy treasurer shall be allowed to play false in his accounts with me, by\nsetting down an X for a V, or an L for an S.  For in that case should I\nmake a hail of fisticuffs to fly into his face.  Look upon me, sir, both\nbefore and behind,--it is made after the manner of a toga, which was the\nancient fashion of the Romans in time of peace.  I took the mode, shape,\nand form thereof in Trajan's Column at Rome, as also in the Triumphant Arch\nof Septimus Severus.  I am tired of the wars, weary of wearing buff-coats,\ncassocks, and hoquetons.  My shoulders are pitifully worn and bruised with\nthe carrying of harness.  Let armour cease, and the long robe bear sway!\nAt least it must be so for the whole space of the succeeding year, if I be\nmarried; as yesterday, by the Mosaic law, you evidenced.  In what\nconcerneth the breeches, my great-aunt Laurence did long ago tell me, that\nthe breeches were only ordained for the use of the codpiece, and to no\nother end; which I, upon a no less forcible consequence, give credit to\nevery whit, as well as to the saying of the fine fellow Galen, who in his\nninth book, Of the Use and Employment of our Members, allegeth that the\nhead was made for the eyes.  For nature might have placed our heads in our\nknees or elbows, but having beforehand determined that the eyes should\nserve to discover things from afar, she for the better enabling them to\nexecute their designed office, fixed them in the head, as on the top of a\nlong pole, in the most eminent part of all the body--no otherwise than we\nsee the phares, or high towers erected in the mouths of havens, that\nnavigators may the further off perceive with ease the lights of the nightly\nfires and lanterns.  And because I would gladly, for some short while, a\nyear at least, take a little rest and breathing time from the toilsome\nlabour of the military profession, that is to say, be married, I have\ndesisted from wearing any more a codpiece, and consequently have laid aside\nmy breeches.  For the codpiece is the principal and most especial piece of\narmour that a warrior doth carry; and therefore do I maintain even to the\nfire (exclusively, understand you me), that no Turks can properly be said\nto be armed men, in regard that codpieces are by their law forbidden to be\nworn.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.VIII.\n\nWhy the codpiece is held to be the chief piece of armour amongst warriors.\n\nWill you maintain, quoth Pantagruel, that the codpiece is the chief piece\nof a military harness?  It is a new kind of doctrine, very paradoxical; for\nwe say, At spurs begins the arming of a man.  Sir, I maintain it, answered\nPanurge, and not wrongfully do I maintain it.  Behold how nature, having a\nfervent desire, after its production of plants, trees, shrubs, herbs,\nsponges, and plant-animals, to eternize and continue them unto all\nsuccession of ages (in their several kinds or sorts, at least, although the\nindividuals perish) unruinable, and in an everlasting being, hath most\ncuriously armed and fenced their buds, sprouts, shoots, and seeds, wherein\nthe above-mentioned perpetuity consisteth, by strengthening, covering,\nguarding, and fortifying them with an admirable industry, with husks,\ncases, scurfs and swads, hulls, cods, stones, films, cartels, shells, ears,\nrinds, barks, skins, ridges, and prickles, which serve them instead of\nstrong, fair, and natural codpieces.  As is manifestly apparent in pease,\nbeans, fasels, pomegranates, peaches, cottons, gourds, pumpions, melons,\ncorn, lemons, almonds, walnuts, filberts, and chestnuts; as likewise in all\nplants, slips, or sets whatsoever, wherein it is plainly and evidently\nseen, that the sperm and semence is more closely veiled, overshadowed,\ncorroborated, and thoroughly harnessed, than any other part, portion, or\nparcel of the whole.\n\nNature, nevertheless, did not after that manner provide for the\nsempiternizing of (the) human race; but, on the contrary, created man\nnaked, tender, and frail, without either offensive or defensive arms; and\nthat in the estate of innocence, in the first age of all, which was the\ngolden season; not as a plant, but living creature, born for peace, not\nwar, and brought forth into the world with an unquestionable right and\ntitle to the plenary fruition and enjoyment of all fruits and vegetables,\nas also to a certain calm and gentle rule and dominion over all kinds of\nbeasts, fowls, fishes, reptiles, and insects.  Yet afterwards it happening\nin the time of the iron age, under the reign of Jupiter, when, to the\nmultiplication of mischievous actions, wickedness and malice began to take\nroot and footing within the then perverted hearts of men, that the earth\nbegan to bring forth nettles, thistles, thorns, briars, and such other\nstubborn and rebellious vegetables to the nature of man.  Nor scarce was\nthere any animal which by a fatal disposition did not then revolt from him,\nand tacitly conspire and covenant with one another to serve him no longer,\nnor, in case of their ability to resist, to do him any manner of obedience,\nbut rather, to the uttermost of their power, to annoy him with all the hurt\nand harm they could.  The man, then, that he might maintain his primitive\nright and prerogative, and continue his sway and dominion over all, both\nvegetable and sensitive creatures, and knowing of a truth that he could not\nbe well accommodated as he ought without the servitude and subjection of\nseveral animals, bethought himself that of necessity he must needs put on\narms, and make provision of harness against wars and violence.  By the holy\nSaint Babingoose, cried out Pantagruel, you are become, since the last\nrain, a great lifrelofre,--philosopher, I should say.  Take notice, sir,\nquoth Panurge, when Dame Nature had prompted him to his own arming, what\npart of the body it was, where, by her inspiration, he clapped on the first\nharness.  It was forsooth by the double pluck of my little dog the ballock\nand good Senor Don Priapos Stabo-stando--which done, he was content, and\nsought no more.  This is certified by the testimony of the great Hebrew\ncaptain (and) philosopher Moses, who affirmeth that he fenced that member\nwith a brave and gallant codpiece, most exquisitely framed, and by right\ncurious devices of a notably pregnant invention made up and composed of\nfig-tree leaves, which by reason of their solid stiffness, incisory\nnotches, curled frizzling, sleeked smoothness, large ampleness, together\nwith their colour, smell, virtue, and faculty, were exceeding proper and\nfit for the covering and arming of the satchels of generation--the\nhideously big Lorraine cullions being from thence only excepted, which,\nswaggering down to the lowermost bottom of the breeches, cannot abide, for\nbeing quite out of all order and method, the stately fashion of the high\nand lofty codpiece; as is manifest by the noble Valentine Viardiere, whom I\nfound at Nancy, on the first day of May--the more flauntingly to\ngallantrize it afterwards--rubbing his ballocks, spread out upon a table\nafter the manner of a Spanish cloak.  Wherefore it is, that none should\nhenceforth say, who would not speak improperly, when any country bumpkin\nhieth to the wars, Have a care, my roister, of the wine-pot, that is, the\nskull, but, Have a care, my roister, of the milk-pot, that is, the\ntesticles.  By the whole rabble of the horned fiends of hell, the head\nbeing cut off, that single person only thereby dieth.  But, if the ballocks\nbe marred, the whole race of human kind would forthwith perish, and be lost\nfor ever.\n\nThis was the motive which incited the goodly writer Galen, Lib. 1. De\nSpermate, to aver with boldness that it were better, that is to say, a less\nevil, to have no heart at all than to be quite destitute of genitories; for\nthere is laid up, conserved, and put in store, as in a secessive repository\nand sacred warehouse, the semence and original source of the whole\noffspring of mankind.  Therefore would I be apt to believe, for less than a\nhundred francs, that those are the very same stones by means whereof\nDeucalion and Pyrrha restored the human race, in peopling with men and\nwomen the world, which a little before that had been drowned in the\noverflowing waves of a poetical deluge.  This stirred up the valiant\nJustinian, L. 4. De Cagotis tollendis, to collocate his Summum Bonum, in\nBraguibus, et Braguetis.  For this and other causes, the Lord Humphrey de\nMerville, following of his king to a certain warlike expedition, whilst he\nwas in trying upon his own person a new suit of armour, for of his old\nrusty harness he could make no more use, by reason that some few years\nsince the skin of his belly was a great way removed from his kidneys, his\nlady thereupon, in the profound musing of a contemplative spirit, very\nmaturely considering that he had but small care of the staff of love and\npacket of marriage, seeing he did no otherwise arm that part of the body\nthan with links of mail, advised him to shield, fence, and gabionate it\nwith a big tilting helmet which she had lying in her closet, to her\notherwise utterly unprofitable.  On this lady were penned these subsequent\nverses, which are extant in the third book of the Shitbrana of Paltry\nWenches.\n\n  When Yoland saw her spouse equipp'd for fight,\n  And, save the codpiece, all in armour dight,\n  My dear, she cried, why, pray, of all the rest\n  Is that exposed, you know I love the best?\n  Was she to blame for an ill-managed fear,--\n  Or rather pious, conscionable care?\n  Wise lady, she!  In hurlyburly fight,\n  Can any tell where random blows may light?\n\nLeave off then, sir, from being astonished, and wonder no more at this new\nmanner of decking and trimming up of myself as you now see me.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.IX.\n\nHow Panurge asketh counsel of Pantagruel whether he should marry, yea, or\nno.\n\nTo this Pantagruel replying nothing, Panurge prosecuted the discourse he\nhad already broached, and therewithal fetching, as from the bottom of his\nheart, a very deep sigh, said, My lord and master, you have heard the\ndesign I am upon, which is to marry, if by some disastrous mischance all\nthe holes in the world be not shut up, stopped, closed, and bushed.  I\nhumbly beseech you, for the affection which of a long time you have borne\nme, to give me your best advice therein.  Then, answered Pantagruel, seeing\nyou have so decreed, taken deliberation thereon, and that the matter is\nfully determined, what need is there of any further talk thereof, but\nforthwith to put it into execution what you have resolved?  Yea but, quoth\nPanurge, I would be loth to act anything therein without your counsel had\nthereto.  It is my judgment also, quoth Pantagruel, and I advise you to it.\nNevertheless, quoth Panurge, if I understood aright that it were much\nbetter for me to remain a bachelor as I am, than to run headlong upon new\nhairbrained undertakings of conjugal adventure, I would rather choose not\nto marry.  Quoth Pantagruel, Then do not marry.  Yea but, quoth Panurge,\nwould you have me so solitarily drive out the whole course of my life,\nwithout the comfort of a matrimonial consort?  You know it is written, Vae\nsoli! and a single person is never seen to reap the joy and solace that is\nfound with married folks.  Then marry, in the name of God, quoth\nPantagruel.  But if, quoth Panurge, my wife should make me a cuckold--as it\nis not unknown unto you, how this hath been a very plentiful year in the\nproduction of that kind of cattle--I would fly out, and grow impatient\nbeyond all measure and mean.  I love cuckolds with my heart, for they seem\nunto me to be of a right honest conversation, and I truly do very willingly\nfrequent their company; but should I die for it, I would not be one of\ntheir number.  That is a point for me of a too sore prickling point.  Then\ndo not marry, quoth Pantagruel, for without all controversy this sentence\nof Seneca is infallibly true, What thou to others shalt have done, others\nwill do the like to thee.  Do you, quoth Panurge, aver that without all\nexception?  Yes, truly, quoth Pantagruel, without all exception.  Ho, ho,\nsays Panurge, by the wrath of a little devil, his meaning is, either in\nthis world or in the other which is to come.  Yet seeing I can no more want\na wife than a blind man his staff--(for) the funnel must be in agitation,\nwithout which manner of occupation I cannot live--were it not a great deal\nbetter for me to apply and associate myself to some one honest, lovely, and\nvirtuous woman, than as I do, by a new change of females every day, run a\nhazard of being bastinadoed, or, which is worse, of the great pox, if not\nof both together.  For never--be it spoken by their husbands' leave and\nfavour--had I enjoyment yet of an honest woman.  Marry then, in God's name,\nquoth Pantagruel.  But if, quoth Panurge, it were the will of God, and that\nmy destiny did unluckily lead me to marry an honest woman who should beat\nme, I would be stored with more than two third parts of the patience of\nJob, if I were not stark mad by it, and quite distracted with such rugged\ndealings.  For it hath been told me that those exceeding honest women have\nordinarily very wicked head-pieces; therefore is it that their family\nlacketh not for good vinegar.  Yet in that case should it go worse with me,\nif I did not then in such sort bang her back and breast, so thumpingly\nbethwack her gillets, to wit, her arms, legs, head, lights, liver, and\nmilt, with her other entrails, and mangle, jag, and slash her coats so\nafter the cross-billet fashion that the greatest devil of hell should wait\nat the gate for the reception of her damnel soul.  I could make a shift for\nthis year to waive such molestation and disquiet, and be content to lay\naside that trouble, and not to be engaged in it.\n\nDo not marry then, answered Pantagruel.  Yea but, quoth Panurge,\nconsidering the condition wherein I now am, out of debt and unmarried; mark\nwhat I say, free from all debt, in an ill hour, for, were I deeply on the\nscore, my creditors would be but too careful of my paternity, but being\nquit, and not married, nobody will be so regardful of me, or carry towards\nme a love like that which is said to be in a conjugal affection.  And if by\nsome mishap I should fall sick, I would be looked to very waywardly.  The\nwise man saith, Where there is no woman--I mean the mother of a family and\nwife in the union of a lawful wedlock--the crazy and diseased are in danger\nof being ill used and of having much brabbling and strife about them; as by\nclear experience hath been made apparent in the persons of popes, legates,\ncardinals, bishops, abbots, priors, priests, and monks; but there, assure\nyourself, you shall not find me.  Marry then, in the name of God, answered\nPantagruel.  But if, quoth Panurge, being ill at ease, and possibly through\nthat distemper made unable to discharge the matrimonial duty that is\nincumbent to an active husband, my wife, impatient of that drooping\nsickness and faint-fits of a pining languishment, should abandon and\nprostitute herself to the embraces of another man, and not only then not\nhelp and assist me in my extremity and need, but withal flout at and make\nsport of that my grievous distress and calamity; or peradventure, which is\nworse, embezzle my goods and steal from me, as I have seen it oftentimes\nbefall unto the lot of many other men, it were enough to undo me utterly,\nto fill brimful the cup of my misfortune, and make me play the mad-pate\nreeks of Bedlam.  Do not marry then, quoth Pantagruel.  Yea but, said\nPanurge, I shall never by any other means come to have lawful sons and\ndaughters, in whom I may harbour some hope of perpetuating my name and\narms, and to whom also I may leave and bequeath my inheritances and\npurchased goods (of which latter sort you need not doubt but that in some\none or other of these mornings I will make a fair and goodly show), that so\nI may cheer up and make merry when otherwise I should be plunged into a\npeevish sullen mood of pensive sullenness, as I do perceive daily by the\ngentle and loving carriage of your kind and gracious father towards you; as\nall honest folks use to do at their own homes and private dwelling-houses.\nFor being free from debt, and yet not married, if casually I should fret\nand be angry, although the cause of my grief and displeasure were never so\njust, I am afraid, instead of consolation, that I should meet with nothing\nelse but scoffs, frumps, gibes, and mocks at my disastrous fortune.  Marry\nthen, in the name of God, quoth Pantagruel.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.X.\n\nHow Pantagruel representeth unto Panurge the difficulty of giving advice in\nthe matter of marriage; and to that purpose mentioneth somewhat of the\nHomeric and Virgilian lotteries.\n\nYour counsel, quoth Panurge, under your correction and favour, seemeth unto\nme not unlike to the song of Gammer Yea-by-nay.  It is full of sarcasms,\nmockeries, bitter taunts, nipping bobs, derisive quips, biting jerks, and\ncontradictory iterations, the one part destroying the other.  I know not,\nquoth Pantagruel, which of all my answers to lay hold on; for your\nproposals are so full of ifs and buts, that I can ground nothing on them,\nnor pitch upon any solid and positive determination satisfactory to what is\ndemanded by them.  Are not you assured within yourself of what you have a\nmind to?  The chief and main point of the whole matter lieth there.  All\nthe rest is merely casual, and totally dependeth upon the fatal disposition\nof the heavens.\n\nWe see some so happy in the fortune of this nuptial encounter, that their\nfamily shineth as it were with the radiant effulgency of an idea, model, or\nrepresentation of the joys of paradise; and perceive others, again, to be\nso unluckily matched in the conjugal yoke, that those very basest of devils\nwhich tempt the hermits that inhabit the deserts of Thebais and Montserrat\nare not more miserable than they.  It is therefore expedient, seeing you\nare resolved for once to take a trial of the state of marriage, that, with\nshut eyes, bowing your head, and kissing the ground, you put the business\nto a venture, and give it a fair hazard, in recommending the success of the\nresidue to the disposure of Almighty God.  It lieth not in my power to give\nyou any other manner of assurance, or otherwise to certify you of what\nshall ensue on this your undertaking.  Nevertheless, if it please you, this\nyou may do.  Bring hither Virgil's poems, that after having opened the\nbook, and with our fingers severed the leaves thereof three several times,\nwe may, according to the number agreed upon betwixt ourselves, explore the\nfuture hap of your intended marriage.  For frequently by a Homeric lottery\nhave many hit upon their destinies; as is testified in the person of\nSocrates, who, whilst he was in prison, hearing the recitation of this\nverse of Homer, said of Achilles in the Ninth of the Iliads--\n\n  Emati ke tritato Phthien eribolon ikoimen,\n\n  We, the third day, to fertile Pthia came--\n\nthereby foresaw that on the third subsequent day he was to die.  Of the\ntruth whereof he assured Aeschines; as Plato, in Critone, Cicero, in Primo,\nde Divinatione, Diogenes Laertius, and others, have to the full recorded in\ntheir works.  The like is also witnessed by Opilius Macrinus, to whom,\nbeing desirous to know if he should be the Roman emperor, befell, by chance\nof lot, this sentence in the Eighth of the Iliads--\n\n  O geron, e mala de se neoi teirousi machetai,\n  Ze de bin lelutai, chalepon de se geras opazei.\n\n  Dotard, new warriors urge thee to be gone.\n  Thy life decays, and old age weighs thee down.\n\nIn fact, he, being then somewhat ancient, had hardly enjoyed the\nsovereignty of the empire for the space of fourteen months, when by\nHeliogabalus, then both young and strong, he was dispossessed thereof,\nthrust out of all, and killed.  Brutus doth also bear witness of another\nexperiment of this nature, who willing, through this exploratory way by\nlot, to learn what the event and issue should be of the Pharsalian battle\nwherein he perished, he casually encountered on this verse, said of\nPatroclus in the Sixteenth of the Iliads--\n\n  Alla me moir oloe, kai Letous ektanen uios.\n\n  Fate, and Latona's son have shot me dead.\n\nAnd accordingly Apollo was the field-word in the dreadful day of that\nfight.  Divers notable things of old have likewise been foretold and known\nby casting of Virgilian lots; yea, in matters of no less importance than\nthe obtaining of the Roman empire, as it happened to Alexander Severus,\nwho, trying his fortune at the said kind of lottery, did hit upon this\nverse written in the Sixth of the Aeneids--\n\n  Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.\n\n  Know, Roman, that thy business is to reign.\n\nHe, within very few years thereafter, was effectually and in good earnest\ncreated and installed Roman emperor.  A semblable story thereto is related\nof Adrian, who, being hugely perplexed within himself out of a longing\nhumour to know in what account he was with the Emperor Trajan, and how\nlarge the measure of that affection was which he did bear unto him, had\nrecourse, after the manner above specified, to the Maronian lottery, which\nby haphazard tendered him these lines out of the Sixth of the Aeneids--\n\n  Quis procul ille autem, ramis insignis olivae\n  Sacra ferens?  Nosco crines incanaque menta\n  Regis Romani.\n\n  But who is he, conspicuous from afar,\n  With olive boughs, that doth his offerings bear?\n  By the white hair and beard I know him plain,\n  The Roman king.\n\nShortly thereafter was he adopted by Trajan, and succeeded to him in the\nempire.  Moreover, to the lot of the praiseworthy Emperor Claudius befell\nthis line of Virgil, written in the Sixth of his Aeneids--\n\n  Tertia dum Latio regnantem viderit aestas.\n\n  Whilst the third summer saw him reign, a king\n  In Latium.\n\nAnd in effect he did not reign above two years.  To the said Claudian also,\ninquiring concerning his brother Quintilius, whom he proposed as a\ncolleague with himself in the empire, happened the response following in\nthe Sixth of the Aeneids--\n\n  Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata.\n\n    Whom Fate let us see,\n  And would no longer suffer him to be.\n\nAnd it so fell out; for he was killed on the seventeenth day after he had\nattained unto the management of the imperial charge.  The very same lot,\nalso, with the like misluck, did betide the Emperor Gordian the younger.\nTo Claudius Albinus, being very solicitous to understand somewhat of his\nfuture adventures, did occur this saying, which is written in the Sixth of\nthe Aeneids--\n\n  Hic rem Romanam magno turbante tumultu\n  Sistet Eques, &c.\n\n  The Romans, boiling with tumultuous rage,\n  This warrior shall the dangerous storm assuage:\n  With victories he the Carthaginian mauls,\n  And with strong hand shall crush the rebel Gauls.\n\nLikewise, when the Emperor D. Claudius, Aurelian's predecessor, did with\ngreat eagerness research after the fate to come of his posterity, his hap\nwas to alight on this verse in the First of the Aeneids--\n\n  Hic ego nec metas rerum, nec tempora pono.\n\n  No bounds are to be set, no limits here.\n\nWhich was fulfilled by the goodly genealogical row of his race.  When Mr.\nPeter Amy did in like manner explore and make trial if he should escape the\nambush of the hobgoblins who lay in wait all-to-bemaul him, he fell upon\nthis verse in the Third of the Aeneids--\n\n  Heu! fuge crudeles terras, fuge littus avarum!\n\n  Oh, flee the bloody land, the wicked shore!\n\nWhich counsel he obeying, safe and sound forthwith avoided all these\nambuscades.\n\nWere it not to shun prolixity, I could enumerate a thousand such like\nadventures, which, conform to the dictate and verdict of the verse, have by\nthat manner of lot-casting encounter befallen to the curious researchers of\nthem.  Do not you nevertheless imagine, lest you should be deluded, that I\nwould upon this kind of fortune-flinging proof infer an uncontrollable and\nnot to be gainsaid infallibility of truth.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XI.\n\nHow Pantagruel showeth the trial of one's fortune by the throwing of dice\nto be unlawful.\n\nIt would be sooner done, quoth Panurge, and more expeditely, if we should\ntry the matter at the chance of three fair dice.  Quoth Pantagruel, That\nsort of lottery is deceitful, abusive, illicitous, and exceedingly\nscandalous.  Never trust in it.  The accursed book of the Recreation of\nDice was a great while ago excogitated in Achaia, near Bourre, by that\nancient enemy of mankind, the infernal calumniator, who, before the statue\nor massive image of the Bourraic Hercules, did of old, and doth in several\nplaces of the world as yet, make many simple souls to err and fall into his\nsnares.  You know how my father Gargantua hath forbidden it over all his\nkingdoms and dominions; how he hath caused burn the moulds and draughts\nthereof, and altogether suppressed, abolished, driven forth, and cast it\nout of the land, as a most dangerous plague and infection to any\nwell-polished state or commonwealth.  What I have told you of dice, I say\nthe same of the play at cockall.  It is a lottery of the like guile and\ndeceitfulness; and therefore do not for convincing of me allege in\nopposition to this my opinion, or bring in the example of the fortunate cast\nof Tiberius, within the fountain of Aponus, at the oracle of Gerion. These\nare the baited hooks by which the devil attracts and draweth unto him the\nfoolish souls of silly people into eternal perdition.\n\nNevertheless, to satisfy your humour in some measure, I am content you\nthrow three dice upon this table, that, according to the number of the\nblots which shall happen to be cast up, we may hit upon a verse of that\npage which in the setting open of the book you shall have pitched upon.\n\nHave you any dice in your pocket?  A whole bagful, answered Panurge.  That\nis provision against the devil, as is expounded by Merlin Coccaius, Lib.\n2. De Patria Diabolorum.  The devil would be sure to take me napping, and\nvery much at unawares, if he should find me without dice.  With this, the\nthree dice being taken out, produced, and thrown, they fell so pat upon the\nlower points that the cast was five, six, and five.  These are, quoth\nPanurge, sixteen in all.  Let us take the sixteenth line of the page.  The\nnumber pleaseth me very well; I hope we shall have a prosperous and happy\nchance.  May I be thrown amidst all the devils of hell, even as a great\nbowl cast athwart at a set of ninepins, or cannon-ball shot among a\nbattalion of foot, in case so many times I do not boult my future wife the\nfirst night of our marriage!  Of that, forsooth, I make no doubt at all,\nquoth Pantagruel.  You needed not to have rapped forth such a horrid\nimprecation, the sooner to procure credit for the performance of so small a\nbusiness, seeing possibly the first bout will be amiss, and that you know\nis usually at tennis called fifteen.  At the next justling turn you may\nreadily amend that fault, and so complete your reckoning of sixteen.  Is it\nso, quoth Panurge, that you understand the matter?  And must my words be\nthus interpreted?  Nay, believe me never yet was any solecism committed by\nthat valiant champion who often hath for me in Belly-dale stood sentry at\nthe hypogastrian cranny.  Did you ever hitherto find me in the\nconfraternity of the faulty?  Never, I trow; never, nor ever shall, for\never and a day.  I do the feat like a goodly friar or father confessor,\nwithout default.  And therein am I willing to be judged by the players.  He\nhad no sooner spoke these words than the works of Virgil were brought in.\nBut before the book was laid open, Panurge said to Pantagruel, My heart,\nlike the furch of a hart in a rut, doth beat within my breast.  Be pleased\nto feel and grope my pulse a little on this artery of my left arm. At its\nfrequent rise and fall you would say that they swinge and belabour me after\nthe manner of a probationer, posed and put to a peremptory trial in the\nexamination of his sufficiency for the discharge of the learned duty of a\ngraduate in some eminent degree in the college of the Sorbonists.\n\nBut would you not hold it expedient, before we proceed any further, that we\nshould invocate Hercules and the Tenetian goddesses who in the chamber of\nlots are said to rule, sit in judgment, and bear a presidential sway?\nNeither him nor them, answered Pantagruel; only open up the leaves of the\nbook with your fingers, and set your nails awork.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XII.\n\nHow Pantagruel doth explore by the Virgilian lottery what fortune Panurge\nshall have in his marriage.\n\nThen at the opening of the book in the sixteenth row of the lines of the\ndisclosed page did Panurge encounter upon this following verse:\n\n  Nec Deus hunc mensa, Dea nec dignata cubili est.\n\n  The god him from his table banished,\n  Nor would the goddess have him in her bed.\n\nThis response, quoth Pantagruel, maketh not very much for your benefit or\nadvantage; for it plainly signifies and denoteth that your wife shall be a\nstrumpet, and yourself by consequence a cuckold.  The goddess, whom you\nshall not find propitious nor favourable unto you, is Minerva, a most\nredoubtable and dreadful virgin, a powerful and fulminating goddess, an\nenemy to cuckolds and effeminate youngsters, to cuckold-makers and\nadulterers.  The god is Jupiter, a terrible and thunder-striking god from\nheaven.  And withal it is to be remarked, that, conform to the doctrine of\nthe ancient Etrurians, the manubes, for so did they call the darting hurls\nor slinging casts of the Vulcanian thunderbolts, did only appertain to her\nand to Jupiter her father capital.  This was verified in the conflagration\nof the ships of Ajax Oileus, nor doth this fulminating power belong to any\nother of the Olympic gods.  Men, therefore, stand not in such fear of them.\nMoreover, I will tell you, and you may take it as extracted out of the\nprofoundest mysteries of mythology, that, when the giants had enterprised\nthe waging of a war against the power of the celestial orbs, the gods at\nfirst did laugh at those attempts, and scorned such despicable enemies, who\nwere, in their conceit, not strong enough to cope in feats of warfare with\ntheir pages; but when they saw by the gigantine labour the high hill Pelion\nset on lofty Ossa, and that the mount Olympus was made shake to be erected\non the top of both, then was it that Jupiter held a parliament, or general\nconvention, wherein it was unanimously resolved upon and condescended to by\nall the gods, that they should worthily and valiantly stand to their\ndefence.  And because they had often seen battles lost by the cumbersome\nlets and disturbing encumbrances of women confusedly huddled in amongst\narmies, it was at that time decreed and enacted that they should expel and\ndrive out of heaven into Egypt and the confines of Nile that whole crew of\ngoddesses, disguised in the shapes of weasels, polecats, bats, shrew-mice,\nferrets, fulmarts, and other such like odd transformations; only Minerva\nwas reserved to participate with Jupiter in the horrific fulminating power,\nas being the goddess both of war and learning, of arts and arms, of counsel\nand despatch--a goddess armed from her birth, a goddess dreaded in heaven,\nin the air, by sea and land.  By the belly of Saint Buff, quoth Panurge,\nshould I be Vulcan, whom the poet blazons?  Nay, I am neither a cripple,\ncoiner of false money, nor smith, as he was.  My wife possibly will be as\ncomely and handsome as ever was his Venus, but not a whore like her, nor I\na cuckold like him.  The crook-legged slovenly slave made himself to be\ndeclared a cuckold by a definite sentence and judgment, in the open view of\nall the gods.  For this cause ought you to interpret the afore-mentioned\nverse quite contrary to what you have said.  This lot importeth that my\nwife will be honest, virtuous, chaste, loyal, and faithful; not armed,\nsurly, wayward, cross, giddy, humorous, heady, hairbrained, or extracted\nout of the brains, as was the goddess Pallas; nor shall this fair jolly\nJupiter be my co-rival.  He shall never dip his bread in my broth, though\nwe should sit together at one table.\n\nConsider his exploits and gallant actions.  He was the manifest ruffian,\nwencher, whoremonger, and most infamous cuckold-maker that ever breathed.\nHe did always lecher it like a boar, and no wonder, for he was fostered by\na sow in the Isle of Candia, if Agathocles the Babylonian be not a liar,\nand more rammishly lascivious than a buck; whence it is that he is said by\nothers to have been suckled and fed with the milk of the Amalthaean goat.\nBy the virtue of Acheron, he justled, bulled, and lastauriated in one day\nthe third part of the world, beasts and people, floods and mountains; that\nwas Europa.  For this grand subagitatory achievement the Ammonians caused\ndraw, delineate, and paint him in the figure and shape of a ram ramming,\nand horned ram.  But I know well enough how to shield and preserve myself\nfrom that horned champion.  He will not, trust me, have to deal in my\nperson with a sottish, dunsical Amphitryon, nor with a silly witless Argus,\nfor all his hundred spectacles, nor yet with the cowardly meacock Acrisius,\nthe simple goose-cap Lycus of Thebes, the doting blockhead Agenor, the\nphlegmatic pea-goose Aesop, rough-footed Lycaon, the luskish misshapen\nCorytus of Tuscany, nor with the large-backed and strong-reined Atlas.  Let\nhim alter, change, transform, and metamorphose himself into a hundred\nvarious shapes and figures, into a swan, a bull, a satyr, a shower of gold,\nor into a cuckoo, as he did when he unmaidened his sister Juno; into an\neagle, ram, or dove, as when he was enamoured of the virgin Phthia, who\nthen dwelt in the Aegean territory; into fire, a serpent, yea, even into a\nflea; into Epicurean and Democratical atoms, or, more\nMagistronostralistically, into those sly intentions of the mind, which in\nthe schools are called second notions,--I'll catch him in the nick, and\ntake him napping.  And would you know what I would do unto him?  Even that\nwhich to his father Coelum Saturn did--Seneca foretold it of me, and\nLactantius hath confirmed it--what the goddess Rhea did to Athis.  I would\nmake him two stone lighter, rid him of his Cyprian cymbals, and cut so\nclose and neatly by the breech, that there shall not remain thereof so much\nas one--, so cleanly would I shave him, and disable him for ever from being\nPope, for Testiculos non habet.  Hold there, said Pantagruel; ho, soft and\nfair, my lad!  Enough of that,--cast up, turn over the leaves, and try your\nfortune for the second time.  Then did he fall upon this ensuing verse:\n\n  Membra quatit, gelidusque coit formidine sanguis.\n\n  His joints and members quake, he becomes pale,\n  And sudden fear doth his cold blood congeal.\n\nThis importeth, quoth Pantagruel, that she will soundly bang your back and\nbelly.  Clean and quite contrary, answered Panurge; it is of me that he\nprognosticates, in saying that I will beat her like a tiger if she vex me.\nSir Martin Wagstaff will perform that office, and in default of a cudgel,\nthe devil gulp him, if I should not eat her up quick, as Candaul the Lydian\nking did his wife, whom he ravened and devoured.\n\nYou are very stout, says Pantagruel, and courageous; Hercules himself durst\nhardly adventure to scuffle with you in this your raging fury.  Nor is it\nstrange; for the Jan is worth two, and two in fight against Hercules are\ntoo too strong.  Am I a Jan? quoth Panurge.  No, no, answered Pantagruel.\nMy mind was only running upon the lurch and tricktrack.  Thereafter did he\nhit, at the third opening of the book, upon this verse:\n\n  Foemineo praedae, et spoliorum ardebat amore.\n\n  After the spoil and pillage, as in fire,\n  He burnt with a strong feminine desire.\n\nThis portendeth, quoth Pantagruel, that she will steal your goods, and rob\nyou.  Hence this, according to these three drawn lots, will be your future\ndestiny, I clearly see it,--you will be a cuckold, you will be beaten, and\nyou will be robbed.  Nay, it is quite otherwise, quoth Panurge; for it is\ncertain that this verse presageth that she will love me with a perfect\nliking.  Nor did the satyr-writing poet lie in proof hereof, when he\naffirmed that a woman, burning with extreme affection, takes sometimes\npleasure to steal from her sweetheart.  And what, I pray you?  A glove, a\npoint, or some such trifling toy of no importance, to make him keep a\ngentle kind of stirring in the research and quest thereof.  In like manner,\nthese small scolding debates and petty brabbling contentions, which\nfrequently we see spring up and for a certain space boil very hot betwixt a\ncouple of high-spirited lovers, are nothing else but recreative diversions\nfor their refreshment, spurs to and incentives of a more fervent amity than\never.  As, for example, we do sometimes see cutlers with hammers maul their\nfinest whetstones, therewith to sharpen their iron tools the better.  And\ntherefore do I think that these three lots make much for my advantage;\nwhich, if not, I from their sentence totally appeal.  There is no\nappellation, quoth Pantagruel, from the decrees of fate or destiny, of lot\nor chance; as is recorded by our ancient lawyers, witness Baldus, Lib. ult.\nCap. de Leg.  The reason hereof is, Fortune doth not acknowledge a\nsuperior, to whom an appeal may be made from her or any of her substitutes.\nAnd in this case the pupil cannot be restored to his right in full, as\nopenly by the said author is alleged in L. Ait Praetor, paragr. ult. ff. de\nminor.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel adviseth Panurge to try the future good or bad luck of his\nmarriage by dreams.\n\nNow, seeing we cannot agree together in the manner of expounding or\ninterpreting the sense of the Virgilian lots, let us bend our course\nanother way, and try a new sort of divination.  Of what kind? asked\nPanurge.  Of a good ancient and authentic fashion, answered Pantagruel; it\nis by dreams.  For in dreaming, such circumstances and conditions being\nthereto adhibited, as are clearly enough described by Hippocrates, in Lib.\nPeri ton enupnion, by Plato, Plotin, Iamblicus, Sinesius, Aristotle,\nXenophon, Galen, Plutarch, Artemidorus, Daldianus, Herophilus, Q. Calaber,\nTheocritus, Pliny, Athenaeus, and others, the soul doth oftentimes foresee\nwhat is to come.  How true this is, you may conceive by a very vulgar and\nfamiliar example; as when you see that at such a time as suckling babes,\nwell nourished, fed, and fostered with good milk, sleep soundly and\nprofoundly, the nurses in the interim get leave to sport themselves, and\nare licentiated to recreate their fancies at what range to them shall seem\nmost fitting and expedient, their presence, sedulity, and attendance on\nthe cradle being, during all that space, held unnecessary.  Even just so,\nwhen our body is at rest, that the concoction is everywhere accomplished,\nand that, till it awake, it lacks for nothing, our soul delighteth to\ndisport itself and is well pleased in that frolic to take a review of its\nnative country, which is the heavens, where it receiveth a most notable\nparticipation of its first beginning with an imbuement from its divine\nsource, and in contemplation of that infinite and intellectual sphere,\nwhereof the centre is everywhere, and the circumference in no place of the\nuniversal world, to wit, God, according to the doctrine of Hermes\nTrismegistus, to whom no new thing happeneth, whom nothing that is past\nescapeth, and unto whom all things are alike present, remarketh not only\nwhat is preterit and gone in the inferior course and agitation of sublunary\nmatters, but withal taketh notice what is to come; then bringing a relation\nof those future events unto the body of the outward senses and exterior\norgans, it is divulged abroad unto the hearing of others.  Whereupon the\nowner of that soul deserveth to be termed a vaticinator, or prophet.\nNevertheless, the truth is, that the soul is seldom able to report those\nthings in such sincerity as it hath seen them, by reason of the\nimperfection and frailty of the corporeal senses, which obstruct the\neffectuating of that office; even as the moon doth not communicate unto\nthis earth of ours that light which she receiveth from the sun with so much\nsplendour, heat, vigour, purity, and liveliness as it was given her.  Hence\nit is requisite for the better reading, explaining, and unfolding of these\nsomniatory vaticinations and predictions of that nature, that a dexterous,\nlearned, skilful, wise, industrious, expert, rational, and peremptory\nexpounder or interpreter be pitched upon, such a one as by the Greeks is\ncalled onirocrit, or oniropolist.  For this cause Heraclitus was wont to\nsay that nothing is by dreams revealed to us, that nothing is by dreams\nconcealed from us, and that only we thereby have a mystical signification\nand secret evidence of things to come, either for our own prosperous or\nunlucky fortune, or for the favourable or disastrous success of another.\nThe sacred Scriptures testify no less, and profane histories assure us of\nit, in both which are exposed to our view a thousand several kinds of\nstrange adventures, which have befallen pat according to the nature of the\ndream, and that as well to the party dreamer as to others.  The Atlantic\npeople, and those that inhabit the (is)land of Thasos, one of the Cyclades,\nare of this grand commodity deprived; for in their countries none yet ever\ndreamed.  Of this sort (were) Cleon of Daulia, Thrasymedes, and in our days\nthe learned Frenchman Villanovanus, neither of all which knew what dreaming\nwas.\n\nFail not therefore to-morrow, when the jolly and fair Aurora with her rosy\nfingers draweth aside the curtains of the night to drive away the sable\nshades of darkness, to bend your spirits wholly to the task of sleeping\nsound, and thereto apply yourself.  In the meanwhile you must denude your\nmind of every human passion or affection, such as are love and hatred, fear\nand hope, for as of old the great vaticinator, most famous and renowned\nprophet Proteus, was not able in his disguise or transformation into fire,\nwater, a tiger, a dragon, and other such like uncouth shapes and visors, to\npresage anything that was to come till he was restored to his own first\nnatural and kindly form; just so doth man; for, at his reception of the art\nof divination and faculty of prognosticating future things, that part in\nhim which is the most divine, to wit, the Nous, or Mens, must be calm,\npeaceable, untroubled, quiet, still, hushed, and not embusied or distracted\nwith foreign, soul-disturbing perturbations.  I am content, quoth Panurge.\nBut, I pray you, sir, must I this evening, ere I go to bed, eat much or\nlittle?  I do not ask this without cause.  For if I sup not well, large,\nround, and amply, my sleeping is not worth a forked turnip.  All the night\nlong I then but doze and rave, and in my slumbering fits talk idle\nnonsense, my thoughts being in a dull brown study, and as deep in their\ndumps as is my belly hollow.\n\nNot to sup, answered Pantagruel, were best for you, considering the state\nof your complexion and healthy constitution of your body.  A certain very\nancient prophet, named Amphiaraus, wished such as had a mind by dreams to\nbe imbued with any oracle, for four-and-twenty hours to taste no victuals,\nand to abstain from wine three days together.  Yet shall not you be put to\nsuch a sharp, hard, rigorous, and extreme sparing diet.  I am truly right\napt to believe that a man whose stomach is replete with various cheer, and\nin a manner surfeited with drinking, is hardly able to conceive aright of\nspiritual things; yet am not I of the opinion of those who, after long and\npertinacious fastings, think by such means to enter more profoundly into\nthe speculation of celestial mysteries.  You may very well remember how my\nfather Gargantua (whom here for honour sake I name) hath often told us that\nthe writings of abstinent, abstemious, and long-fasting hermits were every\nwhit as saltless, dry, jejune, and insipid as were their bodies when they\ndid compose them.  It is a most difficult thing for the spirits to be in a\ngood plight, serene and lively, when there is nothing in the body but a\nkind of voidness and inanity; seeing the philosophers with the physicians\njointly affirm that the spirits which are styled animal spring from, and\nhave their constant practice in and through the arterial blood, refined and\npurified to the life within the admirable net which, wonderfully framed,\nlieth under the ventricles and tunnels of the brain.  He gave us also the\nexample of the philosopher who, when he thought most seriously to have\nwithdrawn himself unto a solitary privacy, far from the rustling\nclutterments of the tumultuous and confused world, the better to improve\nhis theory, to contrive, comment, and ratiocinate, was, notwithstanding his\nuttermost endeavours to free himself from all untoward noises, surrounded\nand environed about so with the barking of curs, bawling of mastiffs,\nbleating of sheep, prating of parrots, tattling of jackdaws, grunting of\nswine, girning of boars, yelping of foxes, mewing of cats, cheeping of\nmice, squeaking of weasels, croaking of frogs, crowing of cocks, cackling\nof hens, calling of partridges, chanting of swans, chattering of jays,\npeeping of chickens, singing of larks, creaking of geese, chirping of\nswallows, clucking of moorfowls, cucking of cuckoos, bumbling of bees,\nrammage of hawks, chirming of linnets, croaking of ravens, screeching of\nowls, whicking of pigs, gushing of hogs, curring of pigeons, grumbling of\ncushat-doves, howling of panthers, curkling of quails, chirping of\nsparrows, crackling of crows, nuzzing of camels, wheening of whelps,\nbuzzing of dromedaries, mumbling of rabbits, cricking of ferrets, humming\nof wasps, mioling of tigers, bruzzing of bears, sussing of kitlings,\nclamouring of scarfs, whimpering of fulmarts, booing of buffaloes, warbling\nof nightingales, quavering of mavises, drintling of turkeys, coniating of\nstorks, frantling of peacocks, clattering of magpies, murmuring of\nstock-doves, crouting of cormorants, cigling of locusts, charming of\nbeagles, guarring of puppies, snarling of messens, rantling of rats,\nguerieting of apes, snuttering of monkeys, pioling of pelicans, quacking of\nducks, yelling of wolves, roaring of lions, neighing of horses, crying of\nelephants, hissing of serpents, and wailing of turtles, that he was much\nmore troubled than if he had been in the middle of the crowd at the fair of\nFontenay or Niort.  Just so is it with those who are tormented with the\ngrievous pangs of hunger.  The stomach begins to gnaw, and bark, as it were,\nthe eyes to look dim, and the veins, by greedily sucking some refection to\nthemselves from the proper substance of all the members of a fleshy\nconsistence, violently pull down and draw back that vagrant, roaming spirit,\ncareless and neglecting of his nurse and natural host, which is the body; as\nwhen a hawk upon the fist, willing to take her flight by a soaring aloft in\nthe open spacious air, is on a sudden drawn back by a leash tied to her\nfeet.\n\nTo this purpose also did he allege unto us the authority of Homer, the\nfather of all philosophy, who said that the Grecians did not put an end to\ntheir mournful mood for the death of Patroclus, the most intimate friend of\nAchilles, till hunger in a rage declared herself, and their bellies\nprotested to furnish no more tears unto their grief.  For from bodies\nemptied and macerated by long fasting there could not be such supply of\nmoisture and brackish drops as might be proper on that occasion.\n\nMediocrity at all times is commendable; nor in this case are you to abandon\nit.  You may take a little supper, but thereat must you not eat of a hare,\nnor of any other flesh.  You are likewise to abstain from beans, from the\npreak, by some called the polyp, as also from coleworts, cabbage, and all\nother such like windy victuals, which may endanger the troubling of your\nbrains and the dimming or casting a kind of mist over your animal spirits.\nFor, as a looking-glass cannot exhibit the semblance or representation of\nthe object set before it, and exposed to have its image to the life\nexpressed, if that the polished sleekedness thereof be darkened by gross\nbreathings, dampish vapours, and foggy, thick, infectious exhalations, even\nso the fancy cannot well receive the impression of the likeness of those\nthings which divination doth afford by dreams, if any way the body be\nannoyed or troubled with the fumish steam of meat which it had taken in a\nwhile before; because betwixt these two there still hath been a mutual\nsympathy and fellow-feeling of an indissolubly knit affection.  You shall\neat good Eusebian and Bergamot pears, one apple of the short-shank pippin\nkind, a parcel of the little plums of Tours, and some few cherries of the\ngrowth of my orchard.  Nor shall you need to fear that thereupon will ensue\ndoubtful dreams, fallacious, uncertain, and not to be trusted to, as by\nsome peripatetic philosophers hath been related; for that, say they, men do\nmore copiously in the season of harvest feed on fruitages than at any other\ntime.  The same is mystically taught us by the ancient prophets and poets,\nwho allege that all vain and deceitful dreams lie hid and in covert under\nthe leaves which are spread on the ground--by reason that the leaves fall\nfrom the trees in the autumnal quarter.  For the natural fervour which,\nabounding in ripe, fresh, recent fruits, cometh by the quickness of its\nebullition to be with ease evaporated into the animal parts of the dreaming\nperson--the experiment is obvious in most--is a pretty while before it be\nexpired, dissolved, and evanished.  As for your drink, you are to have it\nof the fair, pure water of my fountain.\n\nThe condition, quoth Panurge, is very hard.  Nevertheless, cost what price\nit will, or whatsoever come of it, I heartily condescend thereto;\nprotesting that I shall to-morrow break my fast betimes after my somniatory\nexercitations.  Furthermore, I recommend myself to Homer's two gates, to\nMorpheus, to Iselon, to Phantasus, and unto Phobetor.  If they in this my\ngreat need succour me and grant me that assistance which is fitting, I will\nin honour of them all erect a jolly, genteel altar, composed of the softest\ndown.  If I were now in Laconia, in the temple of Juno, betwixt Oetile and\nThalamis, she suddenly would disentangle my perplexity, resolve me of my\ndoubts, and cheer me up with fair and jovial dreams in a deep sleep.\n\nThen did he say thus unto Pantagruel:  Sir, were it not expedient for my\npurpose to put a branch or two of curious laurel betwixt the quilt and\nbolster of my bed, under the pillow on which my head must lean?  There is\nno need at all of that, quoth Pantagruel; for, besides that it is a thing\nvery superstitious, the cheat thereof hath been at large discovered unto us\nin the writings of Serapion, Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Artemon,\nand Fulgentius Planciades.  I could say as much to you of the left shoulder\nof a crocodile, as also of a chameleon, without prejudice be it spoken to\nthe credit which is due to the opinion of old Democritus; and likewise of\nthe stone of the Bactrians, called Eumetrides, and of the Ammonian horn;\nfor so by the Aethiopians is termed a certain precious stone, coloured like\ngold, and in the fashion, shape, form, and proportion of a ram's horn, as\nthe horn of Jupiter Ammon is reported to have been:  they over and above\nassuredly affirming that the dreams of those who carry it about them are no\nless veritable and infallible than the truth of the divine oracles.  Nor is\nthis much unlike to what Homer and Virgil wrote of these two gates of\nsleep, to which you have been pleased to recommend the management of what\nyou have in hand.  The one is of ivory, which letteth in confused,\ndoubtful, and uncertain dreams; for through ivory, how small and slender\nsoever it be, we can see nothing, the density, opacity, and close\ncompactedness of its material parts hindering the penetration of the visual\nrays and the reception of the specieses of such things as are visible.  The\nother is of horn, at which an entry is made to sure and certain dreams,\neven as through horn, by reason of the diaphanous splendour and bright\ntransparency thereof, the species of all objects of the sight distinctly\npass, and so without confusion appear, that they are clearly seen.  Your\nmeaning is, and you would thereby infer, quoth Friar John, that the dreams\nof all horned cuckolds, of which number Panurge, by the help of God and his\nfuture wife, is without controversy to be one, are always true and\ninfallible.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XIV.\n\nPanurge's dream, with the interpretation thereof.\n\nAt seven o'clock of the next following morning Panurge did not fail to\npresent himself before Pantagruel, in whose chamber were at that time\nEpistemon, Friar John of the Funnels, Ponocrates, Eudemon, Carpalin, and\nothers, to whom, at the entry of Panurge, Pantagruel said, Lo! here cometh\nour dreamer.  That word, quoth Epistemon, in ancient times cost very much,\nand was dearly sold to the children of Jacob.  Then said Panurge, I have\nbeen plunged into my dumps so deeply, as if I had been lodged with Gaffer\nNoddy-cap.  Dreamed indeed I have, and that right lustily; but I could take\nalong with me no more thereof that I did goodly understand save only that I\nin my vision had a pretty, fair, young, gallant, handsome woman, who no\nless lovingly and kindly treated and entertained me, hugged, cherished,\ncockered, dandled, and made much of me, as if I had been another neat\ndilly-darling minion, like Adonis.  Never was man more glad than I was\nthen; my joy at that time was incomparable.  She flattered me, tickled me,\nstroked me, groped me, frizzled me, curled me, kissed me, embraced me, laid\nher hands about my neck, and now and then made jestingly pretty little\nhorns above my forehead.  I told her in the like disport, as I did play the\nfool with her, that she should rather place and fix them in a little below\nmine eyes, that I might see the better what I should stick at with them;\nfor, being so situated, Momus then would find no fault therewith, as he did\nonce with the position of the horns of bulls.  The wanton, toying girl,\nnotwithstanding any remonstrance of mine to the contrary, did always drive\nand thrust them further in; yet thereby, which to me seemed wonderful, she\ndid not do me any hurt at all.  A little after, though I know not how, I\nthought I was transformed into a tabor, and she into a chough.\n\nMy sleeping there being interrupted, I awaked in a start, angry,\ndispleased, perplexed, chafing, and very wroth.  There have you a large\nplatterful of dreams, make thereupon good cheer, and, if you please, spare\nnot to interpret them according to the understanding which you may have in\nthem.  Come, Carpalin, let us to breakfast.  To my sense and meaning, quoth\nPantagruel, if I have skill or knowledge in the art of divination by\ndreams, your wife will not really, and to the outward appearance of the\nworld, plant or set horns, and stick them fast in your forehead, after a\nvisible manner, as satyrs use to wear and carry them; but she will be so\nfar from preserving herself loyal in the discharge and observance of a\nconjugal duty, that, on the contrary, she will violate her plighted faith,\nbreak her marriage-oath, infringe all matrimonial ties, prostitute her body\nto the dalliance of other men, and so make you a cuckold.  This point is\nclearly and manifestly explained and expounded by Artemidorus just as I\nhave related it.  Nor will there be any metamorphosis or transmutation made\nof you into a drum or tabor, but you will surely be as soundly beaten as\never was tabor at a merry wedding.  Nor yet will she be changed into a\nchough, but will steal from you, chiefly in the night, as is the nature of\nthat thievish bird.  Hereby may you perceive your dreams to be in every jot\nconform and agreeable to the Virgilian lots.  A cuckold you will be, beaten\nand robbed.  Then cried out Father John with a loud voice, He tells the\ntruth; upon my conscience, thou wilt be a cuckold--an honest one, I warrant\nthee.  O the brave horns that will be borne by thee!  Ha, ha, ha!  Our good\nMaster de Cornibus.  God save thee, and shield thee!  Wilt thou be pleased\nto preach but two words of a sermon to us, and I will go through the parish\nchurch to gather up alms for the poor.\n\nYou are, quoth Panurge, very far mistaken in your interpretation; for the\nmatter is quite contrary to your sense thereof.  My dream presageth that I\nshall by marriage be stored with plenty of all manner of goods--the\nhornifying of me showing that I will possess a cornucopia, that Amalthaean\nhorn which is called the horn of abundance, whereof the fruition did still\nportend the wealth of the enjoyer.  You possibly will say that they are\nrather like to be satyr's horns; for you of these did make some mention.\nAmen, Amen, Fiat, fiatur, ad differentiam papae.  Thus shall I have my\ntouch-her-home still ready.  My staff of love, sempiternally in a good\ncase, will, satyr-like, be never toiled out--a thing which all men wish\nfor, and send up their prayers to that purpose, but such a thing as\nnevertheless is granted but to a few.  Hence doth it follow by a\nconsequence as clear as the sunbeams that I will never be in the danger of\nbeing made a cuckold, for the defect hereof is Causa sine qua non; yea, the\nsole cause, as many think, of making husbands cuckolds.  What makes poor\nscoundrel rogues to beg, I pray you?  Is it not because they have not\nenough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?  What is it\nmakes the wolves to leave the woods?  Is it not the want of flesh meat?\nWhat maketh women whores?  You understand me well enough.  And herein may I\nvery well submit my opinion to the judgment of learned lawyers, presidents,\ncounsellors, advocates, procurers, attorneys, and other glossers and\ncommentators on the venerable rubric, De frigidis et maleficiatis.  You\nare, in truth, sir, as it seems to me (excuse my boldness if I have\ntransgressed), in a most palpable and absurd error to attribute my horns to\ncuckoldry.  Diana wears them on her head after the manner of a crescent.\nIs she a cucquean for that?  How the devil can she be cuckolded who never\nyet was married?  Speak somewhat more correctly, I beseech you, lest she,\nbeing offended, furnish you with a pair of horns shapen by the pattern of\nthose which she made for Actaeon.  The goodly Bacchus also carries horns,\n--Pan, Jupiter Ammon, with a great many others.  Are they all cuckolds?  If\nJove be a cuckold, Juno is a whore.  This follows by the figure metalepsis:\nas to call a child, in the presence of his father and mother, a bastard, or\nwhore's son, is tacitly and underboard no less than if he had said openly\nthe father is a cuckold and his wife a punk.  Let our discourse come nearer\nto the purpose.  The horns that my wife did make me are horns of abundance,\nplanted and grafted in my head for the increase and shooting up of all good\nthings.  This will I affirm for truth, upon my word, and pawn my faith and\ncredit both upon it.  As for the rest, I will be no less joyful, frolic,\nglad, cheerful, merry, jolly, and gamesome, than a well-bended tabor in the\nhands of a good drummer at a nuptial feast, still making a noise, still\nrolling, still buzzing and cracking.  Believe me, sir, in that consisteth\nnone of my least good fortunes.  And my wife will be jocund, feat, compt,\nneat, quaint, dainty, trim, tricked up, brisk, smirk, and smug, even as a\npretty little Cornish chough.  Who will not believe this, let hell or the\ngallows be the burden of his Christmas carol.\n\nI remark, quoth Pantagruel, the last point or particle which you did speak\nof, and, having seriously conferred it with the first, find that at the\nbeginning you were delighted with the sweetness of your dream; but in the\nend and final closure of it you startingly awaked, and on a sudden were\nforthwith vexed in choler and annoyed.  Yea, quoth Panurge, the reason of\nthat was because I had fasted too long.  Flatter not yourself, quoth\nPantagruel; all will go to ruin.  Know for a certain truth, that every\nsleep that endeth with a starting, and leaves the person irksome, grieved,\nand fretting, doth either signify a present evil, or otherwise presageth\nand portendeth a future imminent mishap.  To signify an evil, that is to\nsay, to show some sickness hardly curable, a kind of pestilentious or\nmalignant boil, botch, or sore, lying and lurking hid, occult, and latent\nwithin the very centre of the body, which many times doth by the means of\nsleep, whose nature is to reinforce and strengthen the faculty and virtue\nof concoction, being according to the theorems of physic to declare itself,\nand moves toward the outward superficies.  At this sad stirring is the\nsleeper's rest and ease disturbed and broken, whereof the first feeling and\nstinging smart admonisheth that he must patiently endure great pain and\ntrouble, and thereunto provide some remedy; as when we say proverbially, to\nincense hornets, to move a stinking puddle, and to awake a sleeping lion,\ninstead of these more usual expressions, and of a more familiar and plain\nmeaning, to provoke angry persons, to make a thing the worse by meddling\nwith it, and to irritate a testy choleric man when he is at quiet.  On the\nother part, to presage or foretell an evil, especially in what concerneth\nthe exploits of the soul in matter of somnial divinations, is as much to\nsay as that it giveth us to understand that some dismal fortune or\nmischance is destinated and prepared for us, which shortly will not fail to\ncome to pass.  A clear and evident example hereof is to be found in the\ndream and dreadful awaking of Hecuba, as likewise in that of Eurydice, the\nwife of Orpheus, neither of which was (no) sooner finished, saith Ennius,\nbut that incontinently thereafter they awaked in a start, and were\naffrighted horribly.  Thereupon these accidents ensued:  Hecuba had her\nhusband Priamus, together with her children, slain before her eyes, and saw\nthen the destruction of her country; and Eurydice died speedily thereafter\nin a most miserable manner.  Aeneas, dreaming that he spoke to Hector a\nlittle after his decease, did on a sudden in a great start awake, and was\nafraid.  Now hereupon did follow this event:  Troy that same night was\nspoiled, sacked, and burnt.  At another time the same Aeneas dreaming that\nhe saw his familiar geniuses and penates, in a ghastly fright and\nastonishment awaked, of which terror and amazement the issue was, that the\nvery next day subsequent, by a most horrible tempest on the sea, he was\nlike to have perished and been cast away.  Moreover, Turnus being prompted,\ninstigated, and stirred up by the fantastic vision of an infernal fury to\nenter into a bloody war against Aeneas, awaked in a start much troubled and\ndisquieted in spirit; in sequel whereof, after many notable and famous\nrouts, defeats, and discomfitures in open field, he came at last to be\nkilled in a single combat by the said Aeneas.  A thousand other instances I\ncould afford, if it were needful, of this matter.  Whilst I relate these\nstories of Aeneas, remark the saying of Fabius Pictor, who faithfully\naverred that nothing had at any time befallen unto, was done, or\nenterprised by him, whereof he preallably had not notice, and beforehand\nforeseen it to the full, by sure predictions altogether founded on the\noracles of somnial divination.  To this there is no want of pregnant\nreasons, no more than of examples.  For if repose and rest in sleeping be a\nspecial gift and favour of the gods, as is maintained by the philosophers,\nand by the poet attested in these lines,\n\n  Then sleep, that heavenly gift, came to refresh\n  Of human labourers the wearied flesh;\n\nsuch a gift or benefit can never finish or terminate in wrath and\nindignation without portending some unlucky fate and most disastrous\nfortune to ensue.  Otherwise it were a molestation, and not an ease; a\nscourge, and not a gift; at least, (not) proceeding from the gods above,\nbut from the infernal devils our enemies, according to the common vulgar\nsaying.\n\nSuppose the lord, father, or master of a family, sitting at a very\nsumptuous dinner, furnished with all manner of good cheer, and having at\nhis entry to the table his appetite sharp set upon his victuals, whereof\nthere was great plenty, should be seen rise in a start, and on a sudden\nfling out of his chair, abandoning his meat, frighted, appalled, and in a\nhorrid terror, who should not know the cause hereof would wonder, and be\nastonished exceedingly.  But what? he heard his male servants cry, Fire,\nfire, fire, fire! his serving-maids and women yell, Stop thief, stop thief!\nand all his children shout as loud as ever they could, Murder, O murder,\nmurder!  Then was it not high time for him to leave his banqueting, for\napplication of a remedy in haste, and to give speedy order for succouring\nof his distressed household?  Truly I remember that the Cabalists and\nMassorets, interpreters of the sacred Scriptures, in treating how with\nverity one might judge of evangelical apparitions (because oftentimes the\nangel of Satan is disguised and transfigured into an angel of light), said\nthat the difference of these two mainly did consist in this:  the\nfavourable and comforting angel useth in his appearing unto man at first to\nterrify and hugely affright him, but in the end he bringeth consolation,\nleaveth the person who hath seen him joyful, well-pleased, fully content,\nand satisfied; on the other side, the angel of perdition, that wicked,\ndevilish, and malignant spirit, at his appearance unto any person in the\nbeginning cheereth up the heart of his beholder, but at last forsakes him,\nand leaves him troubled, angry, and perplexed.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XV.\n\nPanurge's excuse and exposition of the monastic mystery concerning powdered\nbeef.\n\nThe Lord save those who see, and do not hear! quoth Panurge.  I see you\nwell enough, but know not what it is that you have said.  The\nhunger-starved belly wanteth ears.  For lack of victuals, before God, I\nroar, bray, yell, and fume as in a furious madness.  I have performed too\nhard a task to-day, an extraordinary work indeed.  He shall be craftier, and\ndo far greater wonders than ever did Mr. Mush, who shall be able any more\nthis year to bring me on the stage of preparation for a dreaming verdict.\nFie! not to sup at all, that is the devil.  Pox take that fashion!  Come,\nFriar John, let us go break our fast; for, if I hit on such a round\nrefection in the morning as will serve thoroughly to fill the mill-hopper\nand hogs-hide of my stomach, and furnish it with meat and drink sufficient,\nthen at a pinch, as in the case of some extreme necessity which presseth, I\ncould make a shift that day to forbear dining.  But not to sup!  A plague\nrot that base custom, which is an error offensive to Nature!  That lady made\nthe day for exercise, to travel, work, wait on and labour in each his\nnegotiation and employment; and that we may with the more fervency and\nardour prosecute our business, she sets before us a clear burning candle, to\nwit, the sun's resplendency; and at night, when she begins to take the light\nfrom us, she thereby tacitly implies no less than if she would have spoken\nthus unto us:  My lads and lasses, all of you are good and honest folks, you\nhave wrought well to-day, toiled and turmoiled enough,--the night\napproacheth,--therefore cast off these moiling cares of yours, desist from\nall your swinking painful labours, and set your minds how to refresh your\nbodies in the renewing of their vigour with good bread, choice wine, and\nstore of wholesome meats; then may you take some sport and recreation, and\nafter that lie down and rest yourselves, that you may strongly, nimbly,\nlustily, and with the more alacrity to-morrow attend on your affairs as\nformerly.\n\nFalconers, in like manner, when they have fed their hawks, will not suffer\nthem to fly on a full gorge, but let them on a perch abide a little, that\nthey may rouse, bait, tower, and soar the better.  That good pope who was\nthe first institutor of fasting understood this well enough; for he\nordained that our fast should reach but to the hour of noon; all the\nremainder of that day was at our disposure, freely to eat and feed at any\ntime thereof.  In ancient times there were but few that dined, as you would\nsay, some church men, monks and canons; for they have little other\noccupation.  Each day is a festival unto them, who diligently heed the\nclaustral proverb, De missa ad mensam.  They do not use to linger and defer\ntheir sitting down and placing of themselves at table, only so long as they\nhave a mind in waiting for the coming of the abbot; so they fell to without\nceremony, terms, or conditions; and everybody supped, unless it were some\nvain, conceited, dreaming dotard.  Hence was a supper called coena, which\nshoweth that it is common to all sorts of people.  Thou knowest it well,\nFriar John.  Come, let us go, my dear friend, in the name of all the devils\nof the infernal regions, let us go.  The gnawings of my stomach in this\nrage of hunger are so tearing, that they make it bark like a mastiff.  Let\nus throw some bread and beef into his throat to pacify him, as once the\nsibyl did to Cerberus.  Thou likest best monastical brewis, the prime, the\nflower of the pot.  I am for the solid, principal verb that comes after\n--the good brown loaf, always accompanied with a round slice of the\nnine-lecture-powdered labourer.  I know thy meaning, answered Friar John;\nthis metaphor is extracted out of the claustral kettle.  The labourer is the\nox that hath wrought and done the labour; after the fashion of nine\nlectures, that is to say, most exquisitely well and thoroughly boiled.\nThese holy religious fathers, by a certain cabalistic institution of the\nancients, not written, but carefully by tradition conveyed from hand to\nhand, rising betimes to go to morning prayers, were wont to flourish that\ntheir matutinal devotion with some certain notable preambles before their\nentry into the church, viz., they dunged in the dungeries, pissed in the\npisseries, spit in the spitteries, melodiously coughed in the cougheries,\nand doted in their dotaries, that to the divine service they might not bring\nanything that was unclean or foul.  These things thus done, they very\nzealously made their repair to the Holy Chapel, for so was in their canting\nlanguage termed the convent kitchen, where they with no small earnestness\nhad care that the beef-pot should be put on the crook for the breakfast of\nthe religious brothers of our Lord and Saviour; and the fire they would\nkindle under the pot themselves.  Now, the matins consisting of nine\nlessons, (it) it was so incumbent on them, that must have risen the rather\nfor the more expedite despatching of them all.  The sooner that they rose,\nthe sharper was their appetite and the barkings of their stomachs, and the\ngnawings increased in the like proportion, and consequently made these godly\nmen thrice more a-hungered and athirst than when their matins were hemmed\nover only with three lessons.  The more betimes they rose, by the said\ncabal, the sooner was the beef-pot put on; the longer that the beef was on\nthe fire, the better it was boiled; the more it boiled, it was the tenderer;\nthe tenderer that it was, the less it troubled the teeth, delighted more the\npalate, less charged the stomach, and nourished our good religious men the\nmore substantially; which is the only end and prime intention of the first\nfounders, as appears by this, that they eat not to live, but live to eat,\nand in this world have nothing but their life.  Let us go, Panurge.\n\nNow have I understood thee, quoth Panurge, my plushcod friar, my caballine\nand claustral ballock.  I freely quit the costs, interest, and charges,\nseeing you have so egregiously commented upon the most especial chapter of\nthe culinary and monastic cabal.  Come along, my Carpalin, and you, Friar\nJohn, my leather-dresser.  Good morrow to you all, my good lords; I have\ndreamed too much to have so little.  Let us go.  Panurge had no sooner done\nspeaking than Epistemon with a loud voice said these words:  It is a very\nordinary and common thing amongst men to conceive, foresee, know, and\npresage the misfortune, bad luck, or disaster of another; but to have the\nunderstanding, providence, knowledge, and prediction of a man's own mishap\nis very scarce and rare to be found anywhere.  This is exceeding\njudiciously and prudently deciphered by Aesop in his Apologues, who there\naffirmeth that every man in the world carrieth about his neck a wallet, in\nthe fore-bag whereof were contained the faults and mischances of others\nalways exposed to his view and knowledge; and in the other scrip thereof,\nwhich hangs behind, are kept the bearer's proper transgressions and\ninauspicious adventures, at no time seen by him, nor thought upon, unless\nhe be a person that hath a favourable aspect from the heavens.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XVI.\n\nHow Pantagruel adviseth Panurge to consult with the Sibyl of Panzoust.\n\nA little while thereafter Pantagruel sent for Panurge and said unto him,\nThe affection which I bear you being now inveterate and settled in my mind\nby a long continuance of time, prompteth me to the serious consideration of\nyour welfare and profit; in order whereto, remark what I have thought\nthereon.  It hath been told me that at Panzoust, near Crouly, dwelleth a\nvery famous sibyl, who is endowed with the skill of foretelling all things\nto come.  Take Epistemon in your company, repair towards her, and hear what\nshe will say unto you.  She is possibly, quoth Epistemon, some Canidia,\nSagana, or Pythonissa, either whereof with us is vulgarly called a witch,\n--I being the more easily induced to give credit to the truth of this\ncharacter of her, that the place of her abode is vilely stained with the\nabominable repute of abounding more with sorcerers and witches than ever\ndid the plains of Thessaly.  I should not, to my thinking, go thither\nwillingly, for that it seems to me a thing unwarrantable, and altogether\nforbidden in the law of Moses.  We are not Jews, quoth Pantagruel, nor is\nit a matter judiciously confessed by her, nor authentically proved by\nothers that she is a witch.  Let us for the present suspend our judgment,\nand defer till after your return from thence the sifting and garbling of\nthose niceties.  Do we know but that she may be an eleventh sibyl or a\nsecond Cassandra?  But although she were neither, and she did not merit the\nname or title of any of these renowned prophetesses, what hazard, in the\nname of God, do you run by offering to talk and confer with her of the\ninstant perplexity and perturbation of your thoughts?  Seeing especially,\nand which is most of all, she is, in the estimation of those that are\nacquainted with her, held to know more, and to be of a deeper reach of\nunderstanding, than is either customary to the country wherein she liveth\nor to the sex whereof she is.  What hindrance, hurt, or harm doth the\nlaudable desire of knowledge bring to any man, were it from a sot, a pot, a\nfool, a stool, a winter mitten, a truckle for a pulley, the lid of a\ngoldsmith's crucible, an oil-bottle, or old slipper?  You may remember to\nhave read, or heard at least, that Alexander the Great, immediately after\nhis having obtained a glorious victory over the King Darius in Arbela,\nrefused, in the presence of the splendid and illustrious courtiers that\nwere about him, to give audience to a poor certain despicable-like fellow,\nwho through the solicitations and mediation of some of his royal attendants\nwas admitted humbly to beg that grace and favour of him.  But sore did he\nrepent, although in vain, a thousand and ten thousand times thereafter, the\nsurly state which he then took upon him to the denial of so just a suit,\nthe grant whereof would have been worth unto him the value of a brace of\npotent cities.  He was indeed victorious in Persia, but withal so far\ndistant from Macedonia, his hereditary kingdom, that the joy of the one did\nnot expel the extreme grief which through occasion of the other he had\ninwardly conceived; for, not being able with all his power to find or\ninvent a convenient mean and expedient how to get or come by the certainty\nof any news from thence, both by reason of the huge remoteness of the\nplaces from one to another, as also because of the impeditive interposition\nof many great rivers, the interjacent obstacle of divers wild deserts, and\nobstructive interjection of sundry almost inaccessible mountains,--whilst\nhe was in this sad quandary and solicitous pensiveness, which, you may\nsuppose, could not be of a small vexation to him, considering that it was a\nmatter of no great difficulty to run over his whole native soil, possess\nhis country, seize on his kingdom, install a new king in the throne, and\nplant thereon foreign colonies, long before he could come to have any\nadvertisement of it:  for obviating the jeopardy of so dreadful\ninconveniency, and putting a fit remedy thereto, a certain Sidonian\nmerchant of a low stature but high fancy, very poor in show, and to the\noutward appearance of little or no account, having presented himself before\nhim, went about to affirm and declare that he had excogitated and hit upon\na ready mean and way by the which those of his territories at home should\ncome to the certain notice of his Indian victories, and himself be\nperfectly informed of the state and condition of Egypt and Macedonia within\nless than five days.  Whereupon the said Alexander, plunged into a sullen\nanimadvertency of mind, through his rash opinion of the improbability of\nperforming a so strange and impossible-like undertaking, dismissed the\nmerchant without giving ear to what he had to say, and vilified him.  What\ncould it have cost him to hearken unto what the honest man had invented and\ncontrived for his good?  What detriment, annoyance, damage, or loss could\nhe have undergone to listen to the discovery of that secret which the good\nfellow would have most willingly revealed unto him?  Nature, I am\npersuaded, did not without a cause frame our ears open, putting thereto no\ngate at all, nor shutting them up with any manner of enclosures, as she\nhath done unto the tongue, the eyes, and other such out-jetting parts of\nthe body.  The cause, as I imagine, is to the end that every day and every\nnight, and that continually, we may be ready to hear, and by a perpetual\nhearing apt to learn.  For, of all the senses, it is the fittest for the\nreception of the knowledge of arts, sciences, and disciplines; and it may\nbe that man was an angel, that is to say, a messenger sent from God, as\nRaphael was to Tobit.  Too suddenly did he contemn, despise, and misregard\nhim; but too long thereafter, by an untimely and too late repentance, did\nhe do penance for it.  You say very well, answered Epistemon, yet shall you\nnever for all that induce me to believe that it can tend any way to the\nadvantage or commodity of a man to take advice and counsel of a woman,\nnamely, of such a woman, and the woman of such a country.  Truly I have\nfound, quoth Panurge, a great deal of good in the counsel of women, chiefly\nin that of the old wives amongst them; for every time I consult with them I\nreadily get a stool or two extraordinary, to the great solace of my bumgut\npassage.  They are as sleuthhounds in the infallibility of their scent, and\nin their sayings no less sententious than the rubrics of the law.\nTherefore in my conceit it is not an improper kind of speech to call them\nsage or wise women.  In confirmation of which opinion of mine, the\ncustomary style of my language alloweth them the denomination of presage\nwomen.  The epithet of sage is due unto them because they are surpassing\ndexterous in the knowledge of most things.  And I give them the title of\npresage, for that they divinely foresee and certainly foretell future\ncontingencies and events of things to come.  Sometimes I call them not\nmaunettes, but monettes, from their wholesome monitions.  Whether it be so,\nask Pythagoras, Socrates, Empedocles, and our master Ortuinus.  I\nfurthermore praise and commend above the skies the ancient memorable\ninstitution of the pristine Germans, who ordained the responses and\ndocuments of old women to be highly extolled, most cordially reverenced,\nand prized at a rate in nothing inferior to the weight, test, and standard\nof the sanctuary.  And as they were respectfully prudent in receiving of\nthese sound advices, so by honouring and following them did they prove no\nless fortunate in the happy success of all their endeavours.  Witness the\nold wife Aurinia, and the good mother Velled, in the days of Vespasian.\nYou need not any way doubt but that feminine old age is always fructifying\nin qualities sublime--I would have said sibylline.  Let us go, by the help,\nlet us go, by the virtue of God, let us go.  Farewell, Friar John, I\nrecommend the care of my codpiece to you.  Well, quoth Epistemon, I will\nfollow you, with this protestation nevertheless, that if I happen to get a\nsure information, or otherwise find that she doth use any kind of charm or\nenchantment in her responses, it may not be imputed to me for a blame to\nleave you at the gate of her house, without accompanying you any further\nin.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XVII.\n\nHow Panurge spoke to the Sibyl of Panzoust.\n\nTheir voyage was three days journeying.  On the third whereof was shown\nunto them the house of the vaticinatress standing on the knap or top of a\nhill, under a large and spacious walnut-tree.  Without great difficulty\nthey entered into that straw-thatched cottage, scurvily built, naughtily\nmovabled, and all besmoked.  It matters not, quoth Epistemon; Heraclitus,\nthe grand Scotist and tenebrous darksome philosopher, was nothing\nastonished at his introit into such a coarse and paltry habitation; for he\ndid usually show forth unto his sectators and disciples that the gods made\nas cheerfully their residence in these mean homely mansions as in sumptuous\nmagnific palaces, replenished with all manner of delight, pomp, and\npleasure.  I withal do really believe that the dwelling-place of the so\nfamous and renowned Hecate was just such another petty cell as this is,\nwhen she made a feast therein to the valiant Theseus; and that of no other\nbetter structure was the cot or cabin of Hyreus, or Oenopion, wherein\nJupiter, Neptune, and Mercury were not ashamed, all three together, to\nharbour and sojourn a whole night, and there to take a full and hearty\nrepast; for the payment of the shot they thankfully pissed Orion.  They\nfinding the ancient woman at a corner of her own chimney, Epistemon said,\nShe is indeed a true sibyl, and the lively portrait of one represented by\nthe Grei kaminoi of Homer.  The old hag was in a pitiful bad plight and\ncondition in matter of the outward state and complexion of her body, the\nragged and tattered equipage of her person in the point of accoutrement,\nand beggarly poor provision of fare for her diet and entertainment;\nfor she was ill apparelled, worse nourished, toothless, blear-eyed,\ncrook-shouldered, snotty, her nose still dropping, and herself still\ndrooping, faint, and pithless; whilst in this woefully wretched case she was\nmaking ready for her dinner porridge of wrinkled green coleworts, with a bit\nskin of yellow bacon, mixed with a twice-before-cooked sort of waterish,\nunsavoury broth, extracted out of bare and hollow bones.  Epistemon said,\nBy the cross of a groat, we are to blame, nor shall we get from her any\nresponse at all, for we have not brought along with us the branch of gold.\nI have, quoth Panurge, provided pretty well for that, for here I have it\nwithin my bag, in the substance of a gold ring, accompanied with some fair\npieces of small money.  No sooner were these words spoken, when Panurge\ncoming up towards her, after the ceremonial performance of a profound and\nhumble salutation, presented her with six neat's tongues dried in the smoke,\na great butter-pot full of fresh cheese, a borachio furnished with good\nbeverage, and a ram's cod stored with single pence, newly coined.  At last\nhe, with a low courtesy, put on her medical finger a pretty handsome golden\nring, whereinto was right artificially enchased a precious toadstone of\nBeausse.  This done, in few words and very succinctly, did he set open and\nexpose unto her the motive reason of his coming, most civilly and\ncourteously entreating her that she might be pleased to vouchsafe to give\nhim an ample and plenary intelligence concerning the future good luck of his\nintended marriage.\n\nThe old trot for a while remained silent, pensive, and grinning like a dog;\nthen, after she had set her withered breech upon the bottom of a bushel,\nshe took into her hands three old spindles, which when she had turned and\nwhirled betwixt her fingers very diversely and after several fashions, she\npried more narrowly into, by the trial of their points, the sharpest\nwhereof she retained in her hand, and threw the other two under a stone\ntrough.  After this she took a pair of yarn windles, which she nine times\nunintermittedly veered and frisked about; then at the ninth revolution or\nturn, without touching them any more, maturely perpending the manner of\ntheir motion, she very demurely waited on their repose and cessation from\nany further stirring.  In sequel whereof she pulled off one of her wooden\npattens, put her apron over her head, as a priest uses to do his amice when\nhe is going to sing mass, and with a kind of antique, gaudy, party-coloured\nstring knit it under her neck.  Being thus covered and muffled, she whiffed\noff a lusty good draught out of the borachio, took three several pence\nforth of the ramcod fob, put them into so many walnut-shells, which she set\ndown upon the bottom of a feather-pot, and then, after she had given them\nthree whisks of a broom besom athwart the chimney, casting into the fire\nhalf a bavin of long heather, together with a branch of dry laurel, she\nobserved with a very hush and coy silence in what form they did burn, and\nsaw that, although they were in a flame, they made no kind of noise or\ncrackling din.  Hereupon she gave a most hideous and horribly dreadful\nshout, muttering betwixt her teeth some few barbarous words of a strange\ntermination.\n\nThis so terrified Panurge that he forthwith said to Epistemon, The devil\nmince me into a gallimaufry if I do not tremble for fear!  I do not think\nbut that I am now enchanted; for she uttereth not her voice in the terms of\nany Christian language.  O look, I pray you, how she seemeth unto me to be\nby three full spans higher than she was when she began to hood herself with\nher apron.  What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?  What\ncan be the signification of the uneven shrugging of her hulchy shoulders?\nTo what end doth she quaver with her lips, like a monkey in the\ndismembering of a lobster?  My ears through horror glow; ah! how they\ntingle!  I think I hear the shrieking of Proserpina; the devils are\nbreaking loose to be all here.  O the foul, ugly, and deformed beasts!  Let\nus run away!  By the hook of God, I am like to die for fear!  I do not love\nthe devils; they vex me, and are unpleasant fellows.  Now let us fly, and\nbetake us to our heels.  Farewell, gammer; thanks and gramercy for your\ngoods!  I will not marry; no, believe me, I will not.  I fairly quit my\ninterest therein, and totally abandon and renounce it from this time\nforward, even as much as at present.  With this, as he endeavoured to make\nan escape out of the room, the old crone did anticipate his flight and make\nhim stop.  The way how she prevented him was this:  whilst in her hand she\nheld the spindle, she flung out to a back-yard close by her lodge, where,\nafter she had peeled off the barks of an old sycamore three several times,\nshe very summarily, upon eight leaves which dropped from thence, wrote with\nthe spindle-point some curt and briefly-couched verses, which she threw\ninto the air, then said unto them, Search after them if you will; find them\nif you can; the fatal destinies of your marriage are written in them.\n\nNo sooner had she done thus speaking than she did withdraw herself unto her\nlurking-hole, where on the upper seat of the porch she tucked up her gown,\nher coats, and smock, as high as her armpits, and gave them a full\ninspection of the nockandroe; which being perceived by Panurge, he said to\nEpistemon, God's bodikins, I see the sibyl's hole!  She suddenly then\nbolted the gate behind her, and was never since seen any more.  They\njointly ran in haste after the fallen and dispersed leaves, and gathered\nthem at last, though not without great labour and toil, for the wind had\nscattered them amongst the thorn-bushes of the valley.  When they had\nranged them each after other in their due places, they found out their\nsentence, as it is metrified in this octastich:\n\n  Thy fame upheld\n  (Properly, as corrected by Ozell:\n  Thy fame will be shell'd\n    By her, I trow.),\n    Even so, so:\n  And she with child\n    Of thee:  No.\n  Thy good end\n    Suck she shall,\n  And flay thee, friend,\n    But not all.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XVIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel and Panurge did diversely expound the verses of the Sibyl of\nPanzoust.\n\nThe leaves being thus collected and orderly disposed, Epistemon and Panurge\nreturned to Pantagruel's court, partly well pleased and other part\ndiscontented; glad for their being come back, and vexed for the trouble\nthey had sustained by the way, which they found to be craggy, rugged,\nstony, rough, and ill-adjusted.  They made an ample and full relation of\ntheir voyage unto Pantagruel, as likewise of the estate and condition of\nthe sibyl.  Then, having presented to him the leaves of the sycamore, they\nshow him the short and twattle verses that were written in them.\nPantagruel, having read and considered the whole sum and substance of the\nmatter, fetched from his heart a deep and heavy sigh; then said to Panurge,\nYou are now, forsooth, in a good taking, and have brought your hogs to a\nfine market.  The prophecy of the sibyl doth explain and lay out before us\nthe same very predictions which have been denoted, foretold, and presaged\nto us by the decree of the Virgilian lots and the verdict of your own\nproper dreams, to wit, that you shall be very much disgraced, shamed, and\ndiscredited by your wife; for that she will make you a cuckold in\nprostituting herself to others, being big with child by another than you,\n--will steal from you a great deal of your goods, and will beat you, scratch\nand bruise you, even to plucking the skin in a part from off you,--will\nleave the print of her blows in some member of your body.  You understand\nas much, answered Panurge, in the veritable interpretation and expounding\nof recent prophecies as a sow in the matter of spicery.  Be not offended,\nsir, I beseech you, that I speak thus boldly; for I find myself a little in\ncholer, and that not without cause, seeing it is the contrary that is true.\nTake heed, and give attentive ear unto my words.  The old wife said that,\nas the bean is not seen till first it be unhusked, and that its swad or\nhull be shelled and peeled from off it, so is it that my virtue and\ntranscendent worth will never come by the mouth of fame to be blazed abroad\nproportionable to the height, extent, and measure of the excellency\nthereof, until preallably I get a wife and make the full half of a married\ncouple.  How many times have I heard you say that the function of a\nmagistrate, or office of dignity, discovereth the merits, parts, and\nendowments of the person so advanced and promoted, and what is in him.\nThat is to say, we are then best able to judge aright of the deservings of\na man when he is called to the management of affairs; for when before he\nlived in a private condition, we could have no more certain knowledge of\nhim than of a bean within his husk.  And thus stands the first article\nexplained; otherwise, could you imagine that the good fame, repute, and\nestimation of an honest man should depend upon the tail of a whore?\n\nNow to the meaning of the second article!  My wife will be with child,\n--here lies the prime felicity of marriage,--but not of me.  Copsody, that I\ndo believe indeed!  It will be of a pretty little infant.  O how heartily I\nshall love it!  I do already dote upon it; for it will be my dainty feedle-\ndarling, my genteel dilly-minion.  From thenceforth no vexation, care, or\ngrief shall take such deep impression in my heart, how hugely great or\nvehement soever it otherwise appear, but that it shall evanish forthwith at\nthe sight of that my future babe, and at the hearing of the chat and\nprating of its childish gibberish.  And blessed be the old wife.  By my\ntruly, I have a mind to settle some good revenue or pension upon her out of\nthe readiest increase of the lands of my Salmigondinois; not an inconstant\nand uncertain rent-seek, like that of witless, giddy-headed bachelors, but\nsure and fixed, of the nature of the well-paid incomes of regenting\ndoctors.  If this interpretation doth not please you, think you my wife\nwill bear me in her flanks, conceive with me, and be of me delivered, as\nwomen use in childbed to bring forth their young ones; so as that it may be\nsaid, Panurge is a second Bacchus, he hath been twice born; he is re-born,\nas was Hippolytus,--as was Proteus, one time of Thetis, and secondly, of\nthe mother of the philosopher Apollonius,--as were the two Palici, near the\nflood Simaethos in Sicily.  His wife was big of child with him.  In him is\nrenewed and begun again the palintocy of the Megarians and the palingenesy\nof Democritus.  Fie upon such errors!  To hear stuff of that nature rends\nmine ears.\n\nThe words of the third article are:  She will suck me at my best end.  Why\nnot?  That pleaseth me right well.  You know the thing; I need not tell you\nthat it is my intercrural pudding with one end.  I swear and promise that,\nin what I can, I will preserve it sappy, full of juice, and as well\nvictualled for her use as may be.  She shall not suck me, I believe, in\nvain, nor be destitute of her allowance; there shall her justum both in\npeck and lippy be furnished to the full eternally.  You expound this\npassage allegorically, and interpret it to theft and larceny.  I love the\nexposition, and the allegory pleaseth me; but not according to the sense\nwhereto you stretch it.  It may be that the sincerity of the affection\nwhich you bear me moveth you to harbour in your breast those refractory\nthoughts concerning me, with a suspicion of my adversity to come.  We have\nthis saying from the learned, That a marvellously fearful thing is love,\nand that true love is never without fear.  But, sir, according to my\njudgment, you do understand both of and by yourself that here stealth\nsignifieth nothing else, no more than in a thousand other places of Greek\nand Latin, old and modern writings, but the sweet fruits of amorous\ndalliance, which Venus liketh best when reaped in secret, and culled by\nfervent lovers filchingly.  Why so, I prithee tell?  Because, when the feat\nof the loose-coat skirmish happeneth to be done underhand and privily,\nbetween two well-disposed, athwart the steps of a pair of stairs lurkingly,\nand in covert behind a suit of hangings, or close hid and trussed upon an\nunbound faggot, it is more pleasing to the Cyprian goddess, and to me also\n--I speak this without prejudice to any better or more sound opinion--than\nto perform that culbusting art after the Cynic manner, in the view of the\nclear sunshine, or in a rich tent, under a precious stately canopy, within\na glorious and sublime pavilion, or yet on a soft couch betwixt rich\ncurtains of cloth of gold, without affrightment, at long intermediate\nrespites, enjoying of pleasures and delights a bellyfull, at all great\nease, with a huge fly-flap fan of crimson satin and a bunch of feathers of\nsome East-Indian ostrich serving to give chase unto the flies all round\nabout; whilst, in the interim, the female picks her teeth with a stiff\nstraw picked even then from out of the bottom of the bed she lies on.  If\nyou be not content with this my exposition, are you of the mind that my\nwife will suck and sup me up as people use to gulp and swallow oysters out\nof the shell? or as the Cilician women, according to the testimony of\nDioscorides, were wont to do the grain of alkermes?  Assuredly that is an\nerror.  Who seizeth on it, doth neither gulch up nor swill down, but takes\naway what hath been packed up, catcheth, snatcheth, and plies the play of\nhey-pass, repass.\n\nThe fourth article doth imply that my wife will flay me, but not all.  O\nthe fine word!  You interpret this to beating strokes and blows.  Speak\nwisely.  Will you eat a pudding?  Sir, I beseech you to raise up your\nspirits above the low-sized pitch of earthly thoughts unto that height of\nsublime contemplation which reacheth to the apprehension of the mysteries\nand wonders of Dame Nature.  And here be pleased to condemn yourself, by a\nrenouncing of those errors which you have committed very grossly and\nsomewhat perversely in expounding the prophetic sayings of the holy sibyl.\nYet put the case (albeit I yield not to it) that, by the instigation of the\ndevil, my wife should go about to wrong me, make me a cuckold downwards to\nthe very breech, disgrace me otherwise, steal my goods from me, yea, and\nlay violently her hands upon me;--she nevertheless should fail of her\nattempts and not attain to the proposed end of her unreasonable\nundertakings.  The reason which induceth me hereto is grounded totally on\nthis last point, which is extracted from the profoundest privacies of a\nmonastic pantheology, as good Friar Arthur Wagtail told me once upon a\nMonday morning, as we were (if I have not forgot) eating a bushel of\ntrotter-pies; and I remember well it rained hard.  God give him the good\nmorrow!  The women at the beginning of the world, or a little after,\nconspired to flay the men quick, because they found the spirit of mankind\ninclined to domineer it, and bear rule over them upon the face of the whole\nearth; and, in pursuit of this their resolution, promised, confirmed,\nswore, and covenanted amongst them all, by the pure faith they owe to the\nnocturnal Sanct Rogero.  But O the vain enterprises of women!  O the great\nfragility of that sex feminine!  They did begin to flay the man, or peel\nhim (as says Catullus), at that member which of all the body they loved\nbest, to wit, the nervous and cavernous cane, and that above five thousand\nyears ago; yet have they not of that small part alone flayed any more till\nthis hour but the head.  In mere despite whereof the Jews snip off that\nparcel of the skin in circumcision, choosing far rather to be called\nclipyards, rascals, than to be flayed by women, as are other nations.  My\nwife, according to this female covenant, will flay it to me, if it be not\nso already.  I heartily grant my consent thereto, but will not give her\nleave to flay it all.  Nay, truly will I not, my noble king.\n\nYea but, quoth Epistemon, you say nothing of her most dreadful cries and\nexclamations when she and we both saw the laurel-bough burn without\nyielding any noise or crackling.  You know it is a very dismal omen, an\ninauspicious sign, unlucky indice, and token formidable, bad, disastrous,\nand most unhappy, as is certified by Propertius, Tibullus, the quick\nphilosopher Porphyrius, Eustathius on the Iliads of Homer, and by many\nothers.  Verily, verily, quoth Panurge, brave are the allegations which you\nbring me, and testimonies of two-footed calves.  These men were fools, as\nthey were poets; and dotards, as they were philosophers; full of folly, as\nthey were of philosophy.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel praiseth the counsel of dumb men.\n\nPantagruel, when this discourse was ended, held for a pretty while his\npeace, seeming to be exceeding sad and pensive, then said to Panurge, The\nmalignant spirit misleads, beguileth, and seduceth you.  I have read that\nin times past the surest and most veritable oracles were not those which\neither were delivered in writing or uttered by word of mouth in speaking.\nFor many times, in their interpretation, right witty, learned, and\ningenious men have been deceived through amphibologies, equivoques, and\nobscurity of words, no less than by the brevity of their sentences.  For\nwhich cause Apollo, the god of vaticination, was surnamed Loxias.  Those\nwhich were represented then by signs and outward gestures were accounted\nthe truest and the most infallible.  Such was the opinion of Heraclitus.\nAnd Jupiter did himself in this manner give forth in Ammon frequently\npredictions.  Nor was he single in this practice; for Apollo did the like\namongst the Assyrians.  His prophesying thus unto those people moved them\nto paint him with a large long beard, and clothes beseeming an old settled\nperson of a most posed, staid, and grave behaviour; not naked, young, and\nbeardless, as he was portrayed most usually amongst the Grecians.  Let us\nmake trial of this kind of fatidicency; and go you take advice of some dumb\nperson without any speaking.  I am content, quoth Panurge.  But, says\nPantagruel, it were requisite that the dumb you consult with be such as\nhave been deaf from the hour of their nativity, and consequently dumb; for\nnone can be so lively, natural, and kindly dumb as he who never heard.\n\nHow is it, quoth Panurge, that you conceive this matter?  If you apprehend\nit so, that never any spoke who had not before heard the speech of others,\nI will from that antecedent bring you to infer very logically a most absurd\nand paradoxical conclusion.  But let it pass; I will not insist on it.  You\ndo not then believe what Herodotus wrote of two children, who, at the\nspecial command and appointment of Psammeticus, King of Egypt, having been\nkept in a petty country cottage, where they were nourished and entertained\nin a perpetual silence, did at last, after a certain long space of time,\npronounce this word Bec, which in the Phrygian language signifieth bread.\nNothing less, quoth Pantagruel, do I believe than that it is a mere abusing\nof our understandings to give credit to the words of those who say that\nthere is any such thing as a natural language.  All speeches have had their\nprimary origin from the arbitrary institutions, accords, and agreements of\nnations in their respective condescendments to what should be noted and\nbetokened by them.  An articulate voice, according to the dialecticians,\nhath naturally no signification at all; for that the sense and meaning\nthereof did totally depend upon the good will and pleasure of the first\ndeviser and imposer of it.  I do not tell you this without a cause; for\nBartholus, Lib. 5. de Verb. Oblig., very seriously reporteth that even in\nhis time there was in Eugubia one named Sir Nello de Gabrielis, who,\nalthough he by a sad mischance became altogether deaf, understood\nnevertheless everyone that talked in the Italian dialect howsoever he\nexpressed himself; and that only by looking on his external gestures, and\ncasting an attentive eye upon the divers motions of his lips and chaps.  I\nhave read, I remember also, in a very literate and eloquent author, that\nTyridates, King of Armenia, in the days of Nero, made a voyage to Rome,\nwhere he was received with great honour and solemnity, and with all manner\nof pomp and magnificence.  Yea, to the end there might be a sempiternal\namity and correspondence preserved betwixt him and the Roman senate, there\nwas no remarkable thing in the whole city which was not shown unto him.  At\nhis departure the emperor bestowed upon him many ample donatives of an\ninestimable value; and besides, the more entirely to testify his affection\ntowards him, heartily entreated him to be pleased to make choice of any\nwhatsoever thing in Rome was most agreeable to his fancy, with a promise\njuramentally confirmed that he should not be refused of his demand.\nThereupon, after a suitable return of thanks for a so gracious offer, he\nrequired a certain Jack-pudding whom he had seen to act his part most\negregiously upon the stage, and whose meaning, albeit he knew not what it\nwas he had spoken, he understood perfectly enough by the signs and\ngesticulations which he had made.  And for this suit of his, in that he\nasked nothing else, he gave this reason, that in the several wide and\nspacious dominions which were reduced under the sway and authority of his\nsovereign government, there were sundry countries and nations much\ndiffering from one another in language, with whom, whether he was to speak\nunto them or give any answer to their requests, he was always necessitated\nto make use of divers sorts of truchman and interpreters.  Now with this\nman alone, sufficient for supplying all their places, will that great\ninconveniency hereafter be totally removed; seeing he is such a fine\ngesticulator, and in the practice of chirology an artist so complete,\nexpert, and dexterous, that with his very fingers he doth speak.\nHowsoever, you are to pitch upon such a dumb one as is deaf by nature and\nfrom his birth; to the end that his gestures and signs may be the more\nvively and truly prophetic, and not counterfeit by the intermixture of some\nadulterate lustre and affectation.  Yet whether this dumb person shall be\nof the male or female sex is in your option, lieth at your discretion, and\naltogether dependeth on your own election.\n\nI would more willingly, quoth Panurge, consult with and be advised by a\ndumb woman, were it not that I am afraid of two things.  The first is, that\nthe greater part of women, whatever be that they see, do always represent\nunto their fancies, think, and imagine, that it hath some relation to the\nsugared entering of the goodly ithyphallos, and graffing in the cleft of\nthe overturned tree the quickset imp of the pin of copulation.  Whatever\nsigns, shows, or gestures we shall make, or whatever our behaviour,\ncarriage, or demeanour shall happen to be in their view and presence, they\nwill interpret the whole in reference to the act of androgynation and the\nculbutizing exercise, by which means we shall be abusively disappointed of\nour designs, in regard that she will take all our signs for nothing else\nbut tokens and representations of our desire to entice her unto the lists\nof a Cyprian combat or catsenconny skirmish.  Do you remember what happened\nat Rome two hundred and threescore years after the foundation thereof?  A\nyoung Roman gentleman encountering by chance, at the foot of Mount Celion,\nwith a beautiful Latin lady named Verona, who from her very cradle upwards\nhad always been both deaf and dumb, very civilly asked her, not without a\nchironomatic Italianizing of his demand, with various jectigation of his\nfingers and other gesticulations as yet customary amongst the speakers of\nthat country, what senators in her descent from the top of the hill she had\nmet with going up thither.  For you are to conceive that he, knowing no\nmore of her deafness than dumbness, was ignorant of both.  She in the\nmeantime, who neither heard nor understood so much as one word of what he\nhad said, straight imagined, by all that she could apprehend in the lovely\ngesture of his manual signs, that what he then required of her was what\nherself had a great mind to, even that which a young man doth naturally\ndesire of a woman.  Then was it that by signs, which in all occurrences of\nvenereal love are incomparably more attractive, valid, and efficacious than\nwords, she beckoned to him to come along with her to her house; which when\nhe had done, she drew him aside to a privy room, and then made a most\nlively alluring sign unto him to show that the game did please her.\nWhereupon, without any more advertisement, or so much as the uttering of\none word on either side, they fell to and bringuardized it lustily.\n\nThe other cause of my being averse from consulting with dumb women is, that\nto our signs they would make no answer at all, but suddenly fall backwards\nin a divarication posture, to intimate thereby unto us the reality of their\nconsent to the supposed motion of our tacit demands.  Or if they should\nchance to make any countersigns responsory to our propositions, they would\nprove so foolish, impertinent, and ridiculous, that by them ourselves\nshould easily judge their thoughts to have no excursion beyond the duffling\nacademy.  You know very well how at Brignoles, when the religious nun,\nSister Fatbum, was made big with child by the young Stiffly-stand-to't, her\npregnancy came to be known, and she cited by the abbess, and, in a full\nconvention of the convent, accused of incest.  Her excuse was that she did\nnot consent thereto, but that it was done by the violence and impetuous\nforce of the Friar Stiffly-stand-to't.  Hereto the abbess very austerely\nreplying, Thou naughty wicked girl, why didst thou not cry, A rape, a rape!\nthen should all of us have run to thy succour.  Her answer was that the\nrape was committed in the dortour, where she durst not cry because it was a\nplace of sempiternal silence.  But, quoth the abbess, thou roguish wench,\nwhy didst not thou then make some sign to those that were in the next\nchamber beside thee?  To this she answered that with her buttocks she made\na sign unto them as vigorously as she could, yet never one of them did so\nmuch as offer to come to her help and assistance.  But, quoth the abbess,\nthou scurvy baggage, why didst thou not tell it me immediately after the\nperpetration of the fact, that so we might orderly, regularly, and\ncanonically have accused him?  I would have done so, had the case been\nmine, for the clearer manifestation of mine innocency.  I truly, madam,\nwould have done the like with all my heart and soul, quoth Sister Fatbum,\nbut that fearing I should remain in sin, and in the hazard of eternal\ndamnation, if prevented by a sudden death, I did confess myself to the\nfather friar before he went out of the room, who, for my penance, enjoined\nme not to tell it, or reveal the matter unto any.  It were a most enormous\nand horrid offence, detestable before God and the angels, to reveal a\nconfession.  Such an abominable wickedness would have possibly brought down\nfire from heaven, wherewith to have burnt the whole nunnery, and sent us\nall headlong to the bottomless pit, to bear company with Korah, Dathan, and\nAbiram.\n\nYou will not, quoth Pantagruel, with all your jesting, make me laugh.  I\nknow that all the monks, friars, and nuns had rather violate and infringe\nthe highest of the commandments of God than break the least of their\nprovincial statutes.  Take you therefore Goatsnose, a man very fit for your\npresent purpose; for he is, and hath been, both dumb and deaf from the very\nremotest infancy of his childhood.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XX.\n\nHow Goatsnose by signs maketh answer to Panurge.\n\nGoatsnose being sent for, came the day thereafter to Pantagruel's court; at\nhis arrival to which Panurge gave him a fat calf, the half of a hog, two\npuncheons of wine, one load of corn, and thirty francs of small money;\nthen, having brought him before Pantagruel, in presence of the gentlemen of\nthe bed-chamber he made this sign unto him.  He yawned a long time, and in\nyawning made without his mouth with the thumb of his right hand the figure\nof the Greek letter Tau by frequent reiterations.  Afterwards he lifted up\nhis eyes to heavenwards, then turned them in his head like a she-goat in\nthe painful fit of an absolute birth, in doing whereof he did cough and\nsigh exceeding heavily.  This done, after that he had made demonstration of\nthe want of his codpiece, he from under his shirt took his placket-racket\nin a full grip, making it therewithal clack very melodiously betwixt his\nthighs; then, no sooner had he with his body stooped a little forwards, and\nbowed his left knee, but that immediately thereupon holding both his arms\non his breast, in a loose faint-like posture, the one over the other, he\npaused awhile.  Goatsnose looked wistly upon him, and having heedfully\nenough viewed him all over, he lifted up into the air his left hand, the\nwhole fingers whereof he retained fistwise close together, except the thumb\nand the forefinger, whose nails he softly joined and coupled to one\nanother.  I understand, quoth Pantagruel, what he meaneth by that sign.  It\ndenotes marriage, and withal the number thirty, according to the profession\nof the Pythagoreans.  You will be married.  Thanks to you, quoth Panurge,\nin turning himself towards Goatsnose, my little sewer, pretty master's\nmate, dainty bailie, curious sergeant-marshal, and jolly catchpole-leader.\nThen did he lift higher up than before his said left hand, stretching out\nall the five fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from one another as\nhe possibly could get done.  Here, says Pantagruel, doth he more amply and\nfully insinuate unto us, by the token which he showeth forth of the quinary\nnumber, that you shall be married.  Yea, that you shall not only be\naffianced, betrothed, wedded, and married, but that you shall furthermore\ncohabit and live jollily and merrily with your wife; for Pythagoras called\nfive the nuptial number, which, together with marriage, signifieth the\nconsummation of matrimony, because it is composed of a ternary, the first\nof the odd, and binary, the first of the even numbers, as of a male and\nfemale knit and united together.  In very deed it was the fashion of old in\nthe city of Rome at marriage festivals to light five wax tapers; nor was it\npermitted to kindle any more at the magnific nuptials of the most potent\nand wealthy, nor yet any fewer at the penurious weddings of the poorest and\nmost abject of the world.  Moreover, in times past, the heathen or paynims\nimplored the assistance of five deities, or of one helpful, at least, in\nfive several good offices to those that were to be married.  Of this sort\nwere the nuptial Jove, Juno, president of the feast, the fair Venus, Pitho,\nthe goddess of eloquence and persuasion, and Diana, whose aid and succour\nwas required to the labour of child-bearing.  Then shouted Panurge, O the\ngentle Goatsnose, I will give him a farm near Cinais, and a windmill hard\nby Mirebalais!  Hereupon the dumb fellow sneezeth with an impetuous\nvehemency and huge concussion of the spirits of the whole body, withdrawing\nhimself in so doing with a jerking turn towards the left hand.  By the body\nof a fox new slain, quoth Pantagruel, what is that?  This maketh nothing\nfor your advantage; for he betokeneth thereby that your marriage will be\ninauspicious and unfortunate.  This sneezing, according to the doctrine of\nTerpsion, is the Socratic demon.  If done towards the right side, it\nimports and portendeth that boldly and with all assurance one may go\nwhither he will and do what he listeth, according to what deliberation he\nshall be pleased to have thereupon taken; his entries in the beginning,\nprogress in his proceedings, and success in the events and issues will be\nall lucky, good, and happy.  The quite contrary thereto is thereby implied\nand presaged if it be done towards the left.  You, quoth Panurge, do take\nalways the matter at the worst, and continually, like another Davus,\ncasteth in new disturbances and obstructions; nor ever yet did I know this\nold paltry Terpsion worthy of citation but in points only of cosenage and\nimposture.  Nevertheless, quoth Pantagruel, Cicero hath written I know not\nwhat to the same purpose in his Second Book of Divination.\n\nPanurge then, turning himself towards Goatsnose, made this sign unto him.\nHe inverted his eyelids upwards, wrenched his jaws from the right to the\nleft side, and drew forth his tongue half out of his mouth.  This done, he\nposited his left hand wholly open, the mid-finger wholly excepted, which\nwas perpendicularly placed upon the palm thereof, and set it just in the\nroom where his codpiece had been.  Then did he keep his right hand\naltogether shut up in a fist, save only the thumb, which he straight turned\nbackwards directly under the right armpit, and settled it afterwards on\nthat most eminent part of the buttocks which the Arabs call the Al-Katim.\nSuddenly thereafter he made this interchange:  he held his right hand after\nthe manner of the left, and posited it on the place wherein his codpiece\nsometime was, and retaining his left hand in the form and fashion of the\nright, he placed it upon his Al-Katim.  This altering of hands did he\nreiterate nine several times; at the last whereof he reseated his eyelids\ninto their own first natural position.  Then doing the like also with his\njaws and tongue, he did cast a squinting look upon Goatsnose, diddering and\nshivering his chaps, as apes use to do nowadays, and rabbits, whilst,\nalmost starved with hunger, they are eating oats in the sheaf.\n\nThen was it that Goatsnose, lifting up into the air his right hand wholly\nopen and displayed, put the thumb thereof, even close unto its first\narticulation, between the two third joints of the middle and ring fingers,\npressing about the said thumb thereof very hard with them both, and, whilst\nthe remanent joints were contracted and shrunk in towards the wrist, he\nstretched forth with as much straightness as he could the fore and little\nfingers.  That hand thus framed and disposed of he laid and posited upon\nPanurge's navel, moving withal continually the aforesaid thumb, and bearing\nup, supporting, or under-propping that hand upon the above-specified fore\nand little fingers, as upon two legs.  Thereafter did he make in this\nposture his hand by little and little, and by degrees and pauses,\nsuccessively to mount from athwart the belly to the stomach, from whence he\nmade it to ascend to the breast, even upwards to Panurge's neck, still\ngaining ground, till, having reached his chin, he had put within the\nconcave of his mouth his afore-mentioned thumb; then fiercely brandishing\nthe whole hand, which he made to rub and grate against his nose, he heaved\nit further up, and made the fashion as if with the thumb thereof he would\nhave put out his eyes.  With this Panurge grew a little angry, and went\nabout to withdraw and rid himself from this ruggedly untoward dumb devil.\nBut Goatsnose in the meantime, prosecuting the intended purpose of his\nprognosticatory response, touched very rudely, with the above-mentioned\nshaking thumb, now his eyes, then his forehead, and after that the borders\nand corners of his cap.  At last Panurge cried out, saying, Before God,\nmaster fool, if you do not let me alone, or that you will presume to vex me\nany more, you shall receive from the best hand I have a mask wherewith to\ncover your rascally scroundrel face, you paltry shitten varlet.  Then said\nFriar John, He is deaf, and doth not understand what thou sayest unto him.\nBulliballock, make sign to him of a hail of fisticuffs upon the muzzle.\n\nWhat the devil, quoth Panurge, means this busy restless fellow?  What is it\nthat this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?\nHe hath almost thrust out mine eyes, as if he had been to poach them in a\nskillet with butter and eggs.  By God, da jurandi, I will feast you with\nflirts and raps on the snout, interlarded with a double row of bobs and\nfinger-fillipings!  Then did he leave him in giving him by way of salvo a\nvolley of farts for his farewell.  Goatsnose, perceiving Panurge thus to\nslip away from him, got before him, and, by mere strength enforcing him to\nstand, made this sign unto him.  He let fall his right arm toward his knee\non the same side as low as he could, and, raising all the fingers of that\nhand into a close fist, passed his dexter thumb betwixt the foremost and\nmid fingers thereto belonging.  Then scrubbing and swingeing a little with\nhis left hand alongst and upon the uppermost in the very bough of the elbow\nof the said dexter arm, the whole cubit thereof, by leisure, fair and\nsoftly, at these thumpatory warnings, did raise and elevate itself even to\nthe elbow, and above it; on a sudden did he then let it fall down as low as\nbefore, and after that, at certain intervals and such spaces of time,\nraising and abasing it, he made a show thereof to Panurge.  This so\nincensed Panurge that he forthwith lifted his hand to have stricken him the\ndumb roister and given him a sound whirret on the ear, but that the respect\nand reverence which he carried to the presence of Pantagruel restrained his\ncholer and kept his fury within bounds and limits.  Then said Pantagruel,\nIf the bare signs now vex and trouble you, how much more grievously will\nyou be perplexed and disquieted with the real things which by them are\nrepresented and signified!  All truths agree and are consonant with one\nanother.  This dumb fellow prophesieth and foretelleth that you will be\nmarried, cuckolded, beaten, and robbed.  As for the marriage, quoth\nPanurge, I yield thereto, and acknowledge the verity of that point of his\nprediction; as for the rest, I utterly abjure and deny it:  and believe,\nsir, I beseech you, if it may please you so to do, that in the matter of\nwives and horses never any man was predestinated to a better fortune than\nI.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXI.\n\nHow Panurge consulteth with an old French poet, named Raminagrobis.\n\nI never thought, said Pantagruel, to have encountered with any man so\nheadstrong in his apprehensions, or in his opinions so wilful, as I have\nfound you to be and see you are.  Nevertheless, the better to clear and\nextricate your doubts, let us try all courses, and leave no stone unturned\nnor wind unsailed by.  Take good heed to what I am to say unto you.  The\nswans, which are fowls consecrated to Apollo, never chant but in the hour\nof their approaching death, especially in the Meander flood, which is a\nriver that runneth along some of the territories of Phrygia.  This I say,\nbecause Aelianus and Alexander Myndius write that they had seen several\nswans in other places die, but never heard any of them sing or chant before\ntheir death.  However, it passeth for current that the imminent death of a\nswan is presaged by his foregoing song, and that no swan dieth until\npreallably he have sung.\n\nAfter the same manner, poets, who are under the protection of Apollo, when\nthey are drawing near their latter end do ordinarily become prophets, and\nby the inspiration of that god sing sweetly in vaticinating things which\nare to come.  It hath been likewise told me frequently, that old decrepit\nmen upon the brinks of Charon's banks do usher their decease with a\ndisclosure all at ease, to those that are desirous of such informations, of\nthe determinate and assured truth of future accidents and contingencies.  I\nremember also that Aristophanes, in a certain comedy of his, calleth the\nold folks Sibyls, Eith o geron Zibullia.  For as when, being upon a pier by\nthe shore, we see afar off mariners, seafaring men, and other travellers\nalongst the curled waves of azure Thetis within their ships, we then\nconsider them in silence only, and seldom proceed any further than to wish\nthem a happy and prosperous arrival; but when they do approach near to the\nhaven, and come to wet their keels within their harbour, then both with\nwords and  gestures we salute them, and heartily congratulate their access\nsafe to the port wherein we are ourselves.  Just so the angels, heroes, and\ngood demons, according to the doctrine of the Platonics, when they see\nmortals drawing near unto the harbour of the grave, as the most sure and\ncalmest port of any, full of repose, ease, rest, tranquillity, free from\nthe  troubles and solicitudes of this tumultuous and tempestuous world; then\nis  it that they with alacrity hail and salute them, cherish and comfort\nthem, and, speaking to them lovingly, begin even then to bless them with\nilluminations, and to communicate unto them the abstrusest mysteries of\ndivination.  I will not offer here to confound your memory by quoting\nantique examples of Isaac, of Jacob, of Patroclus towards Hector, of Hector\ntowards Achilles, of Polymnestor towards Agamemnon, of Hecuba, of the\nRhodian renowned by Posidonius, of Calanus the Indian towards Alexander the\nGreat, of Orodes towards Mezentius, and of many others.  It shall suffice\nfor the present that I commemorate unto you the learned and valiant knight\nand cavalier William of Bellay, late Lord of Langey, who died on the Hill\nof Tarara, the 10th of January, in the climacteric year of his age, and of\nour supputation 1543, according to the Roman account.  The last three or\nfour hours of his life he did employ in the serious utterance of a very\npithy discourse, whilst with a clear judgment and spirit void of all\ntrouble he did foretell several important things, whereof a great deal is\ncome to pass, and the rest we wait for.  Howbeit, his prophecies did at\nthat time seem unto us somewhat strange, absurd, and unlikely, because\nthere did not then appear any sign of efficacy enough to engage our faith\nto the belief of what he did prognosticate.  We have here, near to the town\nof Villomere, a man that is both old and a poet, to wit, Raminagrobis, who\nto his second wife espoused my Lady Broadsow, on whom he begot the fair\nBasoche.  It hath been told me he is a-dying, and so near unto his latter\nend that he is almost upon the very last moment, point, and article thereof.\nRepair thither as fast as you can, and be ready to give an attentive ear to\nwhat he shall chant unto you.  It may be that you shall obtain from him what\nyou desire, and that Apollo will be pleased by his means to clear your\nscruples.  I am content, quoth Panurge.  Let us go thither, Epistemon, and\nthat both instantly and in all haste, lest otherwise his death prevent our\ncoming.  Wilt thou come along with us, Friar John?  Yes, that I will, quoth\nFriar John, right heartily to do thee a courtesy, my billy-ballocks; for I\nlove thee with the best of my milt and liver.\n\nThereupon, incontinently, without any further lingering, to the way they\nall three went, and quickly thereafter--for they made good speed--arriving\nat the poetical habitation, they found the jolly old man, albeit in the\nagony of his departure from this world, looking cheerfully, with an open\ncountenance, splendid aspect, and behaviour full of alacrity.  After that\nPanurge had very civilly saluted him, he in a free gift did present him\nwith a gold ring, which he even then put upon the medical finger of his\nleft hand, in the collet or bezel whereof was enchased an Oriental\nsapphire, very fair and large.  Then, in imitation of Socrates, did he make\nan oblation unto him of a fair white cock, which was no sooner set upon the\ntester of his bed, than that, with a high raised head and crest, lustily\nshaking his feather-coat, he crowed stentoriphonically loud.  This done,\nPanurge very courteously required of him that he would vouchsafe to favour\nhim with the grant and report of his sense and judgment touching the future\ndestiny of his intended marriage.  For answer hereto, when the honest old\nman had forthwith commanded pen, paper, and ink to be brought unto him, and\nthat he was at the same call conveniently served with all the three, he\nwrote these following verses:\n\n  Take, or not take her,\n    Off, or on:\n  Handy-dandy is your lot.\n  When her name you write, you blot.\n  'Tis undone, when all is done,\n  Ended e'er it was begun:\n  Hardly gallop, if you trot,\n  Set not forward when you run,\n  Nor be single, though alone,\n    Take, or not take her.\n\n  Before you eat, begin to fast;\n  For what shall be was never past.\n  Say, unsay, gainsay, save your breath:\n  Then wish at once her life and death.\n    Take, or not take her.\n\nThese lines he gave out of his own hands unto them, saying unto them, Go,\nmy lads, in peace! the great God of the highest heavens be your guardian\nand preserver! and do not offer any more to trouble or disquiet me with\nthis or any other business whatsoever.  I have this same very day, which is\nthe last both of May and of me, with a greal deal of labour, toil, and\ndifficulty, chased out of my house a rabble of filthy, unclean, and\nplaguily pestilentious rake-hells, black beasts, dusk, dun, white,\nash-coloured, speckled, and a foul vermin of other hues, whose obtrusive\nimportunity would not permit me to die at my own ease; for by fraudulent\nand deceitful pricklings, ravenous, harpy-like graspings, waspish\nstingings, and such-like unwelcome approaches, forged in the shop of I know\nnot what kind of insatiabilities, they went about to withdraw and call me\nout of those sweet thoughts wherein I was already beginning to repose\nmyself and acquiesce in the contemplation and vision, yea, almost in the\nvery touch and taste of the happiness and felicity which the good God hath\nprepared for his faithful saints and elect in the other life and state of\nimmortality.  Turn out of their courses and eschew them, step forth of\ntheir ways and do not resemble them; meanwhile, let me be no more troubled\nby you, but leave me now in silence, I beseech you.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXII.\n\nHow Panurge patrocinates and defendeth the Order of the Begging Friars.\n\nPanurge, at his issuing forth of Raminagrobis's chamber, said, as if he had\nbeen horribly affrighted, By the virtue of God, I believe that he is an\nheretic; the devil take me, if I do not! he doth so villainously rail at\nthe Mendicant Friars and Jacobins, who are the two hemispheres of the\nChristian world; by whose gyronomonic circumbilvaginations, as by two\ncelivagous filopendulums, all the autonomatic metagrobolism of the Romish\nChurch, when tottering and emblustricated with the gibble-gabble gibberish\nof this odious error and heresy, is homocentrically poised.  But what harm,\nin the devil's name, have these poor devils the Capuchins and Minims done\nunto him?  Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?\nWho can imagine that these poor snakes, the very extracts of ichthyophagy,\nare not thoroughly enough besmoked and besmeared with misery, distress, and\ncalamity?  Dost thou think, Friar John, by thy faith, that he is in the\nstate of salvation?  He goeth, before God, as surely damned to thirty\nthousand basketsful of devils as a pruning-bill to the lopping of a\nvine-branch.  To revile with opprobrious speeches the good and courageous\nprops and pillars of the Church,--is that to be called a poetical fury?  I\ncannot rest satisfied with him; he sinneth grossly, and blasphemeth against\nthe true religion.  I am very much offended at his scandalizing words and\ncontumelious obloquy.  I do not care a straw, quoth Friar John, for what he\nhath said; for although everybody should twit and jerk them, it were but a\njust retaliation, seeing all persons are served by them with the like sauce:\ntherefore do I pretend no interest therein.  Let us see, nevertheless, what\nhe hath written.  Panurge very attentively read the paper which the old man\nhad penned; then said to his two fellow-travellers, The poor drinker doteth.\nHowsoever, I excuse him, for that I believe he is now drawing near to the\nend and final closure of his life.  Let us go make his epitaph.  By the\nanswer which he hath given us, I am not, I protest, one jot wiser than I\nwas.  Hearken here, Epistemon, my little bully, dost not thou hold him to be\nvery resolute in his responsory verdicts?  He is a witty, quick, and subtle\nsophister.  I will lay an even wager that he is a miscreant apostate.  By\nthe belly of a stalled ox, how careful he is not to be mistaken in his\nwords.  He answered but by disjunctives, therefore can it not be true which\nhe saith; for the verity of such-like propositions is inherent only in one\nof its two members.  O the cozening prattler that he is!  I wonder if\nSantiago of Bressure be one of these cogging shirks.  Such was of old, quoth\nEpistemon, the custom of the grand vaticinator and prophet Tiresias, who\nused always, by way of a preface, to say openly and plainly at the beginning\nof his divinations and predictions that what he was to tell would either\ncome to pass or not.  And such is truly the style of all prudently presaging\nprognosticators.  He was nevertheless, quoth Panurge, so unfortunately\nmisadventurous in the lot of his own destiny, that Juno thrust out both his\neyes.\n\nYes, answered Epistemon, and that merely out of a spite and spleen for\nhaving pronounced his award more veritable than she, upon the question\nwhich was merrily proposed by Jupiter.  But, quoth Panurge, what archdevil\nis it that hath possessed this Master Raminagrobis, that so unreasonably,\nand without any occasion, he should have so snappishly and bitterly\ninveighed against these poor honest fathers, Jacobins, Minors, and Minims?\nIt vexeth me grievously, I assure you; nor am I able to conceal my\nindignation.  He hath transgressed most enormously; his soul goeth\ninfallibly to thirty thousand panniersful of devils.  I understand you not,\nquoth Epistemon, and it disliketh me very much that you should so absurdly\nand perversely interpret that of the Friar Mendicants which by the harmless\npoet was spoken of black beasts, dun, and other sorts of other coloured\nanimals.  He is not in my opinion guilty of such a sophistical and\nfantastic allegory as by that phrase of his to have meant the Begging\nBrothers.  He in downright terms speaketh absolutely and properly of fleas,\npunies, hand worms, flies, gnats, and other such-like scurvy vermin,\nwhereof some are black, some dun, some ash-coloured, some tawny, and some\nbrown and dusky, all noisome, molesting, tyrannous, cumbersome, and\nunpleasant creatures, not only to sick and diseased folks, but to those\nalso who are of a sound, vigorous, and healthful temperament and\nconstitution.  It is not unlikely that he may have the ascarids, and the\nlumbrics, and worms within the entrails of his body.  Possibly doth he\nsuffer, as it is frequent and usual amongst the Egyptians, together with\nall those who inhabit the Erythraean confines, and dwell along the shores\nand coasts of the Red Sea, some sour prickings and smart stingings in his\narms and legs of those little speckled dragons which the Arabians call\nmeden.  You are to blame for offering to expound his words otherwise, and\nwrong the ingenuous poet, and outrageously abuse and miscall the said\nfraters, by an imputation of baseness undeservedly laid to their charge.\nWe still should, in such like discourses of fatiloquent soothsayers,\ninterpret all things to the best.  Will you teach me, quoth Panurge, how to\ndiscern flies among milk, or show your father the way how to beget\nchildren?  He is, by the virtue of God, an arrant heretic, a resolute,\nformal heretic; I say, a rooted, combustible heretic, one as fit to burn as\nthe little wooden clock at Rochelle.  His soul goeth to thirty thousand\ncartsful of devils.  Would you know whither?  Cocks-body, my friend,\nstraight under Proserpina's close-stool, to the very middle of the\nself-same infernal pan within which she, by an excrementitious evacuation,\nvoideth the faecal stuff of her stinking clysters, and that just upon the\nleft side of the great cauldron of three fathom height, hard by the claws\nand talons of Lucifer, in the very darkest of the passage which leadeth\ntowards the black chamber of Demogorgon.  O the villain!\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXIII.\n\nHow Panurge maketh the motion of a return to Raminagrobis.\n\nLet us return, quoth Panurge, not ceasing, to the uttermost of our\nabilities, to ply him with wholesome admonitions for the furtherance of his\nsalvation.  Let us go back, for God's sake; let us go, in the name of God.\nIt will be a very meritorious work, and of great charity in us to deal so\nin the matter, and provide so well for him that, albeit he come to lose\nboth body and life, he may at least escape the risk and danger of the\neternal damnation of his soul.  We will by our holy persuasions bring him\nto a sense and feeling of his escapes, induce him to acknowledge his\nfaults, move him to a cordial repentance of his errors, and stir up in him\nsuch a sincere contrition of heart for his offences, as will prompt him\nwith all earnestness to cry mercy, and to beg pardon at the hands of the\ngood fathers, as well of the absent as of such as are present.  Whereupon\nwe will take instrument formally and authentically extended, to the end he\nbe not, after his decease, declared an heretic, and condemned, as were the\nhobgoblins of the provost's wife of Orleans, to the undergoing of such\npunishments, pains, and tortures as are due to and inflicted on those that\ninhabit the horrid cells of the infernal regions; and withal incline,\ninstigate, and persuade him to bequeath and leave in legacy (by way of an\namends and satisfaction for the outrage and injury done to those good\nreligious fathers throughout all the convents, cloisters, and monasteries\nof this province), many bribes, a great deal of mass-singing, store of\nobits, and that sempiternally, on the anniversary day of his decease, every\none of them all be furnished with a quintuple allowance, and that the great\nborachio replenished with the best liquor trudge apace along the tables, as\nwell of the young duckling monkitoes, lay brothers, and lowermost degree of\nthe abbey lubbards, as of the learned priests and reverend clerks,--the\nvery meanest of the novices and mitiants unto the order being equally\nadmitted to the benefit of those funerary and obsequial festivals with the\naged rectors and professed fathers.  This is the surest ordinary means\nwhereby from God he may obtain forgiveness.  Ho, ho, I am quite mistaken; I\ndigress from the purpose, and fly out of my discourse, as if my spirits\nwere a-wool-gathering.  The devil take me, if I go thither!  Virtue God!\nThe chamber is already full of devils.  O what a swinging, thwacking noise\nis now amongst them!  O the terrible coil that they keep!  Hearken, do you\nnot hear the rustling, thumping bustle of their strokes and blows, as they\nscuffle with one another, like true devils indeed, who shall gulp up the\nRaminagrobis soul, and be the first bringer of it, whilst it is hot, to\nMonsieur Lucifer?  Beware, and get you hence! for my part, I will not go\nthither.  The devil roast me if I go!  Who knows but that these hungry mad\ndevils may in the haste of their rage and fury of their impatience take a\nqui for a quo, and instead of Raminagrobis snatch up poor Panurge frank and\nfree?  Though formerly, when I was deep in debt, they always failed.  Get\nyou hence!  I will not go thither.  Before God, the very bare apprehension\nthereof is like to kill me.  To be in a place where there are greedy,\nfamished, and hunger-starved devils; amongst factious devils--amidst\ntrading and trafficking devils--O the Lord preserve me!  Get you hence!  I\ndare pawn my credit on it, that no Jacobin, Cordelier, Carmelite, Capuchin,\nTheatin, or Minim will bestow any personal presence at his interment.  The\nwiser they, because he hath ordained nothing for them in his latter will\nand testament.  The devil take me, if I go thither.  If he be damned, to\nhis own loss and hindrance be it.  What the deuce moved him to be so\nsnappish and depravedly bent against the good fathers of the true religion?\nWhy did he cast them off, reject them, and drive them quite out of his\nchamber, even in that very nick of time when he stood in greatest need of\nthe aid, suffrage, and assistance of their devout prayers and holy\nadmonitions?  Why did not he by testament leave them, at least, some jolly\nlumps and cantles of substantial meat, a parcel of cheek-puffing victuals,\nand a little belly-timber and provision for the guts of these poor folks,\nwho have nothing but their life in this world?  Let him go thither who\nwill, the devil take me if I go; for, if I should, the devil would not fail\nto snatch me up.  Cancro.  Ho, the pox!  Get you hence, Friar John!  Art\nthou content that thirty thousand wainload of devils should get away with\nthee at this same very instant?  If thou be, at my request do these three\nthings.  First, give me thy purse; for besides that thy money is marked\nwith crosses, and the cross is an enemy to charms, the same may befall to\nthee which not long ago happened to John Dodin, collector of the excise of\nCoudray, at the ford of Vede, when the soldiers broke the planks.  This\nmoneyed fellow, meeting at the very brink of the bank of the ford with\nFriar Adam Crankcod, a Franciscan observantin of Mirebeau, promised him a\nnew frock, provided that in the transporting of him over the water he would\nbear him upon his neck and shoulders, after the manner of carrying dead\ngoats; for he was a lusty, strong-limbed, sturdy rogue.  The condition\nbeing agreed upon, Friar Crankcod trusseth himself up to his very ballocks,\nand layeth upon his back, like a fair little Saint Christopher, the load of\nthe said supplicant Dodin, and so carried him gaily and with a good will,\nas Aeneas bore his father Anchises through the conflagration of Troy,\nsinging in the meanwhile a pretty Ave Maris Stella.  When they were in the\nvery deepest place of all the ford, a little above the master-wheel of the\nwater-mill, he asked if he had any coin about him.  Yes, quoth Dodin, a\nwhole bagful; and that he needed not to mistrust his ability in the\nperformance of the promise which he had made unto him concerning a new\nfrock.  How! quoth Friar Crankcod, thou knowest well enough that by the\nexpress rules, canons, and injunctions of our order we are forbidden to\ncarry on us any kind of money.  Thou art truly unhappy, for having made me\nin this point to commit a heinous trespass.  Why didst thou not leave thy\npurse with the miller?  Without fail thou shalt presently receive thy\nreward for it; and if ever hereafter I may but lay hold upon thee within\nthe limits of our chancel at Mirebeau, thou shalt have the Miserere even to\nthe Vitulos.  With this, suddenly discharging himself of his burden, he\nthrows me down your Dodin headlong.  Take example by this Dodin, my dear\nfriend Friar John, to the end that the devils may the better carry thee\naway at thine own ease.  Give me thy purse.  Carry no manner of cross upon\nthee.  Therein lieth an evident and manifestly apparent danger.  For if you\nhave any silver coined with a cross upon it, they will cast thee down\nheadlong upon some rocks, as the eagles use to do with the tortoises for\nthe breaking of their shells, as the bald pate of the poet Aeschylus can\nsufficiently bear witness.  Such a fall would hurt thee very sore, my sweet\nbully, and I would be sorry for it.  Or otherwise they will let thee fall\nand tumble down into the high swollen waves of some capacious sea, I know\nnot where; but, I warrant thee, far enough hence, as Icarus fell, which\nfrom thy name would afterwards get the denomination of the Funnelian Sea.\n\nSecondly, be out of debt.  For the devils carry a great liking to those\nthat are out of debt.  I have sore felt the experience thereof in mine own\nparticular; for now the lecherous varlets are always wooing me, courting\nme, and making much of me, which they never did when I was all to pieces.\nThe soul of one in debt is insipid, dry, and heretical altogether.\n\nThirdly, with the cowl and Domino de Grobis, return to Raminagrobis; and in\ncase, being thus qualified, thirty thousand boatsful of devils forthwith\ncome not to carry thee quite away, I shall be content to be at the charge\nof paying for the pint and faggot.  Now, if for the more security thou\nwouldst some associate to bear thee company, let not me be the comrade thou\nsearchest for; think not to get a fellow-traveller of me,--nay, do not.  I\nadvise thee for the best.  Get you hence; I will not go thither.  The devil\ntake me if I go.  Notwithstanding all the fright that you are in, quoth\nFriar John, I would not care so much as might possibly be expected I\nshould, if I once had but my sword in my hand.  Thou hast verily hit the\nnail on the head, quoth Panurge, and speakest like a learned doctor, subtle\nand well-skilled in the art of devilry.  At the time when I was a student\nin the University of Toulouse (Tolette), that same reverend father in the\ndevil, Picatrix, rector of the diabological faculty, was wont to tell us\nthat the devils did naturally fear the bright glancing of swords as much as\nthe splendour and light of the sun.  In confirmation of the verity whereof\nhe related this story, that Hercules, at his descent into hell to all the\ndevils of those regions, did not by half so much terrify them with his club\nand lion's skin as afterwards Aeneas did with his clear shining armour upon\nhim, and his sword in his hand well-furbished and unrusted, by the aid,\ncounsel, and assistance of the Sybilla Cumana.  That was perhaps the reason\nwhy the senior John Jacomo di Trivulcio, whilst he was a-dying at Chartres,\ncalled for his cutlass, and died with a drawn sword in his hand, laying\nabout him alongst and athwart around the bed and everywhere within his\nreach, like a stout, doughty, valorous and knight-like cavalier; by which\nresolute manner of fence he scared away and put to flight all the devils\nthat were then lying in wait for his soul at the passage of his death.\nWhen the Massorets and Cabalists are asked why it is that none of all the\ndevils do at any time enter into the terrestrial paradise? their answer\nhath been, is, and will be still, that there is a cherubin standing at the\ngate thereof with a flame-like glistering sword in his hand.  Although, to\nspeak in the true diabological sense or phrase of Toledo, I must needs\nconfess and acknowledge that veritably the devils cannot be killed or die\nby the stroke of a sword, I do nevertheless avow and maintain, according to\nthe doctrine of the said diabology, that they may suffer a solution of\ncontinuity (as if with thy shable thou shouldst cut athwart the flame of a\nburning fire, or the gross opacous exhalations of a thick and obscure\nsmoke), and cry out like very devils at their sense and feeling of this\ndissolution, which in real deed I must aver and affirm is devilishly\npainful, smarting, and dolorous.\n\nWhen thou seest the impetuous shock of two armies, and vehement violence of\nthe push in their horrid encounter with one another, dost thou think,\nBallockasso, that so horrible a noise as is heard there proceedeth from the\nvoice and shouts of men, the dashing and jolting of harness, the clattering\nand clashing of armies, the hacking and slashing of battle-axes, the\njustling and crashing of pikes, the bustling and breaking of lances, the\nclamour and shrieks of the wounded, the sound and din of drums, the\nclangour and shrillness of trumpets, the neighing and rushing in of horses,\nwith the fearful claps and thundering of all sorts of guns, from the double\ncannon to the pocket pistol inclusively?  I cannot goodly deny but that in\nthese various things which I have rehearsed there may be somewhat\noccasionative of the huge yell and tintamarre of the two engaged bodies.\nBut the most fearful and tumultuous coil and stir, the terriblest and most\nboisterous garboil and hurry, the chiefest rustling black santus of all,\nand most principal hurlyburly springeth from the grievously plangorous\nhowling and lowing of devils, who pell-mell, in a hand-over-head confusion,\nwaiting for the poor souls of the maimed and hurt soldiery, receive\nunawares some strokes with swords, and so by those means suffer a solution\nof and division in the continuity of their aerial and invisible substances;\nas if some lackey, snatching at the lard-slices stuck in a piece of roast\nmeat on the spit, should get from Mr. Greasyfist a good rap on the knuckles\nwith a cudgel.  They cry out and shout like devils, even as Mars did when\nhe was hurt by Diomedes at the siege of Troy, who, as Homer testifieth of\nhim, did then raise his voice more horrifically loud and sonoriferously\nhigh than ten thousand men together would have been able to do.  What\nmaketh all this for our present purpose?  I have been speaking here of\nwell-furbished armour and bright shining swords.  But so is it not, Friar\nJohn, with thy weapon; for by a long discontinuance of work, cessation from\nlabour, desisting from making it officiate, and putting it into that\npractice wherein it had been formerly accustomed, and, in a word, for want\nof occupation, it is, upon my faith, become more rusty than the key-hole of\nan old powdering-tub.  Therefore it is expedient that you do one of these\ntwo things:  either furbish your weapon bravely, and as it ought to be, or\notherwise have a care that, in the rusty case it is in, you do not presume\nto return to the house of Raminagrobis.  For my part, I vow I will not go\nthither.  The devil take me if I go.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXIV.\n\nHow Panurge consulteth with Epistemon.\n\nHaving left the town of Villomere, as they were upon their return towards\nPantagruel, Panurge, in addressing his discourse to Epistemon, spoke thus:\nMy most ancient friend and gossip, thou seest the perplexity of my\nthoughts, and knowest many remedies for the removal thereof; art thou not\nable to help and succour me?  Epistemon, thereupon taking the speech in\nhand, represented unto Panurge how the open voice and common fame of the\nwhole country did run upon no other discourse but the derision and mockery\nof his new disguise; wherefore his counsel unto him was that he would in\nthe first place be pleased to make use of a little hellebore for the\npurging of his brain of that peccant humour which, through that extravagant\nand fantastic mummery of his, had furnished the people with a too just\noccasion of flouting and gibing, jeering and scoffing him, and that next he\nwould resume his ordinary fashion of accoutrement, and go apparelled as he\nwas wont to do.  I am, quoth Panurge, my dear gossip Epistemon, of a mind\nand resolution to marry, but am afraid of being a cuckold and to be\nunfortunate in my wedlock.  For this cause have I made a vow to young St.\nFrancis--who at Plessis-les-Tours is much reverenced of all women,\nearnestly cried unto by them, and with great devotion, for he was the first\nfounder of the confraternity of good men, whom they naturally covet,\naffect, and long for--to wear spectacles in my cap, and to carry no\ncodpiece in my breeches, until the present inquietude and perturbation of\nmy spirits be fully settled.\n\nTruly, quoth Epistemon, that is a pretty jolly vow of thirteen to a dozen.\nIt is a shame to you, and I wonder much at it, that you do not return unto\nyourself, and recall your senses from this their wild swerving and straying\nabroad to that rest and stillness which becomes a virtuous man.  This\nwhimsical conceit of yours brings me to the remembrance of a solemn promise\nmade by the shag-haired Argives, who, having in their controversy against\nthe Lacedaemonians for the territory of Thyrea, lost the battle which they\nhoped should have decided it for their advantage, vowed to carry never any\nhair on their heads till preallably they had recovered the loss of both\ntheir honour and lands.  As likewise to the memory of the vow of a pleasant\nSpaniard called Michael Doris, who vowed to carry in his hat a piece of the\nshin of his leg till he should be revenged of him who had struck it off.\nYet do not I know which of these two deserveth most to wear a green and\nyellow hood with a hare's ears tied to it, either the aforesaid\nvainglorious champion, or that Enguerrant, who having forgot the art and\nmanner of writing histories set down by the Samosatian philosopher, maketh\na most tediously long narrative and relation thereof.  For, at the first\nreading of such a profuse discourse, one would think it had been broached\nfor the introducing of a story of great importance and moment concerning\nthe waging of some formidable war, or the notable change and mutation of\npotent states and kingdoms; but, in conclusion, the world laugheth at the\ncapricious champion, at the Englishman who had affronted him, as also at\ntheir scribbler Enguerrant, more drivelling at the mouth than a mustard\npot.  The jest and scorn thereof is not unlike to that of the mountain of\nHorace, which by the poet was made to cry out and lament most enormously as\na woman in the pangs and labour of child-birth, at which deplorable and\nexorbitant cries and lamentations the whole neighbourhood being assembled\nin expectation to see some marvellous monstrous production, could at last\nperceive no other but the paltry, ridiculous mouse.\n\nYour mousing, quoth Panurge, will not make me leave my musing why folks\nshould be so frumpishly disposed, seeing I am certainly persuaded that some\nflout who merit to be flouted at; yet, as my vow imports, so will I do.  It\nis now a long time since, by Jupiter Philos (A mistake of the\ntranslator's.--M.), we did swear faith and amity to one another.  Give me\nyour advice, billy, and tell me your opinion freely, Should I marry or no?\nTruly, quoth Epistemon, the case is hazardous, and the danger so eminently\napparent that I find myself too weak and insufficient to give you a\npunctual and peremptory resolution therein; and if ever it was true that\njudgment is difficult in matters of the medicinal art, what was said by\nHippocrates of Lango, it is certainly so in this case.  True it is that in\nmy brain there are some rolling fancies, by means whereof somewhat may be\npitched upon of a seeming efficacy to the disentangling your mind of those\ndubious apprehensions wherewith it is perplexed; but they do not thoroughly\nsatisfy me.  Some of the Platonic sect affirm that whosoever is able to see\nhis proper genius may know his own destiny.  I understand not their\ndoctrine, nor do I think that you adhere to them; there is a palpable\nabuse.  I have seen the experience of it in a very curious gentleman of the\ncountry of Estangourre.  This is one of the points.  There is yet another\nnot much better.  If there were any authority now in the oracles of Jupiter\nAmmon; of Apollo in Lebadia, Delphos, Delos, Cyrra, Patara, Tegyres,\nPreneste, Lycia, Colophon, or in the Castalian Fountain; near Antiochia in\nSyria, between the Branchidians; of Bacchus in Dodona; of Mercury in\nPhares, near Patras; of Apis in Egypt; of Serapis in Canope; of Faunus in\nMenalia, and Albunea near Tivoli; of Tiresias in Orchomenus; of Mopsus in\nCilicia; of Orpheus in Lesbos, and of Trophonius in Leucadia; I would in\nthat case advise you, and possibly not, to go thither for their judgment\nconcerning the design and enterprise you have in hand.  But you know that\nthey are all of them become as dumb as so many fishes since the advent of\nthat Saviour King whose coming to this world hath made all oracles and\nprophecies to cease; as the approach of the sun's radiant beams expelleth\ngoblins, bugbears, hobthrushes, broams, screech-owl-mates, night-walking\nspirits, and tenebrions.  These now are gone; but although they were as yet\nin continuance and in the same power, rule, and request that formerly they\nwere, yet would not I counsel you to be too credulous in putting any trust\nin their responses.  Too many folks have been deceived thereby.  It stands\nfurthermore upon record how Agrippina did charge the fair Lollia with the\ncrime of having interrogated the oracle of Apollo Clarius, to understand if\nshe should be at any time married to the Emperor Claudius; for which cause\nshe was first banished, and thereafter put to a shameful and ignominious\ndeath.\n\nBut, saith Panurge, let us do better.  The Ogygian Islands are not far\ndistant from the haven of Sammalo.  Let us, after that we shall have spoken\nto our king, make a voyage thither.  In one of these four isles, to wit,\nthat which hath its primest aspect towards the sun setting, it is reported,\nand I have read in good antique and authentic authors, that there reside\nmany soothsayers, fortune-tellers, vaticinators, prophets, and diviners of\nthings to come; that Saturn inhabiteth that place, bound with fair chains\nof gold and within the concavity of a golden rock, being nourished with\ndivine ambrosia and nectar, which are daily in great store and abundance\ntransmitted to him from the heavens, by I do not well know what kind of\nfowls,--it may be that they are the same ravens which in the deserts are\nsaid to have fed St. Paul, the first hermit,--he very clearly foretelleth\nunto everyone who is desirous to be certified of the condition of his lot\nwhat his destiny will be, and what future chance the Fates have ordained\nfor him; for the Parcae, or Weird Sisters, do not twist, spin, or draw out\na thread, nor yet doth Jupiter perpend, project, or deliberate anything\nwhich the good old celestial father knoweth not to the full, even whilst he\nis asleep.  This will be a very summary abbreviation of our labour, if we\nbut hearken unto him a little upon the serious debate and canvassing of\nthis my perplexity.  That is, answered Epistemon, a gullery too evident, a\nplain abuse and fib too fabulous.  I will not go, not I; I will not go.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXV.\n\nHow Panurge consulteth with Herr Trippa.\n\nNevertheless, quoth Epistemon, continuing his discourse, I will tell you\nwhat you may do, if you believe me, before we return to our king.  Hard by\nhere, in the Brown-wheat (Bouchart) Island, dwelleth Herr Trippa.  You know\nhow by the arts of astrology, geomancy, chiromancy, metopomancy, and others\nof a like stuff and nature, he foretelleth all things to come; let us talk\na little, and confer with him about your business.  Of that, answered\nPanurge, I know nothing; but of this much concerning him I am assured, that\none day, and that not long since, whilst he was prating to the great king\nof celestial, sublime, and transcendent things, the lacqueys and footboys\nof the court, upon the upper steps of stairs between two doors, jumbled,\none after another, as often as they listed, his wife, who is passable fair,\nand a pretty snug hussy.  Thus he who seemed very clearly to see all\nheavenly and terrestrial things without spectacles, who discoursed boldly\nof adventures past, with great confidence opened up present cases and\naccidents, and stoutly professed the presaging of all future events and\ncontingencies, was not able, with all the skill and cunning that he had, to\nperceive the bumbasting of his wife, whom he reputed to be very chaste, and\nhath not till this hour got notice of anything to the contrary.  Yet let us\ngo to him, seeing you will have it so; for surely we can never learn too\nmuch.  They on the very next ensuing day came to Herr Trippa's lodging.\nPanurge, by way of donative, presented him with a long gown lined all\nthrough with wolf-skins, with a short sword mounted with a gilded hilt and\ncovered with a velvet scabbard, and with fifty good single angels; then in\na familiar and friendly way did he ask of him his opinion touching the\naffair.  At the very first Herr Trippa, looking on him very wistly in the\nface, said unto him:  Thou hast the metoposcopy and physiognomy of a\ncuckold,--I say, of a notorious and infamous cuckold.  With this, casting\nan eye upon Panurge's right hand in all the parts thereof, he said, This\nrugged draught which I see here, just under the mount of Jove, was never\nyet but in the hand of a cuckold.  Afterwards, he with a white lead pen\nswiftly and hastily drew a certain number of diverse kinds of points, which\nby rules of geomancy he coupled and joined together; then said:  Truth\nitself is not truer than that it is certain thou wilt be a cuckold a little\nafter thy marriage.  That being done, he asked of Panurge the horoscope of\nhis nativity, which was no sooner by Panurge tendered unto him, than that,\nerecting a figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashioned a\ncomplete fabric of the houses of heaven in all their parts, whereof when he\nhad considered the situation and the aspects in their triplicities, he\nfetched a deep sigh, and said:  I have clearly enough already discovered\nunto you the fate of your cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot\nescape it.  And here have I got of new a further assurance thereof, so that\nI may now hardily pronounce and affirm, without any scruple or hesitation\nat all, that thou wilt be a cuckold; that furthermore, thou wilt be beaten\nby thine own wife, and that she will purloin, filch and steal of thy goods\nfrom thee; for I find the seventh house, in all its aspects, of a malignant\ninfluence, and every one of the planets threatening thee with disgrace,\naccording as they stand seated towards one another, in relation to the\nhorned signs of Aries, Taurus, and Capricorn.  In the fourth house I find\nJupiter in a decadence, as also in a tetragonal aspect to Saturn,\nassociated with Mercury.  Thou wilt be soundly peppered, my good, honest\nfellow, I warrant thee.  I will be? answered Panurge.  A plague rot thee,\nthou old fool and doting sot, how graceless and unpleasant thou art!  When\nall cuckolds shall be at a general rendezvous, thou shouldst be their\nstandard-bearer.  But whence comes this ciron-worm betwixt these two\nfingers?  This Panurge said, putting the forefinger of his left hand\nbetwixt the fore and mid finger of the right, which he thrust out towards\nHerr Trippa, holding them open after the manner of two horns, and shutting\ninto his fist his thumb with the other fingers.  Then, in turning to\nEpistemon, he said:  Lo here the true Olus of Martial, who addicted and\ndevoted himself wholly to the observing the miseries, crosses, and\ncalamities of others, whilst his own wife, in the interim, did keep an open\nbawdy-house.  This varlet is poorer than ever was Irus, and yet he is\nproud, vaunting, arrogant, self-conceited, overweening, and more\ninsupportable than seventeen devils; in one word, Ptochalazon, which term\nof old was applied to the like beggarly strutting coxcombs.  Come, let us\nleave this madpash bedlam, this hairbrained fop, and give him leave to rave\nand dose his bellyful with his private and intimately acquainted devils,\nwho, if they were not the very worst of all infernal fiends, would never\nhave deigned to serve such a knavish barking cur as this is.  He hath not\nlearnt the first precept of philosophy, which is, Know thyself; for whilst\nhe braggeth and boasteth that he can discern the least mote in the eye of\nanother, he is not able to see the huge block that puts out the sight of\nboth his eyes.  This is such another Polypragmon as is by Plutarch\ndescribed.  He is of the nature of the Lamian witches, who in foreign\nplaces, in the houses of strangers, in public, and amongst the common\npeople, had a sharper and more piercing inspection into their affairs than\nany lynx, but at home in their own proper dwelling-mansions were blinder\nthan moldwarps, and saw nothing at all.  For their custom was, at their\nreturn from abroad, when they were by themselves in private, to take their\neyes out of their head, from whence they were as easily removable as a pair\nof spectacles from their nose, and to lay them up into a wooden slipper\nwhich for that purpose did hang behind the door of their lodging.\n\nPanurge had no sooner done speaking, when Herr Trippa took into his hand a\ntamarisk branch.  In this, quoth Epistemon, he doth very well, right, and\nlike an artist, for Nicander calleth it the divinatory tree.  Have you a\nmind, quoth Herr Trippa, to have the truth of the matter yet more fully and\namply disclosed unto you by pyromancy, by aeromancy, whereof Aristophanes\nin his Clouds maketh great estimation, by hydromancy, by lecanomancy, of\nold in prime request amongst the Assyrians, and thoroughly tried by\nHermolaus Barbarus.  Come hither, and I will show thee in this platterful\nof fair fountain-water thy future wife lechering and sercroupierizing it\nwith two swaggering ruffians, one after another.  Yea, but have a special\ncare, quoth Panurge, when thou comest to put thy nose within mine arse,\nthat thou forget not to pull off thy spectacles.  Herr Trippa, going on in\nhis discourse, said, By catoptromancy, likewise held in such account by the\nEmperor Didius Julianus, that by means thereof he ever and anon foresaw all\nthat which at any time did happen or befall unto him.  Thou shalt not need\nto put on thy spectacles, for in a mirror thou wilt see her as clearly and\nmanifestly nebrundiated and billibodring it, as if I should show it in the\nfountain of the temple of Minerva near Patras.  By coscinomancy, most\nreligiously observed of old amidst the ceremonies of the ancient Romans.\nLet us have a sieve and shears, and thou shalt see devils.  By\nalphitomancy, cried up by Theocritus in his Pharmaceutria.  By alentomancy,\nmixing the flour of wheat with oatmeal.  By astragalomancy, whereof I have\nthe plots and models all at hand ready for the purpose.  By tyromancy,\nwhereof we make some proof in a great Brehemont cheese which I here keep by\nme.  By giromancy, if thou shouldst turn round circles, thou mightest\nassure thyself from me that they would fall always on the wrong side.  By\nsternomancy, which maketh nothing for thy advantage, for thou hast an\nill-proportioned stomach.  By libanomancy, for the which we shall need but\na little frankincense.  By gastromancy, which kind of ventral fatiloquency\nwas for a long time together used in Ferrara by Lady Giacoma Rodogina, the\nEngastrimythian prophetess.  By cephalomancy, often practised amongst the\nHigh Germans in their boiling of an ass's head upon burning coals.  By\nceromancy, where, by the means of wax dissolved into water, thou shalt see\nthe figure, portrait, and lively representation of thy future wife, and of\nher fredin fredaliatory belly-thumping blades.  By capnomancy.  O the\ngallantest and most excellent of all secrets!  By axionomancy; we want only\na hatchet and a jet-stone to be laid together upon a quick fire of hot\nembers.  O how bravely Homer was versed in the practice hereof towards\nPenelope's suitors!  By onymancy; for that we have oil and wax.  By\ntephromancy.  Thou wilt see the ashes thus aloft dispersed exhibiting thy\nwife in a fine posture.  By botanomancy; for the nonce I have some few\nleaves in reserve.  By sicomancy; O divine art in fig-tree leaves!  By\nicthiomancy, in ancient times so celebrated, and put in use by Tiresias and\nPolydamas, with the like certainty of event as was tried of old at the\nDina-ditch within that grove consecrated to Apollo which is in the\nterritory of the Lycians.  By choiromancy; let us have a great many hogs,\nand thou shalt have the bladder of one of them.  By cheromancy, as the bean\nis found in the cake at the Epiphany vigil.  By anthropomancy, practised by\nthe Roman Emperor Heliogabalus.  It is somewhat irksome, but thou wilt\nendure it well enough, seeing thou art destinated to be a cuckold.  By a\nsibylline stichomancy.  By onomatomancy.  How do they call thee?\nChaw-turd, quoth Panurge.  Or yet by alectryomancy.  If I should here with\na compass draw a round, and in looking upon thee, and considering thy lot,\ndivide the circumference thereof into four-and-twenty equal parts, then\nform a several letter of the alphabet upon every one of them; and, lastly,\nposit a barleycorn or two upon each of these so disposed letters, I durst\npromise upon my faith and honesty that, if a young virgin cock be permitted\nto range alongst and athwart them, he should only eat the grains which are\nset and placed upon these letters, A. C.U.C.K.O.L.D. T.H.O.U. S.H.A.L.T.\nB.E.  And that as fatidically as, under the Emperor Valens, most\nperplexedly desirous to know the name of him who should be his successor to\nthe empire, the cock vacticinating and alectryomantic ate up the pickles\nthat were posited on the letters T.H.E.O.D.  Or, for the more certainty,\nwill you have a trial of your fortune by the art of aruspiciny, by augury,\nor by extispiciny?  By turdispiciny, quoth Panurge.  Or yet by the mystery\nof necromancy?  I will, if you please, suddenly set up again and revive\nsomeone lately deceased, as Apollonius of Tyane did to Achilles, and the\nPythoness in the presence of Saul; which body, so raised up and\nrequickened, will tell us the sum of all you shall require of him:  no more\nnor less than, at the invocation of Erictho, a certain defunct person\nforetold to Pompey the whole progress and issue of the fatal battle fought\nin the Pharsalian fields.  Or, if you be afraid of the dead, as commonly\nall cuckolds are, I will make use of the faculty of sciomancy.\n\nGo, get thee gone, quoth Panurge, thou frantic ass, to the devil, and be\nbuggered, filthy Bardachio that thou art, by some Albanian, for a\nsteeple-crowned hat.  Why the devil didst not thou counsel me as well to\nhold an emerald or the stone of a hyaena under my tongue, or to furnish and\nprovide myself with tongues of whoops, and hearts of green frogs, or to eat\nof the liver and milt of some dragon, to the end that by those means I\nmight, at the chanting and chirping of swans and other fowls, understand the\nsubstance of my future lot and destiny, as did of old the Arabians in the\ncountry of Mesopotamia?  Fifteen brace of devils seize upon the body and\nsoul of this horned renegado, miscreant cuckold, the enchanter, witch, and\nsorcerer of Antichrist to all the devils of hell!  Let us return towards our\nking.  I am sure he will not be well pleased with us if he once come to get\nnotice that we have been in the kennel of this muffled devil.  I repent my\nbeing come hither.  I would willingly dispense with a hundred nobles and\nfourteen yeomans, on condition that he who not long since did blow in the\nbottom of my breeches should instantly with his squirting spittle inluminate\nhis moustaches.  O Lord God now! how the villain hath besmoked me with\nvexation and anger, with charms and witchcraft, and with a terrible coil and\nstir of infernal and Tartarian devils!  The devil take him!  Say Amen, and\nlet us go drink.  I shall not have any appetite for my victuals, how good\ncheer soever I make, these two days to come,--hardly these four.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXVI.\n\nHow Panurge consulteth with Friar John of the Funnels.\n\nPanurge was indeed very much troubled in mind and disquieted at the words\nof Herr Trippa, and therefore, as he passed by the little village of\nHuymes, after he had made his address to Friar John, in pecking at,\nrubbing, and scratching his own left ear, he said unto him, Keep me a\nlittle jovial and merry, my dear and sweet bully, for I find my brains\naltogether metagrabolized and confounded, and my spirits in a most dunsical\npuzzle at the bitter talk of this devilish, hellish, damned fool.

Give me thy advice freely, I beseech thee,\nShould I marry or no?  Friar John very merrily, and with a sprightly\ncheerfulness, made this answer to him:  Marry, in the devil's name.  Why\nnot?  What the devil else shouldst thou do but marry?  Take thee a wife,\nand furbish her harness to some tune.  Swinge her skin-coat as if thou wert\nbeating on stock-fish; and let the repercussion of thy clapper from her\nresounding metal make a noise as if a double peal of chiming-bells were\nhung at the cremasters of thy ballocks.  As I say marry, so do I understand\nthat thou shouldst fall to work as speedily as may be; yea, my meaning is\nthat thou oughtest to be so quick and forward therein, as on this same very\nday, before sunset, to cause proclaim thy banns of matrimony, and make\nprovision of bedsteads.  By the blood of a hog's-pudding, till when wouldst\nthou delay the acting of a husband's part?  Dost thou not know, and is it\nnot daily told unto thee, that the end of the world approacheth?  We are\nnearer it by three poles and half a fathom than we were two days ago.  The\nAntichrist is already born; at least it is so reported by many.  The truth\nis, that hitherto the effects of his wrath have not reached further than to\nthe scratching of his nurse and governesses.  His nails are not sharp\nenough as yet, nor have his claws attained to their full growth,--he is\nlittle.\n\n  Crescat; Nos qui vivimus, multiplicemur.\n\nIt is written so, and it is holy stuff, I warrant you; the truth whereof is\nlike to last as long as a sack of corn may be had for a penny, and a\npuncheon of pure wine for threepence.  Wouldst thou be content to be found\nwith thy genitories full in the day of judgment?  Dum venerit judicari?\nThou hast, quoth Panurge, a right, clear, and neat spirit, Friar John, my\nmetropolitan cod; thou speakst in very deed pertinently and to purpose.\nThat belike was the reason which moved Leander of Abydos in Asia, whilst he\nwas swimming through the Hellespontic sea to make a visit to his sweetheart\nHero of Sestus in Europe, to pray unto Neptune and all the other marine\ngods, thus:\n\n  Now, whilst I go, have pity on me,\n  And at my back returning drown me.\n\nHe was loth, it seems, to die with his cods overgorged.  He was to be\ncommended; therefore do I promise, that from henceforth no malefactor shall\nby justice be executed within my jurisdiction of Salmigondinois, who shall\nnot, for a day or two at least before, be permitted to culbut and\nforaminate onocrotalwise, that there remain not in all his vessels to write\na Greek Y.  Such a precious thing should not be foolishly cast away.  He\nwill perhaps therewith beget a male, and so depart the more contentedly out\nof this life, that he shall have left behind him one for one.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXVII.\n\nHow Friar John merrily and sportingly counselleth Panurge.\n\nBy Saint Rigomet, quoth Friar John, I do advise thee to nothing, my dear\nfriend Panurge, which I would not do myself were I in thy place.  Only have\na special care, and take good heed thou solder well together the joints of\nthe double-backed and two-bellied beast, and fortify thy nerves so\nstrongly, that there be no discontinuance in the knocks of the venerean\nthwacking, else thou art lost, poor soul.  For if there pass long intervals\nbetwixt the priapizing feats, and that thou make an intermission of too\nlarge a time, that will befall thee which betides the nurses if they desist\nfrom giving suck to children--they lose their milk; and if continually thou\ndo not hold thy aspersory tool in exercise, and keep thy mentul going, thy\nlacticinian nectar will be gone, and it will serve thee only as a pipe to\npiss out at, and thy cods for a wallet of lesser value than a beggar's\nscrip.  This is a certain truth I tell thee, friend, and doubt not of it;\nfor myself have seen the sad experiment thereof in many, who cannot now do\nwhat they would, because before they did not what they might have done:  Ex\ndesuetudine amittuntur privilegia.  Non-usage oftentimes destroys one's\nright, say the learned doctors of the law; therefore, my billy, entertain\nas well as possibly thou canst that hypogastrian lower sort of troglodytic\npeople, that their chief pleasure may be placed in the case of sempiternal\nlabouring.  Give order that henceforth they live not, like idle gentlemen,\nidly upon their rents and revenues, but that they may work for their\nlivelihood by breaking ground within the Paphian trenches.  Nay truly,\nanswered Panurge, Friar John, my left ballock, I will believe thee, for\nthou dealest plain with me, and fallest downright square upon the business,\nwithout going about the bush with frivolous circumstances and unnecessary\nreservations.  Thou with the splendour of a piercing wit hast dissipated\nall the lowering clouds of anxious apprehensions and suspicions which did\nintimidate and terrify me; therefore the heavens be pleased to grant to\nthee at all she-conflicts a stiff-standing fortune.  Well then, as thou\nhast said, so will I do; I will, in good faith, marry,--in that point there\nshall be no failing, I promise thee,--and shall have always by me pretty\ngirls clothed with the name of my wife's waiting-maids, that, lying under\nthy wings, thou mayest be night-protector of their sisterhood.\n\nLet this serve for the first part of the sermon.  Hearken, quoth Friar\nJohn, to the oracle of the bells of Varenes.  What say they?  I hear and\nunderstand them, quoth Panurge; their sound is, by my thirst, more\nuprightly fatidical than that of Jove's great kettles in Dodona.  Hearken!\nTake thee a wife, take thee a wife, and marry, marry, marry; for if thou\nmarry, thou shalt find good therein, herein, here in a wife thou shalt find\ngood; so marry, marry.  I will assure thee that I shall be married; all the\nelements invite and prompt me to it.  Let this word be to thee a brazen\nwall, by diffidence not to be broken through.  As for the second part of\nthis our doctrine,--thou seemest in some measure to mistrust the readiness\nof my paternity in the practising of my placket-racket within the\nAphrodisian tennis-court at all times fitting, as if the stiff god of\ngardens were not favourable to me.  I pray thee, favour me so much as to\nbelieve that I still have him at a beck, attending always my commandments,\ndocile, obedient, vigorous, and active in all things and everywhere, and\nnever stubborn or refractory to my will or pleasure.  I need no more but to\nlet go the reins, and slacken the leash, which is the belly-point, and when\nthe game is shown unto him, say, Hey, Jack, to thy booty! he will not fail\neven then to flesh himself upon his prey, and tuzzle it to some purpose.\nHereby you may perceive, although my future wife were as unsatiable and\ngluttonous in her voluptuousness and the delights of venery as ever was the\nEmpress Messalina, or yet the Marchioness (of Oincester) in England, and I\ndesire thee to give credit to it, that I lack not for what is requisite to\noverlay the stomach of her lust, but have wherewith aboundingly to please\nher.  I am not ignorant that Solomon said, who indeed of that matter\nspeaketh clerklike and learnedly,--as also how Aristotle after him declared\nfor a truth that, for the greater part, the lechery of a woman is ravenous\nand unsatisfiable.  Nevertheless, let such as are my friends who read those\npassages receive from me for a most real verity, that I for such a Jill\nhave a fit Jack; and that, if women's things cannot be satiated, I have an\ninstrument indefatigable,--an implement as copious in the giving as can in\ncraving be their vade mecums.  Do not here produce ancient examples of the\nparagons of paillardice, and offer to match with my testiculatory ability\nthe Priapaean prowess of the fabulous fornicators, Hercules, Proculus\nCaesar, and Mahomet, who in his Alkoran doth vaunt that in his cods he had\nthe vigour of three score bully ruffians; but let no zealous Christian\ntrust the rogue,--the filthy ribald rascal is a liar.  Nor shalt thou need\nto urge authorities, or bring forth the instance of the Indian prince of\nwhom Theophrastus, Plinius, and Athenaeus testify, that with the help of a\ncertain herb he was able, and had given frequent experiments thereof, to\ntoss his sinewy piece of generation in the act of carnal concupiscence\nabove three score and ten times in the space of four-and-twenty hours.  Of\nthat I believe nothing, the number is supposititious, and too prodigally\nfoisted in.  Give no faith unto it, I beseech thee, but prithee trust me in\nthis, and thy credulity therein shall not be wronged, for it is true, and\nprobatum est, that my pioneer of nature--the sacred ithyphallian champion\n--is of all stiff-intruding blades the primest.  Come hither, my ballocket,\nand hearken.  Didst thou ever see the monk of Castre's cowl?  When in any\nhouse it was laid down, whether openly in the view of all or covertly out\nof the sight of any, such was the ineffable virtue thereof for excitating\nand stirring up the people of both sexes unto lechery, that the whole\ninhabitants and indwellers, not only of that, but likewise of all the\ncircumjacent places thereto, within three leagues around it, did suddenly\nenter into rut, both beasts and folks, men and women, even to the dogs and\nhogs, rats and cats.\n\nI swear to thee that many times heretofore I have perceived and found in my\ncodpiece a certain kind of energy or efficacious virtue much more irregular\nand of a greater anomaly than what I have related.  I will not speak to\nthee either of house or cottage, nor of church or market, but only tell\nthee, that once at the representation of the Passion, which was acted at\nSaint Maxents, I had no sooner entered within the pit of the theatre, but\nthat forthwith, by the virtue and occult property of it, on a sudden all\nthat were there, both players and spectators, did fall into such an\nexorbitant temptation of lust, that there was not angel, man, devil, nor\ndeviless upon the place who would not then have bricollitched it with all\ntheir heart and soul.  The prompter forsook his copy, he who played\nMichael's part came down to rights, the devils issued out of hell and\ncarried along with them most of the pretty little girls that were there;\nyea, Lucifer got out of his fetters; in a word, seeing the huge disorder, I\ndisparked myself forth of that enclosed place, in imitation of Cato the\nCensor, who perceiving, by reason of his presence, the Floralian festivals\nout of order, withdrew himself.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXVIII.\n\nHow Friar John comforteth Panurge in the doubtful matter of cuckoldry.\n\nI understand thee well enough, said Friar John; but time makes all things\nplain.  The most durable marble or porphyry is subject to old age and\ndecay.  Though for the present thou possibly be not weary of the exercise,\nyet is it like I will hear thee confess a few years hence that thy cods\nhang dangling downwards for want of a better truss.  I see thee waxing a\nlittle hoar-headed already.  Thy beard, by the distinction of grey, white,\ntawny, and black, hath to my thinking the resemblance of a map of the\nterrestrial globe or geographical chart.  Look attentively upon and take\ninspection of what I shall show unto thee.  Behold there Asia.  Here are\nTigris and Euphrates.  Lo there Afric.  Here is the mountain of the Moon,\n--yonder thou mayst perceive the fenny march of Nilus.  On this side lieth\nEurope.  Dost thou not see the Abbey of Theleme?  This little tuft, which\nis altogether white, is the Hyperborean Hills.  By the thirst of my\nthropple, friend, when snow is on the mountains, I say the head and the\nchin, there is not then any considerable heat to be expected in the valleys\nand low countries of the codpiece.  By the kibes of thy heels, quoth\nPanurge, thou dost not understand the topics.  When snow is on the tops of\nthe hills, lightning, thunder, tempest, whirlwinds, storms, hurricanes, and\nall the devils of hell rage in the valleys.  Wouldst thou see the\nexperience thereof, go to the territory of the Switzers and earnestly\nperpend with thyself there the situation of the lake of Wunderberlich,\nabout four leagues distant from Berne, on the Syon-side of the land.  Thou\ntwittest me with my grey hairs, yet considerest not how I am of the nature\nof leeks, which with a white head carry a green, fresh, straight, and\nvigorous tail.  The truth is, nevertheless (why should I deny it), that I\nnow and then discern in myself some indicative signs of old age.  Tell\nthis, I prithee, to nobody, but let it be kept very close and secret\nbetwixt us two; for I find the wine much sweeter now, more savoury to my\ntaste, and unto my palate of a better relish than formerly I was wont to\ndo; and withal, besides mine accustomed manner, I have a more dreadful\napprehension than I ever heretofore have had of lighting on bad wine.  Note\nand observe that this doth argue and portend I know not what of the west\nand occident of my time, and signifieth that the south and meridian of mine\nage is past.  But what then, my gentle companion?  That doth but betoken\nthat I will hereafter drink so much the more.  That is not, the devil hale\nit, the thing that I fear; nor is it there where my shoe pinches.  The\nthing that I doubt most, and have greatest reason to dread and suspect is,\nthat through some long absence of our King Pantagruel (to whom I must needs\nbear company should he go to all the devils of Barathrum), my future wife\nshall make me a cuckold.  This is, in truth, the long and short on't.  For\nI am by all those whom I have spoke to menaced and threatened with a horned\nfortune, and all of them affirm it is the lot to which from heaven I am\npredestinated.  Everyone, answered Friar John, that would be a cuckold is\nnot one.  If it be thy fate to be hereafter of the number of that horned\ncattle, then may I conclude with an Ergo, thy wife will be beautiful, and\nErgo, thou wilt be kindly used by her.  Likewise with this Ergo, thou shalt\nbe blessed with the fruition of many friends and well-willers.  And finally\nwith this other Ergo, thou shalt be saved and have a place in Paradise.\nThese are monachal topics and maxims of the cloister.  Thou mayst take more\nliberty to sin.  Thou shalt be more at ease than ever.  There will be never\nthe less left for thee, nothing diminished, but thy goods shall increase\nnotably.  And if so be it was preordinated for thee, wouldst thou be so\nimpious as not to acquiesce in thy destiny?  Speak, thou jaded cod.\n\nFaded C.           Louting C.

Wouldst thou disorder all the celestial spheres, blame the\nintelligences, blunt the spindles, joint the wherves, slander the spinning\nquills, reproach the bobbins, revile the clew-bottoms, and finally ravel\nand untwist all the threads of both the warp and the waft of the weird\nSister-Parcae?  What a pox to thy bones dost thou mean, stony cod?  Thou\nwouldst if thou couldst, a great deal worse than the giants of old intended\nto have done.  Come hither, billicullion.  Whether wouldst thou be jealous\nwithout cause, or be a cuckold and know nothing of it?  Neither the one nor\nthe other, quoth Panurge, would I choose to be.  But if I get an inkling of\nthe matter, I will provide well enough, or there shall not be one stick of\nwood within five hundred leagues about me whereof to make a cudgel.  In\ngood faith, Friar John, I speak now seriously unto thee, I think it will be\nmy best not to marry.  Hearken to what the bells do tell me, now that we\nare nearer to them!  Do not marry, marry not, not, not, not, not; marry,\nmarry not, not, not, not, not.  If thou marry, thou wilt miscarry, carry,\ncarry; thou'lt repent it, resent it, sent it!  If thou marry, thou a\ncuckold, a cou-cou-cuckoo, cou-cou-cuckold thou shalt be.  By the worthy\nwrath of God, I begin to be angry.  This campanilian oracle fretteth me to\nthe guts,--a March hare was never in such a chafe as I am.  O how I am\nvexed!  You monks and friars of the cowl-pated and hood-polled fraternity,\nhave you no remedy nor salve against this malady of graffing horns in\nheads?  Hath nature so abandoned humankind, and of her help left us so\ndestitute, that married men cannot know how to sail through the seas of\nthis mortal life and be safe from the whirlpools, quicksands, rocks, and\nbanks that lie alongst the coast of Cornwall.\n\nI will, said Friar John, show thee a way and teach thee an expedient by\nmeans whereof thy wife shall never make thee a cuckold without thy\nknowledge and thine own consent.  Do me the favour, I pray thee, quoth\nPanurge, my pretty, soft, downy cod; now tell it, billy, tell it, I beseech\nthee.  Take, quoth Friar John, Hans Carvel's ring upon thy finger, who was\nthe King of Melinda's chief jeweller.  Besides that this Hans Carvel had\nthe reputation of being very skilful and expert in the lapidary's\nprofession, he was a studious, learned, and ingenious man, a scientific\nperson, full of knowledge, a great philosopher, of a sound judgment, of a\nprime wit, good sense, clear spirited, an honest creature, courteous,\ncharitable, a giver of alms, and of a jovial humour, a boon companion, and\na merry blade, if ever there was any in the world.  He was somewhat\ngorbellied, had a little shake in his head, and was in effect unwieldy of\nhis body.  In his old age he took to wife the Bailiff of Concordat's\ndaughter, young, fair, jolly, gallant, spruce, frisk, brisk, neat, feat,\nsmirk, smug, compt, quaint, gay, fine, tricksy, trim, decent, proper,\ngraceful, handsome, beautiful, comely, and kind--a little too much--to her\nneighbours and acquaintance.\n\nHereupon it fell out, after the expiring of a scantling of weeks, that\nMaster Carvel became as jealous as a tiger, and entered into a very\nprofound suspicion that his new-married gixy did keep a-buttock-stirring\nwith others.  To prevent which inconveniency he did tell her many tragical\nstories of the total ruin of several kingdoms by adultery; did read unto\nher the legend of chaste wives; then made some lectures to her in the\npraise of the choice virtue of pudicity, and did present her with a book in\ncommendation of conjugal fidelity; wherein the wickedness of all licentious\nwomen was odiously detested; and withal he gave her a chain enriched with\npure oriental sapphires.  Notwithstanding all this, he found her always\nmore and more inclined to the reception of her neighbour copes-mates, that\nday by day his jealousy increased.  In sequel whereof, one night as he was\nlying by her, whilst in his sleep the rambling fancies of the lecherous\ndeportments of his wife did take up the cellules of his brain, he dreamt\nthat he encountered with the devil, to whom he had discovered to the full\nthe buzzing of his head and suspicion that his wife did tread her shoe\nawry.  The devil, he thought, in this perplexity did for his comfort give\nhim a ring, and therewithal did kindly put it on his middle finger, saying,\nHans Carvel, I give thee this ring,--whilst thou carriest it upon that\nfinger, thy wife shall never carnally be known by any other than thyself\nwithout thy special knowledge and consent.  Gramercy, quoth Hans Carvel, my\nlord devil, I renounce Mahomet if ever it shall come off my finger.  The\ndevil vanished, as is his custom; and then Hans Carvel, full of joy\nawaking, found that his middle finger was as far as it could reach within\nthe what-do-by-call-it of his wife.  I did forget to tell thee how his\nwife, as soon as she had felt the finger there, said, in recoiling her\nbuttocks, Off, yes, nay, tut, pish, tush, ay, lord, that is not the thing\nwhich should be put up in that place.  With this Hans Carvel thought that\nsome pilfering fellow was about to take the ring from him.  Is not this an\ninfallible and sovereign antidote?  Therefore, if thou wilt believe me, in\nimitation of this example never fail to have continually the ring of thy\nwife's commodity upon thy finger.  When that was said, their discourse and\ntheir way ended.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel convocated together a theologian, physician, lawyer, and\nphilosopher, for extricating Panurge out of the perplexity wherein he was.\n\nNo sooner were they come into the royal palace, but they to the full made\nreport unto Pantagruel of the success of their expedition, and showed him\nthe response of Raminagrobis.  When Pantagruel had read it over and over\nagain, the oftener he perused it being the better pleased therewith, he\nsaid, in addressing his speech to Panurge, I have not as yet seen any\nanswer framed to your demand which affordeth me more contentment.  For in\nthis his succinct copy of verses, he summarily and briefly, yet fully\nenough expresseth how he would have us to understand that everyone in the\nproject and enterprise of marriage ought to be his own carver, sole\narbitrator of his proper thoughts, and from himself alone take counsel in\nthe main and peremptory closure of what his determination should be, in\neither his assent to or dissent from it.  Such always hath been my opinion\nto you, and when at first you spoke thereof to me I truly told you this\nsame very thing; but tacitly you scorned my advice, and would not harbour\nit within your mind.  I know for certain, and therefore may I with the\ngreater confidence utter my conception of it, that philauty, or self-love,\nis that which blinds your judgment and deceiveth you.\n\nLet us do otherwise, and that is this:  Whatever we are, or have,\nconsisteth in three things--the soul, the body, and the goods.  Now, for\nthe preservation of these three, there are three sorts of learned men\nordained, each respectively to have care of that one which is recommended\nto his charge.  Theologues are appointed for the soul, physicians for the\nwelfare of the body, and lawyers for the safety of our goods.  Hence it is\nthat it is my resolution to have on Sunday next with me at dinner a divine,\na physician, and a lawyer, that with those three assembled thus together we\nmay in every point and particle confer at large of your perplexity.  By\nSaint Picot, answered Panurge, we never shall do any good that way, I see\nit already.  And you see yourself how the world is vilely abused, as when\nwith a foxtail one claps another's breech to cajole him.  We give our souls\nto keep to the theologues, who for the greater part are heretics.  Our\nbodies we commit to the physicians, who never themselves take any physic.\nAnd then we entrust our goods to the lawyers, who never go to law against\none another.  You speak like a courtier, quoth Pantagruel.  But the first\npoint of your assertion is to be denied; for we daily see how good\ntheologues make it their chief business, their whole and sole employment,\nby their deeds, their words, and writings, to extirpate errors and heresies\nout of the hearts of men, and in their stead profoundly plant the true and\nlively faith.  The second point you spoke of I commend; for, whereas the\nprofessors of the art of medicine give so good order to the prophylactic,\nor conservative part of their faculty, in what concerneth their proper\nhealths, that they stand in no need of making use of the other branch,\nwhich is the curative or therapeutic, by medicaments.  As for the third, I\ngrant it to be true, for learned advocates and counsellors at law are so\nmuch taken up with the affairs of others in their consultations, pleadings,\nand such-like patrocinations of those who are their clients, that they have\nno leisure to attend any controversies of their own.  Therefore, on the\nnext ensuing Sunday, let the divine be our godly Father Hippothadee, the\nphysician our honest Master Rondibilis, and our legist our friend\nBridlegoose.  Nor will it be (to my thinking) amiss, that we enter into the\nPythagoric field, and choose for an assistant to the three afore-named\ndoctors our ancient faithful acquaintance, the philosopher Trouillogan;\nespecially seeing a perfect philosopher, such as is Trouillogan, is able\npositively to resolve all whatsoever doubts you can propose.  Carpalin,\nhave you a care to have them here all four on Sunday next at dinner,\nwithout fail.\n\nI believe, quoth Epistemon, that throughout the whole country, in all the\ncorners thereof, you could not have pitched upon such other four.  Which I\nspeak not so much in regard of the most excellent qualifications and\naccomplishments wherewith all of them are endowed for the respective\ndischarge and management of each his own vocation and calling (wherein\nwithout all doubt or controversy they are the paragons of the land, and\nsurpass all others), as for that Rondibilis is married now, who before was\nnot,--Hippothadee was not before, nor is yet,--Bridlegoose was married\nonce, but is not now,--and Trouillogan is married now, who wedded was to\nanother wife before.  Sir, if it may stand with your good liking, I will\nease Carpalin of some parcel of his labour, and invite Bridlegoose myself,\nwith whom I of a long time have had a very intimate familiarity, and unto\nwhom I am to speak on the behalf of a pretty hopeful youth who now studieth\nat Toulouse, under the most learned virtuous doctor Boissonet.  Do what you\ndeem most expedient, quoth Pantagruel, and tell me if my recommendation can\nin anything be steadable for the promoval of the good of that youth, or\notherwise serve for bettering of the dignity and office of the worthy\nBoissonet, whom I do so love and respect for one of the ablest and most\nsufficient in his way that anywhere are extant.  Sir, I will use therein my\nbest endeavours, and heartily bestir myself about it.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXX.\n\nHow the theologue, Hippothadee, giveth counsel to Panurge in the matter and\nbusiness of his nuptial enterprise.\n\nThe dinner on the subsequent Sunday was no sooner made ready than that the\nafore-named invited guests gave thereto their appearance, all of them,\nBridlegoose only excepted, who was the deputy-governor of Fonsbeton.  At\nthe ushering in of the second service Panurge, making a low reverence,\nspake thus:  Gentlemen, the question I am to propound unto you shall be\nuttered in very few words--Should I marry or no?  If my doubt herein be not\nresolved by you, I shall hold it altogether insolvable, as are the\nInsolubilia de Aliaco; for all of you are elected, chosen, and culled out\nfrom amongst others, everyone in his own condition and quality, like so\nmany picked peas on a carpet.\n\nThe Father Hippothadee, in obedience to the bidding of Pantagruel, and with\nmuch courtesy to the company, answered exceeding modestly after this\nmanner:  My friend, you are pleased to ask counsel of us; but first you\nmust consult with yourself.  Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your\nbody by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?  That I do,\nquoth Panurge, in a hugely strong and almost irresistible measure.  Be not\noffended, I beseech you, good father, at the freedom of my expression.  No\ntruly, friend, not I, quoth Hippothadee, there is no reason why I should be\ndispleased therewith.  But in this carnal strife and debate of yours have\nyou obtained from God the gift and special grace of continency?  In good\nfaith, not, quoth Panurge.  My counsel to you in that case, my friend, is\nthat you marry, quoth Hippothadee; for you should rather choose to marry\nonce than to burn still in fires of concupiscence.  Then Panurge, with a\njovial heart and a loud voice, cried out, That is spoke gallantly, without\ncircumbilivaginating about and about, and never hitting it in its centred\npoint.  Gramercy, my good father!  In truth I am resolved now to marry, and\nwithout fail I shall do it quickly.  I invite you to my wedding.  By the\nbody of a hen, we shall make good cheer, and be as merry as crickets.  You\nshall wear the bridegroom's colours, and, if we eat a goose, my wife shall\nnot roast it for me.  I will entreat you to lead up the first dance of the\nbridesmaids, if it may please you to do me so much favour and honour.\nThere resteth yet a small difficulty, a little scruple, yea, even less than\nnothing, whereof I humbly crave your resolution.  Shall I be a cuckold,\nfather, yea or no?  By no means, answered Hippothadee, will you be\ncuckolded, if it please God.  O the Lord help us now, quoth Panurge;\nwhither are we driven to, good folks?  To the conditionals, which,\naccording to the rules and precepts of the dialectic faculty, admit of all\ncontradictions and impossibilities.  If my Transalpine mule had wings, my\nTransalpine mule would fly, if it please God, I shall not be a cuckold; but\nI shall be a cuckold, if it please him.  Good God, if this were a condition\nwhich I knew how to prevent, my hopes should be as high as ever, nor would\nI despair.  But you here send me to God's privy council, to the closet of\nhis little pleasures.  You, my French countrymen, which is the way you take\nto go thither?\n\nMy honest father, I believe it will be your best not to come to my wedding.\nThe clutter and dingle-dangle noise of marriage guests will but disturb\nyou, and break the serious fancies of your brain.  You love repose, with\nsolitude and silence; I really believe you will not come.  And then you\ndance but indifferently, and would be out of countenance at the first\nentry.  I will send you some good things to your chamber, together with the\nbride's favour, and there you may drink our health, if it may stand with\nyour good liking.  My friend, quoth Hippothadee, take my words in the sense\nwherein I meant them, and do not misinterpret me.  When I tell you,--If it\nplease God,--do I to you any wrong therein?  Is it an ill expression?  Is\nit a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?  Do\nnot we thereby honour the Lord God Almighty, Creator, Protector, and\nConserver of all things?  Is not that a mean whereby we do acknowledge him\nto be the sole giver of all whatsoever is good?  Do not we in that manifest\nour faith that we believe all things to depend upon his infinite and\nincomprehensible bounty, and that without him nothing can be produced, nor\nafter its production be of any value, force, or power, without the\nconcurring aid and favour of his assisting grace?  Is it not a canonical\nand authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?  Is\nit not expedient that what we propose unto ourselves be still referred to\nwhat shall be disposed of by the sacred will of God, unto which all things\nmust acquiesce in the heavens as well as on the earth?  Is not that verily\na sanctifying of his holy name?  My friend, you shall not be a cuckold, if\nit please God, nor shall we need to despair of the knowledge of his good\nwill and pleasure herein, as if it were such an abstruse and mysteriously\nhidden secret that for the clear understanding thereof it were necessary to\nconsult with those of his celestial privy council, or expressly make a\nvoyage unto the empyrean chamber where order is given for the effectuating\nof his most holy pleasures.  The great God hath done us this good, that he\nhath declared and revealed them to us openly and plainly, and described\nthem in the Holy Bible.  There will you find that you shall never be a\ncuckold, that is to say, your wife shall never be a strumpet, if you make\nchoice of one of a commendable extraction, descended of honest parents, and\ninstructed in all piety and virtue--such a one as hath not at any time\nhaunted or frequented the company or conversation of those that are of\ncorrupt and depraved manners, one loving and fearing God, who taketh a\nsingular delight in drawing near to him by faith and the cordial observing\nof his sacred commandments--and finally, one who, standing in awe of the\nDivine Majesty of the Most High, will be loth to offend him and lose the\nfavourable kindness of his grace through any defect of faith or\ntransgression against the ordinances of his holy law, wherein adultery is\nmost rigorously forbidden and a close adherence to her husband alone most\nstrictly and severely enjoined; yea, in such sort that she is to cherish,\nserve, and love him above anything, next to God, that meriteth to be\nbeloved.  In the interim, for the better schooling of her in these\ninstructions, and that the wholesome doctrine of a matrimonial duty may\ntake the deeper root in her mind, you must needs carry yourself so on your\npart, and your behaviour is to be such, that you are to go before her in a\ngood example, by entertaining her unfeignedly with a conjugal amity, by\ncontinually approving yourself in all your words and actions a faithful and\ndiscreet husband; and by living, not only at home and privately with your\nown household and family, but in the face also of all men and open view of\nthe world, devoutly, virtuously, and chastely, as you would have her on her\nside to deport and to demean herself towards you, as becomes a godly,\nloyal, and respectful wife, who maketh conscience to keep inviolable the\ntie of a matrimonial oath.  For as that looking-glass is not the best which\nis most decked with gold and precious stones, but that which representeth\nto the eye the liveliest shapes of objects set before it, even so that wife\nshould not be most esteemed who richest is and of the noblest race, but she\nwho, fearing God, conforms herself nearest unto the humour of her husband.\n\nConsider how the moon doth not borrow her light from Jupiter, Mars,\nMercury, or any other of the planets, nor yet from any of those splendid\nstars which are set in the spangled firmament, but from her husband only,\nthe bright sun, which she receiveth from him more or less, according to the\nmanner of his aspect and variously bestowed eradiations.  Just so should\nyou be a pattern to your wife in virtue, goodly zeal, and true devotion,\nthat by your radiance in darting on her the aspect of an exemplary\ngoodness, she, in your imitation, may outshine the luminaries of all other\nwomen.  To this effect you daily must implore God's grace to the protection\nof you both.  You would have me then, quoth Panurge, twisting the whiskers\nof his beard on either side with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand,\nto espouse and take to wife the prudent frugal woman described by Solomon.\nWithout all doubt she is dead, and truly to my best remembrance I never saw\nher; the Lord forgive me!  Nevertheless, I thank you, father.  Eat this\nslice of marchpane, it will help your digestion; then shall you be\npresented with a cup of claret hippocras, which is right healthful and\nstomachal.  Let us proceed.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXI.\n\nHow the physician Rondibilis counselleth Panurge.\n\nPanurge, continuing his discourse, said, The first word which was spoken by\nhim who gelded the lubberly, quaffing monks of Saussiniac, after that he\nhad unstoned Friar Cauldaureil, was this, To the rest.  In like manner, I\nsay, To the rest.  Therefore I beseech you, my good Master Rondibilis,\nshould I marry or not?  By the raking pace of my mule, quoth Rondibilis, I\nknow not what answer to make to this problem of yours.\n\nYou say that you feel in you the pricking stings of sensuality, by which\nyou are stirred up to venery.  I find in our faculty of medicine, and we\nhave founded our opinion therein upon the deliberate resolution and final\ndecision of the ancient Platonics, that carnal concupiscence is cooled and\nquelled five several ways.\n\nFirst, By the means of wine.  I shall easily believe that, quoth Friar\nJohn, for when I am well whittled with the juice of the grape I care for\nnothing else, so I may sleep.  When I say, quoth Rondibilis, that wine\nabateth lust, my meaning is, wine immoderately taken; for by intemperancy\nproceeding from the excessive drinking of strong liquor there is brought\nupon the body of such a swill-down boozer a chillness in the blood, a\nslackening in the sinews, a dissipation of the generative seed, a numbness\nand hebetation of the senses, with a perversive wryness and convulsion of\nthe muscles--all which are great lets and impediments to the act of\ngeneration.  Hence it is that Bacchus, the god of bibbers, tipplers, and\ndrunkards, is most commonly painted beardless and clad in a woman's habit,\nas a person altogether effeminate, or like a libbed eunuch.  Wine,\nnevertheless, taken moderately, worketh quite contrary effects, as is\nimplied by the old proverb, which saith that Venus takes cold when not\naccompanied with Ceres and Bacchus.  This opinion is of great antiquity, as\nappeareth by the testimony of Diodorus the Sicilian, and confirmed by\nPausanias, and universally held amongst the Lampsacians, that Don Priapus\nwas the son of Bacchus and Venus.\n\nSecondly, The fervency of lust is abated by certain drugs, plants, herbs,\nand roots, which make the taker cold, maleficiated, unfit for, and unable\nto perform the act of generation; as hath been often experimented in the\nwater-lily, heraclea, agnus castus, willow-twigs, hemp-stalks, woodbine,\nhoneysuckle, tamarisk, chaste tree, mandrake, bennet, keckbugloss, the skin\nof a hippopotam, and many other such, which, by convenient doses\nproportioned to the peccant humour and constitution of the patient, being\nduly and seasonably received within the body--what by their elementary\nvirtues on the one side and peculiar properties on the other--do either\nbenumb, mortify, and beclumpse with cold the prolific semence, or scatter\nand disperse the spirits which ought to have gone along with and conducted\nthe sperm to the places destined and appointed for its reception, or\nlastly, shut up, stop, and obstruct the ways, passages, and conduits\nthrough which the seed should have been expelled, evacuated, and ejected.\nWe have nevertheless of those ingredients which, being of a contrary\noperation, heat the blood, bend the nerves, unite the spirits, quicken the\nsenses, strengthen the muscles, and thereby rouse up, provoke, excite, and\nenable a man to the vigorous accomplishment of the feat of amorous\ndalliance.  I have no need of those, quoth Panurge, God be thanked, and\nyou, my good master.  Howsoever, I pray you, take no exception or offence\nat these my words; for what I have said was not out of any illwill I did\nbear to you, the Lord he knows.\n\nThirdly, The ardour of lechery is very much subdued and mated by frequent\nlabour and continual toiling.  For by painful exercises and laborious\nworking so great a dissolution is brought upon the whole body, that the\nblood, which runneth alongst the channels of the veins thereof for the\nnourishment and alimentation of each of its members, hath neither time,\nleisure, nor power to afford the seminal resudation, or superfluity of the\nthird concoction, which nature most carefully reserves for the conservation\nof the individual, whose preservation she more heedfully regardeth than the\npropagating of the species and the multiplication of humankind.  Whence it\nis that Diana is said to be chaste, because she is never idle, but always\nbusied about her hunting.  For the same reason was a camp or leaguer of old\ncalled castrum, as if they would have said castum; because the soldiers,\nwrestlers, runners, throwers of the bar, and other such-like athletic\nchampions as are usually seen in a military circumvallation, do incessantly\ntravail and turmoil, and are in a perpetual stir and agitation.  To this\npurpose Hippocrates also writeth in his book, De Aere, Aqua et Locis, that\nin his time there were people in Scythia as impotent as eunuchs in the\ndischarge of a venerean exploit, because that without any cessation, pause,\nor respite they were never from off horseback, or otherwise assiduously\nemployed in some troublesome and molesting drudgery.\n\nOn the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto, the philosophers\nsay that idleness is the mother of luxury.  When it was asked Ovid, Why\nAegisthus became an adulterer? he made no other answer but this, Because he\nwas idle.  Who were able to rid the world of loitering and laziness might\neasily frustrate and disappoint Cupid of all his designs, aims, engines,\nand devices, and so disable and appal him that his bow, quiver, and darts\nshould from thenceforth be a mere needless load and burden to him, for that\nit could not then lie in his power to strike or wound any of either sex\nwith all the arms he had.  He is not, I believe, so expert an archer as\nthat he can hit the cranes flying in the air, or yet the young stags\nskipping through the thickets, as the Parthians knew well how to do; that\nis to say, people moiling, stirring and hurrying up and down, restless, and\nwithout repose.  He must have those hushed, still, quiet, lying at a stay,\nlither, and full of ease, whom he is able, though his mother help him, to\ntouch, much less to pierce with all his arrows.  In confirmation hereof,\nTheophrastus, being asked on a time what kind of beast or thing he judged a\ntoyish, wanton love to be? he made answer, that it was a passion of idle\nand sluggish spirits.  From which pretty description of tickling\nlove-tricks that of Diogenes's hatching was not very discrepant, when he\ndefined lechery the occupation of folks destitute of all other occupation.\nFor this cause the Syconian engraver Canachus, being desirous to give us to\nunderstand that sloth, drowsiness, negligence, and laziness were the prime\nguardians and governesses of ribaldry, made the statue of Venus, not\nstanding, as other stone-cutters had used to do, but sitting.\n\nFourthly, The tickling pricks of incontinency are blunted by an eager\nstudy; for from thence proceedeth an incredible resolution of the spirits,\nthat oftentimes there do not remain so many behind as may suffice to push\nand thrust forwards the generative resudation to the places thereto\nappropriated, and therewithal inflate the cavernous nerve whose office is\nto ejaculate the moisture for the propagation of human progeny.  Lest you\nshould think it is not so, be pleased but to contemplate a little the form,\nfashion, and carriage of a man exceeding earnestly set upon some learned\nmeditation, and deeply plunged therein, and you shall see how all the\narteries of his brains are stretched forth and bent like the string of a\ncrossbow, the more promptly, dexterously, and copiously to suppeditate,\nfurnish, and supply him with store of spirits sufficient to replenish and\nfill up the ventricles, seats, tunnels, mansions, receptacles, and cellules\nof the common sense,--of the imagination, apprehension, and fancy,--of the\nratiocination, arguing, and resolution,--as likewise of the memory,\nrecordation, and remembrance; and with great alacrity, nimbleness, and\nagility to run, pass, and course from the one to the other, through those\npipes, windings, and conduits which to skilful anatomists are perceivable\nat the end of the wonderful net where all the arteries close in a\nterminating point; which arteries, taking their rise and origin from the\nleft capsule of the heart, bring through several circuits, ambages, and\nanfractuosities, the vital, to subtilize and refine them to the ethereal\npurity of animal spirits.  Nay, in such a studiously musing person you may\nespy so extravagant raptures of one as it were out of himself, that all his\nnatural faculties for that time will seem to be suspended from each their\nproper charge and office, and his exterior senses to be at a stand.  In a\nword, you cannot otherwise choose than think that he is by an extraordinary\necstasy quite transported out of what he was, or should be; and that\nSocrates did not speak improperly when he said that philosophy was nothing\nelse but a meditation upon death.  This possibly is the reason why\nDemocritus deprived himself of the sense of seeing, prizing at a much lower\nrate the loss of his sight than the diminution of his contemplations, which\nhe frequently had found disturbed by the vagrant, flying-out strayings of\nhis unsettled and roving eyes.  Therefore is it that Pallas, the goddess of\nwisdom, tutoress and guardianess of such as are diligently studious and\npainfully industrious, is, and hath been still accounted a virgin.  The\nMuses upon the same consideration are esteemed perpetual maids; and the\nGraces, for the like reason, have been held to continue in a sempiternal\npudicity.\n\nI remember to have read that Cupid, on a time being asked of his mother\nVenus why he did not assault and set upon the Muses, his answer was that he\nfound them so fair, so sweet, so fine, so neat, so wise, so learned, so\nmodest, so discreet, so courteous, so virtuous, and so continually busied\nand employed,--one in the speculation of the stars,--another in the\nsupputation of numbers,--the third in the dimension of geometrical\nquantities,--the fourth in the composition of heroic poems,--the fifth in\nthe jovial interludes of a comic strain,--the sixth in the stately gravity\nof a tragic vein,--the seventh in the melodious disposition of musical\nairs,--the eighth in the completest manner of writing histories and books\non all sorts of subjects,--and the ninth in the mysteries, secrets, and\ncuriosities of all sciences, faculties, disciplines, and arts whatsoever,\nwhether liberal or mechanic,--that approaching near unto them he unbended\nhis bow, shut his quiver, and extinguished his torch, through mere shame\nand fear that by mischance he might do them some hurt or prejudice.  Which\ndone, he thereafter put off the fillet wherewith his eyes were bound to\nlook them in the face, and to hear their melody and poetic odes.  There\ntook he the greatest pleasure in the world, that many times he was\ntransported with their beauty and pretty behaviour, and charmed asleep by\nthe harmony; so far was he from assaulting them or interrupting their\nstudies.  Under this article may be comprised what Hippocrates wrote in the\nafore-cited treatise concerning the Scythians; as also that in a book of\nhis entitled Of Breeding and Production, where he hath affirmed all such\nmen to be unfit for generation as have their parotid arteries cut--whose\nsituation is beside the ears--for the reason given already when I was\nspeaking of the resolution of the spirits and of that spiritual blood\nwhereof the arteries are the sole and proper receptacles, and that likewise\nhe doth maintain a large portion of the parastatic liquor to issue and\ndescend from the brains and backbone.\n\nFifthly, By the too frequent reiteration of the act of venery.  There did I\nwait for you, quoth Panurge, and shall willingly apply it to myself, whilst\nanyone that pleaseth may, for me, make use of any of the four preceding.\nThat is the very same thing, quoth Friar John, which Father Scyllino, Prior\nof Saint Victor at Marseilles, calleth by the name of maceration and taming\nof the flesh.  I am of the same opinion,--and so was the hermit of Saint\nRadegonde, a little above Chinon; for, quoth he, the hermits of Thebaide\ncan no more aptly or expediently macerate and bring down the pride of their\nbodies, daunt and mortify their lecherous sensuality, or depress and\novercome the stubbornness and rebellion of the flesh, than by duffling and\nfanfreluching it five-and-twenty or thirty times a day.  I see Panurge,\nquoth Rondibilis, neatly featured and proportioned in all the members of\nhis body, of a good temperament in his humours, well-complexioned in his\nspirits, of a competent age, in an opportune time, and of a reasonably\nforward mind to be married.  Truly, if he encounter with a wife of the like\nnature, temperament, and constitution, he may beget upon her children\nworthy of some transpontine monarchy; and the sooner he marry it will be\nthe better for him, and the more conducible for his profit if he would see\nand have his children in his own time well provided for.  Sir, my worthy\nmaster, quoth Panurge, I will do it, do not you doubt thereof, and that\nquickly enough, I warrant you.  Nevertheless, whilst you were busied in the\nuttering of your learned discourse, this flea which I have in mine ear hath\ntickled me more than ever.  I retain you in the number of my festival\nguests, and promise you that we shall not want for mirth and good cheer\nenough, yea, over and above the ordinary rate.  And, if it may please you,\ndesire your wife to come along with you, together with her she-friends and\nneighbours--that is to be understood--and there shall be fair play.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXII.\n\nHow Rondibilis declareth cuckoldry to be naturally one of the appendances\nof marriage.\n\nThere remaineth as yet, quoth Panurge, going on in his discourse, one small\nscruple to be cleared.  You have seen heretofore, I doubt not, in the Roman\nstandards, S.P.Q.R., Si, Peu, Que, Rien.  Shall not I be a cuckold?  By the\nhaven of safety, cried out Rondibilis, what is this you ask of me?  If you\nshall be a cuckold?  My noble friend, I am married, and you are like to be\nso very speedily; therefore be pleased, from my experiment in the matter,\nto write in your brain with a steel pen this subsequent ditton, There is no\nmarried man who doth not run the hazard of being made a cuckold.  Cuckoldry\nnaturally attendeth marriage.  The shadow doth not more naturally follow\nthe body, than cuckoldry ensueth after marriage to place fair horns upon\nthe husbands' heads.\n\nAnd when you shall happen to hear any man pronounce these three words, He\nis married; if you then say he is, hath been, shall be, or may be a\ncuckold, you will not be accounted an unskilful artist in framing of true\nconsequences.  Tripes and bowels of all the devils, cries Panurge, what do\nyou tell me?  My dear friend, answered Rondibilis, as Hippocrates on a time\nwas in the very nick of setting forwards from Lango to Polystilo to visit\nthe philosopher Democritus, he wrote a familiar letter to his friend\nDionysius, wherein he desired him that he would, during the interval of his\nabsence, carry his wife to the house of her father and mother, who were an\nhonourable couple and of good repute; because I would not have her at my\nhome, said he, to make abode in solitude.  Yet, notwithstanding this her\nresidence beside her parents, do not fail, quoth he, with a most heedful\ncare and circumspection to pry into her ways, and to espy what places she\nshall go to with her mother, and who those be that shall repair unto her.\nNot, quoth he, that I do mistrust her virtue, or that I seem to have any\ndiffidence of her pudicity and chaste behaviour,--for of that I have\nfrequently had good and real proofs,--but I must freely tell you, She is a\nwoman.  There lies the suspicion.\n\nMy worthy friend, the nature of women is set forth before our eyes and\nrepresented to us by the moon, in divers other things as well as in this,\nthat they squat, skulk, constrain their own inclinations, and, with all the\ncunning they can, dissemble and play the hypocrite in the sight and\npresence of their husbands; who come no sooner to be out of the way, but\nthat forthwith they take their advantage, pass the time merrily, desist\nfrom all labour, frolic it, gad abroad, lay aside their counterfeit garb,\nand openly declare and manifest the interior of their dispositions, even as\nthe moon, when she is in conjunction with the sun, is neither seen in the\nheavens nor on the earth, but in her opposition, when remotest from him,\nshineth in her greatest fulness, and wholly appeareth in her brightest\nsplendour whilst it is night.  Thus women are but women.\n\nWhen I say womankind, I speak of a sex so frail, so variable, so\nchangeable, so fickle, inconstant, and imperfect, that in my opinion\nNature, under favour, nevertheless, of the prime honour and reverence which\nis due unto her, did in a manner mistake the road which she had traced\nformerly, and stray exceedingly from that excellence of providential\njudgment by the which she had created and formed all other things, when she\nbuilt, framed, and made up the woman.  And having thought upon it a hundred\nand five times, I know not what else to determine therein, save only that\nin the devising, hammering, forging, and composing of the woman she hath\nhad a much tenderer regard, and by a great deal more respectful heed to the\ndelightful consortship and sociable delectation of the man, than to the\nperfection and accomplishment of the individual womanishness or muliebrity.\nThe divine philosopher Plato was doubtful in what rank of living creatures\nto place and collocate them, whether amongst the rational animals, by\nelevating them to an upper seat in the specifical classis of humanity, or\nwith the irrational, by degrading them to a lower bench on the opposite\nside, of a brutal kind, and mere bestiality.  For nature hath posited in a\nprivy, secret, and intestine place of their bodies, a sort of member, by\nsome not impertinently termed an animal, which is not to be found in men.\nTherein sometimes are engendered certain humours so saltish, brackish,\nclammy, sharp, nipping, tearing, prickling, and most eagerly tickling, that\nby their stinging acrimony, rending nitrosity, figging itch, wriggling\nmordicancy, and smarting salsitude (for the said member is altogether\nsinewy and of a most quick and lively feeling), their whole body is shaken\nand ebrangled, their senses totally ravished and transported, the\noperations of their judgment and understanding utterly confounded, and all\ndisordinate passions and perturbations of the mind thoroughly and\nabsolutely allowed, admitted, and approved of; yea, in such sort that if\nnature had not been so favourable unto them as to have sprinkled their\nforehead with a little tincture of bashfulness and modesty, you should see\nthem in a so frantic mood run mad after lechery, and hie apace up and down\nwith haste and lust, in quest of and to fix some chamber-standard in their\nPaphian ground, that never did the Proetides, Mimallonides, nor Lyaean\nThyades deport themselves in the time of their bacchanalian festivals more\nshamelessly, or with a so affronted and brazen-faced impudency; because\nthis terrible animal is knit unto, and hath an union with all the chief and\nmost principal parts of the body, as to anatomists is evident.  Let it not\nhere be thought strange that I should call it an animal, seeing therein I\ndo no otherwise than follow and adhere to the doctrine of the academic and\nperipatetic philosophers.  For if a proper motion be a certain mark and\ninfallible token of the life and animation of the mover, as Aristotle\nwriteth, and that any such thing as moveth of itself ought to be held\nanimated and of a living nature, then assuredly Plato with very good reason\ndid give it the denomination of an animal, for that he perceived and\nobserved in it the proper and self-stirring motions of suffocation,\nprecipitation, corrugation, and of indignation so extremely violent, that\noftentimes by them is taken and removed from the woman all other sense and\nmoving whatsoever, as if she were in a swounding lipothymy, benumbing\nsyncope, epileptic, apoplectic palsy, and true resemblance of a pale-faced\ndeath.\n\nFurthermore, in the said member there is a manifest discerning faculty of\nscents and odours very perceptible to women, who feel it fly from what is\nrank and unsavoury, and follow fragrant and aromatic smells.  It is not\nunknown to me how Cl. Galen striveth with might and main to prove that\nthese are not proper and particular notions proceeding intrinsically from\nthe thing itself, but accidentally and by chance.  Nor hath it escaped my\nnotice how others of that sect have laboured hardly, yea, to the utmost of\ntheir abilities, to demonstrate that it is not a sensitive discerning or\nperception in it of the difference of wafts and smells, but merely a\nvarious manner of virtue and efficacy passing forth and flowing from the\ndiversity of odoriferous substances applied near unto it.  Nevertheless, if\nyou will studiously examine and seriously ponder and weigh in Critolaus's\nbalance the strength of their reasons and arguments, you shall find that\nthey, not only in this, but in several other matters also of the like\nnature, have spoken at random, and rather out of an ambitious envy to check\nand reprehend their betters than for any design to make inquiry into the\nsolid truth.\n\nI will not launch my little skiff any further into the wide ocean of this\ndispute, only will I tell you that the praise and commendation is not mean\nand slender which is due to those honest and good women who, living\nchastely and without blame, have had the power and virtue to curb, range,\nand subdue that unbridled, heady, and wild animal to an obedient,\nsubmissive, and obsequious yielding unto reason.  Therefore here will I\nmake an end of my discourse thereon, when I shall have told you that the\nsaid animal being once satiated--if it be possible that it can be contented\nor satisfied--by that aliment which nature hath provided for it out of the\nepididymal storehouse of man, all its former and irregular and disordered\nmotions are at an end, laid, and assuaged, all its vehement and unruly\nlongings lulled, pacified, and quieted, and all the furious and raging\nlusts, appetites, and desires thereof appeased, calmed, and extinguished.\nFor this cause let it seem nothing strange unto you if we be in a perpetual\ndanger of being cuckolds, that is to say, such of us as have not\nwherewithal fully to satisfy the appetite and expectation of that voracious\nanimal.  Odds fish! quoth Panurge, have you no preventive cure in all your\nmedicinal art for hindering one's head to be horny-graffed at home whilst\nhis feet are plodding abroad?  Yes, that I have, my gallant friend,\nanswered Rondibilis, and that which is a sovereign remedy, whereof I\nfrequently make use myself; and, that you may the better relish, it is set\ndown and written in the book of a most famous author, whose renown is of a\nstanding of two thousand years.  Hearken and take good heed.  You are,\nquoth Panurge, by cockshobby, a right honest man, and I love you with all\nmy heart.  Eat a little of this quince-pie; it is very proper and\nconvenient for the shutting up of the orifice of the ventricle of the\nstomach, because of a kind of astringent stypticity which is in that sort\nof fruit, and is helpful to the first concoction.  But what? I think I\nspeak Latin before clerks.  Stay till I give you somewhat to drink out of\nthis Nestorian goblet.  Will you have another draught of white hippocras?\nBe not afraid of the squinzy, no.  There is neither squinant, ginger, nor\ngrains in it; only a little choice cinnamon, and some of the best refined\nsugar, with the delicious white wine of the growth of that vine which was\nset in the slips of the great sorbapple above the walnut-tree.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXIII.\n\nRondibilis the physician's cure of cuckoldry.\n\nAt that time, quoth Rondibilis, when Jupiter took a view of the state of\nhis Olympic house and family, and that he had made the calendar of all the\ngods and goddesses, appointing unto the festival of every one of them its\nproper day and season, establishing certain fixed places and stations for\nthe pronouncing of oracles and relief of travelling pilgrims, and ordaining\nvictims, immolations, and sacrifices suitable and correspondent to the\ndignity and nature of the worshipped and adored deity--Did not he do, asked\nPanurge, therein as Tintouille, the Bishop of Auxerre, is said once to have\ndone?  This noble prelate loved entirely the pure liquor of the grape, as\nevery honest and judicious man doth; therefore was it that he had an\nespecial care and regard to the bud of the vine-tree as to the\ngreat-grandfather of Bacchus.  But so it is, that for sundry years together\nhe saw a most pitiful havoc, desolation, and destruction made amongst the\nsprouts, shootings, buds, blossoms, and scions of the vines by hoary frost,\ndank fogs, hot mists, unseasonable colds, chill blasts, thick hail, and\nother calamitous chances of foul weather, happening, as he thought, by the\ndismal inauspiciousness of the holy days of St. George, St. Mary, St. Paul,\nSt. Eutrope, Holy Rood, the Ascension, and other festivals, in that time\nwhen the sun passeth under the sign of Taurus; and thereupon harboured in\nhis mind this opinion, that the afore-named saints were Saint\nHail-flingers, Saint Frost-senders, Saint Fog-mongers, and Saint Spoilers of\nthe Vine-buds.  For which cause he went about to have transmitted their\nfeasts from the spring to the winter, to be celebrated between Christmas and\nEpiphany, so the mother of the three kings called it, allowing them with all\nhonour and reverence the liberty then to freeze, hail, and rain as much as\nthey would; for that he knew that at such a time frost was rather profitable\nthan hurtful to the vine-buds, and in their steads to have placed the\nfestivals of St. Christopher, St. John the Baptist, St. Magdalene, St. Anne,\nSt. Domingo, and St. Lawrence; yea, and to have gone so far as to collocate\nand transpose the middle of August in and to the beginning of May, because\nduring the whole space of their solemnity there was so little danger of\nhoary frosts and cold mists, that no artificers are then held in greater\nrequest than the afforders of refrigerating inventions, makers of junkets,\nfit disposers of cooling shades, composers of green arbours, and refreshers\nof wine.\n\nJupiter, said Rondibilis, forgot the poor devil Cuckoldry, who was then in\nthe court at Paris very eagerly soliciting a peddling suit at law for one\nof his vassals and tenants.  Within some few days thereafter, I have forgot\nhow many, when he got full notice of the trick which in his absence was\ndone unto him, he instantly desisted from prosecuting legal processes in\nthe behalf of others, full of solicitude to pursue after his own business,\nlest he should be foreclosed, and thereupon he appeared personally at the\ntribunal of the great Jupiter, displayed before him the importance of his\npreceding merits, together with the acceptable services which in obedience\nto his commandments he had formerly performed; and therefore in all\nhumility begged of him that he would be pleased not to leave him alone\namongst all the sacred potentates, destitute and void of honour, reverence,\nsacrifices, and festival ceremonies.  To this petition Jupiter's answer was\nexcusatory, that all the places and offices of his house were bestowed.\nNevertheless, so importuned was he by the continual supplications of\nMonsieur Cuckoldry, that he, in fine, placed him in the rank, list, roll,\nrubric, and catalogue, and appointed honours, sacrifices, and festival\nrites to be observed on earth in great devotion, and tendered to him with\nsolemnity.  The feast, because there was no void, empty, nor vacant place\nin all the calendar, was to be celebrated jointly with, and on the same day\nthat had been consecrated to the goddess Jealousy.  His power and dominion\nshould be over married folks, especially such as had handsome wives.  His\nsacrifices were to be suspicion, diffidence, mistrust, a lowering pouting\nsullenness, watchings, wardings, researchings, plyings, explorations,\ntogether with the waylayings, ambushes, narrow observations, and malicious\ndoggings of the husband's scouts and espials of the most privy actions of\ntheir wives.  Herewithal every married man was expressly and rigorously\ncommanded to reverence, honour, and worship him, to celebrate and solemnize\nhis festival with twice more respect than that of any other saint or deity,\nand to immolate unto him with all sincerity and alacrity of heart the\nabove-mentioned sacrifices and oblations, under pain of severe censures,\nthreatenings, and comminations of these subsequent fines, mulcts,\namerciaments, penalties, and punishments to be inflicted on the\ndelinquents:  that Monsieur Cuckoldry should never be favourable nor\npropitious to them; that he should never help, aid, supply, succour, nor\ngrant them any subventitious furtherance, auxiliary suffrage, or\nadminiculary assistance; that he should never hold them in any reckoning,\naccount, or estimation; that he should never deign to enter within their\nhouses, neither at the doors, windows, nor any other place thereof; that he\nshould never haunt nor frequent their companies or conversations, how\nfrequently soever they should invocate him and call upon his name; and that\nnot only he should leave and abandon them to rot alone with their wives in\na sempiternal solitariness, without the benefit of the diversion of any\ncopes-mate or corrival at all, but should withal shun and eschew them, fly\nfrom them, and eternally forsake and reject them as impious heretics and\nsacrilegious persons, according to the accustomed manner of other gods\ntowards such as are too slack in offering up the duties and reverences\nwhich ought to be performed respectively to their divinities--as is\nevidently apparent in Bacchus towards negligent vine-dressers; in Ceres,\nagainst idle ploughmen and tillers of the ground; in Pomona, to unworthy\nfruiterers and costard-mongers; in Neptune, towards dissolute mariners and\nseafaring men, in Vulcan, towards loitering smiths and forgemen; and so\nthroughout the rest.  Now, on the contrary, this infallible promise was\nadded, that unto all those who should make a holy day of the above-recited\nfestival, and cease from all manner of worldly work and negotiation, lay\naside all their own most important occasions, and to be so retchless,\nheedless, and careless of what might concern the management of their proper\naffairs as to mind nothing else but a suspicious espying and prying into\nthe secret deportments of their wives, and how to coop, shut up, hold at\nunder, and deal cruelly and austerely with them by all the harshness and\nhardships that an implacable and every way inexorable jealousy can devise\nand suggest, conform to the sacred ordinances of the afore-mentioned\nsacrifices and oblations, he should be continually favourable to them,\nshould love them, sociably converse with them, should be day and night in\ntheir houses, and never leave them destitute of his presence.  Now I have\nsaid, and you have heard my cure.\n\nHa, ha, ha! quoth Carpalin, laughing; this is a remedy yet more apt and\nproper than Hans Carvel's ring.  The devil take me if I do not believe it!\nThe humour, inclination, and nature of women is like the thunder, whose\nforce in its bolt or otherwise burneth, bruiseth, and breaketh only hard,\nmassive, and resisting objects, without staying or stopping at soft, empty,\nand yielding matters.  For it pasheth into pieces the steel sword without\ndoing any hurt to the velvet scabbard which ensheatheth it.  It chrusheth\nalso and consumeth the bones without wounding or endamaging the flesh\nwherewith they are veiled and covered.  Just so it is that women for the\ngreater part never bend the contention, subtlety, and contradictory\ndisposition of their spirits unless it be to do what is prohibited and\nforbidden.\n\nVerily, quoth Hippothadee, some of our doctors aver for a truth that the\nfirst woman of the world, whom the Hebrews call Eve, had hardly been\ninduced or allured into the temptation of eating of the fruit of the Tree\nof Life if it had not been forbidden her so to do.  And that you may give\nthe more credit to the validity of this opinion, consider how the cautelous\nand wily tempter did commemorate unto her, for an antecedent to his\nenthymeme, the prohibition which was made to taste it, as being desirous to\ninfer from thence, It is forbidden thee; therefore thou shouldst eat of it,\nelse thou canst not be a woman.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXIV.\n\nHow women ordinarily have the greatest longing after things prohibited.\n\nWhen I was, quoth Carpalin, a whoremaster at Orleans, the whole art of\nrhetoric, in all its tropes and figures, was not able to afford unto me a\ncolour or flourish of greater force and value, nor could I by any other\nform or manner of elocution pitch upon a more persuasive argument for\nbringing young beautiful married ladies into the snares of adultery,\nthrough alluring and enticing them to taste with me of amorous delights,\nthan with a lively sprightfulness to tell them in downright terms, and to\nremonstrate to them with a great show of detestation of a crime so horrid,\nhow their husbands were jealous.  This was none of my invention.  It is\nwritten, and we have laws, examples, reasons, and daily experiences\nconfirmative of the same.  If this belief once enter into their noddles,\ntheir husbands will infallibly be cuckolds; yea, by God, will they, without\nswearing, although they should do like Semiramis, Pasiphae, Egesta, the\nwomen of the Isle Mandez in Egypt, and other such-like queanish flirting\nharlots mentioned in the writings of Herodotus, Strabo, and such-like\npuppies.\n\nTruly, quoth Ponocrates, I have heard it related, and it hath been told me\nfor a verity, that Pope John XXII., passing on a day through the Abbey of\nToucherome, was in all humility required and besought by the abbess and\nother discreet mothers of the said convent to grant them an indulgence by\nmeans whereof they might confess themselves to one another, alleging that\nreligious women were subject to some petty secret slips and imperfections\nwhich would be a foul and burning shame for them to discover and to reveal\nto men, how sacerdotal soever their functions were; but that they would\nfreelier, more familiarly, and with greater cheerfulness, open to each\nother their offences, faults, and escapes under the seal of confession.\nThere is not anything, answered the pope, fitting for you to impetrate of\nme which I would not most willingly condescend unto; but I find one\ninconvenience.  You know confession should be kept secret, and women are\nnot able to do so.  Exceeding well, quoth they, most holy father, and much\nmore closely than the best of men.\n\nThe said pope on the very same day gave them in keeping a pretty box,\nwherein he purposely caused a little linnet to be put, willing them very\ngently and courteously to lock it up in some sure and hidden place, and\npromising them, by the faith of a pope, that he should yield to their\nrequest if they would keep secret what was enclosed within that deposited\nbox, enjoining them withal not to presume one way nor other, directly or\nindirectly, to go about the opening thereof, under pain of the highest\necclesiastical censure, eternal excommunication.  The prohibition was no\nsooner made but that they did all of them boil with a most ardent desire to\nknow and see what kind of thing it was that was within it.  They thought\nlong already that the pope was not gone, to the end they might jointly,\nwith the more leisure and ease, apply themselves to the box-opening\ncuriosity.\n\nThe holy father, after he had given them his benediction, retired and\nwithdrew himself to the pontifical lodgings of his own palace.  But he was\nhardly gone three steps from without the gates of their cloister when the\ngood ladies throngingly, and as in a huddled crowd, pressing hard on the\nbacks of one another, ran thrusting and shoving who should be first at the\nsetting open of the forbidden box and descrying of the quod latitat within.\n\nOn the very next day thereafter the pope made them another visit, of a full\ndesign, purpose, and intention, as they imagined, to despatch the grant of\ntheir sought and wished-for indulgence.  But before he would enter into any\nchat or communing with them, he commanded the casket to be brought unto\nhim.  It was done so accordingly; but, by your leave, the bird was no more\nthere.  Then was it that the pope did represent to their maternities how\nhard a matter and difficult it was for them to keep secrets revealed to\nthem in confession unmanifested to the ears of others, seeing for the space\nof four-and-twenty hours they were not able to lay up in secret a box which\nhe had highly recommended to their discretion, charge, and custody.\n\nWelcome, in good faith, my dear master, welcome!  It did me good to hear\nyou talk, the Lord be praised for all!  I do not remember to have seen you\nbefore now, since the last time that you acted at Montpellier with our\nancient friends, Anthony Saporra, Guy Bourguyer, Balthasar Noyer, Tolet,\nJohn Quentin, Francis Robinet, John Perdrier, and Francis Rabelais, the\nmoral comedy of him who had espoused and married a dumb wife.  I was there,\nquoth Epistemon.  The good honest man her husband was very earnestly urgent\nto have the fillet of her tongue untied, and would needs have her speak by\nany means.  At his desire some pains were taken on her, and partly by the\nindustry of the physician, other part by the expertness of the surgeon, the\nencyliglotte which she had under her tongue being cut, she spoke and spoke\nagain; yea, within a few hours she spoke so loud, so much, so fiercely, and\nso long, that her poor husband returned to the same physician for a recipe\nto make her hold her peace.  There are, quoth the physician, many proper\nremedies in our art to make dumb women speak, but there are none that ever\nI could learn therein to make them silent.  The only cure which I have\nfound out is their husband's deafness.  The wretch became within few weeks\nthereafter, by virtue of some drugs, charms, or enchantments which the\nphysician had prescribed unto him, so deaf that he could not have heard the\nthundering of nineteen hundred cannons at a salvo.  His wife perceiving\nthat indeed he was as deaf as a door-nail, and that her scolding was but in\nvain, sith that he heard her not, she grew stark mad.\n\nSome time after the doctor asked for his fee of the husband, who answered\nthat truly he was deaf, and so was not able to understand what the tenour\nof his demand might be.  Whereupon the leech bedusted him with a little, I\nknow not what, sort of powder, which rendered him a fool immediately, so\ngreat was the stultificating virtue of that strange kind of pulverized\ndose.  Then did this fool of a husband and his mad wife join together, and,\nfalling on the doctor and the surgeon, did so scratch, bethwack, and bang\nthem that they were left half dead upon the place, so furious were the\nblows which they received.  I never in my lifetime laughed so much as at\nthe acting of that buffoonery.\n\nLet us come to where we left off, quoth Panurge.  Your words, being\ntranslated from the clapper-dudgeons to plain English, do signify that it\nis not very inexpedient that I marry, and that I should not care for being\na cuckold.  You have there hit the nail on the head.  I believe, master\ndoctor, that on the day of my marriage you will be so much taken up with\nyour patients, or otherwise so seriously employed, that we shall not enjoy\nyour company.  Sir, I will heartily excuse your absence.\n\n  Stercus et urina medici sunt prandia prima.\n  Ex aliis paleas, ex istis collige grana.\n\nYou are mistaken, quoth Rondibilis, in the second verse of our distich, for\nit ought to run thus--\n\n  Nobis sunt signa, vobis sunt prandia digna.\n\nIf my wife at any time prove to be unwell and ill at ease, I will look upon\nthe water which she shall have made in an urinal glass, quoth Rondibilis,\ngrope her pulse, and see the disposition of her hypogaster, together with\nher umbilicary parts--according to the prescript rule of Hippocrates, 2.\nAph. 35--before I proceed any further in the cure of her distemper.  No,\nno, quoth Panurge, that will be but to little purpose.  Such a feat is for\nthe practice of us that are lawyers, who have the rubric, De ventre\ninspiciendo.  Do not therefore trouble yourself about it, master doctor; I\nwill provide for her a plaster of warm guts.  Do not neglect your more\nurgent occasions otherwhere for coming to my wedding.  I will send you some\nsupply of victuals to your own house, without putting you to the trouble of\ncoming abroad, and you shall always be my special friend.  With this,\napproaching somewhat nearer to him, he clapped into his hand, without the\nspeaking of so much as one word, four rose nobles.  Rondibilis did shut his\nfist upon them right kindly; yet, as if it had displeased him to make\nacceptance of such golden presents, he in a start, as if he had been wroth,\nsaid, He he, he, he, he! there was no need of anything; I thank you\nnevertheless.  From wicked folks I never get enough, and I from honest\npeople refuse nothing.  I shall be always, sir, at your command.  Provided\nthat I pay you well, quoth Panurge.  That, quoth Rondibilis, is understood.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXV.\n\nHow the philosopher Trouillogan handleth the difficulty of marriage.\n\nAs this discourse was ended, Pantagruel said to the philosopher\nTrouillogan, Our loyal, honest, true, and trusty friend, the lamp from hand\nto hand is come to you.  It falleth to your turn to give an answer:  Should\nPanurge, pray you, marry, yea or no?  He should do both, quoth Trouillogan.\nWhat say you? asked Panurge.  That which you have heard, answered\nTrouillogan.  What have I heard? replied Panurge.  That which I have said,\nreplied Trouillogan.  Ha, ha, ha! are we come to that pass? quoth Panurge.\nLet it go nevertheless, I do not value it at a rush, seeing we can make no\nbetter of the game.  But howsoever tell me, Should I marry or no?  Neither\nthe one nor the other, answered Trouillogan.  The devil take me, quoth\nPanurge, if these odd answers do not make me dote, and may he snatch me\npresently away if I do understand you.  Stay awhile until I fasten these\nspectacles of mine on this left ear, that I may hear you better.  With this\nPantagruel perceived at the door of the great hall, which was that day\ntheir dining-room, Gargantua's little dog, whose name was Kyne; for so was\nToby's dog called, as is recorded.  Then did he say to these who were there\npresent, Our king is not far off,--let us all rise.\n\nThat word was scarcely sooner uttered, than that Gargantua with his royal\npresence graced that banqueting and stately hall.  Each of the guests arose\nto do their king that reverence and duty which became them.  After that\nGargantua had most affably saluted all the gentlemen there present, he\nsaid, Good friends, I beg this favour of you, and therein you will very\nmuch oblige me, that you leave not the places where you sate nor quit the\ndiscourse you were upon.  Let a chair be brought hither unto this end of\nthe table, and reach me a cupful of the strongest and best wine you have,\nthat I may drink to all the company.  You are, in faith, all welcome,\ngentlemen.  Now let me know what talk you were about.  To this Pantagruel\nanswered that at the beginning of the second service Panurge had proposed a\nproblematic theme, to wit, whether he should marry, or not marry? that\nFather Hippothadee and Doctor Rondibilis had already despatched their\nresolutions thereupon; and that, just as his majesty was coming in, the\nfaithful Trouillogan in the delivery of his opinion hath thus far\nproceeded, that when Panurge asked whether he ought to marry, yea or no? at\nfirst he made this answer, Both together.  When this same question was\nagain propounded, his second answer was, Neither the one nor the other.\nPanurge exclaimeth that those answers are full of repugnancies and\ncontradictions, protesting that he understands them not, nor what it is\nthat can be meant by them.  If I be not mistaken, quoth Gargantua, I\nunderstand it very well.  The answer is not unlike to that which was once\nmade by a philosopher in ancient times, who being interrogated if he had a\nwoman whom they named him to his wife?  I have her, quoth he, but she hath\nnot me,--possessing her, by her I am not possessed.  Such another answer,\nquoth Pantagruel, was once made by a certain bouncing wench of Sparta, who\nbeing asked if at any time she had had to do with a man? No, quoth she, but\nsometimes men have had to do with me.  Well then, quoth Rondibilis, let it\nbe a neuter in physic, as when we say a body is neuter, when it is neither\nsick nor healthful, and a mean in philosophy; that, by an abnegation of\nboth extremes, and this by the participation of the one and of the other.\nEven as when lukewarm water is said to be both hot and cold; or rather, as\nwhen time makes the partition, and equally divides betwixt the two, a while\nin the one, another while as long in the other opposite extremity.  The\nholy Apostle, quoth Hippothadee, seemeth, as I conceive, to have more\nclearly explained this point when he said, Those that are married, let them\nbe as if they were not married; and those that have wives, let them be as\nif they had no wives at all.  I thus interpret, quoth Pantagruel, the\nhaving and not having of a wife.  To have a wife is to have the use of her\nin such a way as nature hath ordained, which is for the aid, society, and\nsolace of man, and propagating of his race.  To have no wife is not to be\nuxorious, play the coward, and be lazy about her, and not for her sake to\ndistain the lustre of that affection which man owes to God, or yet for her\nto leave those offices and duties which he owes unto his country, unto his\nfriends and kindred, or for her to abandon and forsake his precious\nstudies, and other businesses of account, to wait still on her will, her\nbeck, and her buttocks.  If we be pleased in this sense to take having and\nnot having of a wife, we shall indeed find no repugnancy nor contradiction\nin the terms at all.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXVI.\n\nA continuation of the answer of the Ephectic and Pyrrhonian philosopher\nTrouillogan.\n\nYou speak wisely, quoth Panurge, if the moon were green cheese.  Such a\ntale once pissed my goose.  I do not think but that I am let down into that\ndark pit in the lowermost bottom whereof the truth was hid, according to\nthe saying of Heraclitus.  I see no whit at all, I hear nothing, understand\nas little, my senses are altogether dulled and blunted; truly I do very\nshrewdly suspect that I am enchanted.  I will now alter the former style of\nmy discourse, and talk to him in another strain.  Our trusty friend, stir\nnot, nor imburse any; but let us vary the chance, and speak without\ndisjunctives.  I see already that these loose and ill-joined members of an\nenunciation do vex, trouble, and perplex you.\n\n  Now go on, in the name of God!  Should I marry?\n\n  Trouillogan.  There is some likelihood therein.\n\n  Panurge.  But if I do not marry?\n\n  Trouil.  I see in that no inconvenience.\n\n  Pan.  You do not?\n\n  Trouil.  None, truly, if my eyes deceive me not.\n\n  Pan.  Yea, but I find more than five hundred.\n\n  Trouil.  Reckon them.\n\n  Pan.  This is an impropriety of speech, I confess; for I do no more\nthereby but take a certain for an uncertain number, and posit the\ndeterminate term for what is indeterminate.  When I say, therefore, five\nhundred, my meaning is many.\n\n  Trouil.  I hear you.\n\nPan.  Is it possible for me to live without a wife, in the name of all the\nsubterranean devils?\n\n  Trouil.  Away with these filthy beasts.\n\n  Pan.  Let it be, then, in the name of God; for my Salmigondinish people\nuse to say, To lie alone, without a wife, is certainly a brutish life.  And\nsuch a life also was it assevered to be by Dido in her lamentations.\n\n  Trouil.  At your command.\n\n  Pan.  By the pody cody, I have fished fair; where are we now?  But will\nyou tell me?  Shall I marry?\n\n  Trouil.  Perhaps.\n\n  Pan.  Shall I thrive or speed well withal?\n\n  Trouil.  According to the encounter.\n\n  Pan.  But if in my adventure I encounter aright, as I hope I will, shall\nI be fortunate?\n\n  Trouil.  Enough.\n\n  Pan.  Let us turn the clean contrary way, and brush our former words\nagainst the wool:  what if I encounter ill?\n\n  Trouil.  Then blame not me.\n\n  Pan.  But, of courtesy, be pleased to give me some advice.  I heartily\nbeseech you, what must I do?\n\n  Trouil.  Even what thou wilt.\n\n  Pan.  Wishy, washy; trolly, trolly.\n\n  Trouil.  Do not invocate the name of anything, I pray you.\n\n  Pan.  In the name of God, let it be so!  My actions shall be regulated by\nthe rule and square of your counsel.  What is it that you advise and\ncounsel me to do?\n\n  Trouil.  Nothing.\n\n  Pan.  Shall I marry?\n\n  Trouil.  I have no hand in it.\n\n  Pan.  Then shall I not marry?\n\n  Trouil.  I cannot help it.\n\n  Pan.  If I never marry, I shall never be a cuckold.\n\n  Trouil.  I thought so.\n\n  Pan.  But put the case that I be married.\n\n  Trouil.  Where shall we put it?\n\n  Pan.  Admit it be so, then, and take my meaning in that sense.\n\n  Trouil.  I am otherwise employed.\n\n  Pan.  By the death of a hog, and mother of a toad, O Lord! if I durst\nhazard upon a little fling at the swearing game, though privily and under\nthumb, it would lighten the burden of my heart and ease my lights and reins\nexceedingly.  A little patience nevertheless is requisite.  Well then, if I\nmarry, I shall be a cuckold.\n\n  Trouil.  One would say so.\n\n  Pan.  Yet if my wife prove a virtuous, wise, discreet, and chaste woman,\nI shall never be cuckolded.\n\n  Trouil.  I think you speak congruously.\n\n  Pan.  Hearken.\n\n  Trouil.  As much as you will.\n\n  Pan.  Will she be discreet and chaste?  This is the only point I would be\nresolved in.\n\n  Trouil.  I question it.\n\n  Pan.  You never saw her?\n\n  Trouil.  Not that I know of.\n\n  Pan.  Why do you then doubt of that which you know not?\n\n  Trouil.  For a cause.\n\n  Pan.  And if you should know her.\n\n  Trouil.  Yet more.\n\n  Pan.  Page, my pretty little darling, take here my cap,--I give it thee.\nHave a care you do not break the spectacles that are in it.  Go down to the\nlower court.  Swear there half an hour for me, and I shall in compensation\nof that favour swear hereafter for thee as much as thou wilt.  But who\nshall cuckold me?\n\n  Trouil.  Somebody.\n\n  Pan.  By the belly of the wooden horse at Troy, Master Somebody, I shall\nbang, belam thee, and claw thee well for thy labour.\n\n  Trouil.  You say so.\n\n  Pan.  Nay, nay, that Nick in the dark cellar, who hath no white in his\neye, carry me quite away with him if, in that case, whensoever I go abroad\nfrom the palace of my domestic residence, I do not, with as much\ncircumspection as they use to ring mares in our country to keep them from\nbeing sallied by stoned horses, clap a Bergamasco lock upon my wife.\n\n  Trouil.  Talk better.\n\n  Pan.  It is bien chien, chie chante, well cacked and cackled, shitten,\nand sung in matter of talk.  Let us resolve on somewhat.\n\n  Trouil.  I do not gainsay it.\n\n  Pan.  Have a little patience.  Seeing I cannot on this side draw any\nblood of you, I will try if with the lancet of my judgment I be able to\nbleed you in another vein.  Are you married, or are you not?\n\n  Trouil.  Neither the one nor the other, and both together.\n\n  Pan.  O the good God help us!  By the death of a buffle-ox, I sweat with\nthe toil and travail that I am put to, and find my digestion broke off,\ndisturbed, and interrupted, for all my phrenes, metaphrenes, and\ndiaphragms, back, belly, midriff, muscles, veins, and sinews are held in a\nsuspense and for a while discharged from their proper offices to stretch\nforth their several powers and abilities for incornifistibulating and\nlaying up into the hamper of my understanding your various sayings and\nanswers.\n\n  Trouil.  I shall be no hinderer thereof.\n\n  Pan.  Tush, for shame!  Our faithful friend, speak; are you married?\n\n  Trouil.  I think so.\n\n  Pan.  You were also married before you had this wife?\n\n  Trouil.  It is possible.\n\n  Pan.  Had you good luck in your first marriage?\n\n  Trouil.  It is not impossible.\n\n  Pan.  How thrive you with this second wife of yours?\n\n  Trouil.  Even as it pleaseth my fatal destiny.\n\n  Pan.  But what, in good earnest?  Tell me--do you prosper well with her?\n\n  Trouil.  It is likely.\n\n  Pan.  Come on, in the name of God.  I vow, by the burden of Saint\nChristopher, that I had rather undertake the fetching of a fart forth of\nthe belly of a dead ass than to draw out of you a positive and determinate\nresolution.  Yet shall I be sure at this time to have a snatch at you, and\nget my claws over you.  Our trusty friend, let us shame the devil of hell,\nand confess the verity.  Were you ever a cuckold?  I say, you who are here,\nand not that other you who playeth below in the tennis-court?\n\n  Trouil.  No, if it was not predestinated.\n\n  Pan.  By the flesh, blood, and body, I swear, reswear, forswear, abjure,\nand renounce, he evades and avoids, shifts, and escapes me, and quite slips\nand winds himself out of my grips and clutches.\n\nAt these words Gargantua arose and said, Praised be the good God in all\nthings, but especially for bringing the world into that height of\nrefinedness beyond what it was when I first came to be acquainted\ntherewith, that now the learnedst and most prudent philosophers are not\nashamed to be seen entering in at the porches and frontispieces of the\nschools of the Pyrrhonian, Aporrhetic, Sceptic, and Ephectic sects.\nBlessed be the holy name of God!  Veritably, it is like henceforth to be\nfound an enterprise of much more easy undertaking to catch lions by the\nneck, horses by the main, oxen by the horns, bulls by the muzzle, wolves by\nthe tail, goats by the beard, and flying birds by the feet, than to entrap\nsuch philosophers in their words.  Farewell, my worthy, dear, and honest\nfriends.\n\nWhen he had done thus speaking, he withdrew himself from the company.\nPantagruel and others with him would have followed and accompanied him, but\nhe would not permit them so to do.  No sooner was Gargantua departed out of\nthe banqueting-hall than that Pantagruel said to the invited guests:\nPlato's Timaeus, at the beginning always of a solemn festival convention,\nwas wont to count those that were called thereto.  We, on the contrary,\nshall at the closure and end of this treatment reckon up our number.  One,\ntwo, three; where is the fourth?  I miss my friend Bridlegoose.  Was not he\nsent for?  Epistemon answered that he had been at his house to bid and\ninvite him, but could not meet with him; for that a messenger from the\nparliament of Mirlingois, in Mirlingues, was come to him with a writ of\nsummons to cite and warn him personally to appear before the reverend\nsenators of the high court there, to vindicate and justify himself at the\nbar of the crime of prevarication laid to his charge, and to be\nperemptorily instanced against him in a certain decree, judgment, or\nsentence lately awarded, given, and pronounced by him; and that, therefore,\nhe had taken horse and departed in great haste from his own house, to the\nend that without peril or danger of falling into a default or contumacy he\nmight be the better able to keep the prefixed and appointed time.\n\nI will, quoth Pantagruel, understand how that matter goeth.  It is now\nabove forty years that he hath been constantly the judge of Fonsbeton,\nduring which space of time he hath given four thousand definitive\nsentences, of two thousand three hundred and nine whereof, although appeal\nwas made by the parties whom he had judicially condemned from his inferior\njudicatory to the supreme court of the parliament of Mirlingois, in\nMirlingues, they were all of them nevertheless confirmed, ratified, and\napproved of by an order, decree, and final sentence of the said sovereign\ncourt, to the casting of the appellants, and utter overthrow of the suits\nwherein they had been foiled at law, for ever and a day.  That now in his\nold age he should be personally summoned, who in all the foregoing time of\nhis life hath demeaned himself so unblamably in the discharge of the office\nand vocation he had been called unto, it cannot assuredly be that such a\nchange hath happened without some notorious misfortune and disaster.  I am\nresolved to help and assist him in equity and justice to the uttermost\nextent of my power and ability.  I know the malice, despite, and wickedness\nof the world to be so much more nowadays exasperated, increased, and\naggravated by what it was not long since, that the best cause that is, how\njust and equitable soever it be, standeth in great need to be succoured,\naided, and supported.  Therefore presently, from this very instant forth,\ndo I purpose, till I see the event and closure thereof, most heedfully to\nattend and wait upon it, for fear of some underhand tricky surprisal,\ncavilling pettifoggery, or fallacious quirks in law, to his detriment,\nhurt, or disadvantage.\n\nThen dinner being done, and the tables drawn and removed, when Pantagruel\nhad very cordially and affectionately thanked his invited guests for the\nfavour which he had enjoyed of their company, he presented them with\nseveral rich and costly gifts, such as jewels, rings set with precious\nstones, gold and silver vessels, with a great deal of other sort of plate\nbesides, and lastly, taking of them all his leave, retired himself into an\ninner chamber.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel persuaded Panurge to take counsel of a fool.\n\nWhen Pantagruel had withdrawn himself, he, by a little sloping window in\none of the galleries, perceived Panurge in a lobby not far from thence,\nwalking alone, with the gesture, carriage, and garb of a fond dotard,\nraving, wagging, and shaking his hands, dandling, lolling, and nodding with\nhis head, like a cow bellowing for her calf; and, having then called him\nnearer, spoke unto him thus:  You are at this present, as I think, not\nunlike to a mouse entangled in a snare, who the more that she goeth about\nto rid and unwind herself out of the gin wherein she is caught, by\nendeavouring to clear and deliver her feet from the pitch whereto they\nstick, the foulier she is bewrayed with it, and the more strongly pestered\ntherein.  Even so is it with you.  For the more that you labour, strive,\nand enforce yourself to disencumber and extricate your thoughts out of the\nimplicating involutions and fetterings of the grievous and lamentable gins\nand springs of anguish and perplexity, the greater difficulty there is in\nthe relieving of you, and you remain faster bound than ever.  Nor do I know\nfor the removal of this inconveniency any remedy but one.\n\nTake heed, I have often heard it said in a vulgar proverb, The wise may be\ninstructed by a fool.  Seeing the answers and responses of sage and\njudicious men have in no manner of way satisfied you, take advice of some\nfool, and possibly by so doing you may come to get that counsel which will\nbe agreeable to your own heart's desire and contentment.  You know how by\nthe advice and counsel and prediction of fools, many kings, princes,\nstates, and commonwealths have been preserved, several battles gained, and\ndivers doubts of a most perplexed intricacy resolved.  I am not so\ndiffident of your memory as to hold it needful to refresh it with a\nquotation of examples, nor do I so far undervalue your judgment but that I\nthink it will acquiesce in the reason of this my subsequent discourse.  As\nhe who narrowly takes heed to what concerns the dexterous management of his\nprivate affairs, domestic businesses, and those adoes which are confined\nwithin the strait-laced compass of one family, who is attentive, vigilant,\nand active in the economic rule of his own house, whose frugal spirit never\nstrays from home, who loseth no occasion whereby he may purchase to himself\nmore riches, and build up new heaps of treasure on his former wealth, and\nwho knows warily how to prevent the inconveniences of poverty, is called a\nworldly wise man, though perhaps in the second judgment of the\nintelligences which are above he be esteemed a fool,--so, on the contrary,\nis he most like, even in the thoughts of all celestial spirits, to be not\nonly sage, but to presage events to come by divine inspiration, who laying\nquite aside those cares which are conducible to his body or his fortunes,\nand, as it were, departing from himself, rids all his senses of terrene\naffections, and clears his fancies of those plodding studies which harbour\nin the minds of thriving men.  All which neglects of sublunary things are\nvulgarily imputed folly.  After this manner, the son of Picus, King of the\nLatins, the great soothsayer Faunus, was called Fatuus by the witless\nrabble of the common people.  The like we daily see practised amongst the\ncomic players, whose dramatic roles, in distribution of the personages,\nappoint the acting of the fool to him who is the wisest of the troop.  In\napprobation also of this fashion the mathematicians allow the very same\nhoroscope to princes and to sots.  Whereof a right pregnant instance by\nthem is given in the nativities of Aeneas and Choroebus; the latter of\nwhich two is by Euphorion said to have been a fool, and yet had with the\nformer the same aspects and heavenly genethliac influences.\n\nI shall not, I suppose, swerve much from the purpose in hand, if I relate\nunto you what John Andrew said upon the return of a papal writ, which was\ndirected to the mayor and burgesses of Rochelle, and after him by Panorme,\nupon the same pontifical canon; Barbatias on the Pandects, and recently by\nJason in his Councils, concerning Seyny John, the noted fool of Paris, and\nCaillet's fore great-grandfather.  The case is this.\n\nAt Paris, in the roastmeat cookery of the Petit Chastelet, before the\ncookshop of one of the roastmeat sellers of that lane, a certain hungry\nporter was eating his bread, after he had by parcels kept it a while above\nthe reek and steam of a fat goose on the spit, turning at a great fire, and\nfound it, so besmoked with the vapour, to be savoury; which the cook\nobserving, took no notice, till after having ravined his penny loaf,\nwhereof no morsel had been unsmokified, he was about decamping and going\naway.  But, by your leave, as the fellow thought to have departed thence\nshot-free, the master-cook laid hold upon him by the gorget, and demanded\npayment for the smoke of his roast meat.  The porter answered, that he had\nsustained no loss at all; that by what he had done there was no diminution\nmade of the flesh; that he had taken nothing of his, and that therefore he\nwas not indebted to him in anything.  As for the smoke in question, that,\nalthough he had not been there, it would howsoever have been evaporated;\nbesides, that before that time it had never been seen nor heard that\nroastmeat smoke was sold upon the streets of Paris.  The cook hereto\nreplied, that he was not obliged nor any way bound to feed and nourish for\nnought a porter whom he had never seen before with the smoke of his roast\nmeat, and thereupon swore that if he would not forthwith content and\nsatisfy him with present payment for the repast which he had thereby got,\nthat he would take his crooked staves from off his back; which, instead of\nhaving loads thereafter laid upon them, should serve for fuel to his\nkitchen fires.  Whilst he was going about so to do, and to have pulled them\nto him by one of the bottom rungs which he had caught in his hand, the\nsturdy porter got out of his grip, drew forth the knotty cudgel, and stood\nto his own defence.  The altercation waxed hot in words, which moved the\ngaping hoidens of the sottish Parisians to run from all parts thereabouts,\nto see what the issue would be of that babbling strife and contention.  In\nthe interim of this dispute, to very good purpose Seyny John, the fool and\ncitizen of Paris, happened to be there, whom the cook perceiving, said to\nthe porter, Wilt thou refer and submit unto the noble Seyny John the\ndecision of the difference and controversy which is betwixt us?  Yes, by\nthe blood of a goose, answered the porter, I am content.  Seyny John the\nfool, finding that the cook and porter had compromised the determination of\ntheir variance and debate to the discretion of his award and arbitrament,\nafter that the reasons on either side whereupon was grounded the mutual\nfierceness of their brawling jar had been to the full displayed and laid\nopen before him, commanded the porter to draw out of the fob of his belt a\npiece of money, if he had it.  Whereupon the porter immediately without\ndelay, in reverence to the authority of such a judicious umpire, put the\ntenth part of a silver Philip into his hand.  This little Philip Seyny John\ntook; then set it on his left shoulder, to try by feeling if it was of a\nsufficient weight.  After that, laying it on the palm of his hand, he made\nit ring and tingle, to understand by the ear if it was of a good alloy in\nthe metal whereof it was composed.  Thereafter he put it to the ball or\napple of his left eye, to explore by the sight if it was well stamped and\nmarked; all which being done, in a profound silence of the whole doltish\npeople who were there spectators of this pageantry, to the great hope of\nthe cook's and despair of the porter's prevalency in the suit that was in\nagitation, he finally caused the porter to make it sound several times upon\nthe stall of the cook's shop.  Then with a presidential majesty holding his\nbauble sceptre-like in his hand, muffling his head with a hood of marten\nskins, each side whereof had the resemblance of an ape's face sprucified up\nwith ears of pasted paper, and having about his neck a bucked ruff, raised,\nfurrowed, and ridged with pointing sticks of the shape and fashion of small\norgan pipes, he first with all the force of his lungs coughed two or three\ntimes, and then with an audible voice pronounced this following sentence:\nThe court declareth that the porter who ate his bread at the smoke of the\nroast, hath civilly paid the cook with the sound of his money.  And the\nsaid court ordaineth that everyone return to his own home, and attend his\nproper business, without cost and charges, and for a cause.  This verdict,\naward, and arbitrament of the Parisian fool did appear so equitable, yea,\nso admirable to the aforesaid doctors, that they very much doubted if the\nmatter had been brought before the sessions for justice of the said place,\nor that the judges of the Rota at Rome had been umpires therein, or yet\nthat the Areopagites themselves had been the deciders thereof, if by any\none part, or all of them together, it had been so judicially sententiated\nand awarded.  Therefore advise, if you will be counselled by a fool.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXVIII.\n\nHow Triboulet is set forth and blazed by Pantagruel and Panurge.\n\nBy my soul, quoth Panurge, that overture pleaseth me exceedingly well.  I\nwill therefore lay hold thereon, and embrace it.  At the very motioning\nthereof my very right entrail seemeth to be widened and enlarged, which was\nbut just now hard-bound, contracted, and costive.  But as we have hitherto\nmade choice of the purest and most refined cream of wisdom and sapience for\nour counsel, so would I now have to preside and bear the prime sway in our\nconsultation as very a fool in the supreme degree.  Triboulet, quoth\nPantagruel, is completely foolish, as I conceive.  Yes, truly, answered\nPanurge, he is properly and totally a fool, a\n\n\n    Pantagruel.

If he were the god Fatuus of whom we have already made\nmention, the husband of the goddess Fatua, his father would be Good Day,\nand his grandmother Good Even.\n\n  Panurge.  If all fools paced, albeit he be somewhat wry-legged, he would\noverlay at least a fathom at every rake.  Let us go toward him without any\nfurther lingering or delay; we shall have, no doubt, some fine resolution\nof him.  I am ready to go, and long for the issue of our progress\nimpatiently.  I must needs, quoth Pantagruel, according to my former\nresolution therein, be present at Bridlegoose's trial.  Nevertheless,\nwhilst I shall be upon my journey towards Mirelingues, which is on the\nother side of the river of Loire, I will despatch Carpalin to bring along\nwith him from Blois the fool Triboulet.  Then was Carpalin instantly sent\naway, and Pantagruel, at the same time attended by his domestics, Panurge,\nEpistemon, Ponocrates, Friar John, Gymnast, Ryzotomus, and others, marched\nforward on the high road to Mirelingues.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XXXIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel was present at the trial of Judge Bridlegoose, who decided\ncauses and controversies in law by the chance and fortune of the dice.\n\nOn the day following, precisely at the hour appointed, Pantagruel came to\nMirelingues.  At his arrival the presidents, senators, and counsellors\nprayed him to do them the honour to enter in with them, to hear the\ndecision of all the causes, arguments, and reasons which Bridlegoose in his\nown defence would produce, why he had pronounced a certain sentence against\nthe subsidy-assessor, Toucheronde, which did not seem very equitable to\nthat centumviral court.  Pantagruel very willingly condescended to their\ndesire, and accordingly entering in, found Bridlegoose sitting within the\nmiddle of the enclosure of the said court of justice; who immediately upon\nthe coming of Pantagruel, accompanied with the senatorian members of that\nworshipful judicatory, arose, went to the bar, had his indictment read, and\nfor all his reasons, defences, and excuses, answered nothing else but that\nhe was become old, and that his sight of late was very much failed, and\nbecome dimmer than it was wont to be; instancing therewithal many miseries\nand calamities which old age bringeth along with it, and are concomitant to\nwrinkled elders; which not. per Archid. d. lxxxvi. c. tanta.  By reason of\nwhich infirmity he was not able so distinctly and clearly to discern the\npoints and blots of the dice as formerly he had been accustomed to do;\nwhence it might very well have happened, said he, as old dim-sighted Isaac\ntook Jacob for Esau, that I after the same manner, at the decision of\ncauses and controversies in law, should have been mistaken in taking a\nquatre for a cinque, or a trey for a deuce.  This I beseech your worships,\nquoth he, to take into your serious consideration, and to have the more\nfavourable opinion of my uprightness, notwithstanding the prevarication\nwhereof I am accused in the matter of Toucheronde's sentence, that at the\ntime of that decree's pronouncing I only had made use of my small dice; and\nyour worships, said he, know very well how by the most authentic rules of\nthe law it is provided that the imperfections of nature should never be\nimputed unto any for crimes and transgressions; as appeareth, ff. de re\nmilit. l. qui cum uno. ff. de reg.

And who would offer to do otherwise, should not\nthereby accuse the man, but nature, and the all-seeing providence of God,\nas is evident in l. Maximum Vitium, c. de lib. praeter.\n\nWhat kind of dice, quoth Trinquamelle, grand-president of the said court,\ndo you mean, my friend Bridlegoose?  The dice, quoth Bridlegoose, of\nsentences at law, decrees, and peremptory judgments, Alea Judiciorum,\nwhereof is written, Per Doct. 26. qu. 2. cap. sort. l. nec emptio ff. de\ncontrahend. empt. l. quod debetur. ff. de pecul. et ibi Bartol., and which\nyour worships do, as well as I, use, in this glorious sovereign court of\nyours.  So do all other righteous judges in their decision of processes and\nfinal determination of legal differences, observing that which hath been\nsaid thereof by D. Henri. Ferrandat, et not. gl. in c. fin. de sortil. et\nl. sed cum ambo. ff. de jud.  Ubi Docto.  Mark, that chance and fortune are\ngood, honest, profitable, and necessary for ending of and putting a final\nclosure to dissensions and debates in suits at law.  The same hath more\nclearly been declared by Bald. Bartol. et Alex. c. communia de leg. l. Si\nduo.  But how is it that you do these things? asked Trinquamelle.  I very\nbriefly, quoth Bridlegoose, shall answer you, according to the doctrine and\ninstructions of Leg. ampliorem para. in refutatoriis. c. de appel.; which\nis conform to what is said in Gloss l. 1. ff. quod met. causa.  Gaudent\nbrevitate moderni.  My practice is therein the same with that of your other\nworships, and as the custom of the judicatory requires, unto which our law\ncommandeth us to have regard, and by the rule thereof still to direct and\nregulate our actions and procedures; ut not. extra. de consuet. in c. ex\nliteris et ibi innoc.  For having well and exactly seen, surveyed,\noverlooked, reviewed, recognized, read, and read over again, turned and\ntossed over, seriously perused and examined the bills of complaint,\naccusations, impeachments, indictments, warnings, citations, summonings,\ncomparitions, appearances, mandates, commissions, delegations,\ninstructions, informations, inquests, preparatories, productions,\nevidences, proofs, allegations, depositions, cross speeches,\ncontradictions, supplications, requests, petitions, inquiries, instruments\nof the deposition of witnesses, rejoinders, replies, confirmations of\nformer assertions, duplies, triplies, answers to rejoinders, writings,\ndeeds, reproaches, disabling of exceptions taken, grievances, salvation\nbills, re-examination of witnesses, confronting of them together,\ndeclarations, denunciations, libels, certificates, royal missives, letters\nof appeal, letters of attorney, instruments of compulsion, delineatories,\nanticipatories, evocations, messages, dimissions, issues, exceptions,\ndilatory pleas, demurs, compositions, injunctions, reliefs, reports,\nreturns, confessions, acknowledgments, exploits, executions, and other\nsuch-like confects and spiceries, both at the one and the other side, as a\ngood judge ought to do, conform to what hath been noted thereupon.  Spec.\nde ordination. Paragr. 3. et Tit. de Offi. omn. jud. paragr. fin. et de\nrescriptis praesentat. parag. 1.--I posit on the end of a table in my\ncloset all the pokes and bags of the defendant, and then allow unto him the\nfirst hazard of the dice, according to the usual manner of your other\nworships.  And it is mentioned, l. favorabiliores. ff. de reg. jur. et in\ncap. cum sunt eod. tit. lib. 6, which saith, Quum sunt partium jura\nobscura, reo potius favendum est quam actori.  That being done, I\nthereafter lay down upon the other end of the same table the bags and\nsatchels of the plaintiff, as your other worships are accustomed to do,\nvisum visu, just over against one another; for Opposita juxta se posita\nclarius elucescunt:  ut not. in lib. 1. parag. Videamus. ff. de his qui\nsunt sui vel alieni juris, et in l. munerum. para. mixta ff. de mun. et\nhon.  Then do I likewise and semblably throw the dice for him, and\nforthwith livre him his chance.  But, quoth Trinquamelle, my friend, how\ncome you to know, understand, and resolve the obscurity of these various\nand seeming contrary passages in law, which are laid claim to by the\nsuitors and pleading parties?  Even just, quoth Bridlegoose, after the\nfashion of your other worships; to wit, when there are many bags on the one\nside and on the other, I then use my little small dice, after the customary\nmanner of your other worships, in obedience to the law, Semper in\nstipulationibus ff. de reg. jur.  And the law ver(s)ified versifieth that,\nEod. tit. Semper in obscuris quod minimum est sequimur; canonized in c. in\nobscuris. eod. tit. lib. 6.  I have other large great dice, fair and goodly\nones, which I employ in the fashion that your other worships use to do,\nwhen the matter is more plain, clear, and liquid, that is to say, when\nthere are fewer bags.  But when you have done all these fine things, quoth\nTrinquamelle, how do you, my friend, award your decrees, and pronounce\njudgment?  Even as your other worships, answered Bridlegoose; for I give\nout sentence in his favour unto whom hath befallen the best chance by dice,\njudiciary, tribunian, pretorial, what comes first.  So our laws command,\nff. qui pot. in pign. l. creditor, c. de consul. 1.  Et de regul. jur. in\n6.  Qui prior est tempore potior est jure.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XL.\n\nHow Bridlegoose giveth reasons why he looked upon those law-actions which\nhe decided by the chance of the dice.\n\nYea but, quoth Trinquamelle, my friend, seeing it is by the lot, chance,\nand throw of the dice that you award your judgments and sentences, why do\nnot you livre up these fair throws and chances the very same day and hour,\nwithout any further procrastination or delay, that the controverting\nparty-pleaders appear before you?  To what use can those writings serve you,\nthose papers and other procedures contained in the bags and pokes of the\nlaw-suitors?  To the very same use, quoth Bridlegoose, that they serve your\nother worships.  They are behooveful unto me, and serve my turn in three\nthings very exquisite, requisite, and authentical.  First, for formality\nsake, the omission whereof, that it maketh all, whatever is done, to be of\nno force nor value, is excellently well proved, by Spec. 1. tit. de instr.\nedit. et tit. de rescript. praesent.  Besides that, it is not unknown to\nyou, who have had many more experiments thereof than I, how oftentimes, in\njudicial proceedings, the formalities utterly destroy the materialities and\nsubstances of the causes and matters agitated; for Forma mutata, mutatur\nsubstantia. ff. ad exhib. l. Julianus. ff. ad leg. Fal. l. si is qui\nquadraginta.  Et extra de decim. c. ad audientiam, et de celebrat. miss. c.\nin quadam.\n\nSecondly, they are useful and steadable to me, even as unto your other\nworships, in lieu of some other honest and healthful exercise.  The late\nMaster Othoman Vadet (Vadere), a prime physician, as you would say, Cod. de\nComit. et Archi. lib. 12, hath frequently told me that the lack and default\nof bodily exercise is the chief, if not the sole and only cause of the\nlittle health and short lives of all officers of justice, such as your\nworships and I am.  Which observation was singularly well before him noted\nand remarked by Bartholus in lib. 1. c. de sent. quae pro eo quod.\nTherefore it is that the practice of such-like exercitations is appointed\nto be laid hold on by your other worships, and consequently not to be\ndenied unto me, who am of the same profession; Quia accessorium naturam\nsequitur principalis. de reg. jur. l. 6. et l. cum principalis. et l. nihil\ndolo. ff. eod. tit. ff. de fide-juss. l. fide-juss. et extra de officio\ndeleg. cap. 1.  Let certain honest and recreative sports and plays of\ncorporeal exercises be allowed and approved of; and so far, (ff. de allus.\net aleat. l. solent. et authent.) ut omnes obed. in princ. coll. 7. et ff.\nde praescript. verb. l. si gratuitam et l. 1. cod. de spect. l. 11.  Such\nalso is the opinion of D. Thom, in secunda, secundae Q. I. 168.  Quoted in\nvery good purpose by D. Albert de Rosa, who fuit magnus practicus, and a\nsolemn doctor, as Barbatias attesteth in principiis consil.  Wherefore the\nreason is evidently and clearly deduced and set down before us in gloss. in\nprooemio. ff. par. ne autem tertii.\n\n  Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis.\n\nIn very deed, once, in the year a thousand four hundred fourscore and\nninth, having a business concerning the portion and inheritance of a\nyounger brother depending in the court and chamber of the four high\ntreasurers of France, whereinto as soon as ever I got leave to enter by a\npecuniary permission of the usher thereof,--as your other worships know\nvery well, that Pecuniae obediunt omnia, and there says Baldus, in l.\nsingularia. ff. si cert. pet. et Salic. in l. receptitia. Cod. de constit.\npecuni. et Card. in Clem. 1. de baptism.--I found them all recreating and\ndiverting themselves at the play called muss, either before or after\ndinner; to me, truly, it is a thing altogether indifferent whether of the\ntwo it was, provided that hic not., that the game of the muss is honest,\nhealthful, ancient, and lawful, a Muscho inventore, de quo cod. de petit.\nhaered. l. si post mortem. et Muscarii.  Such as play and sport it at the\nmuss are excusable in and by law, lib. 1. c. de excus. artific. lib. 10.\nAnd at the very same time was Master Tielman Picquet one of the players of\nthat game of muss.  There is nothing that I do better remember, for he\nlaughed heartily when his fellow-members of the aforesaid judicial chamber\nspoiled their caps in swingeing of his shoulders.  He, nevertheless, did\neven then say unto them, that the banging and flapping of him, to the waste\nand havoc of their caps, should not, at their return from the palace to\ntheir own houses, excuse them from their wives, Per. c. extra. de\npraesumpt. et ibi gloss.  Now, resolutorie loquendo, I should say,\naccording to the style and phrase of your other worships, that there is no\nexercise, sport, game, play, nor recreation in all this palatine, palatial,\nor parliamentary world, more aromatizing and fragrant than to empty and\nvoid bags and purses, turn over papers and writings, quote margins and\nbacks of scrolls and rolls, fill panniers, and take inspection of causes,\nEx. Bart. et Joan. de Pra. in l. falsa. de condit. et demonst. ff.\n\nThirdly, I consider, as your own worships use to do, that time ripeneth and\nbringeth all things to maturity, that by time everything cometh to be made\nmanifest and patent, and that time is the father of truth and virtue.\nGloss. in l. 1. cod. de servit. authent. de restit. et ea quae pa. et spec.\ntit. de requisit. cons.  Therefore is it that, after the manner and fashion\nof your other worships, I defer, protract, delay, prolong, intermit,\nsurcease, pause, linger, suspend, prorogate, drive out, wire-draw, and\nshift off the time of giving a definitive sentence, to the end that the\nsuit or process, being well fanned and winnowed, tossed and canvassed to\nand fro, narrowly, precisely, and nearly garbled, sifted, searched, and\nexamined, and on all hands exactly argued, disputed, and debated, may, by\nsuccession of time, come at last to its full ripeness and maturity.  By\nmeans whereof, when the fatal hazard of the dice ensueth thereupon, the\nparties cast or condemned by the said aleatory chance will with much\ngreater patience, and more mildly and gently, endure and bear up the\ndisastrous load of their misfortune, than if they had been sentenced at\ntheir first arrival unto the court, as not. gl. ff. de excus. tut. l. tria.\nonera.\n\n  Portatur leviter quod portat quisque libenter.\n\nOn the other part, to pass a decree or sentence when the action is raw,\ncrude, green, unripe, unprepared, as at the beginning, a danger would ensue\nof a no less inconveniency than that which the physicians have been wont to\nsay befalleth to him in whom an imposthume is pierced before it be ripe, or\nunto any other whose body is purged of a strong predominating humour before\nits digestion.  For as it is written, in authent. haec constit. in Innoc.\nde constit. princip., so is the same repeated in gloss. in c. caeterum.\nextra. de juram. calumn.  Quod medicamenta morbis exhibent, hoc jura\nnegotiis.  Nature furthermore admonisheth and teacheth us to gather and\nreap, eat and feed on fruits when they are ripe, and not before.

As also, that he had\nbeheld and looked upon the fair and beautiful Pragmatical Sanction his\nwife, with her huge rosary or patenotrian chaplet of jet-beads hanging at a\nlarge sky-coloured ribbon.  This honest man compounded, atoned, and agreed\nmore differences, controversies, and variances at law than had been\ndetermined, voided, and finished during his time in the whole palace of\nPoictiers, in the auditory of Montmorillon, and in the town-house of the\nold Partenay.  This amicable disposition of his rendered him venerable and\nof great estimation, sway, power, and authority throughout all the\nneighbouring places of Chauvigny, Nouaille, Leguge, Vivonne, Mezeaux,\nEstables, and other bordering and circumjacent towns, villages, and\nhamlets.  All their debates were pacified by him; he put an end to their\nbrabbling suits at law and wrangling differences.  By his advice and\ncounsels were accords and reconcilements no less firmly made than if the\nverdict of a sovereign judge had been interposed therein, although, in very\ndeed, he was no judge at all, but a right honest man, as you may well\nconceive,--arg. in l. sed si unius. ff. de jure-jur. et de verbis\nobligatoriis l.continuus.  There was not a hog killed within three parishes\nof him whereof he had not some part of the haslet and puddings.  He was\nalmost every day invited either to a marriage banquet, christening feast,\nan uprising or women-churching treatment, a birthday's anniversary\nsolemnity, a merry frolic gossiping, or otherwise to some delicious\nentertainment in a tavern, to make some accord and agreement between\npersons at odds and in debate with one another.  Remark what I say; for he\nnever yet settled and compounded a difference betwixt any two at variance,\nbut he straight made the parties agreed and pacified to drink together as a\nsure and infallible token and symbol of a perfect and completely\nwell-cemented reconciliation, sign of a sound and sincere amity and proper\nmark of a new joy and gladness to follow thereupon,--Ut not. per (Doct.) ff.\nde peric. et com. rei vend. l. 1.  He had a son, whose name was Tenot\nDandin, a lusty, young, sturdy, frisking roister, so help me God! who\nlikewise, in imitation of his peace-making father, would have undertaken and\nmeddled with the making up of variances and deciding of controversies\nbetwixt disagreeing and contentious party-pleaders; as you know,\n\n  Saepe solet similis esse patri.\n  Et sequitur leviter filia matris iter.\n\nUt ait gloss. 6, quaest. 1. c.

And\nsuch was his confidence to have no worse success than his father, he\nassumed unto himself the title of Law-strife-settler.  He was likewise in\nthese pacificatory negotiations so active and vigilant--for, Vigilantibus\njura subveniunt. ex l. pupillus. ff. quae in fraud. cred. et ibid. l. non\nenim. et instit. in prooem.--that when he had smelt, heard, and fully\nunderstood--ut ff.si quando paup. fec. l. Agaso. gloss. in verb. olfecit,\nid est, nasum ad culum posuit--and found that there was anywhere in the\ncountry a debatable matter at law, he would incontinently thrust in his\nadvice, and so forwardly intrude his opinion in the business, that he made\nno bones of making offer, and taking upon him to decide it, how difficult\nsoever it might happen to be, to the full contentment and satisfaction of\nboth parties.  It is written, Qui non laborat non manducat; and the said\ngl. ff. de damn. infect. l. quamvis, and Currere plus que le pas vetulam\ncompellit egestas. gloss. ff. de lib. agnosc. l. si quis. pro qua facit. l.\nsi plures. c. de cond. incert.  But so hugely great was his misfortune in\nthis his undertaking, that he never composed any difference, how little\nsoever you may imagine it might have been, but that, instead of reconciling\nthe parties at odds, he did incense, irritate, and exasperate them to a\nhigher point of dissension and enmity than ever they were at before.  Your\nworships know, I doubt not, that,\n\n  Sermo datur cunctis, animi sapientia paucis.\n\nGl. ff. de alien. jud. mut. caus. fa. lib.2.  This administered unto the\ntavern-keepers, wine-drawers, and vintners of Semerve an occasion to say,\nthat under him they had not in the space of a whole year so much\nreconciliation-wine, for so were they pleased to call the good wine of\nLeguge, as under his father they had done in one half-hour's time.  It\nhappened a little while thereafter that he made a most heavy regret thereof\nto his father, attributing the causes of his bad success in pacificatory\nenterprises to the perversity, stubbornness, froward, cross, and backward\ninclinations of the people of his time; roundly, boldly, and irreverently\nupbraiding, that if but a score of years before the world had been so\nwayward, obstinate, pervicacious, implacable, and out of all square, frame,\nand order as it was then, his father had never attained to and acquired the\nhonour and title of Strife-appeaser so irrefragably, inviolably, and\nirrevocably as he had done.  In doing whereof Tenot did heinously\ntransgress against the law which prohibiteth children to reproach the\nactions of their parents; per gl. et Bart. l. 3. paragr. si quis. ff. de\ncond. ob caus. et authent. de nupt. par. sed quod sancitum. col. 4.  To\nthis the honest old father answered thus:  My son Dandin, when Don Oportet\ntaketh place, this is the course which we must trace, gl. c. de appell. l.\neos etiam.  For the road that you went upon was not the way to the fuller's\nmill, nor in any part thereof was the form to be found wherein the hare did\nsit.  Thou hast not the skill and dexterity of settling and composing\ndifferences.  Why?  Because thou takest them at the beginning, in the very\ninfancy and bud as it were, when they are green, raw, and indigestible.\nYet I know handsomely and featly how to compose and settle them all.  Why?\nBecause I take them at their decadence, in their weaning, and when they are\npretty well digested.  So saith Gloss:\n\n  Dulcior est fructus post multa pericula ductus.\n\nL. non moriturus. c. de contrahend. et committ. stip.  Didst thou ever hear\nthe vulgar proverb, Happy is the physician whose coming is desired at the\ndeclension of a disease?  For the sickness being come to a crisis is then\nupon the decreasing hand, and drawing towards an end, although the\nphysician should not repair thither for the cure thereof; whereby, though\nnature wholly do the work, he bears away the palm and praise thereof.  My\npleaders, after the same manner, before I did interpose my judgment in the\nreconciling of them, were waxing faint in their contestations.  Their\naltercation heat was much abated, and, in declining from their former\nstrife, they of themselves inclined to a firm accommodation of their\ndifferences; because there wanted fuel to that fire of burning rancour and\ndespiteful wrangling whereof the lower sort of lawyers were the kindlers.\nThat is to say, their purses were emptied of coin, they had not a win in\ntheir fob, nor penny in their bag, wherewith to solicit and present their\nactions.\n\n  Deficiente pecu, deficit omne, nia.\n\nThere wanted then nothing but some brother to supply the place of a\nparanymph, brawl-broker, proxenete, or mediator, who, acting his part\ndexterously, should be the first broacher of the motion of an agreement,\nfor saving both the one and the other party from that hurtful and\npernicious shame whereof he could not have avoided the imputation when it\nshould have been said that he was the first who yielded and spoke of a\nreconcilement, and that therefore, his cause not being good, and being\nsensible where his shoe did pinch him, he was willing to break the ice, and\nmake the greater haste to prepare the way for a condescendment to an\namicable and friendly treaty.  Then was it that I came in pudding time,\nDandin, my son, nor is the fat of bacon more relishing to boiled peas than\nwas my verdict then agreeable to them.  This was my luck, my profit, and\ngood fortune.  I tell thee, my jolly son Dandin, that by this rule and\nmethod I could settle a firm peace, or at least clap up a cessation of arms\nand truce for many years to come, betwixt the Great King and the Venetian\nState, the Emperor and the Cantons of Switzerland, the English and the\nScots, and betwixt the Pope and the Ferrarians.  Shall I go yet further?\nYea, as I would have God to help me, betwixt the Turk and the Sophy, the\nTartars and the Muscoviters.  Remark well what I am to say unto thee.  I\nwould take them at that very instant nick of time when both those of the\none and the other side should be weary and tired of making war, when they\nhad voided and emptied their own cashes and coffers of all treasure and\ncoin, drained and exhausted the purses and bags of their subjects, sold and\nmortgaged their domains and proper inheritances, and totally wasted, spent,\nand consumed the munition, furniture, provision, and victuals that were\nnecessary for the continuance of a military expedition.  There I am sure,\nby God, or by his Mother, that, would they, would they not, in spite of all\ntheir teeths, they should be forced to have a little respite and breathing\ntime to moderate the fury and cruel rage of their ambitious aims.  This is\nthe doctrine in Gl. 37. d. c. si quando.\n\n  Odero, si potero; si non, invitus amabo.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLII.\n\nHow suits at law are bred at first, and how they come afterwards to their\nperfect growth.\n\nFor this cause, quoth Bridlegoose, going on in his discourse, I temporize\nand apply myself to the times, as your other worships use to do, waiting\npatiently for the maturity of the process, full growth and perfection\nthereof in all its members, to wit, the writings and the bags.

Just so do I see, as your other worships\ndo, processes and suits in law, at their first bringing forth, to be\nnumberless, without shape, deformed, and disfigured, for that then they\nconsist only of one or two writings, or copies of instruments, through\nwhich defect they appear unto me, as to your other worships, foul,\nloathsome, filthy, and misshapen beasts.  But when there are heaps of these\nlegiformal papers packed, piled, laid up together, impoked, insatchelled,\nand put up in bags, then is it that with a good reason we may term that\nsuit, to which, as pieces, parcels, parts, portions, and members thereof,\nthey do pertain and belong, well-formed and fashioned, big-limbed,\nstrong-set, and in all and each of its dimensions most completely membered.\nBecause forma dat esse. rei. l. si is qui. ff. ad leg.

Even as your other worships use to do, answered Bridlegoose.\nFirst, I permit the plaintiff to depart from the court, enjoining him not\nto presume to return thither till he preallably should have taken a good\nsound and profound sleep, which is to serve for the prime entry and\nintroduction to the legal carrying on of the business.  In the next place,\na formal report is to be made to me of his having slept.  Thirdly, I issue\nforth a warrant to convene him before me.  Fourthly, he is to produce a\nsufficient and authentic attestation of his having thoroughly and entirely\nslept, conform to the Gloss. 37. Quest. 7. c. Si quis cum.\n\n  Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.\n\nBeing thus far advanced in the formality of the process, I find that this\nconsopiating act engendereth another act, whence ariseth the articulating\nof a member.  That again produceth a third act, fashionative of another\nmember; which third bringing forth a fourth, procreative of another act.\nNew members in a no fewer number are shapen and framed, one still breeding\nand begetting another--as, link after link, the coat of mail at length is\nmade--till thus, piece after piece, by little and little, by information\nupon information, the process be completely well formed and perfect in all\nhis members.  Finally, having proceeded this length, I have recourse to my\ndice, nor is it to be thought that this interruption, respite, or\ninterpellation is by me occasioned without very good reason inducing me\nthereunto, and a notable experience of a most convincing and irrefragable\nforce.\n\nI remember, on a time, that in the camp at Stockholm there was a certain\nGascon named Gratianauld, native of the town of Saint Sever, who having\nlost all his money at play, and consecutively being very angry thereat--as\nyou know, Pecunia est alter sanguis, ut ait Anto. de Burtio, in c.\naccedens. 2. extra ut lit. non contest. et Bald. in l. si tuis. c. de opt.\nleg. per tot.in l. advocati. c. de advoc. div. jud.  Pecunia est vita\nhominis et optimus fide-jussor in necessitatibus--did, at his coming forth\nof the gaming-house, in the presence of the whole company that was there,\nwith a very loud voice speak in his own language these following words:\nPao cap de bious hillots, que maux de pipes bous tresbire:  ares que de\npergudes sont les mires bingt, et quouatre bagnelles, ta pla donnerien\npics, trucs, et patacts, Sey degun de bous aulx, qui boille truquar ambe\niou a bels embis.  Finding that none would make him any answer, he passed\nfrom thence to that part of the leaguer where the huff-snuff, honder\nsponder, swashbuckling High Germans were, to whom he renewed these very\nterms, provoking them to fight with him; but all the return he had from\nthem to his stout challenge was only, Der Gasconner thut sich ausz mit ein\niedem zu schlagen, aber er ist geneigter zu stehlen, darum, liebe frawen,\nhabt sorg zu euerm hauszrath.  Finding also that none of that band of\nTeutonic soldiers offered himself to the combat, he passed to that quarter\nof the leaguer where the French freebooting adventurers were encamped, and\nreiterating unto them what he had before repeated to the Dutch warriors,\nchallenged them likewise to fight with him, and therewithal made some\npretty little Gasconado frisking gambols to oblige them the more cheerfully\nand gallantly to cope with him in the lists of a duellizing engagement; but\nno answer at all was made unto him.  Whereupon the Gascon, despairing of\nmeeting with any antagonists, departed from thence, and laying himself down\nnot far from the pavilions of the grand Christian cavalier Crissie, fell\nfast asleep.  When he had thoroughly slept an hour or two, another\nadventurous and all-hazarding blade of the forlorn hope of the lavishingly\nwasting gamesters, having also lost all his moneys, sallied forth with\nsword in his hand, of a firm resolution to fight with the aforesaid Gascon,\nseeing he had lost as well as he.\n\n  Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veris,\n\nsaith the Gl. de poenitent. distinct. 3. c. sunt plures.  To this effect\nhaving made inquiry and search for him throughout the whole camp, and in\nsequel thereof found him asleep, he said unto him, Up, ho, good fellow, in\nthe name of all the devils of hell, rise up, rise up, get up!  I have lost\nmy money as well as thou hast done; let us therefore go fight lustily\ntogether, grapple and scuffle it to some purpose.  Thou mayest look and see\nthat my tuck is no longer than thy rapier.  The Gascon, altogether\nastonished at his unexpected provocation, without altering his former\ndialect spoke thus:  Cap de Saint Arnault, quau seys to you, qui me\nrebeillez?  Que mau de taberne te gire.  Ho Saint Siobe, cap de Gascoigne,\nta pla dormy jou, quand aquoest taquain me bingut estee.  The venturous\nroister inviteth him again to the duel, but the Gascon, without\ncondescending to his desire, said only this:  He paovret jou tesquinerie\nares, que son pla reposat.  Vayne un pauque te pausar com jou, peusse\ntruqueren.  Thus, in forgetting his loss, he forgot the eagerness which he\nhad to fight.  In conclusion, after that the other had likewise slept a\nlittle, they, instead of fighting, and possibly killing one another, went\njointly to a sutler's tent, where they drank together very amicably, each\nupon the pawn of his sword.  Thus by a little sleep was pacified the ardent\nfury of two warlike champions.  There, gossip, comes the golden word of\nJohn Andr. in cap. ult. de sent. et re. judic. l. sexto.\n\n  Sedendo, et dormiendo fit anima prudens.\n\nChapter 3.XLIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel excuseth Bridlegoose in the matter of sentencing actions at\nlaw by the chance of the dice.\n\nWith this Bridlegoose held his peace.  Whereupon Trinquamelle bid him\nwithdraw from the court--which accordingly was done--and then directed his\ndiscourse to Pantagruel after this manner:  It is fitting, most illustrious\nprince, not only by reason of the deep obligations wherein this present\nparliament, together with the whole marquisate of Mirelingues, stand bound\nto your royal highness for the innumerable benefits which, as effects of\nmere grace, they have received from your incomparable bounty, but for that\nexcellent wit also, prime judgment, and admirable learning wherewith\nAlmighty God, the giver of all good things, hath most richly qualified and\nendowed you, we tender and present unto you the decision of this new,\nstrange, and paradoxical case of Bridlegoose; who, in your presence, to\nyour both hearing and seeing, hath plainly confessed his final judging and\ndeterminating of suits of law by the mere chance and fortune of the dice.\nTherefore do we beseech you that you may be pleased to give sentence\ntherein as unto you shall seem most just and equitable.  To this Pantagruel\nanswered:  Gentlemen, it is not unknown to you how my condition is somewhat\nremote from the profession of deciding law controversies; yet, seeing you\nare pleased to do me the honour to put that task upon me, instead of\nundergoing the office of a judge I will become your humble supplicant.  I\nobserve, gentlemen, in this Bridlegoose several things which induce me to\nrepresent before you that it is my opinion he should be pardoned.  In the\nfirst place, his old age; secondly, his simplicity; to both which qualities\nour statute and common laws, civil and municipal together, allow many\nexcuses for any slips or escapes which, through the invincible imperfection\nof either, have been inconsiderately stumbled upon by a person so\nqualified.  Thirdly, gentlemen, I must needs display before you another\ncase, which in equity and justice maketh much for the advantage of\nBridlegoose, to wit, that this one, sole, and single fault of his ought to\nbe quite forgotten, abolished, and swallowed up by that immense and vast\nocean of just dooms and sentences which heretofore he hath given and\npronounced; his demeanours, for these forty years and upwards that he hath\nbeen a judge, having been so evenly balanced in the scales of uprightness,\nthat envy itself till now could not have been so impudent as to accuse and\ntwit him with any act worthy of a check or reprehension; as, if a drop of\nthe sea were thrown into the Loire, none could perceive or say that by this\nsingle drop the whole river should be salt and brackish.\n\nTruly, it seemeth unto me, that in the whole series of Bridlegoose's\njuridical decrees there hath been I know not what of extraordinary\nsavouring of the unspeakable benignity of God, that all those his preceding\nsentences, awards, and judgments, have been confirmed and approved of by\nyourselves in this your own venerable and sovereign court.  For it is\nusual, as you know well, with him whose ways are inscrutable, to manifest\nhis own ineffable glory in blunting the perspicacy of the eyes of the wise,\nin weakening the strength of potent oppressors, in depressing the pride of\nrich extortioners, and in erecting, comforting, protecting, supporting,\nupholding, and shoring up the poor, feeble, humble, silly, and foolish ones\nof the earth.  But, waiving all these matters, I shall only beseech you,\nnot by the obligations which you pretend to owe to my family, for which I\nthank you, but for that constant and unfeigned love and affection which you\nhave always found in me, both on this and on the other side of Loire, for\nthe maintenance and establishment of your places, offices, and dignities,\nthat for this one time you would pardon and forgive him upon these two\nconditions.  First, that he satisfy, or put a sufficient surety for the\nsatisfaction of the party wronged by the injustice of the sentence in\nquestion.  For the fulfilment of this article I will provide sufficiently.\nAnd, secondly, that for his subsidiary aid in the weighty charge of\nadministrating justice you would be pleased to appoint and assign unto him\nsome pretty little virtuous counsellor, younger, learneder, and wiser than\nhe, by the square and rule of whose advice he may regulate, guide, temper,\nand moderate in times coming all his judiciary procedures; or otherwise, if\nyou intend totally to depose him from his office, and to deprive him\naltogether of the state and dignity of a judge, I shall cordially entreat\nyou to make a present and free gift of him to me, who shall find in my\nkingdoms charges and employments enough wherewith to embusy him, for the\nbettering of his own fortunes and furtherance of my service.  In the\nmeantime, I implore the Creator, Saviour, and Sanctifier of all good\nthings, in his grace, mercy, and kindness, to preserve you all now and\nevermore, world without end.\n\nThese words thus spoken, Pantagruel, vailing his cap and making a leg with\nsuch a majestic garb as became a person of his paramount degree and\neminency, farewelled Trinquamelle, the president and master-speaker of that\nMirelinguesian parliament, took his leave of the whole court, and went out\nof the chamber; at the door whereof finding Panurge, Epistemon, Friar John,\nand others, he forthwith, attended by them, walked to the outer gate, where\nall of them immediately took horse to return towards Gargantua.  Pantagruel\nby the way related to them from point to point the manner of Bridlegoose's\nsententiating differences at law.  Friar John said that he had seen Peter\nDandin, and was acquainted with him at that time when he sojourned in the\nmonastery of Fontaine le Comte, under the noble Abbot Ardillon.  Gymnast\nlikewise affirmed that he was in the tent of the grand Christian cavalier\nDe Crissie, when the Gascon, after his sleep, made answer to the\nadventurer.  Panurge was somewhat incredulous in the matter of believing\nthat it was morally possible Bridlegoose should have been for such a long\nspace of time so continually fortunate in that aleatory way of deciding law\ndebates.  Epistemon said to Pantagruel, Such another story, not much unlike\nto that in all the circumstances thereof, is vulgarly reported of the\nprovost of Montlehery.  In good sooth, such a perpetuity of good luck is to\nbe wondered at.  To have hit right twice or thrice in a judgment so given\nby haphazard might have fallen out well enough, especially in controversies\nthat were ambiguous, intricate, abstruse, perplexed, and obscure.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLIV.\n\nHow Pantagruel relateth a strange history of the perplexity of human\njudgment.\n\nSeeing you talk, quoth Pantagruel, of dark, difficult, hard, and knotty\ndebates, I will tell you of one controverted before Cneius Dolabella,\nproconsul in Asia.  The case was this.\n\nA wife in Smyrna had of her first husband a child named Abece.  He dying,\nshe, after the expiring of a year and day, married again, and to her second\nhusband bore a boy called Effege.  A pretty long time thereafter it\nhappened, as you know the affection of stepfathers and stepdams is very\nrare towards the children of the first fathers and mothers deceased, that\nthis husband, with the help of his son Effege, secretly, wittingly,\nwillingly, and treacherously murdered Abece.  The woman came no sooner to\nget information of the fact, but, that it might not go unpunished, she\ncaused kill them both, to revenge the death of her first son.  She was\napprehended and carried before Cneius Dolabella, in whose presence she,\nwithout dissembling anything, confessed all that was laid to her charge;\nyet alleged that she had both right and reason on her side for the killing\nof them.  Thus was the state of the question.  He found the business so\ndubious and intricate, that he knew not what to determine therein, nor\nwhich of the parties to incline to.  On the one hand, it was an execrable\ncrime to cut off at once both her second husband and her son.  On the other\nhand, the cause of the murder seemed to be so natural, as to be grounded\nupon the law of nations and the rational instinct of all the people of the\nworld, seeing they two together had feloniously and murderously destroyed\nher first son; not that they had been in any manner of way wronged,\noutraged, or injured by him, but out of an avaricious intent to possess his\ninheritance.  In this doubtful quandary and uncertainty what to pitch upon,\nhe sent to the Areopagites then sitting at Athens to learn and obtain their\nadvice and judgment.  That judicious senate, very sagely perpending the\nreasons of his perplexity, sent him word to summon her personally to\ncompear before him a precise hundred years thereafter, to answer to some\ninterrogatories touching certain points which were not contained in the\nverbal defence.  Which resolution of theirs did import that it was in their\nopinion a so difficult and inextricable matter that they knew not what to\nsay or judge therein.  Who had decided that plea by the chance and fortune\nof the dice, could not have erred nor awarded amiss on which side soever he\nhad passed his casting and condemnatory sentence.  If against the woman,\nshe deserved punishment for usurping sovereign authority by taking that\nvengeance at her own hand, the inflicting whereof was only competent to the\nsupreme power to administer justice in criminal cases.  If for her, the\njust resentment of a so atrocious injury done unto her, in murdering her\ninnocent son, did fully excuse and vindicate her of any trespass or offence\nabout that particular committed by her.  But this continuation of\nBridlegoose for so many years still hitting the nail on the head, never\nmissing the mark, and always judging aright, by the mere throwing of the\ndice and chance thereof, is that which most astonisheth and amazeth me.\n\nTo answer, quoth Pantagruel (Epistemon, says the English edition of 1694,\nfollowing the reading of the modern French editions.  Le Duchat has pointed\nout the mistake.--M.), categorically to that which you wonder at, I must\ningeniously confess and avow that I cannot; yet, conjecturally to guess at\nthe reason of it, I would refer the cause of that marvellously\nlong-continued happy success in the judiciary results of his definitive\nsentences to the favourable aspect of the heavens and benignity of the\nintelligences; who, out of their love to goodness, after having\ncontemplated the pure simplicity and sincere unfeignedness of Judge\nBridlegoose in the acknowledgment of his inabilities, did regulate that for\nhim by chance which by the profoundest act of his maturest deliberation he\nwas not able to reach unto.  That, likewise, which possibly made him to\ndiffide in his own skill and capacity, notwithstanding his being an expert\nand understanding lawyer, for anything that I know to the contrary, was the\nknowledge and experience which he had of the antinomies, contrarieties,\nantilogies, contradictions, traversings, and thwartings of laws, customs,\nedicts, statutes, orders, and ordinances, in which dangerous opposition,\nequity and justice being structured and founded on either of the opposite\nterms, and a gap being thereby opened for the ushering in of injustice and\niniquity through the various interpretations of self-ended lawyers, being\nassuredly persuaded that the infernal calumniator, who frequently\ntransformeth himself into the likeness of a messenger or angel of light,\nmaketh use of these cross glosses and expositions in the mouths and pens of\nhis ministers and servants, the perverse advocates, bribing judges,\nlaw-monging attorneys, prevaricating counsellors, and other such-like\nlaw-wresting members of a court of justice, to turn by those means black to\nwhite, green to grey, and what is straight to a crooked ply.  For the more\nexpedient doing whereof, these diabolical ministers make both the pleading\nparties believe that their cause is just and righteous; for it is well\nknown that there is no cause, how bad soever, which doth not find an\nadvocate to patrocinate and defend it,--else would there be no process in\nthe world, no suits at law, nor pleadings at the bar.  He did in these\nextremities, as I conceive, most humbly recommend the direction of his\njudicial proceedings to the upright judge of judges, God Almighty; did\nsubmit himself to the conduct and guideship of the blessed Spirit in the\nhazard and perplexity of the definitive sentence, and, by this aleatory\nlot, did as it were implore and explore the divine decree of his goodwill\nand pleasure, instead of that which we call the final judgment of a court.\nTo this effect, to the better attaining to his purpose, which was to judge\nrighteously, he did, in my opinion, throw and turn the dice, to the end\nthat by the providence aforesaid the best chance might fall to him whose\naction was uprightest, and backed with greatest reason.  In doing whereof\nhe did not stray from the sense of Talmudists, who say that there is so\nlittle harm in that manner of searching the truth, that in the anxiety and\nperplexedness of human wits God oftentimes manifesteth the secret pleasure\nof his divine will.\n\nFurthermore, I will neither think nor say, nor can I believe, that the\nunstraightness is so irregular, or the corruption so evident, of those of\nthe parliament of Mirelingois in Mirelingues, before whom Bridlegoose was\narraigned for prevarication, that they will maintain it to be a worse\npractice to have the decision of a suit at law referred to the chance and\nhazard of a throw of the dice, hab nab, or luck as it will, than to have it\nremitted to and passed by the determination of those whose hands are full\nof blood and hearts of wry affections.  Besides that, their principal\ndirection in all law matters comes to their hands from one Tribonian, a\nwicked, miscreant, barbarous, faithless and perfidious knave, so\npernicious, unjust, avaricious, and perverse in his ways, that it was his\nordinary custom to sell laws, edicts, declarations, constitutions, and\nordinances, as at an outroop or putsale, to him who offered most for them.\nThus did he shape measures for the pleaders, and cut their morsels to them\nby and out of these little parcels, fragments, bits, scantlings, and shreds\nof the law now in use, altogether concealing, suppressing, disannulling,\nand abolishing the remainder, which did make for the total law; fearing\nthat, if the whole law were made manifest and laid open to the knowledge of\nsuch as are interested in it, and the learned books of the ancient doctors\nof the law upon the exposition of the Twelve Tables and Praetorian Edicts,\nhis villainous pranks, naughtiness, and vile impiety should come to the\npublic notice of the world.  Therefore were it better, in my conceit, that\nis to say, less inconvenient, that parties at variance in any juridical\ncase should in the dark march upon caltrops than submit the determination\nof what is their right to such unhallowed sentences and horrible decrees;\nas Cato in his time wished and advised that every judiciary court should be\npaved with caltrops.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLV.\n\nHow Panurge taketh advice of Triboulet.\n\nOn the sixth day thereafter Pantagruel was returned home at the very same\nhour that Triboulet was by water come from Blois.  Panurge, at his arrival,\ngave him a hog's bladder puffed up with wind, and resounding because of the\nhard peas that were within it.  Moreover he did present him with a gilt\nwooden sword, a hollow budget made of a tortoise shell, an osier-wattled\nwicker-bottle full of Breton wine, and five-and-twenty apples of the\norchard of Blandureau.\n\nIf he be such a fool, quoth Carpalin, as to be won with apples, there is no\nmore wit in his pate than in the head of an ordinary cabbage.  Triboulet\ngirded the sword and scrip to his side, took the bladder in his hand, ate\nsome few of the apples, and drunk up all the wine.  Panurge very wistly and\nheedfully looking upon him said, I never yet saw a fool, and I have seen\nten thousand francs worth of that kind of cattle, who did not love to drink\nheartily, and by good long draughts.  When Triboulet had done with his\ndrinking, Panurge laid out before him and exposed the sum of the business\nwherein he was to require his advice, in eloquent and choicely-sorted\nterms, adorned with flourishes of rhetoric.  But, before he had altogether\ndone, Triboulet with his fist gave him a bouncing whirret between the\nshoulders, rendered back into his hand again the empty bottle, fillipped\nand flirted him in the nose with the hog's bladder, and lastly, for a final\nresolution, shaking and wagging his head strongly and disorderly, he\nanswered nothing else but this, By God, God, mad fool, beware the monk,\nBuzansay hornpipe!  These words thus finished, he slipped himself out of\nthe company, went aside, and, rattling the bladder, took a huge delight in\nthe melody of the rickling crackling noise of the peas.  After which time\nit lay not in the power of them all to draw out of his chaps the articulate\nsound of one syllable, insomuch that, when Panurge went about to\ninterrogate him further, Triboulet drew his wooden sword, and would have\nstuck him therewith.  I have fished fair now, quoth Panurge, and brought my\npigs to a fine market.  Have I not got a brave determination of all my\ndoubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?\nHe is a great fool, that is not to be denied, yet is he a greater fool who\nbrought him hither to me,--That bolt, quoth Carpalin, levels point-blank at\nme,--but of the three I am the greatest fool, who did impart the secret of\nmy thoughts to such an idiot ass and native ninny.\n\nWithout putting ourselves to any stir or trouble in the least, quoth\nPantagruel, let us maturely and seriously consider and perpend the gestures\nand speech which he hath made and uttered.  In them, veritably, quoth he,\nhave I remarked and observed some excellent and notable mysteries; yea, of\nsuch important worth and weight, that I shall never henceforth be\nastonished, nor think strange, why the Turks with a great deal of worship\nand reverence honour and respect natural fools equally with their primest\ndoctors, muftis, divines, and prophets.  Did not you take heed, quoth he, a\nlittle before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and\nwagging his head did keep?  By the approved doctrine of the ancient\nphilosophers, the customary ceremonies of the most expert magicians, and\nthe received opinions of the learnedest lawyers, such a brangling agitation\nand moving should by us all be judged to proceed from, and be quickened and\nsuscitated by the coming and inspiration of the prophetizing and fatidical\nspirit, which, entering briskly and on a sudden into a shallow receptacle\nof a debile substance (for, as you know, and as the proverb shows it, a\nlittle head containeth not much brains), was the cause of that commotion.\nThis is conform to what is avouched by the most skilful physicians, when\nthey affirm that shakings and tremblings fall upon the members of a human\nbody, partly because of the heaviness and violent impetuosity of the burden\nand load that is carried, and, other part, by reason of the weakness and\nimbecility that is in the virtue of the bearing organ.  A manifest example\nwhereof appeareth in those who, fasting, are not able to carry to their\nhead a great goblet full of wine without a trembling and a shaking in the\nhand that holds it.  This of old was accounted a prefiguration and mystical\npointing out of the Pythian divineress, who used always, before the\nuttering of a response from the oracle, to shake a branch of her domestic\nlaurel.  Lampridius also testifieth that the Emperor Heliogabalus, to\nacquire unto himself the reputation of a soothsayer, did, on several holy\ndays of prime solemnnity, in the presence of the fanatic rabble, make the\nhead of his idol by some slight within the body thereof publicly to shake.\nPlautus, in his Asinaria, declareth likewise, that Saurias, whithersoever\nhe walked, like one quite distracted of his wits kept such a furious\nlolling and mad-like shaking of his head, that he commonly affrighted those\nwho casually met with him in his way.  The said author in another place,\nshowing a reason why Charmides shook and brangled his head, assevered that\nhe was transported and in an ecstasy.  Catullus after the same manner\nmaketh mention, in his Berecynthia and Atys, of the place wherein the\nMenades, Bacchical women, she-priests of the Lyaean god, and demented\nprophetesses, carrying ivy boughs in their hands, did shake their heads.\nAs in the like case, amongst the Galli, the gelded priests of Cybele were\nwont to do in the celebrating of their festivals.  Whence, too, according\nto the sense of the ancient theologues, she herself has her denomination,\nfor kubistan signifieth to turn round, whirl about, shake the head, and\nplay the part of one that is wry-necked.\n\nSemblably Titus Livius writeth that, in the solemnization time of the\nBacchanalian holidays at Rome, both men and women seemed to prophetize and\nvaticinate, because of an affected kind of wagging of the head, shrugging\nof the shoulders, and jectigation of the whole body, which they used then\nmost punctually.  For the common voice of the philosophers, together with\nthe opinion of the people, asserteth for an irrefragable truth that\nvaticination is seldom by the heavens bestowed on any without the\nconcomitancy of a little frenzy and a head-shaking, not only when the said\npresaging virtue is infused, but when the person also therewith inspired\ndeclareth and manifesteth it unto others.  The learned lawyer Julian, being\nasked on a time if that slave might be truly esteemed to be healthful and\nin a good plight who had not only conversed with some furious, maniac, and\nenraged people, but in their company had also prophesied, yet without a\nnoddle-shaking concussion, answered that, seeing there was no head-wagging\nat the time of his predictions, he might be held for sound and compotent\nenough.  Is it not daily seen how schoolmasters, teachers, tutors, and\ninstructors of children shake the heads of their disciples, as one would do\na pot in holding it by the lugs, that by this erection, vellication,\nstretching, and pulling their ears, which, according to the doctrine of the\nsage Egyptians, is a member consecrated to the memory, they may stir them\nup to recollect their scattered thoughts, bring home those fancies of\ntheirs which perhaps have been extravagantly roaming abroad upon strange\nand uncouth objects, and totally range their judgments, which possibly by\ndisordinate affections have been made wild, to the rule and pattern of a\nwise, discreet, virtuous, and philosophical discipline.  All which Virgil\nacknowledgeth to be true, in the branglement of Apollo Cynthius.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLVI.\n\nHow Pantagruel and Panurge diversely interpret the words of Triboulet.\n\nHe says you are a fool.  And what kind of fool?  A mad fool, who in your\nold age would enslave yourself to the bondage of matrimony, and shut your\npleasures up within a wedlock whose key some ruffian carries in his\ncodpiece.  He says furthermore, Beware of the monk.  Upon mine honour, it\ngives me in my mind that you will be cuckolded by a monk.  Nay, I will\nengage mine honour, which is the most precious pawn I could have in my\npossession although I were sole and peaceable dominator over all Europe,\nAsia, and Africa, that, if you marry, you will surely be one of the horned\nbrotherhood of Vulcan.  Hereby may you perceive how much I do attribute to\nthe wise foolery of our morosoph Triboulet.  The other oracles and\nresponses did in the general prognosticate you a cuckold, without\ndescending so near to the point of a particular determination as to pitch\nupon what vocation amongst the several sorts of men he should profess who\nis to be the copesmate of your wife and hornifier of your proper self.\nThus noble Triboulet tells it us plainly, from whose words we may gather\nwith all ease imaginable that your cuckoldry is to be infamous, and so much\nthe more scandalous that your conjugal bed will be incestuously\ncontaminated with the filthiness of a monkery lecher.  Moreover, he says\nthat you will be the hornpipe of Buzansay, that is to say, well-horned,\nhornified, and cornuted.  And, as Triboulet's uncle asked from Louis the\nTwelfth, for a younger brother of his own who lived at Blois, the hornpipes\nof Buzansay, for the organ pipes, through the mistake of one word for\nanother, even so, whilst you think to marry a wise, humble, calm, discreet,\nand honest wife, you shall unhappily stumble upon one witless, proud, loud,\nobstreperous, bawling, clamorous, and more unpleasant than any Buzansay\nhornpipe.  Consider withal how he flirted you on the nose with the bladder,\nand gave you a sound thumping blow with his fist upon the ridge of the\nback.  This denotates and presageth that you shall be banged, beaten, and\nfillipped by her, and that also she will steal of your goods from you, as\nyou stole the hog's bladder from the little boys of Vaubreton.\n\nFlat contrary, quoth Panurge;--not that I would impudently exempt myself\nfrom being a vassal in the territory of folly.  I hold of that\njurisdiction, and am subject thereto, I confess it.  And why should I not?\nFor the whole world is foolish.  In the old Lorraine language, fou for tou,\nall and fool, were the same thing.  Besides, it is avouched by Solomon that\ninfinite is the number of fools.  From an infinity nothing can be deducted\nor abated, nor yet, by the testimony of Aristotle, can anything thereto be\nadded or subjoined.  Therefore were I a mad fool if, being a fool, I should\nnot hold myself a fool.  After the same manner of speaking, we may aver the\nnumber of the mad and enraged folks to be infinite.  Avicenna maketh no\nbones to assert that the several kinds of madness are infinite.  Though\nthis much of Triboulet's words tend little to my advantage, howbeit the\nprejudice which I sustain thereby be common with me to all other men, yet\nthe rest of his talk and gesture maketh altogether for me.  He said to my\nwife, Be wary of the monkey; that is as much as if she should be cheery,\nand take as much delight in a monkey as ever did the Lesbia of Catullus in\nher sparrow; who will for his recreation pass his time no less joyfully at\nthe exercise of snatching flies than heretofore did the merciless\nfly-catcher Domitian.  Withal he meant, by another part of his discourse,\nthat she should be of a jovial country-like humour, as gay and pleasing as a\nharmonious hornpipe of Saulieau or Buzansay.  The veridical Triboulet did\ntherein hint at what I liked well, as perfectly knowing the inclinations and\npropensions of my mind, my natural disposition, and the bias of my interior\npassions and affections.  For you may be assured that my humour is much\nbetter satisfied and contented with the pretty, frolic, rural, dishevelled\nshepherdesses, whose bums through their coarse canvas smocks smell of the\nclover grass of the field, than with those great ladies in magnific courts,\nwith their flandan top-knots and sultanas, their polvil, pastillos, and\ncosmetics.  The homely sound, likewise, of a rustical hornpipe is more\nagreeable to my ears than the curious warbling and musical quavering of\nlutes, theorbos, viols, rebecs, and violins.  He gave me a lusty rapping\nthwack on my back,--what then?  Let it pass, in the name and for the love of\nGod, as an abatement of and deduction from so much of my future pains in\npurgatory.  He did it not out of any evil intent.  He thought, belike, to\nhave hit some of the pages.  He is an honest fool, and an innocent\nchangeling.  It is a sin to harbour in the heart any bad conceit of him.  As\nfor myself, I heartily pardon him.  He flirted me on the nose.  In that\nthere is no harm; for it importeth nothing else but that betwixt my wife and\nme there will occur some toyish wanton tricks which usually happen to all\nnew-married folks.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel and Panurge resolved to make a visit to the oracle of the\nholy bottle.\n\nThere is as yet another point, quoth Panurge, which you have not at all\nconsidered on, although it be the chief and principal head of the matter.\nHe put the bottle in my hand and restored it me again.  How interpret you\nthat passage?  What is the meaning of that?  He possibly, quoth Pantagruel,\nsignifieth thereby that your wife will be such a drunkard as shall daily\ntake in her liquor kindly, and ply the pots and bottles apace.  Quite\notherwise, quoth Panurge; for the bottle was empty.  I swear to you, by the\nprickling brambly thorn of St. Fiacre in Brie, that our unique morosoph,\nwhom I formerly termed the lunatic Triboulet, referreth me, for attaining\nto the final resolution of my scruple, to the response-giving bottle.\nTherefore do I renew afresh the first vow which I made, and here in your\npresence protest and make oath, by Styx and Acheron, to carry still\nspectacles in my cap, and never to wear a codpiece in my breeches, until\nupon the enterprise in hand of my nuptial undertaking I shall have obtained\nan answer from the holy bottle.  I am acquainted with a prudent,\nunderstanding, and discreet gentleman, and besides a very good friend of\nmine, who knoweth the land, country, and place where its temple and oracle\nis built and posited.  He will guide and conduct us thither sure and\nsafely.  Let us go thither, I beseech you.  Deny me not, and say not nay;\nreject not the suit I make unto you, I entreat you.  I will be to you an\nAchates, a Damis, and heartily accompany you all along in the whole voyage,\nboth in your going forth and coming back.  I have of a long time known you\nto be a great lover of peregrination, desirous still to learn new things,\nand still to see what you had never seen before.\n\nVery willingly, quoth Pantagruel, I condescend to your request.  But before\nwe enter in upon our progress towards the accomplishment of so far a\njourney, replenished and fraught with eminent perils, full of innumerable\nhazards, and every way stored with evident and manifest dangers,--What\ndangers? quoth Panurge, interrupting him.  Dangers fly back, run from, and\nshun me whithersoever I go, seven leagues around, as in the presence of the\nsovereign a subordinate magistracy is eclipsed; or as clouds and darkness\nquite evanish at the bright coming of a radiant sun; or as all sores and\nsicknesses did suddenly depart at the approach of the body of St. Martin a\nQuande.  Nevertheless, quoth Pantagruel, before we adventure to set\nforwards on the road of our projected and intended voyage, some few points\nare to be discussed, expedited, and despatched.  First, let us send back\nTriboulet to Blois.  Which was instantly done, after that Pantagruel had\ngiven him a frieze coat.  Secondly, our design must be backed with the\nadvice and counsel of the king my father.  And, lastly, it is most needful\nand expedient for us that we search for and find out some sibyl to serve us\nfor a guide, truchman, and interpreter.  To this Panurge made answer, that\nhis friend Xenomanes would abundantly suffice for the plenary discharge and\nperformance of the sibyl's office; and that, furthermore, in passing\nthrough the Lanternatory revelling country, they should take along with\nthem a learned and profitable Lanternesse, which would be no less useful to\nthem in their voyage than was the sibyl to Aeneas in his descent to the\nElysian fields.  Carpalin, in the interim, as he was upon the conducting\naway of Triboulet, in his passing by hearkened a little to the discourse\nthey were upon; then spoke out, saying, Ho, Panurge, master freeman, take\nmy Lord Debitis at Calais alongst with you, for he is goud-fallot, a good\nfellow.  He will not forget those who have been debitors; these are\nLanternes.  Thus shall you not lack for both fallot and lanterne.  I may\nsafely with the little skill I have, quoth Pantagruel, prognosticate that\nby the way we shall engender no melancholy.  I clearly perceive it already.\nThe only thing that vexeth me is, that I cannot speak the Lanternatory\nlanguage.  I shall, answered Panurge, speak for you all.  I understand it\nevery whit as well as I do mine own maternal tongue; I have been no less\nused to it than to the vulgar French.\n\n  Briszmarg dalgotbrick nubstzne zos.\n  Isquebsz prusq:  albok crinqs zacbac.\n  Mizbe dilbarskz morp nipp stancz bos,\n  Strombtz, Panurge, walmap quost gruszbac.\n\nNow guess, friend Epistemon, what this is.  They are, quoth Epistemon,\nnames of errant devils, passant devils, and rampant devils.  These words of\nthine, dear friend of mine, are true, quoth Panurge; yet are they terms\nused in the language of the court of the Lanternish people.  By the way, as\nwe go upon our journey, I will make to thee a pretty little dictionary,\nwhich, notwithstanding, shall not last you much longer than a pair of new\nshoes.  Thou shalt have learned it sooner than thou canst perceive the\ndawning of the next subsequent morning.  What I have said in the foregoing\ntetrastich is thus translated out of the Lanternish tongue into our vulgar\ndialect:\n\n  All miseries attended me, whilst I\n  A lover was, and had no good thereby.\n  Of better luck the married people tell;\n  Panurge is one of those, and knows it well.\n\nThere is little more, then, quoth Pantagruel, to be done, but that we\nunderstand what the will of the king my father will be therein, and\npurchase his consent.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLVIII.\n\nHow Gargantua showeth that the children ought not to marry without the\nspecial knowledge and advice of their fathers and mothers.\n\nNo sooner had Pantagruel entered in at the door of the great hall of the\ncastle, than that he encountered full butt with the good honest Gargantua\ncoming forth from the council board, unto whom he made a succinct and\nsummary narrative of what had passed and occurred, worthy of his\nobservation, in his travels abroad, since their last interview; then,\nacquainting him with the design he had in hand, besought him that it might\nstand with his goodwill and pleasure to grant him leave to prosecute and go\nthrough-stitch with the enterprise which he had undertaken.  The good man\nGargantua, having in one hand two great bundles of petitions endorsed and\nanswered, and in the other some remembrancing notes and bills, to put him\nin mind of such other requests of supplicants, which, albeit presented, had\nnevertheless been neither read nor heard, he gave both to Ulric Gallet, his\nancient and faithful Master of Requests; then drew aside Pantagruel, and,\nwith a countenance more serene and jovial than customary, spoke to him\nthus:  I praise God, and have great reason so to do, my most dear son, that\nhe hath been pleased to entertain in you a constant inclination to virtuous\nactions.  I am well content that the voyage which you have motioned to me\nbe by you accomplished, but withal I could wish you would have a mind and\ndesire to marry, for that I see you are of competent years.  Panurge in the\nmeanwhile was in a readiness of preparing and providing for remedies,\nsalves, and cures against all such lets, obstacles, and impediments as he\ncould in the height of his fancy conceive might by Gargantua be cast in the\nway of their itinerary design.  Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that\nyou speak? answered Pantagruel.  For my part, I have not yet thought upon\nit.  In all this affair I wholly submit and rest in your good liking and\npaternal authority.  For I shall rather pray unto God that he would throw\nme down stark dead at your feet, in your pleasure, than that against your\npleasure I should be found married alive.  I never yet heard that by any\nlaw, whether sacred or profane, yea, amongst the rudest and most barbarous\nnations in the world, it was allowed and approved of that children may be\nsuffered and tolerated to marry at their own goodwill and pleasure, without\nthe knowledge, advice, or consent asked and had thereto of their fathers,\nmothers, and nearest kindred.  All legislators, everywhere upon the face of\nthe whole earth, have taken away and removed this licentious liberty from\nchildren, and totally reserved it to the discretion of the parents.\n\nMy dearly beloved son, quoth Gargantua, I believe you, and from my heart\nthank God for having endowed you with the grace of having both a perfect\nnotice of and entire liking to laudable and praiseworthy things; and that\nthrough the windows of your exterior senses he hath vouchsafed to transmit\nunto the interior faculties of your mind nothing but what is good and\nvirtuous.  For in my time there hath been found on the continent a certain\ncountry, wherein are I know not what kind of Pastophorian mole-catching\npriests, who, albeit averse from engaging their proper persons into a\nmatrimonial duty, like the pontifical flamens of Cybele in Phrygia, as if\nthey were capons, and not cocks full of lasciviousness, salacity, and\nwantonness, who yet have, nevertheless, in the matter of conjugal affairs,\ntaken upon them to prescribe laws and ordinances to married folks.  I\ncannot goodly determine what I should most abhor, detest, loathe, and\nabominate,--whether the tyrannical presumption of those dreaded sacerdotal\nmole-catchers, who, not being willing to contain and coop up themselves\nwithin the grates and trellises of their own mysterious temples, do deal\nin, meddle with, obtrude upon, and thrust their sickles into harvests of\nsecular businesses quite contrary and diametrically opposite to the\nquality, state, and condition of their callings, professions, and\nvocations; or the superstitious stupidity and senseless scrupulousness of\nmarried folks, who have yielded obedience, and submitted their bodies,\nfortunes, and estates to the discretion and authority of such odious,\nperverse, barbarous, and unreasonable laws.  Nor do they see that which is\nclearer than the light and splendour of the morning star,--how all these\nnuptial and connubial sanctions, statutes, and ordinances have been\ndecreed, made, and instituted for the sole benefit, profit, and advantage\nof the flaminal mysts and mysterious flamens, and nothing at all for the\ngood, utility, or emolument of the silly hoodwinked married people.  Which\nadministereth unto others a sufficient cause for rendering these churchmen\nsuspicious of iniquity, and of an unjust and fraudulent manner of dealing,\nno more to be connived at nor countenanced, after that it be well weighed\nin the scales of reason, than if with a reciprocal temerity the laics, by\nway of compensation, would impose laws to be followed and observed by those\nmysts and flamens, how they should behave themselves in the making and\nperformance of their rites and ceremonies, and after what manner they ought\nto proceed in the offering up and immolating of their various oblations,\nvictims, and sacrifices; seeing that, besides the decimation and\ntithe-haling of their goods, they cut off and take parings, shreddings, and\nclippings of the gain proceeding from the labour of their hands and sweat\nof their brows, therewith to entertain themselves the better.  Upon which\nconsideration, in my opinion, their injunctions and commands would not\nprove so pernicious and impertinent as those of the ecclesiastic power unto\nwhich they had tendered their blind obedience.  For, as you have very well\nsaid, there is no place in the world where, legally, a licence is granted\nto the children to marry without the advice and consent of their parents\nand kindred.  Nevertheless, by those wicked laws and mole-catching customs,\nwhereat there is a little hinted in what I have already spoken to you,\nthere is no scurvy, measly, leprous, or pocky ruffian, pander, knave,\nrogue, skellum, robber, or thief, pilloried, whipped, and burn-marked in\nhis own country for his crimes and felonies, who may not violently snatch\naway and ravish what maid soever he had a mind to pitch upon, how noble,\nhow fair, how rich, honest, and chaste soever she be, and that out of the\nhouse of her own father, in his own presence, from the bosom of her mother,\nand in the sight and despite of her friends and kindred looking on a so\nwoeful spectacle, provided that the rascal villain be so cunning as to\nassociate unto himself some mystical flamen, who, according to the covenant\nmade betwixt them two, shall be in hope some day to participate of the\nprey.\n\nCould the Goths, the Scyths, or Massagets do a worse or more cruel act to\nany of the inhabitants of a hostile city, when, after the loss of many of\ntheir most considerable commanders, the expense of a great deal of money,\nand a long siege, they shall have stormed and taken it by a violent and\nimpetuous assault?  May not these fathers and mothers, think you, be\nsorrowful and heavy-hearted when they see an unknown fellow, a vagabond\nstranger, a barbarous lout, a rude cur, rotten, fleshless, putrified,\nscraggy, boily, botchy, poor, a forlorn caitiff and miserable sneak, by an\nopen rapt snatch away before their own eyes their so fair, delicate, neat,\nwell-behavioured, richly-provided-for and healthful daughters, on whose\nbreeding and education they had spared no cost nor charges, by bringing\nthem up in an honest discipline to all the honourable and virtuous\nemployments becoming one of their sex descended of a noble parentage,\nhoping by those commendable and industrious means in an opportune and\nconvenient time to bestow them on the worthy sons of their well-deserving\nneighbours and ancient friends, who had nourished, entertained, taught,\ninstructed, and schooled their children with the same care and solicitude,\nto make them matches fit to attain to the felicity of a so happy marriage,\nthat from them might issue an offspring and progeny no less heirs to the\nlaudable endowments and exquisite qualifications of their parents, whom\nthey every way resemble, than to their personal and real estates, movables,\nand inheritances?  How doleful, trist, and plangorous would such a sight\nand pageantry prove unto them?  You shall not need to think that the\ncollachrymation of the Romans and their confederates at the decease of\nGermanicus Drusus was comparable to this lamentation of theirs?  Neither\nwould I have you to believe that the discomfort and anxiety of the\nLacedaemonians, when the Greek Helen, by the perfidiousness of the\nadulterous Trojan, Paris, was privily stolen away out of their country, was\ngreater or more pitiful than this ruthful and deplorable collugency of\ntheirs?  You may very well imagine that Ceres at the ravishment of her\ndaughter Proserpina was not more attristed, sad, nor mournful than they.\nTrust me, and your own reason, that the loss of Osiris was not so\nregrettable to Isis, nor did Venus so deplore the death of Adonis, nor yet\ndid Hercules so bewail the straying of Hylas, nor was the rapt of Polyxena\nmore throbbingly resented and condoled by Priamus and Hecuba, than this\naforesaid accident would be sympathetically bemoaned, grievous, ruthful,\nand anxious to the woefully desolate and disconsolate parents.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, the greater part of so vilely abused parents are\nso timorous and afraid of devils and hobgoblins, and so deeply plunged in\nsuperstition, that they dare not gainsay nor contradict, much less oppose\nand resist those unnatural and impious actions, when the mole-catcher hath\nbeen present at the perpetrating of the fact, and a party contractor and\ncovenanter in that detestable bargain.  What do they do then?  They\nwretchedly stay at their own miserable homes, destitute of their\nwell-beloved daughters, the fathers cursing the days and the hours wherein\nthey were married, and the mothers howling and crying that it was not their\nfortune to have brought forth abortive issues when they happened to be\ndelivered of such unfortunate girls, and in this pitiful plight spend at\nbest the remainder of their time with tears and weeping for those their\nchildren, of and from whom they expected, (and, with good reason, should\nhave obtained and reaped,) in these latter days of theirs, joy and comfort.\nOther parents there have been, so impatient of that affront and indignity\nput upon them and their families, that, transported with the extremity of\npassion, in a mad and frantic mood, through the vehemency of a grievous\nfury and raging sorrow, have drowned, hanged, killed, and otherwise put\nviolent hands on themselves.  Others, again, of that parental relation\nhave, upon the reception of the like injury, been of a more magnanimous and\nheroic spirit, who, in imitation and at the example of the children of\nJacob revenging upon the Sichemites the rapt of their sister Dinah, having\nfound the rascally ruffian in the association of his mystical mole-catcher\nclosely and in hugger-mugger conferring, parleying, and coming with their\ndaughters, for the suborning, corrupting, depraving, perverting, and\nenticing these innocent unexperienced maids unto filthy lewdnesses, have,\nwithout any further advisement on the matter, cut them instantly into\npieces, and thereupon forthwith thrown out upon the fields their so\ndismembered bodies, to serve for food unto the wolves and ravens.  Upon the\nchivalrous, bold, and courageous achievement of a so valiant, stout, and\nmanlike act, the other mole-catching symmysts have been so highly incensed,\nand have so chafed, fretted, and fumed thereat, that, bills of complaint\nand accusations having been in a most odious and detestable manner put in\nbefore the competent judges, the arm of secular authority hath with much\nimportunity and impetuosity been by them implored and required, they\nproudly contending that the servants of God would become contemptible if\nexemplary punishment were not speedily taken upon the persons of the\nperpetrators of such an enormous, horrid, sacrilegious, crying, heinous,\nand execrable crime.\n\nYet neither by natural equity, by the law of nations, nor by any imperial\nlaw whatsoever, hath there been found so much as one rubric, paragraph,\npoint, or tittle, by the which any kind of chastisement or correction hath\nbeen adjudged due to be inflicted upon any for their delinquency in that\nkind.  Reason opposeth, and nature is repugnant.  For there is no virtuous\nman in the world who both naturally and with good reason will not be more\nhugely troubled in mind, hearing of the news of the rapt, disgrace,\nignominy, and dishonour of his daughter, than of her death.  Now any man,\nfinding in hot blood one who with a forethought felony hath murdered his\ndaughter, may, without tying himself to the formalities and circumstances\nof a legal proceeding, kill him on a sudden and out of hand without\nincurring any hazard of being attainted and apprehended by the officers of\njustice for so doing.  What wonder is it then?  Or how little strange\nshould it appear to any rational man, if a lechering rogue, together with\nhis mole-catching abettor, be entrapped in the flagrant act of suborning\nhis daughter, and stealing her out of his house, though herself consent\nthereto, that the father in such a case of stain and infamy by them brought\nupon his family, should put them both to a shameful death, and cast their\ncarcasses upon dunghills to be devoured and eaten up by dogs and swine, or\notherwise fling them a little further off to the direption, tearing, and\nrending asunder of their joints and members by the wild beasts of the field\n(as unworthy to receive the gentle, the desired, the last kind embraces of\nthe great Alma Mater, the earth, commonly called burial).\n\nDearly beloved son, have an especial care that after my decease none of\nthese laws be received in any of your kingdoms; for whilst I breathe, by\nthe grace and assistance of God, I shall give good order.  Seeing,\ntherefore, you have totally referred unto my discretion the disposure of\nyou in marriage, I am fully of an opinion that I shall provide sufficiently\nwell for you in that point.  Make ready and prepare yourself for Panurge's\nvoyage.  Take along with you Epistemon, Friar John, and such others as you\nwill choose.  Do with my treasures what unto yourself shall seem most\nexpedient.  None of your actions, I promise you, can in any manner of way\ndisplease me.  Take out of my arsenal Thalasse whatsoever equipage,\nfurniture, or provision you please, together with such pilots, mariners,\nand truchmen as you have a mind to, and with the first fair and favourable\nwind set sail and make out to sea in the name of God our Saviour.  In the\nmeanwhile, during your absence, I shall not be neglective of providing a\nwife for you, nor of those preparations which are requisite to be made for\nthe more sumptuous solemnizing of your nuptials with a most splendid feast,\nif ever there was any in the world, since the days of Ahasuerus.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.XLIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel did put himself in a readiness to go to sea; and of the herb\nnamed Pantagruelion.\n\nWithin very few days after that Pantagruel had taken his leave of the good\nGargantua, who devoutly prayed for his son's happy voyage, he arrived at\nthe seaport, near to Sammalo, accompanied with Panurge, Epistemon, Friar\nJohn of the Funnels, Abbot of Theleme, and others of the royal house,\nespecially with Xenomanes the great traveller and thwarter of dangerous\nways, who was come at the bidding and appointment of Panurge, of whose\ncastlewick of Salmigondin he did hold some petty inheritance by the tenure\nof a mesne fee.  Pantagruel, being come thither, prepared and made ready\nfor launching a fleet of ships, to the number of those which Ajax of\nSalamine had of old equipped in convoy of the Grecian soldiery against the\nTrojan state.  He likewise picked out for his use so many mariners, pilots,\nsailors, interpreters, artificers, officers, and soldiers, as he thought\nfitting, and therewithal made provision of so much victuals of all sorts,\nartillery, munition of divers kinds, clothes, moneys, and other such\nluggage, stuff, baggage, chaffer, and furniture, as he deemed needful for\ncarrying on the design of a so tedious, long, and perilous voyage.  Amongst\nother things, it was observed how he caused some of his vessels to be\nfraught and loaded with a great quantity of an herb of his called\nPantagruelion, not only of the green and raw sort of it, but of the\nconfected also, and of that which was notably well befitted for present use\nafter the fashion of conserves.  The herb Pantagruelion hath a little root\nsomewhat hard and rough, roundish, terminating in an obtuse and very blunt\npoint, and having some of its veins, strings, or filaments coloured with\nsome spots of white, never fixeth itself into the ground above the\nprofoundness almost of a cubit, or foot and a half.  From the root thereof\nproceedeth the only stalk, orbicular, cane-like, green without, whitish\nwithin, and hollow like the stem of smyrnium, olus atrum, beans, and\ngentian, full of long threads, straight, easy to be broken, jagged,\nsnipped, nicked, and notched a little after the manner of pillars and\ncolumns, slightly furrowed, chamfered, guttered, and channelled, and full\nof fibres, or hairs like strings, in which consisteth the chief value and\ndignity of the herb, especially in that part thereof which is termed mesa,\nas he would say the mean, and in that other, which hath got the\ndenomination of milasea.  Its height is commonly of five or six foot.  Yet\nsometimes it is of such a tall growth as doth surpass the length of a\nlance, but that is only when it meeteth with a sweet, easy, warm, wet, and\nwell-soaked soil--as is the ground of the territory of Olone, and that of\nRasea, near to Preneste in Sabinia--and that it want not for rain enough\nabout the season of the fishers' holidays and the estival solstice.  There\nare many trees whose height is by it very far exceeded, and you might call\nit dendromalache by the authority of Theophrastus.  The plant every year\nperisheth,--the tree neither in the trunk, root, bark, or boughs being\ndurable.\n\nFrom the stalk of this Pantagruelian plant there issue forth several large\nand great branches, whose leaves have thrice as much length as breadth,\nalways green, roughish, and rugged like the orcanet, or Spanish bugloss,\nhardish, slit round about like unto a sickle, or as the saxifragum, betony,\nand finally ending as it were in the points of a Macedonian spear, or of\nsuch a lancet as surgeons commonly make use of in their phlebotomizing\ntiltings.  The figure and shape of the leaves thereof is not much different\nfrom that of those of the ash-tree, or of agrimony; the herb itself being\nso like the Eupatorian plant that many skilful herbalists have called it\nthe Domestic Eupator, and the Eupator the Wild Pantagruelion.  These leaves\nare in equal and parallel distances spread around the stalk by the number\nin every rank either of five or seven, nature having so highly favoured and\ncherished this plant that she hath richly adorned it with these two odd,\ndivine, and mysterious numbers.  The smell thereof is somewhat strong, and\nnot very pleasing to nice, tender, and delicate noses.  The seed enclosed\ntherein mounteth up to the very top of its stalk, and a little above it.\n\nThis is a numerous herb; for there is no less abundance of it than of any\nother whatsoever.  Some of these plants are spherical, some rhomboid, and\nsome of an oblong shape, and all of those either black, bright-coloured, or\ntawny, rude to the touch, and mantled with a quickly-blasted-away coat, yet\nsuch a one as is of a delicious taste and savour to all shrill and\nsweetly-singing birds, such as linnets, goldfinches, larks, canary birds,\nyellow-hammers, and others of that airy chirping choir; but it would quite\nextinguish the natural heat and procreative virtue of the semence of any\nman who would eat much and often of it.  And although that of old amongst\nthe Greeks there was certain kinds of fritters and pancakes, buns and\ntarts, made thereof, which commonly for a liquorish daintiness were\npresented on the table after supper to delight the palate and make the wine\nrelish the better; yet is it of a difficult concoction, and offensive to\nthe stomach.  For it engendereth bad and unwholesome blood, and with its\nexorbitant heat woundeth them with grievous, hurtful, smart, and noisome\nvapours.  And, as in divers plants and trees there are two sexes, male and\nfemale, which is perceptible in laurels, palms, cypresses, oaks, holms, the\ndaffodil, mandrake, fern, the agaric, mushroom, birthwort, turpentine,\npennyroyal, peony, rose of the mount, and many other such like, even so in\nthis herb there is a male which beareth no flower at all, yet it is very\ncopious of and abundant in seed.  There is likewise in it a female, which\nhath great store and plenty of whitish flowers, serviceable to little or no\npurpose, nor doth it carry in it seed of any worth at all, at least\ncomparable to that of the male.  It hath also a larger leaf, and much\nsofter than that of the male, nor doth it altogether grow to so great a\nheight.  This Pantagruelion is to be sown at the first coming of the\nswallows, and is to be plucked out of the ground when the grasshoppers\nbegin to be a little hoarse.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.L.\n\nHow the famous Pantagruelion ought to be prepared and wrought.\n\nThe herb Pantagruelion, in September, under the autumnal equinox, is\ndressed and prepared several ways, according to the various fancies of the\npeople and diversity of the climates wherein it groweth.  The first\ninstruction which Pantagruel gave concerning it was to divest and despoil\nthe stalk and stem thereof of all its flowers and seeds, to macerate and\nmortify it in pond, pool, or lake water, which is to be made run a little\nfor five days together (Properly--'lake water, which is to be made\nstagnant, not current, for five days together.'--M.) if the season be dry\nand the water hot, or for full nine or twelve days if the weather be\ncloudish and the water cold.  Then must it be parched before the sun till\nit be drained of its moisture.  After this it is in the shadow, where the\nsun shines not, to be peeled and its rind pulled off.  Then are the fibres\nand strings thereof to be parted, wherein, as we have already said,\nconsisteth its prime virtue, price, and efficacy, and severed from the\nwoody part thereof, which is unprofitable, and serveth hardly to any other\nuse than to make a clear and glistering blaze, to kindle the fire, and for\nthe play, pastime, and disport of little children, to blow up hogs'\nbladders and make them rattle.  Many times some use is made thereof by\ntippling sweet-lipped bibbers, who out of it frame quills and pipes,\nthrough which they with their liquor-attractive breath suck up the new\ndainty wine from the bung of the barrel.  Some modern Pantagruelists, to\nshun and avoid that manual labour which such a separating and partitional\nwork would of necessity require, employ certain cataractic instruments,\ncomposed and formed after the same manner that the froward, pettish, and\nangry Juno did hold the fingers of both her hands interwovenly clenched\ntogether when she would have hindered the childbirth delivery of Alcmena at\nthe nativity of Hercules; and athwart those cataracts they break and bruise\nto very trash the woody parcels, thereby to preserve the better the fibres,\nwhich are the precious and excellent parts.  In and with this sole\noperation do these acquiesce and are contented, who, contrary to the\nreceived opinion of the whole earth, and in a manner paradoxical to all\nphilosophers, gain their livelihoods backwards, and by recoiling.  But\nthose that love to hold it at a higher rate, and prize it according to its\nvalue, for their own greater profit do the very same which is told us of\nthe recreation of the three fatal sister Parcae, or of the nocturnal\nexercise of the noble Circe, or yet of the excuse which Penelope made to\nher fond wooing youngsters and effeminate courtiers during the long absence\nof her husband Ulysses.\n\nBy these means is this herb put into a way to display its inestimable\nvirtues, whereof I will discover a part; for to relate all is a thing\nimpossible to do.  I have already interpreted and exposed before you the\ndenomination thereof.  I find that plants have their names given and\nbestowed upon them after several ways.  Some got the name of him who first\nfound them out, knew them, sowed them, improved them by culture, qualified\nthem to tractability, and appropriated them to the uses and subserviences\nthey were fit for, as the Mercuriale from Mercury; Panacea from Panace, the\ndaughter of Aesculapius; Armois from Artemis, who is Diana; Eupatoria from\nthe king Eupator; Telephion from Telephus; Euphorbium from Euphorbus, King\nJuba's physician; Clymenos from Clymenus; Alcibiadium from Alcibiades;\nGentiane from Gentius, King of Sclavonia, and so forth, through a great\nmany other herbs or plants.  Truly, in ancient times this prerogative of\nimposing the inventor's name upon an herb found out by him was held in a so\ngreat account and estimation, that, as a controversy arose betwixt Neptune\nand Pallas from which of them two that land should receive its denomination\nwhich had been equally found out by them both together--though thereafter\nit was called and had the appellation of Athens, from Athene, which is\nMinerva--just so would Lynceus, King of Scythia, have treacherously slain\nthe young Triptolemus, whom Ceres had sent to show unto mankind the\ninvention of corn, which until then had been utterly unknown, to the end\nthat, after the murder of the messenger, whose death he made account to\nhave kept secret, he might, by imposing, with the less suspicion of false\ndealing, his own name upon the said found out seed, acquire unto himself an\nimmortal honour and glory for having been the inventor of a grain so\nprofitable and necessary to and for the use of human life.  For the\nwickedness of which treasonable attempt he was by Ceres transformed into\nthat wild beast which by some is called a lynx and by others an ounce.\nSuch also was the ambition of others upon the like occasion, as appeareth\nby that very sharp wars and of a long continuance have been made of old\nbetwixt some residentiary kings in Cappadocia upon this only debate, of\nwhose name a certain herb should have the appellation; by reason of which\ndifference, so troublesome and expensive to them all, it was by them called\nPolemonion, and by us for the same cause termed Make-bate.\n\nOther herbs and plants there are which retain the names of the countries\nfrom whence they were transported, as the Median apples from Media, where\nthey first grew; Punic apples from Punicia, that is to say, Carthage;\nLigusticum, which we call lovage, from Liguria, the coast of Genoa; Rhubarb\nfrom a flood in Barbary, as Ammianus attesteth, called Ru; Santonica from a\nregion of that name; Fenugreek from Greece; Gastanes from a country so\ncalled; Persicaria from Persia; Sabine from a territory of that\nappellation; Staechas from the Staechad Islands; Spica Celtica from the\nland of the Celtic Gauls, and so throughout a great many other, which were\ntedious to enumerate.  Some others, again, have obtained their\ndenominations by way of antiphrasis, or contrariety; as Absinth, because it\nis contrary to Psinthos, for it is bitter to the taste in drinking;\nHolosteon, as if it were all bones, whilst, on the contrary, there is no\nfrailer, tenderer, nor brittler herb in the whole production of nature than\nit.\n\nThere are some other sorts of herbs which have got their names from their\nvirtues and operations, as Aristolochia, because it helpeth women in\nchildbirth; Lichen, for that it cureth the disease of that name; Mallow,\nbecause it mollifieth; Callithricum, because it maketh the hair of a bright\ncolour; Alyssum, Ephemerum, Bechium, Nasturtium, Aneban (Henbane), and so\nforth through many more.\n\nOther some there are which have obtained their names from the admirable\nqualities that are found to be in them, as Heliotropium, which is the\nmarigold, because it followeth the sun, so that at the sun rising it\ndisplayeth and spreads itself out, at his ascending it mounteth, at his\ndeclining it waneth, and when he is set it is close shut; Adianton,\nbecause, although it grow near unto watery places, and albeit you should\nlet it lie in water a long time, it will nevertheless retain no moisture\nnor humidity; Hierachia, Eringium, and so throughout a great many more.\nThere are also a great many herbs and plants which have retained the very\nsame names of the men and women who have been metamorphosed and transformed\nin them, as from Daphne the laurel is called also Daphne; Myrrh from\nMyrrha, the daughter of Cinarus; Pythis from Pythis; Cinara, which is the\nartichoke, from one of that name; Narcissus, with Saffron, Smilax, and\ndivers others.\n\nMany herbs likewise have got their names of those things which they seem to\nhave some resemblance to; as Hippuris, because it hath the likeness of a\nhorse's tail; Alopecuris, because it representeth in similitude the tail of\na fox; Psyllion, from a flea which it resembleth; Delphinium, for that it\nis like a dolphin fish; Bugloss is so called because it is an herb like an\nox's tongue; Iris, so called because in its flowers it hath some\nresemblance of the rainbow; Myosota, because it is like the ear of a mouse;\nCoronopus, for that it is of the likeness of a crow's foot.  A great many\nother such there are, which here to recite were needless.  Furthermore, as\nthere are herbs and plants which have had their names from those of men, so\nby a reciprocal denomination have the surnames of many families taken their\norigin from them, as the Fabii, a fabis, beans; the Pisons, a pisis, peas;\nthe Lentuli from lentils; the Cicerons; a ciceribus, vel ciceris, a sort of\npulse called chickpease, and so forth.  In some plants and herbs the\nresemblance or likeness hath been taken from a higher mark or object, as\nwhen we say Venus' navel, Venus' hair, Venus' tub, Jupiter's beard,\nJupiter's eye, Mars' blood, the Hermodactyl or Mercury's fingers, which are\nall of them names of herbs, as there are a great many more of the like\nappellation.  Others, again, have received their denomination from their\nforms, such as the Trefoil, because it is three-leaved; Pentaphylon, for\nhaving five leaves; Serpolet, because it creepeth along the ground;\nHelxine, Petast, Myrobalon, which the Arabians called Been, as if you would\nsay an acorn, for it hath a kind of resemblance thereto, and withal is very\noily.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.LI.\n\nWhy it is called Pantagruelion, and of the admirable virtues thereof.\n\nBy such-like means of attaining to a denomination--the fabulous ways being\nonly from thence excepted, for the Lord forbid that we should make use of\nany fables in this a so veritable history--is this herb called\nPantagruelion, for Pantagruel was the inventor thereof.  I do not say of\nthe plant itself, but of a certain use which it serves for, exceeding\nodious and hateful to thieves and robbers, unto whom it is more contrarious\nand hurtful than the strangle-weed and chokefitch is to the flax, the\ncats-tail to the brakes, the sheave-grass to the mowers of hay, the fitches\nto the chickney-pease, the darnel to barley, the hatchet-fitch to the lentil\npulse, the antramium to the beans, tares to wheat, ivy to walls, the\nwater-lily to lecherous monks, the birchen rod to the scholars of the\ncollege of Navarre in Paris, colewort to the vine-tree, garlic to the\nloadstone, onions to the sight, fern-seed to women with child, willow-grain\nto vicious nuns, the yew-tree shade to those that sleep under it, wolfsbane\nto wolves and libbards, the smell of fig-tree to mad bulls, hemlock to\ngoslings, purslane to the teeth, or oil to trees.  For we have seen many of\nthose rogues, by virtue and right application of this herb, finish their\nlives short and long, after the manner of Phyllis, Queen of Thracia, of\nBonosus, Emperor of Rome, of Amata, King Latinus's wife, of Iphis,\nAutolycus, Lycambe, Arachne, Phaedra, Leda, Achius, King of Lydia, and many\nthousands more, who were chiefly angry and vexed at this disaster therein,\nthat, without being otherwise sick or evil-disposed in their bodies, by a\ntouch only of the Pantagruelion they came on a sudden to have the passage\nobstructed, and their pipes, through which were wont to bolt so many jolly\nsayings and to enter so many luscious morsels, stopped, more cleverly than\never could have done the squinancy.\n\nOthers have been heard most woefully to lament, at the very instant when\nAtropos was about to cut the thread of their life, that Pantagruel held\nthem by the gorge.  But, well-a-day, it was not Pantagruel; he never was an\nexecutioner.  It was the Pantagruelion, manufactured and fashioned into an\nhalter; and serving in the place and office of a cravat.  In that, verily,\nthey solecized and spoke improperly, unless you would excuse them by a\ntrope, which alloweth us to posit the inventor in the place of the thing\ninvented, as when Ceres is taken for bread, and Bacchus put instead of\nwine.  I swear to you here, by the good and frolic words which are to issue\nout of that wine-bottle which is a-cooling below in the copper vessel full\nof fountain water, that the noble Pantagruel never snatched any man by the\nthroat, unless it was such a one as was altogether careless and neglective\nof those obviating remedies which were preventive of the thirst to come.\n\nIt is also termed Pantagruelion by a similitude.  For Pantagruel, at the\nvery first minute of his birth, was no less tall than this herb is long\nwhereof I speak unto you, his measure having been then taken the more easy\nthat he was born in the season of the great drought, when they were busiest\nin the gathering of the said herb, to wit, at that time when Icarus's dog,\nwith his fiery bawling and barking at the sun, maketh the whole world\nTroglodytic, and enforceth people everywhere to hide themselves in dens and\nsubterranean caves.  It is likewise called Pantagruelion because of the\nnotable and singular qualities, virtues, and properties thereof.  For as\nPantagruel hath been the idea, pattern, prototype, and exemplary of all\njovial perfection and accomplishment--in the truth whereof I believe there\nis none of you gentlemen drinkers that putteth any question--so in this\nPantagruelion have I found so much efficacy and energy, so much\ncompleteness and excellency, so much exquisiteness and rarity, and so many\nadmirable effects and operations of a transcendent nature, that if the\nworth and virtue thereof had been known when those trees, by the relation\nof the prophet, made election of a wooden king to rule and govern over\nthem, it without all doubt would have carried away from all the rest the\nplurality of votes and suffrages.\n\nShall I yet say more?  If Oxylus, the son of Orius, had begotten this plant\nupon his sister Hamadryas, he had taken more delight in the value and\nperfection of it alone than in all his eight children, so highly renowned\nby our ablest mythologians that they have sedulously recommended their\nnames to the never-failing tuition of an eternal remembrance.  The eldest\nchild was a daughter, whose name was Vine; the next born was a boy, and his\nname was Fig-tree; the third was called Walnut-tree; the fourth Oak; the\nfifth Sorbapple-tree; the sixth Ash; the seventh Poplar, and the last had\nthe name of Elm, who was the greatest surgeon in his time.  I shall forbear\nto tell you how the juice or sap thereof, being poured and distilled within\nthe ears, killeth every kind of vermin that by any manner of putrefaction\ncometh to be bred and engendered there, and destroyeth also any whatsoever\nother animal that shall have entered in thereat.  If, likewise, you put a\nlittle of the said juice within a pail or bucket full of water, you shall\nsee the water instantly turn and grow thick therewith as if it were\nmilk-curds, whereof the virtue is so great that the water thus curded is a\npresent remedy for horses subject to the colic, and such as strike at their\nown flanks.  The root thereof well boiled mollifieth the joints, softeneth\nthe hardness of shrunk-in sinews, is every way comfortable to the nerves,\nand good against all cramps and convulsions, as likewise all cold and\nknotty gouts.  If you would speedily heal a burning, whether occasioned by\nwater or fire, apply thereto a little raw Pantagruelion, that is to say,\ntake it so as it cometh out of the ground, without bestowing any other\npreparation or composition upon it; but have a special care to change it\nfor some fresher in lieu thereof as soon as you shall find it waxing dry\nupon the sore.\n\nWithout this herb kitchens would be detested, the tables of dining-rooms\nabhorred, although there were great plenty and variety of most dainty and\nsumptuous dishes of meat set down upon them, and the choicest beds also,\nhow richly soever adorned with gold, silver, amber, ivory, porphyry, and\nthe mixture of most precious metals, would without it yield no delight or\npleasure to the reposers in them.  Without it millers could neither carry\nwheat, nor any other kind of corn to the mill, nor would they be able to\nbring back from thence flour, or any other sort of meal whatsoever.\nWithout it, how could the papers and writs of lawyers' clients be brought\nto the bar?  Seldom is the mortar, lime, or plaster brought to the\nworkhouse without it.  Without it, how should the water be got out of a\ndraw-well?  In what case would tabellions, notaries, copists, makers of\ncounterpanes, writers, clerks, secretaries, scriveners, and such-like\npersons be without it?  Were it not for it, what would become of the\ntoll-rates and rent-rolls?  Would not the noble art of printing perish\nwithout it?  Whereof could the chassis or paper-windows be made?  How should\nthe bells be rung?  The altars of Isis are adorned therewith, the\nPastophorian priests are therewith clad and accoutred, and whole human\nnature covered and wrapped therein at its first position and production in\nand into this world.  All the lanific trees of Seres, the bumbast and cotton\nbushes in the territories near the Persian Sea and Gulf of Bengala, the\nArabian swans, together with the plants of Malta, do not all the them\nclothe, attire, and apparel so many persons as this one herb alone.\nSoldiers are nowadays much better sheltered under it than they were in\nformer times, when they lay in tents covered with skins.  It overshadows the\ntheatres and amphitheatres from the heat of a scorching sun.  It begirdeth\nand encompasseth forests, chases, parks, copses, and groves, for the\npleasure of hunters.  It descendeth into the salt and fresh of both sea and\nriver-waters for the profit of fishers.  By it are boots of all sizes,\nbuskins, gamashes, brodkins, gambadoes, shoes, pumps, slippers, and every\ncobbled ware wrought and made steadable for the use of man.  By it the butt\nand rover-bows are strung, the crossbows bended, and the slings made fixed.\nAnd, as if it were an herb every whit as holy as the vervain, and reverenced\nby ghosts, spirits, hobgoblins, fiends, and phantoms, the bodies of deceased\nmen are never buried without it.\n\nI will proceed yet further.  By the means of this fine herb the invisible\nsubstances are visibly stopped, arrested, taken, detained, and\nprisoner-like committed to their receptive gaols.  Heavy and ponderous\nweights are by it heaved, lifted up, turned, veered, drawn, carried, and\nevery way moved quickly, nimbly, and easily, to the great profit and\nemolument of humankind.  When I perpend with myself these and such-like\nmarvellous effects of this wonderful herb, it seemeth strange unto me how\nthe invention of so useful a practice did escape through so many by-past\nages the knowledge of the ancient philosophers, considering the inestimable\nutility which from thence proceeded, and the immense labour which without it\nthey did undergo in their pristine elucubrations.  By virtue thereof,\nthrough the retention of some aerial gusts, are the huge rambarges, mighty\ngalleons, the large floats, the Chiliander, the Myriander ships launched\nfrom their stations and set a-going at the pleasure and arbitrament of their\nrulers, conders, and steersmen.  By the help thereof those remote nations\nwhom nature seemed so unwilling to have discovered to us, and so desirous to\nhave kept them still in abscondito and hidden from us, that the ways through\nwhich their countries were to be reached unto were not only totally unknown,\nbut judged also to be altogether impermeable and inaccessible, are now\narrived to us, and we to them.\n\nThose voyages outreached flights of birds and far surpassed the scope of\nfeathered fowls, how swift soever they had been on the wing, and\nnotwithstanding that advantage which they have of us in swimming through\nthe air.  Taproban hath seen the heaths of Lapland, and both the Javas and\nRiphaean mountains; wide distant Phebol shall see Theleme, and the\nIslanders drink of the flood Euphrates.  By it the chill-mouthed Boreas\nhath surveyed the parched mansions of the torrid Auster, and Eurus visited\nthe regions which Zephyrus hath under his command; yea, in such sort have\ninterviews been made by the assistance of this sacred herb, that, maugre\nlongitudes and latitudes, and all the variations of the zones, the\nPeriaecian people, and Antoecian, Amphiscian, Heteroscian, and Periscian\nhad oft rendered and received mutual visits to and from other, upon all the\nclimates.  These strange exploits bred such astonishment to the celestial\nintelligences, to all the marine and terrestrial gods, that they were on a\nsudden all afraid.  From which amazement, when they saw how, by means of\nthis blest Pantagruelion, the Arctic people looked upon the Antarctic,\nscoured the Atlantic Ocean, passed the tropics, pushed through the torrid\nzone, measured all the zodiac, sported under the equinoctial, having both\npoles level with their horizon, they judged it high time to call a council\nfor their own safety and preservation.\n\nThe Olympic gods, being all and each of them affrighted at the sight of\nsuch achievements, said:  Pantagruel hath shapen work enough for us, and\nput us more to a plunge and nearer our wits' end by this sole herb of his\nthan did of old the Aloidae by overturning mountains.  He very speedily is\nto be married, and shall have many children by his wife.  It lies not in\nour power to oppose this destiny; for it hath passed through the hands and\nspindles of the Fatal Sisters, necessity's inexorable daughters.  Who knows\nbut by his sons may be found out an herb of such another virtue and\nprodigious energy, as that by the aid thereof, in using it aright according\nto their father's skill, they may contrive a way for humankind to pierce\ninto the high aerian clouds, get up unto the springhead of the hail, take\nan inspection of the snowy sources, and shut and open as they please the\nsluices from whence proceed the floodgates of the rain; then, prosecuting\ntheir aethereal voyage, they may step in unto the lightning workhouse and\nshop, where all the thunderbolts are forged, where, seizing on the magazine\nof heaven and storehouse of our warlike fire-munition, they may discharge a\nbouncing peal or two of thundering ordnance for joy of their arrival to\nthese new supernal places, and, charging those tonitrual guns afresh, turn\nthe whole force of that artillery against ourselves wherein we most\nconfided.  Then is it like they will set forward to invade the territories\nof the Moon, whence, passing through both Mercury and Venus, the Sun will\nserve them for a torch, to show the way from Mars to Jupiter and Saturn.\nWe shall not then be able to resist the impetuosity of their intrusion, nor\nput a stoppage to their entering in at all, whatever regions, domiciles, or\nmansions of the spangled firmament they shall have any mind to see, to stay\nin, to travel through for their recreation.  All the celestial signs\ntogether, with the constellations of the fixed stars, will jointly be at\ntheir devotion then.  Some will take up their lodging at the Ram, some at\nthe Bull, and others at the Twins; some at the Crab, some at the Lion Inn,\nand others at the sign of the Virgin; some at the Balance, others at the\nScorpion, and others will be quartered at the Archer; some will be\nharboured at the Goat, some at the Water-pourer's sign, some at the Fishes;\nsome will lie at the Crown, some at the Harp, some at the Golden Eagle and\nthe Dolphin; some at the Flying Horse, some at the Ship, some at the great,\nsome at the little Bear; and so throughout the glistening hostelries of the\nwhole twinkling asteristic welkin.  There will be sojourners come from the\nearth, who, longing after the taste of the sweet cream, of their own\nskimming off, from the best milk of all the dairy of the Galaxy, will set\nthemselves at table down with us, drink of our nectar and ambrosia, and\ntake to their own beds at night for wives and concubines our fairest\ngoddesses, the only means whereby they can be deified.  A junto hereupon\nbeing convocated, the better to consult upon the manner of obviating a so\ndreadful danger, Jove, sitting in his presidential throne, asked the votes\nof all the other gods, which, after a profound deliberation amongst\nthemselves on all contingencies, they freely gave at last, and then\nresolved unanimously to withstand the shocks of all whatsoever sublunary\nassaults.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.LII.\n\nHow a certain kind of Pantagruelion is of that nature that the fire is not\nable to consume it.\n\nI have already related to you great and admirable things; but, if you might\nbe induced to adventure upon the hazard of believing some other divinity of\nthis sacred Pantagruelion, I very willingly would tell it you.  Believe it,\nif you will, or otherwise, believe it not, I care not which of them you do,\nthey are both alike to me.  It shall be sufficient for my purpose to have\ntold you the truth, and the truth I will tell you.  But to enter in\nthereat, because it is of a knaggy, difficult, and rugged access, this is\nthe question which I ask of you.  If I had put within this bottle two\npints, the one of wine and the other of water, thoroughly and exactly\nmingled together, how would you unmix them?  After what manner would you go\nabout to sever them, and separate the one liquor from the other, in such\nsort that you render me the water apart, free from the wine, and the wine\nalso pure, without the intermixture of one drop of water, and both of them\nin the same measure, quantity, and taste that I had embottled them?  Or, to\nstate the question otherwise.  If your carmen and mariners, entrusted for\nthe provision of your houses with the bringing of a certain considerable\nnumber of tuns, puncheons, pipes, barrels, and hogsheads of Graves wine, or\nof the wine of Orleans, Beaune, and Mireveaux, should drink out the half,\nand afterwards with water fill up the other empty halves of the vessels as\nfull as before, as the Limosins use to do in their carriages by wains and\ncarts of the wines of Argenton and Sangaultier; after that, how would you\npart the water from the wine, and purify them both in such a case?  I\nunderstand you well enough.  Your meaning is, that I must do it with an ivy\nfunnel.  That is written, it is true, and the verity thereof explored by a\nthousand experiments; you have learned to do this feat before, I see it.\nBut those that have never known it, nor at any time have seen the like,\nwould hardly believe that it were possible.  Let us nevertheless proceed.\n\nBut put the case, we were now living in the age of Sylla, Marius, Caesar,\nand other such Roman emperors, or that we were in the time of our ancient\nDruids, whose custom was to burn and calcine the dead bodies of their\nparents and lords, and that you had a mind to drink the ashes or cinders of\nyour wives or fathers in the infused liquor of some good white-wine, as\nArtemisia drunk the dust and ashes of her husband Mausolus; or otherwise,\nthat you did determine to have them reserved in some fine urn or reliquary\npot; how would you save the ashes apart, and separate them from those other\ncinders and ashes into which the fuel of the funeral and bustuary fire hath\nbeen converted?  Answer, if you can.  By my figgins, I believe it will\ntrouble you so to do.\n\nWell, I will despatch, and tell you that, if you take of this celestial\nPantagruelion so much as is needful to cover the body of the defunct, and\nafter that you shall have enwrapped and bound therein as hard and closely\nas you can the corpse of the said deceased persons, and sewed up the\nfolding-sheet with thread of the same stuff, throw it into the fire, how\ngreat or ardent soever it be it matters not a straw, the fire through this\nPantagruelion will burn the body and reduce to ashes the bones thereof, and\nthe Pantagruelion shall be not only not consumed nor burnt, but also shall\nneither lose one atom of the ashes enclosed within it, nor receive one atom\nof the huge bustuary heap of ashes resulting from the blazing conflagration\nof things combustible laid round about it, but shall at last, when taken\nout of the fire, be fairer, whiter, and much cleaner than when you did put\nit in at first.  Therefore it is called Asbeston, which is as much to say\nas incombustible.  Great plenty is to be found thereof in Carpasia, as\nlikewise in the climate Dia Sienes, at very easy rates.  O how rare and\nadmirable a thing it is, that the fire which devoureth, consumeth, and\ndestroyeth all such things else, should cleanse, purge, and whiten this\nsole Pantagruelion Carpasian Asbeston!  If you mistrust the verity of this\nrelation, and demand for further confirmation of my assertion a visible\nsign, as the Jews and such incredulous infidels use to do, take a fresh\negg, and orbicularly, or rather ovally, enfold it within this divine\nPantagruelion.  When it is so wrapped up, put it in the hot embers of a\nfire, how great or ardent soever it be, and having left it there as long as\nyou will, you shall at last, at your taking it out of the fire, find the\negg roasted hard, and as it were burnt, without any alteration, change,\nmutation, or so much as a calefaction of the sacred Pantagruelion.  For\nless than a million of pounds sterling, modified, taken down, and\namoderated to the twelfth part of one fourpence halfpenny farthing, you are\nable to put it to a trial and make proof thereof.\n\nDo not think to overmatch me here, by paragoning with it in the way of a\nmore eminent comparison the Salamander.  That is a fib; for, albeit a\nlittle ordinary fire, such as is used in dining-rooms and chambers,\ngladden, cheer up, exhilarate, and quicken it, yet may I warrantably enough\nassure that in the flaming fire of a furnace it will, like any other\nanimated creature, be quickly suffocated, choked, consumed, and destroyed.\nWe have seen the experiment thereof, and Galen many ages ago hath clearly\ndemonstrated and confirmed it, Lib. 3, De temperamentis, and Dioscorides\nmaintaineth the same doctrine, Lib. 2.  Do not here instance in competition\nwith this sacred herb the feather alum or the wooden tower of Pyraeus,\nwhich Lucius Sylla was never able to get burnt; for that Archelaus,\ngovernor of the town for Mithridates, King of Pontus, had plastered it all\nover on the outside with the said alum.  Nor would I have you to compare\ntherewith the herb which Alexander Cornelius called Eonem, and said that it\nhad some resemblance with that oak which bears the mistletoe, and that it\ncould neither be consumed nor receive any manner of prejudice by fire nor\nby water, no more than the mistletoe, of which was built, said he, the so\nrenowned ship Argos.  Search where you please for those that will believe\nit.  I in that point desire to be excused.  Neither would I wish you to\nparallel therewith--although I cannot deny but that it is of a very\nmarvellous nature--that sort of tree which groweth alongst the mountains of\nBrianson and Ambrun, which produceth out of his root the good agaric.  From\nits body it yieldeth unto us a so excellent rosin, that Galen hath been\nbold to equal it to the turpentine.  Upon the delicate leaves thereof it\nretaineth for our use that sweet heavenly honey which is called the manna,\nand, although it be of a gummy, oily, fat, and greasy substance, it is,\nnotwithstanding, unconsumable by any fire.  It is in Greek and Latin called\nLarix.  The Alpinese name is Melze.  The Antenorides and Venetians term it\nLarege; which gave occasion to that castle in Piedmont to receive the\ndenomination of Larignum, by putting Julius Caesar to a stand at his return\nfrom amongst the Gauls.\n\nJulius Caesar commanded all the yeomen, boors, hinds, and other inhabitants\nin, near unto, and about the Alps and Piedmont, to bring all manner of\nvictuals and provision for an army to those places which on the military\nroad he had appointed to receive them for the use of his marching soldiery.\nTo which ordinance all of them were obedient, save only those as were\nwithin the garrison of Larignum, who, trusting in the natural strength of\nthe place, would not pay their contribution.  The emperor, purposing to\nchastise them for their refusal, caused his whole army to march straight\ntowards that castle, before the gate whereof was erected a tower built of\nhuge big spars and rafters of the larch-tree, fast bound together with pins\nand pegs of the same wood, and interchangeably laid on one another, after\nthe fashion of a pile or stack of timber, set up in the fabric thereof to\nsuch an apt and convenient height that from the parapet above the\nportcullis they thought with stones and levers to beat off and drive away\nsuch as should approach thereto.\n\nWhen Caesar had understood that the chief defence of those within the\ncastle did consist in stones and clubs, and that it was not an easy matter\nto sling, hurl, dart, throw, or cast them so far as to hinder the\napproaches, he forthwith commanded his men to throw great store of bavins,\nfaggots, and fascines round about the castle, and when they had made the\nheap of a competent height, to put them all in a fair fire; which was\nthereupon incontinently done.  The fire put amidst the faggots was so great\nand so high that it covered the whole castle, that they might well imagine\nthe tower would thereby be altogether burnt to dust, and demolished.\nNevertheless, contrary to all their hopes and expectations, when the flame\nceased, and that the faggots were quite burnt and consumed, the tower\nappeared as whole, sound, and entire as ever.  Caesar, after a serious\nconsideration had thereof, commanded a compass to be taken without the\ndistance of a stone cast from the castle round about it there, with ditches\nand entrenchments to form a blockade; which when the Larignans understood,\nthey rendered themselves upon terms.  And then by a relation from them it\nwas that Caesar learned the admirable nature and virtue of this wood, which\nof itself produceth neither fire, flame, nor coal, and would, therefore, in\nregard of that rare quality of incombustibility, have been admitted into\nthis rank and degree of a true Pantagruelional plant; and that so much the\nrather, for that Pantagruel directed that all the gates, doors, angiports,\nwindows, gutters, fretticed and embowed ceilings, cans, (cants?) and other\nwhatsoever wooden furniture in the abbey of Theleme, should be all\nmateriated of this kind of timber.  He likewise caused to cover therewith\nthe sterns, stems, cook-rooms or laps, hatches, decks, courses, bends, and\nwalls of his carricks, ships, galleons, galleys, brigantines, foists,\nfrigates, crears, barques, floats, pinks, pinnaces, hoys, ketches, capers,\nand other vessels of his Thalassian arsenal; were it not that the wood or\ntimber of the larch-tree, being put within a large and ample furnace full\nof huge vehemently flaming fire proceeding from the fuel of other sorts and\nkinds of wood, cometh at last to be corrupted, consumed, dissipated, and\ndestroyed, as are stones in a lime-kiln.  But this Pantagruelion Asbeston\nis rather by the fire renewed and cleansed than by the flames thereof\nconsumed or changed.  Therefore,\n\n  Arabians, Indians, Sabaeans,\n  Sing not, in hymns and Io Paeans,\n  Your incense, myrrh, or ebony.\n  Come here, a nobler plant to see,\n  And carry home, at any rate,\n  Some seed, that you may propagate.\n  If in your soil it takes, to heaven\n  A thousand thousand thanks be given;\n  And say with France, it goodly goes,\n  Where the Pantagruelion grows.\n\nEND OF BOOK III\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\n\nTHE FOURTH BOOK\n\n\nThe Translator's Preface.\n\nReader,--I don't know what kind of a preface I must write to find thee\ncourteous, an epithet too often bestowed without a cause.  The author of\nthis work has been as sparing of what we call good nature, as most readers\nare nowadays.  So I am afraid his translator and commentator is not to\nexpect much more than has been showed them.  What's worse, there are but\ntwo sorts of taking prefaces, as there are but two kinds of prologues to\nplays; for Mr. Bays was doubtless in the right when he said that if thunder\nand lightning could not fright an audience into complaisance, the sight of\nthe poet with a rope about his neck might work them into pity.  Some,\nindeed, have bullied many of you into applause, and railed at your faults\nthat you might think them without any; and others, more safely, have spoken\nkindly of you, that you might think, or at least speak, as favourably of\nthem, and be flattered into patience.  Now, I fancy, there's nothing less\ndifficult to attempt than the first method; for, in this blessed age, 'tis\nas easy to find a bully without courage, as a whore without beauty, or a\nwriter without wit; though those qualifications are so necessary in their\nrespective professions.  The mischief is, that you seldom allow any to rail\nbesides yourselves, and cannot bear a pride which shocks your own.  As for\nwheedling you into a liking of a work, I must confess it seems the safest\nway; but though flattery pleases you well when it is particular, you hate\nit, as little concerning you, when it is general.  Then we knights of the\nquill are a stiff-necked generation, who as seldom care to seem to doubt\nthe worth of our writings, and their being liked, as we love to flatter\nmore than one at a time; and had rather draw our pens, and stand up for the\nbeauty of our works (as some arrant fools use to do for that of their\nmistresses) to the last drop of our ink.  And truly this submission, which\nsometimes wheedles you into pity, as seldom decoys you into love, as the\nawkward cringing of an antiquated fop, as moneyless as he is ugly, affects\nan experienced fair one.  Now we as little value your pity as a lover his\nmistress's, well satisfied that it is only a less uncivil way of dismissing\nus.  But what if neither of these two ways will work upon you, of which\ndoleful truth some of our playwrights stand so many living monuments?  Why,\nthen, truly I think on no other way at present but blending the two into\none; and, from this marriage of huffing and cringing, there will result a\nnew kind of careless medley, which, perhaps, will work upon both sorts of\nreaders, those who are to be hectored, and those whom we must creep to.  At\nleast, it is like to please by its novelty; and it will not be the first\nmonster that has pleased you when regular nature could not do it.\n\nIf uncommon worth, lively wit, and deep learning, wove into wholesome\nsatire, a bold, good, and vast design admirably pursued, truth set out in\nits true light, and a method how to arrive to its oracle, can recommend a\nwork, I am sure this has enough to please any reasonable man.  The three\nbooks published some time since, which are in a manner an entire work, were\nkindly received; yet, in the French, they come far short of these two,\nwhich are also entire pieces; for the satire is all general here, much more\nobvious, and consequently more entertaining.  Even my long explanatory\npreface was not thought improper.  Though I was so far from being allowed\ntime to make it methodical, that at first only a few pages were intended;\nyet as fast as they were printed I wrote on, till it proved at last like\none of those towns built little at first, then enlarged, where you see\npromiscuously an odd variety of all sorts of irregular buildings.  I hope\nthe remarks I give now will not please less; for, as I have translated the\nwork which they explain, I had more time to make them, though as little to\nwrite them.  It would be needless to give here a large account of my\nperformance; for, after all, you readers care no more for this or that\napology, or pretence of Mr. Translator, if the version does not please you,\nthan we do for a blundering cook's excuse after he has spoiled a good dish\nin the dressing.  Nor can the first pretend to much praise, besides that of\ngiving his author's sense in its full extent, and copying his style, if it\nis to be copied; since he has no share in the invention or disposition of\nwhat he translates.  Yet there was no small difficulty in doing Rabelais\njustice in that double respect; the obsolete words and turns of phrase, and\ndark subjects, often as darkly treated, make the sense hard to be\nunderstood even by a Frenchman, and it cannot be easy to give it the free\neasy air of an original; for even what seems most common talk in one\nlanguage, is what is often the most difficult to be made so in another; and\nHorace's thoughts of comedy may be well applied to this:\n\n  Creditur, ex medio quia res arcessit, habere\n  Sudoris minimum; sed habet commoedia tantum\n  Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus.\n\nFar be it from me, for all this, to value myself upon hitting the words of\ncant in which my drolling author is so luxuriant; for though such words\nhave stood me in good stead, I scarce can forbear thinking myself unhappy\nin having insensibly hoarded up so much gibberish and Billingsgate trash in\nmy memory; nor could I forbear asking of myself, as an Italian cardinal\nsaid on another account, D'onde hai tu pigliato tante coglionerie?  Where\nthe devil didst thou rake up all these fripperies?\n\nIt was not less difficult to come up to the author's sublime expressions.\nNor would I have attempted such a task, but that I was ambitious of giving\na view of the most valuable work of the greatest genius of his age, to the\nMecaenas and best genius of this.  For I am not overfond of so ungrateful a\ntask as translating, and would rejoice to see less versions and more\noriginals; so the latter were not as bad as many of the first are, through\nwant of encouragement.  Some indeed have deservedly gained esteem by\ntranslating; yet not many condescend to translate, but such as cannot\ninvent; though to do the first well requires often as much genius as to do\nthe latter.\n\nI wish, reader, thou mayest be as willing to do my author justice, as I\nhave strove to do him right.  Yet, if thou art a brother of the quill, it\nis ten to one thou art too much in love with thy own dear productions to\nadmire those of one of thy trade.  However, I know three or four who have\nnot such a mighty opinion of themselves; but I'll not name them, lest I\nshould be obliged to place myself among them.  If thou art one of those\nwho, though they never write, criticise everyone that does; avaunt!--Thou\nart a professed enemy of mankind and of thyself, who wilt never be pleased\nnor let anybody be so, and knowest no better way to fame than by striving\nto lessen that of others; though wouldst thou write thou mightst be soon\nknown, even by the butterwomen, and fly through the world in bandboxes.  If\nthou art of the dissembling tribe, it is thy office to rail at those books\nwhich thou huggest in a corner.  If thou art one of those eavesdroppers,\nwho would have their moroseness be counted gravity, thou wilt condemn a\nmirth which thou art past relishing; and I know no other way to quit the\nscore than by writing (as like enough I may) something as dull, or duller\nthan thyself, if possible.  If thou art one of those critics in dressing,\nthose extempores of fortune, who, having lost a relation and got an estate,\nin an instant set up for wit and every extravagance, thou'lt either praise\nor discommend this book, according to the dictates of some less foolish\nthan thyself, perhaps of one of those who, being lodged at the sign of the\nbox and dice, will know better things than to recommend to thee a work\nwhich bids thee beware of his tricks.  This book might teach thee to leave\nthy follies; but some will say it does not signify much to some fools\nwhether they are so or not; for when was there a fool that thought himself\none?  If thou art one of those who would put themselves upon us for learned\nmen in Greek and Hebrew, yet are mere blockheads in English, and patch\ntogether old pieces of the ancients to get themselves clothes out of them,\nthou art too severely mauled in this work to like it.  Who then will? some\nwill cry.  Nay, besides these, many societies that make a great figure in\nthe world are reflected on in this book; which caused Rabelais to study to\nbe dark, and even bedaub it with many loose expressions, that he might not\nbe thought to have any other design than to droll; in a manner bewraying\nhis book that his enemies might not bite it.  Truly, though now the riddle\nis expounded, I would advise those who read it not to reflect on the\nauthor, lest he be thought to have been beforehand with them, and they be\nranked among those who have nothing to show for their honesty but their\nmoney, nothing for their religion but their dissembling, or a fat benefice,\nnothing for their wit but their dressing, for their nobility but their\ntitle, for their gentility but their sword, for their courage but their\nhuffing, for their preferment but their assurance, for their learning but\ntheir degrees, or for their gravity but their wrinkles or dulness.  They\nhad better laugh at one another here, as it is the custom of the world.\nLaughing is of all professions; the miser may hoard, the spendthrift\nsquander, the politician plot, the lawyer wrangle, and the gamester cheat;\nstill their main design is to be able to laugh at one another; and here\nthey may do it at a cheap and easy rate.  After all, should this work fail\nto please the greater number of readers, I am sure it cannot miss being\nliked by those who are for witty mirth and a chirping bottle; though not by\nthose solid sots who seem to have drudged all their youth long only that\nthey might enjoy the sweet blessing of getting drunk every night in their\nold age.  But those men of sense and honour who love truth and the good of\nmankind in general above all other things will undoubtedly countenance this\nwork.  I will not gravely insist upon its usefulness, having said enough of\nit in the preface (Motteux' Preface to vol. I of Rabelais, ed. 1694.) to\nthe first part.  I will only add, that as Homer in his Odyssey makes his\nhero wander ten years through most parts of the then known world, so\nRabelais, in a three months' voyage, makes Pantagruel take a view of almost\nall sorts of people and professions; with this difference, however, between\nthe ancient mythologist and the modern, that while the Odyssey has been\ncompared to a setting sun in respect to the Iliads, Rabelais' last work,\nwhich is this Voyage to the Oracle of the Bottle (by which he means truth)\nis justly thought his masterpiece, being wrote with more spirit, salt, and\nflame, than the first part of his works.  At near seventy years of age, his\ngenius, far from being drained, seemed to have acquired fresh vigour and\nnew graces the more it exerted itself; like those rivers which grow more\ndeep, large, majestic, and useful by their course.  Those who accuse the\nFrench of being as sparing of their wit as lavish of their words will find\nan Englishman in our author.  I must confess indeed that my countrymen and\nother southern nations temper the one with the other in a manner as they do\ntheir wine with water, often just dashing the latter with a little of the\nfirst.  Now here men love to drink their wine pure; nay, sometimes it will\nnot satisfy unless in its very quintessence, as in brandies; though an\nexcess of this betrays want of sobriety, as much as an excess of wit\nbetrays a want of judgment.  But I must conclude, lest I be justly taxed\nwith wanting both.  I will only add, that as every language has its\npeculiar graces, seldom or never to be acquired by a foreigner, I cannot\nthink I have given my author those of the English in every place; but as\nnone compelled me to write, I fear to ask a pardon which yet the generous\ntemper of this nation makes me hope to obtain.  Albinus, a Roman, who had\nwritten in Greek, desired in his preface to be forgiven his faults of\nlanguage; but Cato asked him in derision whether any had forced him to\nwrite in a tongue of which he was not an absolute master.  Lucullus wrote a\nhistory in the same tongue, and said he had scattered some false Greek in\nit to let the world know it was the work of a Roman.  I will not say as\nmuch of my writings, in which I study to be as little incorrect as the\nhurry of business and shortness of time will permit; but I may better say,\nas Tully did of the history of his consulship, which he also had written in\nGreek, that what errors may be found in the diction are crept in against my\nintent.  Indeed, Livius Andronicus and Terence, the one a Greek, the other\na Carthaginian, wrote successfully in Latin, and the latter is perhaps the\nmost perfect model of the purity and urbanity of that tongue; but I ought\nnot to hope for the success of those great men.  Yet am I ambitious of\nbeing as subservient to the useful diversion of the ingenious of this\nnation as I can, which I have endeavoured in this work, with hopes to\nattempt some greater tasks if ever I am happy enough to have more leisure.\nIn the meantime it will not displease me, if it is known that this is given\nby one who, though born and educated in France, has the love and veneration\nof a loyal subject for this nation, one who, by a fatality, which with many\nmore made him say,\n\n  Nos patriam fugimus et dulcia linquimus arva,\n\nis obliged to make the language of these happy regions as natural to him as\nhe can, and thankfully say with the rest, under this Protestant government,\n\n  Deus nobis haec otia fecit.\n\n\n\nThe Author's Epistle Dedicatory.\n\nTo the most Illustrious Prince and most Reverend Lord Odet, Cardinal de\nChastillon.\n\nYou know, most illustrious prince, how often I have been, and am daily\npressed and required by great numbers of eminent persons, to proceed in the\nPantagruelian fables; they tell me that many languishing, sick, and\ndisconsolate persons, perusing them, have deceived their grief, passed\ntheir time merrily, and been inspired with new joy and comfort.  I commonly\nanswer that I aimed not at glory and applause when I diverted myself with\nwriting, but only designed to give by my pen, to the absent who labour\nunder affliction, that little help which at all times I willingly strive to\ngive to the present that stand in need of my art and service.  Sometimes I\nat large relate to them how Hippocrates in several places, and particularly\nin lib. 6. Epidem., describing the institution of the physician his\ndisciple, and also Soranus of Ephesus, Oribasius, Galen, Hali Abbas, and\nother authors, have descended to particulars, in the prescription of his\nmotions, deportment, looks, countenance, gracefulness, civility,\ncleanliness of face, clothes, beard, hair, hands, mouth, even his very\nnails; as if he were to play the part of a lover in some comedy, or enter\nthe lists to fight some enemy.  And indeed the practice of physic is\nproperly enough compared by Hippocrates to a fight, and also to a farce\nacted between three persons, the patient, the physician, and the disease.\nWhich passage has sometimes put me in mind of Julia's saying to Augustus\nher father.  One day she came before him in a very gorgeous, loose,\nlascivious dress, which very much displeased him, though he did not much\ndiscover his discontent.  The next day she put on another, and in a modest\ngarb, such as the chaste Roman ladies wore, came into his presence.  The\nkind father could not then forbear expressing the pleasure which he took to\nsee her so much altered, and said to her:  Oh! how much more this garb\nbecomes and is commendable in the daughter of Augustus.  But she, having\nher excuse ready, answered:  This day, sir, I dressed myself to please my\nfather's eye; yesterday, to gratify that of my husband.  Thus disguised in\nlooks and garb, nay even, as formerly was the fashion, with a rich and\npleasant gown with four sleeves, which was called philonium according to\nPetrus Alexandrinus in 6. Epidem., a physician might answer to such as\nmight find the metamorphosis indecent:  Thus have I accoutred myself, not\nthat I am proud of appearing in such a dress, but for the sake of my\npatient, whom alone I wholly design to please, and no wise offend or\ndissatisfy.  There is also a passage in our father Hippocrates, in the book\nI have named, which causes some to sweat, dispute, and labour; not indeed\nto know whether the physician's frowning, discontented, and morose Catonian\nlook render the patient sad, and his joyful, serene, and pleasing\ncountenance rejoice him; for experience teaches us that this is most\ncertain; but whether such sensations of grief or pleasure are produced by\nthe apprehension of the patient observing his motions and qualities in his\nphysician, and drawing from thence conjectures of the end and catastrophe\nof his disease; as, by his pleasing look, joyful and desirable events, and\nby his sorrowful and unpleasing air, sad and dismal consequences; or\nwhether those sensations be produced by a transfusion of the serene or\ngloomy, aerial or terrestrial, joyful or melancholic spirits of the\nphysician into the person of the patient, as is the opinion of Plato,\nAverroes, and others.\n\nAbove all things, the forecited authors have given particular directions to\nphysicians about the words, discourse, and converse which they ought to\nhave with their patients; everyone aiming at one point, that is, to rejoice\nthem without offending God, and in no wise whatsoever to vex or displease\nthem.  Which causes Herophilus much to blame the physician Callianax, who,\nbeing asked by a patient of his, Shall I die? impudently made him this\nanswer:\n\n  Patroclus died, whom all allow\n  By much a better man than you.\n\nAnother, who had a mind to know the state of his distemper, asking him,\nafter our merry Patelin's way:  Well, doctor, does not my water tell you I\nshall die?  He foolishly answered, No; if Latona, the mother of those\nlovely twins, Phoebus and Diana, begot thee.  Galen, lib. 4, Comment. 6.\nEpidem., blames much also Quintus his tutor, who, a certain nobleman of\nRome, his patient, saying to him, You have been at breakfast, my master,\nyour breath smells of wine; answered arrogantly, Yours smells of fever;\nwhich is the better smell of the two, wine or a putrid fever?  But the\ncalumny of certain cannibals, misanthropes, perpetual eavesdroppers, has\nbeen so foul and excessive against me, that it had conquered my patience,\nand I had resolved not to write one jot more.  For the least of their\ndetractions were that my books are all stuffed with various heresies, of\nwhich, nevertheless, they could not show one single instance; much, indeed,\nof comical and facetious fooleries, neither offending God nor the king (and\ntruly I own they are the only subject and only theme of these books), but\nof heresy not a word, unless they interpreted wrong, and against all use of\nreason and common language, what I had rather suffer a thousand deaths, if\nit were possible, than have thought; as who should make bread to be stone,\na fish to be a serpent, and an egg to be a scorpion.  This, my lord,\nemboldened me once to tell you, as I was complaining of it in your\npresence, that if I did not esteem myself a better Christian than they show\nthemselves towards me, and if my life, writings, words, nay thoughts,\nbetrayed to me one single spark of heresy, or I should in a detestable\nmanner fall into the snares of the spirit of detraction, Diabolos, who, by\ntheir means, raises such crimes against me; I would then, like the phoenix,\ngather dry wood, kindle a fire, and burn myself in the midst of it.  You\nwere then pleased to say to me that King Francis, of eternal memory, had\nbeen made sensible of those false accusations; and that having caused my\nbooks (mine, I say, because several, false and infamous, have been wickedly\nlaid to me) to be carefully and distinctly read to him by the most learned\nand faithful anagnost in this kingdom, he had not found any passage\nsuspicious; and that he abhorred a certain envious, ignorant, hypocritical\ninformer, who grounded a mortal heresy on an n put instead of an m by the\ncarelessness of the printers.\n\nAs much was done by his son, our most gracious, virtuous, and blessed\nsovereign, Henry, whom Heaven long preserve! so that he granted you his\nroyal privilege and particular protection for me against my slandering\nadversaries.\n\nYou kindly condescended since to confirm me these happy news at Paris; and\nalso lately, when you visited my Lord Cardinal du Bellay, who, for the\nbenefit of his health, after a lingering distemper, was retired to St.\nMaur, that place (or rather paradise) of salubrity, serenity, conveniency,\nand all desirable country pleasures.\n\nThus, my lord, under so glorious a patronage, I am emboldened once more to\ndraw my pen, undaunted now and secure; with hopes that you will still prove\nto me, against the power of detraction, a second Gallic Hercules in\nlearning, prudence, and eloquence; an Alexicacos in virtue, power, and\nauthority; you, of whom I may truly say what the wise monarch Solomon saith\nof Moses, that great prophet and captain of Israel, Ecclesiast. 45:  A man\nfearing and loving God, who found favour in the sight of all flesh,\nwell-beloved both of God and man; whose memorial is blessed.  God made him\nlike to the glorious saints, and magnified him so, that his enemies stood in\nfear of him; and for him made wonders; made him glorious in the sight of\nkings, gave him a commandment for his people, and by him showed his light;\nhe sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, and chose him out of all\nmen.  By him he made us to hear his voice, and caused by him the law of life\nand knowledge to be given.\n\nAccordingly, if I shall be so happy as to hear anyone commend those merry\ncomposures, they shall be adjured by me to be obliged and pay their thanks\nto you alone, as also to offer their prayers to Heaven for the continuance\nand increase of your greatness; and to attribute no more to me than my\nhumble and ready obedience to your commands; for by your most honourable\nencouragement you at once have inspired me with spirit and with invention;\nand without you my heart had failed me, and the fountain-head of my animal\nspirits had been dry.  May the Lord keep you in his blessed mercy!\n\n               My Lord,\n\n  Your most humble, and most devoted Servant,\n\n                   Francis Rabelais, Physician.\n\n  Paris, this 28th of January, MDLII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Author's Prologue.\n\nGood people, God save and keep you!  Where are you?  I can't see you:\nstay--I'll saddle my nose with spectacles--oh, oh! 'twill be fair anon:  I\nsee you.  Well, you have had a good vintage, they say:  this is no bad news\nto Frank, you may swear.  You have got an infallible cure against thirst:\nrarely performed of you, my friends!  You, your wives, children, friends,\nand families are in as good case as hearts can wish; it is well, it is as I\nwould have it:  God be praised for it, and if such be his will, may you\nlong be so.  For my part, I am thereabouts, thanks to his blessed goodness;\nand by the means of a little Pantagruelism (which you know is a certain\njollity of mind, pickled in the scorn of fortune), you see me now hale and\ncheery, as sound as a bell, and ready to drink, if you will.  Would you\nknow why I'm thus, good people?  I will even give you a positive answer\n--Such is the Lord's will, which I obey and revere; it being said in his\nword, in great derision to the physician neglectful of his own health,\nPhysician, heal thyself.\n\nGalen had some knowledge of the Bible, and had conversed with the\nChristians of his time, as appears lib. 11. De Usu Partium; lib. 2. De\nDifferentiis Pulsuum, cap. 3, and ibid. lib. 3. cap. 2. and lib. De Rerum\nAffectibus (if it be Galen's).  Yet 'twas not for any such veneration of\nholy writ that he took care of his own health.  No, it was for fear of\nbeing twitted with the saying so well known among physicians:\n\n  Iatros allon autos elkesi bruon.\n\n  He boasts of healing poor and rich,\n  Yet is himself all over itch.\n\nThis made him boldly say, that he did not desire to be esteemed a\nphysician, if from his twenty-eighth year to his old age he had not lived\nin perfect health, except some ephemerous fevers, of which he soon rid\nhimself; yet he was not naturally of the soundest temper, his stomach being\nevidently bad.  Indeed, as he saith, lib. 5, De Sanitate tuenda, that\nphysician will hardly be thought very careful of the health of others who\nneglects his own.  Asclepiades boasted yet more than this; for he said that\nhe had articled with fortune not to be reputed a physician if he could be\nsaid to have been sick since he began to practise physic to his latter age,\nwhich he reached, lusty in all his members and victorious over fortune;\ntill at last the old gentleman unluckily tumbled down from the top of a\ncertain ill-propped and rotten staircase, and so there was an end of him.\n\nIf by some disaster health is fled from your worships to the right or to\nthe left, above or below, before or behind, within or without, far or near,\non this side or the other side, wheresoever it be, may you presently, with\nthe help of the Lord, meet with it.  Having found it, may you immediately\nclaim it, seize it, and secure it.  The law allows it; the king would have\nit so; nay, you have my advice for it.  Neither more nor less than the\nlaw-makers of old did fully empower a master to claim and seize his runaway\nservant wherever he might be found.  Odds-bodikins, is it not written and\nwarranted by the ancient customs of this noble, so rich, so flourishing\nrealm of France, that the dead seizes the quick?  See what has been\ndeclared very lately in that point by that learned, wise, courteous, humane\nand just civilian, Andrew Tiraqueau, one of the judges in the most\nhonourable court of Parliament at Paris.  Health is our life, as Ariphron\nthe Sicyonian wisely has it; without health life is not life, it is not\nliving life: abios bios, bios abiotos.  Without health life is only a\nlanguishment and an image of death.  Therefore, you that want your health,\nthat is to say, that are dead, seize the quick; secure life to yourselves,\nthat is to say, health.\n\nI have this hope in the Lord, that he will hear our supplications,\nconsidering with what faith and zeal we pray, and that he will grant this\nour wish because it is moderate and mean.  Mediocrity was held by the\nancient sages to be golden, that is to say, precious, praised by all men,\nand pleasing in all places.  Read the sacred Bible, you will find the\nprayers of those who asked moderately were never unanswered.  For example,\nlittle dapper Zaccheus, whose body and relics the monks of St. Garlick,\nnear Orleans, boast of having, and nickname him St. Sylvanus; he only\nwished to see our blessed Saviour near Jerusalem.  It was but a small\nrequest, and no more than anybody then might pretend to.  But alas! he was\nbut low-built; and one of so diminutive a size, among the crowd, could not\nso much as get a glimpse of him.  Well then he struts, stands on tiptoes,\nbustles, and bestirs his stumps, shoves and makes way, and with much ado\nclambers up a sycamore.  Upon this, the Lord, who knew his sincere\naffection, presented himself to his sight, and was not only seen by him,\nbut heard also; nay, what is more, he came to his house and blessed his\nfamily.\n\nOne of the sons of the prophets in Israel felling would near the river\nJordan, his hatchet forsook the helve and fell to the bottom of the river;\nso he prayed to have it again ('twas but a small request, mark ye me), and\nhaving a strong faith, he did not throw the hatchet after the helve, as\nsome spirits of contradiction say by way of scandalous blunder, but the\nhelve after the hatchet, as you all properly have it.  Presently two great\nmiracles were seen:  up springs the hatchet from the bottom of the water,\nand fixes itself to its old acquaintance the helve.  Now had he wished to\ncoach it to heaven in a fiery chariot like Elias, to multiply in seed like\nAbraham, be as rich as Job, strong as Samson, and beautiful as Absalom,\nwould he have obtained it, d'ye think?  I' troth, my friends, I question it\nvery much.\n\nNow I talk of moderate wishes in point of hatchet (but harkee me, be sure\nyou don't forget when we ought to drink), I will tell you what is written\namong the apologues of wise Aesop the Frenchman.  I mean the Phrygian and\nTrojan, as Max. Planudes makes him; from which people, according to the\nmost faithful chroniclers, the noble French are descended.  Aelian writes\nthat he was of Thrace and Agathias, after Herodotus, that he was of Samos;\n'tis all one to Frank.\n\nIn his time lived a poor honest country fellow of Gravot, Tom Wellhung by\nname, a wood-cleaver by trade, who in that low drudgery made shift so to\npick up a sorry livelihood.  It happened that he lost his hatchet.  Now\ntell me who ever had more cause to be vexed than poor Tom?  Alas, his whole\nestate and life depended on his hatchet; by his hatchet he earned many a\nfair penny of the best woodmongers or log-merchants among whom he went\na-jobbing; for want of his hatchet he was like to starve; and had death but\nmet with him six days after without a hatchet, the grim fiend would have\nmowed him down in the twinkling of a bedstaff.  In this sad case he began\nto be in a heavy taking, and called upon Jupiter with the most eloquent\nprayers--for you know necessity was the mother of eloquence.  With the\nwhites of his eyes turned up towards heaven, down on his marrow-bones, his\narms reared high, his fingers stretched wide, and his head bare, the poor\nwretch without ceasing was roaring out, by way of litany, at every\nrepetition of his supplications, My hatchet, Lord Jupiter, my hatchet! my\nhatchet! only my hatchet, O Jupiter, or money to buy another, and nothing\nelse! alas, my poor hatchet!\n\nJupiter happened then to be holding a grand council about certain urgent\naffairs, and old gammer Cybele was just giving her opinion, or, if you\nwould rather have it so, it was young Phoebus the beau; but, in short,\nTom's outcries and lamentations were so loud that they were heard with no\nsmall amazement at the council-board, by the whole consistory of the gods.\nWhat a devil have we below, quoth Jupiter, that howls so horridly?  By the\nmud of Styx, have not we had all along, and have not we here still enough\nto do, to set to rights a world of damned puzzling businesses of\nconsequence?  We made an end of the fray between Presthan, King of Persia,\nand Soliman the Turkish emperor, we have stopped up the passages between\nthe Tartars and the Muscovites; answered the Xeriff's petition; done the\nsame to that of Golgots Rays; the state of Parma's despatched; so is that\nof Maidenburg, that of Mirandola, and that of Africa, that town on the\nMediterranean which we call Aphrodisium; Tripoli by carelessness has got a\nnew master; her hour was come.\n\nHere are the Gascons cursing and damning, demanding the restitution of\ntheir bells.\n\nIn yonder corner are the Saxons, Easterlings, Ostrogoths, and Germans,\nnations formerly invincible, but now aberkeids, bridled, curbed, and\nbrought under a paltry diminutive crippled fellow; they ask us revenge,\nrelief, restitution of their former good sense and ancient liberty.\n\nBut what shall we do with this same Ramus and this Galland, with a pox to\nthem, who, surrounded with a swarm of their scullions, blackguard\nragamuffins, sizars, vouchers, and stipulators, set together by the ears\nthe whole university of Paris?  I am in a sad quandary about it, and for\nthe heart's blood of me cannot tell yet with whom of the two to side.\n\nBoth seem to me notable fellows, and as true cods as ever pissed.  The one\nhas rose-nobles, I say fine and weighty ones; the other would gladly have\nsome too.  The one knows something; the other's no dunce.  The one loves\nthe better sort of men; the other's beloved by 'em.  The one is an old\ncunning fox; the other with tongue and pen, tooth and nail, falls foul on\nthe ancient orators and philosophers, and barks at them like a cur.\n\nWhat thinkest thou of it, say, thou bawdy Priapus?  I have found thy\ncounsel just before now, et habet tua mentula mentem.\n\nKing Jupiter, answered Priapus, standing up and taking off his cowl, his\nsnout uncased and reared up, fiery and stiffly propped, since you compare\nthe one to a yelping snarling cur and the other to sly Reynard the fox, my\nadvice is, with submission, that without fretting or puzzling your brains\nany further about 'em, without any more ado, even serve 'em both as, in the\ndays of yore, you did the dog and the fox.  How? asked Jupiter; when? who\nwere they? where was it?  You have a rare memory, for aught I see! returned\nPriapus.  This right worshipful father Bacchus, whom we have here nodding\nwith his crimson phiz, to be revenged on the Thebans had got a fairy fox,\nwho, whatever mischief he did, was never to be caught or wronged by any\nbeast that wore a head.\n\nThe noble Vulcan here present had framed a dog of Monesian brass, and with\nlong puffing and blowing put the spirit of life into him; he gave it to\nyou, you gave it your Miss Europa, Miss Europa gave it Minos, Minos gave it\nProcris, Procris gave it Cephalus.  He was also of the fairy kind; so that,\nlike the lawyers of our age, he was too hard for all other sorts of\ncreatures; nothing could scape the dog.  Now who should happen to meet but\nthese two?  What do you think they did?  Dog by his destiny was to take\nfox, and fox by his fate was not to be taken.\n\nThe case was brought before your council:  you protested that you would not\nact against the fates; and the fates were contradictory.  In short, the end\nand result of the matter was, that to reconcile two contradictions was an\nimpossibility in nature.  The very pang put you into a sweat; some drops of\nwhich happening to light on the earth, produced what the mortals call\ncauliflowers.  All our noble consistory, for want of a categorical\nresolution, were seized with such a horrid thirst, that above seventy-eight\nhogsheads of nectar were swilled down at that sitting.  At last you took my\nadvice, and transmogrified them into stones; and immediately got rid of\nyour perplexity, and a truce with thirst was proclaimed through this vast\nOlympus.  This was the year of flabby cods, near Teumessus, between Thebes\nand Chalcis.\n\nAfter this manner, it is my opinion that you should petrify this dog and\nthis fox.  The metamorphosis will not be incongruous; for they both bear\nthe name of Peter.  And because, according to the Limosin proverb, to make\nan oven's mouth there must be three stones, you may associate them with\nMaster Peter du Coignet, whom you formerly petrified for the same cause.\nThen those three dead pieces shall be put in an equilateral trigone\nsomewhere in the great temple at Paris--in the middle of the porch, if you\nwill--there to perform the office of extinguishers, and with their noses\nput out the lighted candles, torches, tapers, and flambeaux; since, while\nthey lived, they still lighted, ballock-like, the fire of faction,\ndivision, ballock sects, and wrangling among those idle bearded boys, the\nstudents.  And this will be an everlasting monument to show that those puny\nself-conceited pedants, ballock-framers, were rather contemned than\ncondemned by you.  Dixi, I have said my say.\n\nYou deal too kindly by them, said Jupiter, for aught I see, Monsieur\nPriapus.  You do not use to be so kind to everybody, let me tell you; for\nas they seek to eternize their names, it would be much better for them to\nbe thus changed into hard stones than to return to earth and putrefaction.\nBut now to other matters.  Yonder behind us, towards the Tuscan sea and the\nneighbourhood of Mount Apennine, do you see what tragedies are stirred up\nby certain topping ecclesiastical bullies?  This hot fit will last its\ntime, like the Limosins' ovens, and then will be cooled, but not so fast.\n\nWe shall have sport enough with it; but I foresee one inconveniency; for\nmethinks we have but little store of thunder ammunition since the time that\nyou, my fellow gods, for your pastime lavished them away to bombard new\nAntioch, by my particular permission; as since, after your example, the\nstout champions who had undertaken to hold the fortress of Dindenarois\nagainst all comers fairly wasted their powder with shooting at sparrows,\nand then, not having wherewith to defend themselves in time of need,\nvaliantly surrendered to the enemy, who were already packing up their awls,\nfull of madness and despair, and thought on nothing but a shameful retreat.\nTake care this be remedied, son Vulcan; rouse up your drowsy Cyclopes,\nAsteropes, Brontes, Arges, Polyphemus, Steropes, Pyracmon, and so forth,\nset them at work, and make them drink as they ought.\n\nNever spare liquor to such as are at hot work.  Now let us despatch this\nbawling fellow below.  You, Mercury, go see who it is, and know what he\nwants.  Mercury looked out at heaven's trapdoor, through which, as I am\ntold, they hear what is said here below.  By the way, one might well enough\nmistake it for the scuttle of a ship; though Icaromenippus said it was like\nthe mouth of a well.  The light-heeled deity saw that it was honest Tom,\nwho asked for his lost hatchet; and accordingly he made his report to the\nsynod.  Marry, said Jupiter, we are finely helped up, as if we had now\nnothing else to do here but to restore lost hatchets.  Well, he must have\nit then for all this, for so 'tis written in the Book of Fate (do you\nhear?), as well as if it was worth the whole duchy of Milan.  The truth is,\nthe fellow's hatchet is as much to him as a kingdom to a king.  Come, come,\nlet no more words be scattered about it; let him have his hatchet again.\n\nNow, let us make an end of the difference betwixt the Levites and\nmole-catchers of Landerousse.  Whereabouts were we?  Priapus was standing in\nthe chimney-corner, and having heard what Mercury had reported, said in a\nmost courteous and jovial manner:  King Jupiter, while by your order and\nparticular favour I was garden-keeper-general on earth, I observed that this\nword hatchet is equivocal to many things; for it signifies a certain\ninstrument by the means of which men fell and cleave timber.  It also\nsignifies (at least I am sure it did formerly) a female soundly and\nfrequently thumpthumpriggletickletwiddletobyed.  Thus I perceived that every\ncock of the game used to call his doxy his hatchet; for with that same tool\n(this he said lugging out and exhibiting his nine-inch knocker) they so\nstrongly and resolutely shove and drive in their helves, that the females\nremain free from a fear epidemical amongst their sex, viz., that from the\nbottom of the male's belly the instrument should dangle at his heel for want\nof such feminine props.  And I remember, for I have a member, and a memory\ntoo, ay, and a fine memory, large enough to fill a butter-firkin; I\nremember, I say, that one day of tubilustre (horn-fair) at the festivals of\ngoodman Vulcan in May, I heard Josquin Des Prez, Olkegan, Hobrecht,\nAgricola, Brumel, Camelin, Vigoris, De la Fage, Bruyer, Prioris, Seguin, De\nla Rue, Midy, Moulu, Mouton, Gascogne, Loyset, Compere, Penet, Fevin,\nRousee, Richard Fort, Rousseau, Consilion, Constantio Festi, Jacquet Bercan,\nmelodiously singing the following catch on a pleasant green:\n\n  Long John to bed went to his bride,\n  And laid a mallet by his side:\n  What means this mallet, John? saith she.\n  Why! 'tis to wedge thee home, quoth he.\n  Alas! cried she, the man's a fool:\n  What need you use a wooden tool?\n  When lusty John does to me come,\n  He never shoves but with his bum.\n\nNine Olympiads, and an intercalary year after (I have a rare member, I\nwould say memory; but I often make blunders in the symbolization and\ncolligance of those two words), I heard Adrian Villart, Gombert, Janequin,\nArcadet, Claudin, Certon, Manchicourt, Auxerre, Villiers, Sandrin, Sohier,\nHesdin, Morales, Passereau, Maille, Maillart, Jacotin, Heurteur, Verdelot,\nCarpentras, L'Heritier, Cadeac, Doublet, Vermont, Bouteiller, Lupi,\nPagnier, Millet, Du Moulin, Alaire, Maraut, Morpain, Gendre, and other\nmerry lovers of music, in a private garden, under some fine shady trees,\nround about a bulwark of flagons, gammons, pasties, with several coated\nquails, and laced mutton, waggishly singing:\n\n  Since tools without their hafts are useless lumber,\n  And hatchets without helves are of that number;\n  That one may go in t'other, and may match it,\n  I'll be the helve, and thou shalt be the hatchet.\n\nNow would I know what kind of hatchet this bawling Tom wants?  This threw\nall the venerable gods and goddesses into a fit of laughter, like any\nmicrocosm of flies; and even set limping Vulcan a-hopping and jumping\nsmoothly three or four times for the sake of his dear.  Come, come, said\nJupiter to Mercury, run down immediately, and cast at the poor fellow's\nfeet three hatchets:  his own, another of gold, and a third of massy\nsilver, all of one size; then having left it to his will to take his\nchoice, if he take his own, and be satisfied with it, give him the other\ntwo; if he take another, chop his head off with his own; and henceforth\nserve me all those losers of hatchets after that manner.  Having said this,\nJupiter, with an awkward turn of his head, like a jackanapes swallowing of\npills, made so dreadful a phiz that all the vast Olympus quaked again.\nHeaven's foot messenger, thanks to his low-crowned narrow-brimmed hat, his\nplume of feathers, heel-pieces, and running stick with pigeon wings, flings\nhimself out at heaven's wicket, through the idle deserts of the air, and in\na trice nimbly alights upon the earth, and throws at friend Tom's feet the\nthree hatchets, saying unto him:  Thou hast bawled long enough to be a-dry;\nthy prayers and request are granted by Jupiter:  see which of these three\nis thy hatchet, and take it away with thee.  Wellhung lifts up the golden\nhatchet, peeps upon it, and finds it very heavy; then staring on Mercury,\ncries, Codszouks, this is none of mine; I won't ha't:  the same he did with\nthe silver one, and said, 'Tis not this neither, you may e'en take them\nagain.  At last he takes up his own hatchet, examines the end of the helve,\nand finds his mark there; then, ravished with joy, like a fox that meets\nsome straggling poultry, and sneering from the tip of the nose, he cried,\nBy the mass, this is my hatchet, master god; if you will leave it me, I\nwill sacrifice to you a very good and huge pot of milk brimful, covered\nwith fine strawberries, next ides of May.\n\nHonest fellow, said Mercury, I leave it thee; take it; and because thou\nhast wished and chosen moderately in point of hatchet, by Jupiter's command\nI give thee these two others; thou hast now wherewith to make thyself rich:\nbe honest.  Honest Tom gave Mercury a whole cartload of thanks, and revered\nthe most great Jupiter.  His old hatchet he fastens close to his leathern\ngirdle, and girds it above his breech like Martin of Cambray; the two\nothers, being more heavy, he lays on his shoulder.  Thus he plods on,\ntrudging over the fields, keeping a good countenance amongst his neighbours\nand fellow-parishioners, with one merry saying or other after Patelin's\nway.  The next day, having put on a clean white jacket, he takes on his\nback the two precious hatchets and comes to Chinon, the famous city, noble\ncity, ancient city, yea, the first city in the world, according to the\njudgment and assertion of the most learned Massorets.  At Chinon he turned\nhis silver hatchet into fine testons, crown-pieces, and other white cash;\nhis golden hatchet into fine angels, curious ducats, substantial ridders,\nspankers, and rose-nobles; then with them purchases a good number of farms,\nbarns, houses, out-houses, thatched houses, stables, meadows, orchards,\nfields, vineyards, woods, arable lands, pastures, ponds, mills, gardens,\nnurseries, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, swine, hogs, asses, horses, hens,\ncocks, capons, chickens, geese, ganders, ducks, drakes, and a world of all\nother necessaries, and in a short time became the richest man in the\ncountry, nay, even richer than that limping scrape-good Maulevrier.  His\nbrother bumpkins, and the other yeomen and country-puts thereabouts,\nperceiving his good fortune, were not a little amazed, insomuch that their\nformer pity of poor Tom was soon changed into an envy of his so great and\nunexpected rise; and as they could not for their souls devise how this came\nabout, they made it their business to pry up and down, and lay their heads\ntogether, to inquire, seek, and inform themselves by what means, in what\nplace, on what day, what hour, how, why, and wherefore, he had come by this\ngreat treasure.\n\nAt last, hearing it was by losing his hatchet, Ha, ha! said they, was there\nno more to do but to lose a hatchet to make us rich?  Mum for that; 'tis as\neasy as pissing a bed, and will cost but little.  Are then at this time the\nrevolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament, and\naspects of the planets such, that whosoever shall lose a hatchet shall\nimmediately grow rich?  Ha, ha, ha! by Jove, you shall e'en be lost, an't\nplease you, my dear hatchet.  With this they all fairly lost their hatchets\nout of hand.  The devil of one that had a hatchet left; he was not his\nmother's son that did not lose his hatchet.  No more was wood felled or\ncleaved in that country through want of hatchets.  Nay, the Aesopian\napologue even saith that certain petty country gents of the lower class,\nwho had sold Wellhung their little mill and little field to have\nwherewithal to make a figure at the next muster, having been told that his\ntreasure was come to him by that only means, sold the only badge of their\ngentility, their swords, to purchase hatchets to go lose them, as the silly\nclodpates did, in hopes to gain store of chink by that loss.\n\nYou would have truly sworn they had been a parcel of your petty spiritual\nusurers, Rome-bound, selling their all, and borrowing of others, to buy\nstore of mandates, a pennyworth of a new-made pope.\n\nNow they cried out and brayed, and prayed and bawled, and lamented, and\ninvoked Jupiter:  My hatchet! my hatchet!  Jupiter, my hatchet! on this\nside, My hatchet! on that side, My hatchet!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, Jupiter, my\nhatchet!  The air round about rung again with the cries and howlings of\nthese rascally losers of hatchets.\n\nMercury was nimble in bringing them hatchets; to each offering that which\nhe had lost, as also another of gold, and a third of silver.\n\nEvery he still was for that of gold, giving thanks in abundance to the\ngreat giver, Jupiter; but in the very nick of time that they bowed and\nstooped to take it from the ground, whip, in a trice, Mercury lopped off\ntheir heads, as Jupiter had commanded; and of heads thus cut off the number\nwas just equal to that of the lost hatchets.\n\nYou see how it is now; you see how it goes with those who in the simplicity\nof their hearts wish and desire with moderation.  Take warning by this, all\nyou greedy, fresh-water sharks, who scorn to wish for anything under ten\nthousand pounds; and do not for the future run on impudently, as I have\nsometimes heard you wishing, Would to God I had now one hundred\nseventy-eight millions of gold!  Oh! how I should tickle it off.  The deuce\non you, what more might a king, an emperor, or a pope wish for?  For that\nreason, indeed, you see that after you have made such hopeful wishes, all\nthe good that comes to you of it is the itch or the scab, and not a cross in\nyour breeches to scare the devil that tempts you to make these wishes:  no\nmore than those two mumpers, wishers after the custom of Paris; one of whom\nonly wished to have in good old gold as much as hath been spent, bought, and\nsold in Paris, since its first foundations were laid, to this hour; all of\nit valued at the price, sale, and rate of the dearest year in all that space\nof time.  Do you think the fellow was bashful?  Had he eaten sour plums\nunpeeled?  Were his teeth on edge, I pray you?  The other wished Our Lady's\nChurch brimful of steel needles, from the floor to the top of the roof, and\nto have as many ducats as might be crammed into as many bags as might be\nsewed with each and everyone of those needles, till they were all either\nbroke at the point or eye.  This is to wish with a vengeance!  What think\nyou of it?  What did they get by't, in your opinion?  Why at night both my\ngentlemen had kibed heels, a tetter in the chin, a churchyard cough in the\nlungs, a catarrh in the throat, a swingeing boil at the rump, and the devil\nof one musty crust of a brown george the poor dogs had to scour their\ngrinders with.  Wish therefore for mediocrity, and it shall be given unto\nyou, and over and above yet; that is to say, provided you bestir yourself\nmanfully, and do your best in the meantime.\n\nAy, but say you, God might as soon have given me seventy-eight thousand as\nthe thirteenth part of one half; for he is omnipotent, and a million of\ngold is no more to him than one farthing.  Oh, ho! pray tell me who taught\nyou to talk at this rate of the power and predestination of God, poor silly\npeople?  Peace, tush, st, st, st! fall down before his sacred face and own\nthe nothingness of your nothing.\n\nUpon this, O ye that labour under the affliction of the gout, I ground my\nhopes; firmly believing, that if so it pleases the divine goodness, you\nshall obtain health; since you wish and ask for nothing else, at least for\nthe present.  Well, stay yet a little longer with half an ounce of\npatience.\n\nThe Genoese do not use, like you, to be satisfied with wishing health\nalone, when after they have all the livelong morning been in a brown study,\ntalked, pondered, ruminated, and resolved in the counting-houses of whom\nand how they may squeeze the ready, and who by their craft must be hooked\nin, wheedled,  bubbled, sharped, overreached, and choused; they go to the\nexchange, and greet one another with a Sanita e guadagno, Messer! health\nand gain to you, sir!  Health alone will not go down with the greedy\ncurmudgeons; they over and above must wish for gain, with a pox to 'em; ay,\nand for the fine crowns, or scudi di Guadaigne; whence, heaven be praised!\nit happens many a time that the silly wishers and woulders are baulked, and\nget neither.\n\nNow, my lads, as you hope for good health, cough once aloud with lungs of\nleather; take me off three swingeing bumpers; prick up your ears; and you\nshall hear me tell wonders of the noble and good Pantagruel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH BOOK.\n\n\nChapter 4.I.\n\nHow Pantagruel went to sea to visit the oracle of Bacbuc, alias the Holy\nBottle.\n\nIn the month of June, on Vesta's holiday, the very numerical day on which\nBrutus, conquering Spain, taught its strutting dons to truckle under him,\nand that niggardly miser Crassus was routed and knocked on the head by the\nParthians, Pantagruel took his leave of the good Gargantua, his royal\nfather.  The old gentleman, according to the laudable custom of the\nprimitive Christians, devoutly prayed for the happy voyage of his son and\nhis whole company, and then they took shipping at the port of Thalassa.\nPantagruel had with him Panurge, Friar John des Entomeures, alias of the\nFunnels, Epistemon, Gymnast, Eusthenes, Rhizotome, Carpalin, cum multis\naliis, his ancient servants and domestics; also Xenomanes, the great\ntraveller, who had crossed so many dangerous roads, dikes, ponds, seas, and\nso forth, and was come some time before, having been sent for by Panurge.\n\nFor certain good causes and considerations him thereunto moving, he had\nleft with Gargantua, and marked out, in his great and universal\nhydrographical chart, the course which they were to steer to visit the\nOracle of the Holy Bottle Bacbuc.  The number of ships were such as I\ndescribed in the third book, convoyed by a like number of triremes, men of\nwar, galleons, and feluccas, well-rigged, caulked, and stored with a good\nquantity of Pantagruelion.\n\nAll the officers, droggermen, pilots, captains, mates, boatswains,\nmidshipmen, quartermasters, and sailors, met in the Thalamege, Pantagruel's\nprincipal flag-ship, which had in her stern for her ensign a huge large\nbottle, half silver well polished, the other half gold enamelled with\ncarnation; whereby it was easy to guess that white and red were the colours\nof the noble travellers, and that they went for the word of the Bottle.\n\nOn the stern of the second was a lantern like those of the ancients,\nindustriously made with diaphanous stone, implying that they were to pass\nby Lanternland.  The third ship had for her device a fine deep china ewer.\nThe fourth, a double-handed jar of gold, much like an ancient urn.  The\nfifth, a famous can made of sperm of emerald.  The sixth, a monk's mumping\nbottle made of the four metals together.  The seventh, an ebony funnel, all\nembossed and wrought with gold after the Tauchic manner.  The eighth, an\nivy goblet, very precious, inlaid with gold.  The ninth, a cup of fine\nObriz gold.  The tenth, a tumbler of aromatic agoloch (you call it lignum\naloes) edged with Cyprian gold, after the Azemine make.  The eleventh, a\ngolden vine-tub of mosaic work.  The twelfth, a runlet of unpolished gold,\ncovered with a small vine of large Indian pearl of Topiarian work.\nInsomuch that there was not a man, however in the dumps, musty,\nsour-looked, or melancholic he were, not even excepting that blubbering\nwhiner Heraclitus, had he been there, but seeing this noble convoy of ships\nand their devices, must have been seized with present gladness of heart,\nand, smiling at the conceit, have said that the travellers were all honest\ntopers, true pitcher-men, and have judged by a most sure prognostication\nthat their voyage, both outward and homeward-bound, would be performed in\nmirth and perfect health.\n\nIn the Thalamege, where was the general meeting, Pantagruel made a short\nbut sweet exhortation, wholly backed with authorities from Scripture upon\nnavigation; which being ended, with an audible voice prayers were said in\nthe presence and hearing of all the burghers of Thalassa, who had flocked\nto the mole to see them take shipping.  After the prayers was melodiously\nsung a psalm of the holy King David, which begins, When Israel went out of\nEgypt; and that being ended, tables were placed upon deck, and a feast\nspeedily served up. The Thalassians, who had also borne a chorus in the\npsalm, caused store of belly-timber to be brought out of their houses.  All\ndrank to them; they drank to all; which was the cause that none of the\nwhole company gave up what they had eaten, nor were sea-sick, with a pain\nat the head and stomach; which inconveniency they could not so easily have\nprevented by drinking, for some time before, salt water, either alone or\nmixed with wine; using quinces, citron peel, juice of pomegranates, sourish\nsweetmeats, fasting a long time, covering their stomachs with paper, or\nfollowing such other idle remedies as foolish physicians prescribe to those\nthat go to sea.\n\nHaving often renewed their tipplings, each mother's son retired on board\nhis own ship, and set sail all so fast with a merry gale at south-east; to\nwhich point of the compass the chief pilot, James Brayer by name, had\nshaped his course, and fixed all things accordingly.  For seeing that the\nOracle of the Holy Bottle lay near Cathay, in the Upper India, his advice,\nand that of Xenomanes also, was not to steer the course which the\nPortuguese use, while sailing through the torrid zone, and Cape Bona\nSperanza, at the south point of Africa, beyond the equinoctial line, and\nlosing sight of the northern pole, their guide, they make a prodigious long\nvoyage; but rather to keep as near the parallel of the said India as\npossible, and to tack to the westward of the said pole, so that winding\nunder the north, they might find themselves in the latitude of the port of\nOlone, without coming nearer it for fear of being shut up in the frozen\nsea; whereas, following this canonical turn, by the said parallel, they\nmust have that on the right to the eastward, which at their departure was\non their left.\n\nThis proved a much shorter cut; for without shipwreck, danger, or loss of\nmen, with uninterrupted good weather, except one day near the island of the\nMacreons, they performed in less than four months the voyage of Upper\nIndia, which the Portuguese, with a thousand inconveniences and innumerable\ndangers, can hardly complete in three years.  And it is my opinion, with\nsubmission to better judgments, that this course was perhaps steered by\nthose Indians who sailed to Germany, and were honourably received by the\nKing of the Swedes, while Quintus Metellus Celer was proconsul of the\nGauls; as Cornelius Nepos, Pomponius Mela, and Pliny after them tell us.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.II.\n\nHow Pantagruel bought many rarities in the island of Medamothy.\n\nThat day and the two following they neither discovered land nor anything\nnew; for they had formerly sailed that way:  but on the fourth they made an\nisland called Medamothy, of a fine and delightful prospect, by reason of\nthe vast number of lighthouses and high marble towers in its circuit, which\nis not less than that of Canada (sic).  Pantagruel, inquiring who governed\nthere, heard that it was King Philophanes, absent at that time upon account\nof the marriage of his brother Philotheamon with the infanta of the kingdom\nof Engys.\n\nHearing this, he went ashore in the harbour, and while every ship's crew\nwatered, passed his time in viewing divers pictures, pieces of tapestry,\nanimals, fishes, birds, and other exotic and foreign merchandises, which\nwere along the walks of the mole and in the markets of the port.  For it\nwas the third day of the great and famous fair of the place, to which the\nchief merchants of Africa and Asia resorted.  Out of these Friar John\nbought him two rare pictures; in one of which the face of a man that brings\nin an appeal was drawn to the life; and in the other a servant that wants a\nmaster, with every needful particular, action, countenance, look, gait,\nfeature, and deportment, being an original by Master Charles Charmois,\nprincipal painter to King Megistus; and he paid for them in the court\nfashion, with conge and grimace.  Panurge bought a large picture, copied\nand done from the needle-work formerly wrought by Philomela, showing to her\nsister Progne how her brother-in-law Tereus had by force handselled her\ncopyhold, and then cut out her tongue that she might not (as women will)\ntell tales.  I vow and swear by the handle of my paper lantern that it was\na gallant, a mirific, nay, a most admirable piece.  Nor do you think, I\npray you, that in it was the picture of a man playing the beast with two\nbacks with a female; this had been too silly and gross:  no, no; it was\nanother-guise thing, and much plainer.  You may, if you please, see it at\nTheleme, on the left hand as you go into the high gallery.  Epistemon\nbought another, wherein were painted to the life the ideas of Plato and the\natoms of Epicurus.  Rhizotome purchased another, wherein Echo was drawn to\nthe life.  Pantagruel caused to be bought, by Gymnast, the life and deeds\nof Achilles, in seventy-eight pieces of tapestry, four fathom long, and\nthree fathom broad, all of Phrygian silk, embossed with gold and silver;\nthe work beginning at the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, continuing to the\nbirth of Achilles; his youth, described by Statius Papinius; his warlike\nachievements, celebrated by Homer; his death and obsequies, written by Ovid\nand Quintus Calaber; and ending at the appearance of his ghost, and\nPolyxena's sacrifice, rehearsed by Euripides.\n\nHe also caused to be bought three fine young unicorns; one of them a male\nof a chestnut colour, and two grey dappled females; also a tarand, whom he\nbought of a Scythian of the Gelones' country.\n\nA tarand is an animal as big as a bullock, having a head like a stag, or a\nlittle bigger, two stately horns with large branches, cloven feet, hair\nlong like that of a furred Muscovite, I mean a bear, and a skin almost as\nhard as steel armour.  The Scythian said that there are but few tarands to\nbe found in Scythia, because it varieth its colour according to the\ndiversity of the places where it grazes and abides, and represents the\ncolour of the grass, plants, trees, shrubs, flowers, meadows, rocks, and\ngenerally of all things near which it comes.  It hath this common with the\nsea-pulp, or polypus, with the thoes, with the wolves of India, and with\nthe chameleon, which is a kind of a lizard so wonderful that Democritus\nhath written a whole book of its figure and anatomy, as also of its virtue\nand propriety in magic.  This I can affirm, that I have seen it change its\ncolour, not only at the approach of things that have a colour, but by its\nown voluntary impulse, according to its fear or other affections; as, for\nexample, upon a green carpet I have certainly seen it become green; but\nhaving remained there some time, it turned yellow, blue, tanned, and purple\nin course, in the same manner as you see a turkey-cock's comb change colour\naccording to its passions.  But what we find most surprising in this tarand\nis, that not only its face and skin, but also its hair could take whatever\ncolour was about it.  Near Panurge, with his kersey coat, its hair used to\nturn grey; near Pantagruel, with his scarlet mantle, its hair and skin grew\nred; near the pilot, dressed after the fashion of the Isiacs of Anubis in\nEgypt, its hair seemed all white, which two last colours the chameleons\ncannot borrow.\n\nWhen the creature was free from any fear or affection, the colour of its\nhair was just such as you see that of the asses of Meung.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.III.\n\nHow Pantagruel received a letter from his father Gargantua, and of the\nstrange way to have speedy news from far distant places.\n\nWhile Pantagruel was taken up with the purchase of those foreign animals,\nthe noise of ten guns and culverins, together with a loud and joyful cheer\nof all the fleet, was heard from the mole.  Pantagruel looked towards the\nhaven, and perceived that this was occasioned by the arrival of one of his\nfather Gargantua's celoces, or advice-boats, named the Chelidonia; because\non the stern of it was carved in Corinthian brass a sea-swallow, which is a\nfish as large as a dare-fish of Loire, all flesh, without scale, with\ncartilaginous wings (like a bat's) very long and broad, by the means of\nwhich I have seen them fly about three fathom above water, about a\nbow-shot.  At Marseilles 'tis called lendole.  And indeed that ship was as\nlight as a swallow, so that it rather seemed to fly on the sea than to\nsail.  Malicorne, Gargantua's esquire carver, was come in her, being sent\nexpressly by his master to have an account of his son's health and\ncircumstances, and to bring him credentials.  When Malicorne had saluted\nPantagruel, before the prince opened the letters, the first thing he said\nto him was, Have you here the Gozal, the heavenly messenger?  Yes, sir,\nsaid he; here it is swaddled up in this basket.  It was a grey pigeon,\ntaken out of Gargantua's dove-house, whose young ones were just hatched\nwhen the advice-boat was going off.\n\nIf any ill fortune had befallen Pantagruel, he would have fastened some\nblack ribbon to his feet; but because all things had succeeded happily\nhitherto, having caused it to be undressed, he tied to its feet a white\nribbon, and without any further delay let it loose.  The pigeon presently\nflew away, cutting the air with an incredible speed, as you know that there\nis no flight like a pigeon's, especially when it hath eggs or young ones,\nthrough the extreme care which nature hath fixed in it to relieve and be\nwith its young; insomuch that in less than two hours it compassed in the\nair the long tract which the advice-boat, with all her diligence, with oars\nand sails, and a fair wind, could not go through in less than three days\nand three nights; and was seen as it went into the dove-house in its nest.\nWhereupon Gargantua, hearing that it had the white ribbon on, was joyful\nand secure of his son's welfare.  This was the custom of the noble\nGargantua and Pantagruel when they would have speedy news of something of\ngreat concern; as the event of some battle, either by sea or land; the\nsurrendering or holding out of some strong place; the determination of some\ndifference of moment; the safe or unhappy delivery of some queen or great\nlady; the death or recovery of their sick friends or allies, and so forth.\nThey used to take the gozal, and had it carried from one to another by the\npost, to the places whence they desired to have news.  The gozal, bearing\neither a black or white ribbon, according to the occurrences and accidents,\nused to remove their doubts at its return, making in the space of one hour\nmore way through the air than thirty postboys could have done in one\nnatural day.  May not this be said to redeem and gain time with a\nvengeance, think you?  For the like service, therefore, you may believe as\na most true thing that in the dove-houses of their farms there were to be\nfound all the year long store of pigeons hatching eggs or rearing their\nyoung.  Which may be easily done in aviaries and voleries by the help of\nsaltpetre and the sacred herb vervain.\n\nThe gozal being let fly, Pantagruel perused his father Gargantua's letter,\nthe contents of which were as followeth:\n\nMy dearest Son,--The affection that naturally a father bears a beloved son\nis so much increased in me by reflecting on the particular gifts which by\nthe divine goodness have been heaped on thee, that since thy departure it\nhath often banished all other thoughts out of my mind, leaving my heart\nwholly possessed with fear lest some misfortune has attended thy voyage;\nfor thou knowest that fear was ever the attendant of true and sincere love.\nNow because, as Hesiod saith, A good beginning of anything is the half of\nit; or, Well begun's half done, according to the old saying; to free my\nmind from this anxiety I have expressly despatched Malicorne, that he may\ngive me a true account of thy health at the beginning of thy voyage.  For\nif it be good, and such as I wish it, I shall easily foresee the rest.\n\nI have met with some diverting books, which the bearer will deliver thee;\nthou mayest read them when thou wantest to unbend and ease thy mind from\nthy better studies.  He will also give thee at large the news at court.\nThe peace of the Lord be with thee.  Remember me to Panurge, Friar John,\nEpistemon, Xenomanes, Gymnast, and thy other principal domestics.  Dated at\nour paternal seat, this 13th day of June.\n\n            Thy father and friend, Gargantua.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.IV.\n\nHow Pantagruel writ to his father Gargantua, and sent him several\ncuriosities.\n\nPantagruel, having perused the letter, had a long conference with the\nesquire Malicorne; insomuch that Panurge, at last interrupting them, asked\nhim, Pray, sir, when do you design to drink?  When shall we drink?  When\nshall the worshipful esquire drink?  What a devil! have you not talked long\nenough to drink?  It is a good motion, answered Pantagruel:  go, get us\nsomething ready at the next inn; I think 'tis the Centaur.  In the meantime\nhe writ to Gargantua as followeth, to be sent by the aforesaid esquire:\n\nMost gracious Father,--As our senses and animal faculties are more\ndiscomposed at the news of events unexpected, though desired (even to an\nimmediate dissolution of the soul from the body), than if those accidents\nhad been foreseen, so the coming of Malicorne hath much surprised and\ndisordered me.  For I had no hopes to see any of your servants, or to hear\nfrom you, before I had finished our voyage; and contented myself with the\ndear remembrance of your august majesty, deeply impressed in the hindmost\nventricle of my brain, often representing you to my mind.\n\nBut since you have made me happy beyond expectation by the perusal of your\ngracious letter, and the faith I have in your esquire hath revived my\nspirits by the news of your welfare, I am as it were compelled to do what\nformerly I did freely, that is, first to praise the blessed Redeemer, who\nby his divine goodness preserves you in this long enjoyment of perfect\nhealth; then to return you eternal thanks for the fervent affection which\nyou have for me your most humble son and unprofitable servant.\n\nFormerly a Roman, named Furnius, said to Augustus, who had received his\nfather into favour, and pardoned him after he had sided with Antony, that\nby that action the emperor had reduced him to this extremity, that for want\nof power to be grateful, both while he lived and after it, he should be\nobliged to be taxed with ingratitude.  So I may say, that the excess of\nyour fatherly affection drives me into such a strait, that I shall be\nforced to live and die ungrateful; unless that crime be redressed by the\nsentence of the Stoics, who say that there are three parts in a benefit,\nthe one of the giver, the other of the receiver, the third of the\nremunerator; and that the receiver rewards the giver when he freely\nreceives the benefit and always remembers it; as, on the contrary, that man\nis most ungrateful who despises and forgets a benefit.  Therefore, being\noverwhelmed with infinite favours, all proceeding from your extreme\ngoodness, and on the other side wholly incapable of making the smallest\nreturn, I hope at least to free myself from the imputation of ingratitude,\nsince they can never be blotted out of my mind; and my tongue shall never\ncease to own that to thank you as I ought transcends my capacity.\n\nAs for us, I have this assurance in the Lord's mercy and help, that the end\nof our voyage will be answerable to its beginning, and so it will be\nentirely performed in health and mirth.  I will not fail to set down in a\njournal a full account of our navigation, that at our return you may have\nan exact relation of the whole.\n\nI have found here a Scythian tarand, an animal strange and wonderful for\nthe variations of colour on its skin and hair, according to the distinction\nof neighbouring things; it is as tractable and easily kept as a lamb.  Be\npleased to accept of it.\n\nI also send you three young unicorns, which are the tamest of creatures.\n\nI have conferred with the esquire, and taught him how they must be fed.\nThese cannot graze on the ground by reason of the long horn on their\nforehead, but are forced to browse on fruit trees, or on proper racks, or\nto be fed by hand, with herbs, sheaves, apples, pears, barley, rye, and\nother fruits and roots, being placed before them.\n\nI am amazed that ancient writers should report them to be so wild, furious,\nand dangerous, and never seen alive; far from it, you will find that they\nare the mildest things in the world, provided they are not maliciously\noffended.  Likewise I send you the life and deeds of Achilles in curious\ntapestry; assuring you whatever rarities of animals, plants, birds, or\nprecious stones, and others, I shall be able to find and purchase in our\ntravels, shall be brought to you, God willing, whom I beseech, by his\nblessed grace, to preserve you.\n\nFrom Medamothy, this 15th of June.  Panurge, Friar John, Epistemon,\nZenomanes, Gymnast, Eusthenes, Rhizotome, and Carpalin, having most humbly\nkissed your hand, return your salute a thousand times.\n\n       Your most dutiful son and servant, Pantagruel.\n\nWhile Pantagruel was writing this letter, Malicorne was made welcome by all\nwith a thousand goodly good-morrows and how-d'ye's; they clung about him so\nthat I cannot tell you how much they made of him, how many humble services,\nhow many from my love and to my love were sent with him.  Pantagruel,\nhaving writ his letters, sat down at table with him, and afterwards\npresented him with a large chain of gold, weighing eight hundred crowns,\nbetween whose septenary links some large diamonds, rubies, emeralds,\nturquoise stones, and unions were alternately set in.  To each of his\nbark's crew he ordered to be given five hundred crowns.  To Gargantua, his\nfather, he sent the tarand covered with a cloth of satin, brocaded with\ngold, and the tapestry containing the life and deeds of Achilles, with the\nthree unicorns in friezed cloth of gold trappings; and so they left\nMedamothy--Malicorne to return to Gargantua, Pantagruel to proceed in his\nvoyage, during which Epistemon read to him the books which the esquire had\nbrought, and because he found them jovial and pleasant, I shall give you an\naccount of them, if you earnestly desire it.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.V.\n\nHow Pantagruel met a ship with passengers returning from Lanternland.\n\nOn the fifth day we began already to wind by little and little about the\npole; going still farther from the equinoctial line, we discovered a\nmerchant-man to the windward of us.  The joy for this was not small on both\nsides; we in hopes to hear news from sea, and those in the merchant-man\nfrom land.  So we bore upon 'em, and coming up with them we hailed them;\nand finding them to be Frenchmen of Xaintonge, backed our sails and lay by\nto talk to them.  Pantagruel heard that they came from Lanternland; which\nadded to his joy, and that of the whole fleet.  We inquired about the state\nof that country, and the way of living of the Lanterns; and were told that\nabout the latter end of the following July was the time prefixed for the\nmeeting of the general chapter of the Lanterns; and that if we arrived\nthere at that time, as we might easily, we should see a handsome,\nhonourable, and jolly company of Lanterns; and that great preparations were\nmaking, as if they intended to lanternize there to the purpose.  We were\ntold also that if we touched at the great kingdom of Gebarim, we should be\nhonourably received and treated by the sovereign of that country, King\nOhabe, who, as well as all his subjects, speaks Touraine French.\n\nWhile we were listening to these news, Panurge fell out with one Dingdong,\na drover or sheep-merchant of Taillebourg.  The occasion of the fray was\nthus:\n\nThis same Dingdong, seeing Panurge without a codpiece, with his spectacles\nfastened to his cap, said to one of his comrades, Prithee, look, is there\nnot a fine medal of a cuckold?  Panurge, by reason of his spectacles, as\nyou may well think, heard more plainly by half with his ears than usually;\nwhich caused him (hearing this) to say to the saucy dealer in mutton, in a\nkind of a pet:\n\nHow the devil should I be one of the hornified fraternity, since I am not\nyet a brother of the marriage-noose, as thou art; as I guess by thy\nill-favoured phiz?\n\nYea, verily, quoth the grazier, I am married, and would not be otherwise\nfor all the pairs of spectacles in Europe; nay, not for all the magnifying\ngimcracks in Africa; for I have got me the cleverest, prettiest,\nhandsomest, properest, neatest, tightest, honestest, and soberest piece of\nwoman's flesh for my wife that is in all the whole country of Xaintonge;\nI'll say that for her, and a fart for all the rest.  I bring her home a\nfine eleven-inch-long branch of red coral for her Christmas-box.  What hast\nthou to do with it? what's that to thee? who art thou? whence comest thou,\nO dark lantern of Antichrist?  Answer, if thou art of God.  I ask thee, by\nthe way of question, said Panurge to him very seriously, if with the\nconsent and countenance of all the elements, I had gingumbobbed, codpieced,\nand thumpthumpriggledtickledtwiddled thy so clever, so pretty, so handsome,\nso proper, so neat, so tight, so honest, and so sober female importance,\ninsomuch that the stiff deity that has no forecast, Priapus (who dwells\nhere at liberty, all subjection of fastened codpieces, or bolts, bars, and\nlocks, abdicated), remained sticking in her natural Christmas-box in such a\nlamentable manner that it were never to come out, but eternally should\nstick there unless thou didst pull it out with thy teeth; what wouldst thou\ndo?  Wouldst thou everlastingly leave it there, or wouldst thou pluck it\nout with thy grinders?  Answer me, O thou ram of Mahomet, since thou art\none of the devil's gang.  I would, replied the sheepmonger, take thee such\na woundy cut on this spectacle-bearing lug of thine with my trusty bilbo as\nwould smite thee dead as a herring.  Thus, having taken pepper in the nose,\nhe was lugging out his sword, but, alas!--cursed cows have short horns,--it\nstuck in the scabbard; as you know that at sea cold iron will easily take\nrust by reason of the excessive and nitrous moisture.  Panurge, so smitten\nwith terror that his heart sunk down to his midriff, scoured off to\nPantagruel for help; but Friar John laid hand on his flashing scimitar that\nwas new ground, and would certainly have despatched Dingdong to rights, had\nnot the skipper and some of his passengers beseeched Pantagruel not to\nsuffer such an outrage to be committed on board his ship.  So the matter\nwas made up, and Panurge and his antagonist shaked fists, and drank in\ncourse to one another in token of a perfect reconciliation.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.VI.\n\nHow, the fray being over, Panurge cheapened one of Dingdong's sheep.\n\nThis quarrel being hushed, Panurge tipped the wink upon Epistemon and Friar\nJohn, and taking them aside, Stand at some distance out of the way, said\nhe, and take your share of the following scene of mirth.  You shall have\nrare sport anon, if my cake be not dough, and my plot do but take.  Then\naddressing himself to the drover, he took off to him a bumper of good\nlantern wine.  The other pledged him briskly and courteously.  This done,\nPanurge earnestly entreated him to sell him one of his sheep.\n\nBut the other answered him, Is it come to that, friend and neighbour?\nWould you put tricks upon travellers?  Alas, how finely you love to play\nupon poor folk!  Nay, you seem a rare chapman, that's the truth on't.  Oh,\nwhat a mighty sheep-merchant you are!  In good faith, you look liker one of\nthe diving trade than a buyer of sheep.  Adzookers, what a blessing it\nwould be to have one's purse well lined with chink near your worship at a\ntripe-house when it begins to thaw!  Humph, humph, did not we know you\nwell, you might serve one a slippery trick!  Pray do but see, good people,\nwhat a mighty conjuror the fellow would be reckoned.  Patience, said\nPanurge; but waiving that, be so kind as to sell me one of your sheep.\nCome, how much?  What do you mean, master of mine? answered the other.\nThey are long-wool sheep; from these did Jason take his golden fleece.  The\ngold of the house of Burgundy was drawn from them.  Zwoons, man, they are\noriental sheep, topping sheep, fatted sheep, sheep of quality.  Be it so,\nsaid Panurge; but sell me one of them, I beseech you; and that for a cause,\npaying you ready money upon the nail, in good and lawful occidental current\ncash.  Wilt say how much?  Friend, neighbour, answered the seller of\nmutton, hark ye me a little, on the ear.\n\n  Panurge.  On which side you please; I hear you.\n\n  Dingdong.  You are going to Lanternland, they say.\n\n  Panurge.  Yea, verily.\n\n  Dingdong.  To see fashions?\n\n  Panurge.  Even so.\n\n  Dingdong.  And be merry?\n\n  Panurge.  And be merry.\n\n  Dingdong.  Your name is, as I take it, Robin Mutton?\n\n  Panurge.  As you please for that, sweet sir.\n\n  Dingdong.  Nay, without offence.\n\n  Panurge.  So I would have it.\n\n  Dingdong.  You are, as I take it, the king's jester; aren't you?\n\n  Panurge.  Ay, ay, anything.\n\n  Dingdong.  Give me your hand--humph, humph, you go to see fashions, you\nare the king's jester, your name is Robin Mutton!  Do you see this same\nram?  His name, too, is Robin.  Here, Robin, Robin, Robin!  Baea, baea,\nbaea.  Hath he not a rare voice?\n\n  Panurge.  Ay, marry has he, a very fine and harmonious voice.\n\n  Dingdong.  Well, this bargain shall be made between you and me, friend\nand neighbour; we will get a pair of scales, then you Robin Mutton shall be\nput into one of them, and Tup Robin into the other.  Now I will hold you a\npeck of Busch oysters that in weight, value, and price he shall outdo you,\nand you shall be found light in the very numerical manner as when you shall\nbe hanged and suspended.\n\nPatience, said Panurge; but you would do much for me and your whole\nposterity if you would chaffer with me for him, or some other of his\ninferiors.  I beg it of you; good your worship, be so kind.  Hark ye,\nfriend of mine, answered the other; with the fleece of these your fine\nRouen cloth is to be made; your Leominster superfine wool is mine arse to\nit; mere flock in comparison.  Of their skins the best cordovan will be\nmade, which shall be sold for Turkey and Montelimart, or for Spanish\nleather at least.  Of the guts shall be made fiddle and harp strings that\nwill sell as dear as if they came from Munican or Aquileia.  What do you\nthink on't, hah?  If you please, sell me one of them, said Panurge, and I\nwill be yours for ever.  Look, here's ready cash.  What's the price?  This\nhe said exhibiting his purse stuffed with new Henricuses.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.VII.\n\nWhich if you read you'll find how Panurge bargained with Dingdong.\n\nNeighbour, my friend, answered Dingdong, they are meat for none but kings\nand princes; their flesh is so delicate, so savoury, and so dainty that one\nwould swear it melted in the mouth.  I bring them out of a country where\nthe very hogs, God be with us, live on nothing but myrobolans.  The sows in\nthe styes when they lie-in (saving the honour of this good company) are fed\nonly with orange-flowers.  But, said Panurge, drive a bargain with me for\none of them, and I will pay you for't like a king, upon the honest word of\na true Trojan; come, come, what do you ask?  Not so fast, Robin, answered\nthe trader; these sheep are lineally descended from the very family of the\nram that wafted Phryxus and Helle over the sea since called the Hellespont.\nA pox on't, said Panurge, you are clericus vel addiscens!  Ita is a\ncabbage, and vere a leek, answered the merchant.  But, rr, rrr, rrrr,\nrrrrr, hoh Robin, rr, rrrrrrr, you don't understand that gibberish, do you?\nNow I think on't, over all the fields where they piss, corn grows as fast\nas if the Lord had pissed there; they need neither be tilled nor dunged.\nBesides, man, your chemists extract the best saltpetre in the world out of\ntheir urine.  Nay, with their very dung (with reverence be it spoken) the\ndoctors in our country make pills that cure seventy-eight kinds of\ndiseases, the least of which is the evil of St. Eutropius of Xaintes, from\nwhich, good Lord, deliver us!  Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my\nfriend?  The truth is, they cost me money, that they do.  Cost what they\nwill, cried Panurge, trade with me for one of them, paying you well.  Our\nfriend, quoth the quacklike sheepman, do but mind the wonders of nature\nthat are found in those animals, even in a member which one would think\nwere of no use.  Take me but these horns, and bray them a little with an\niron pestle, or with an andiron, which you please, it is all one to me;\nthen bury them wherever you will, provided it be where the sun may shine,\nand water them frequently; in a few months I'll engage you will have the\nbest asparagus in the world, not even excepting those of Ravenna.  Now,\ncome and tell me whether the horns of your other knights of the bull's\nfeather have such a virtue and wonderful propriety?\n\nPatience, said Panurge.  I don't know whether you be a scholar or no,\npursued Dingdong; I have seen a world of scholars, I say great scholars,\nthat were cuckolds, I'll assure you.  But hark you me, if you were a\nscholar, you should know that in the most inferior members of those\nanimals, which are the feet, there is a bone, which is the heel, the\nastragalus, if you will have it so, wherewith, and with that of no other\ncreature breathing, except the Indian ass and the dorcades of Libya, they\nused in old times to play at the royal game of dice, whereat Augustus the\nemperor won above fifty thousand crowns one evening.  Now such cuckolds as\nyou will be hanged ere you get half so much at it.  Patience, said Panurge;\nbut let us despatch.  And when, my friend and neighbour, continued the\ncanting sheepseller, shall I have duly praised the inward members, the\nshoulders, the legs, the knuckles, the neck, the breast, the liver, the\nspleen, the tripes, the kidneys, the bladder, wherewith they make\nfootballs; the ribs, which serve in Pigmyland to make little crossbows to\npelt the cranes with cherry-stones; the head, which with a little brimstone\nserves to make a miraculous decoction to loosen and ease the belly of\ncostive dogs?  A turd on't, said the skipper to his preaching passenger,\nwhat a fiddle-faddle have we here?  There is too long a lecture by half:\nsell him if thou wilt; if thou won't, don't let the man lose more time.  I\nhate a gibble-gabble and a rimble-ramble talk.  I am for a man of brevity.\nI will, for your sake, replied the holder-forth; but then he shall give me\nthree livres, French money, for each pick and choose.  It is a woundy\nprice, cried Panurge; in our country I could have five, nay six, for the\nmoney; see that you do not overreach me, master.  You are not the first man\nwhom I have known to have fallen, even sometimes to the endangering, if not\nbreaking, of his own neck, for endeavouring to rise all at once.  A murrain\nseize thee for a blockheaded booby, cried the angry seller of sheep; by the\nworthy vow of Our Lady of Charroux, the worst in this flock is four times\nbetter than those which the Coraxians in Tuditania, a country of Spain,\nused to sell for a gold talent each; and how much dost thou think, thou\nHibernian fool, that a talent of gold was worth?  Sweet sir, you fall into\na passion, I see, returned Panurge; well, hold, here is your money.\nPanurge, having paid his money, chose him out of all the flock a fine\ntopping ram; and as he was hauling it along, crying out and bleating, all\nthe rest, hearing and bleating in concert, stared to see whither their\nbrother-ram should be carried.  In the meanwhile the drover was saying to\nhis shepherds:  Ah! how well the knave could choose him out a ram; the\nwhoreson has skill in cattle.  On my honest word, I reserved that very\npiece of flesh for the Lord of Cancale, well knowing his disposition; for\nthe good man is naturally overjoyed when he holds a good-sized handsome\nshoulder of mutton, instead of a left-handed racket, in one hand, with a\ngood sharp carver in the other.  God wot, how he belabours himself then.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.VIII.\n\nHow Panurge caused Dingdong and his sheep to be drowned in the sea.\n\nOn a sudden, you would wonder how the thing was so soon done--for my part I\ncannot tell you, for I had not leisure to mind it--our friend Panurge,\nwithout any further tittle-tattle, throws you his ram overboard into the\nmiddle of the sea, bleating and making a sad noise.  Upon this all the\nother sheep in the ship, crying and bleating in the same tone, made all the\nhaste they could to leap nimbly into the sea, one after another; and great\nwas the throng who should leap in first after their leader.  It was\nimpossible to hinder them; for you know that it is the nature of sheep\nalways to follow the first wheresoever it goes; which makes Aristotle, lib.\n9. De. Hist. Animal., mark them for the most silly and foolish animals in\nthe world.  Dingdong, at his wits' end, and stark staring mad, as a man who\nsaw his sheep destroy and drown themselves before his face, strove to\nhinder and keep them back with might and main; but all in vain:  they all\none after t'other frisked and jumped into the sea, and were lost.  At last\nhe laid hold on a huge sturdy one by the fleece, upon the deck of the ship,\nhoping to keep it back, and so save that and the rest; but the ram was so\nstrong that it proved too hard for him, and carried its master into the\nherring pond in spite of his teeth--where it is supposed he drank somewhat\nmore than his fill, so that he was drowned--in the same manner as one-eyed\nPolyphemus' sheep carried out of the den Ulysses and his companions.  The\nlike happened to the shepherds and all their gang, some laying hold on\ntheir beloved tup, this by the horns, t'other by the legs, a third by the\nrump, and others by the fleece; till in fine they were all of them forced\nto sea, and drowned like so many rats.  Panurge, on the gunnel of the ship,\nwith an oar in his hand, not to help them you may swear, but to keep them\nfrom swimming to the ship and saving themselves from drowning, preached and\ncanted to them all the while like any little Friar (Oliver) Maillard, or\nanother Friar John Burgess; laying before them rhetorical commonplaces\nconcerning the miseries of this life and the blessings and felicity of the\nnext; assuring them that the dead were much happier than the living in this\nvale of misery, and promised to erect a stately cenotaph and honorary tomb\nto every one of them on the highest summit of Mount Cenis at his return\nfrom Lanternland; wishing them, nevertheless, in case they were not yet\ndisposed to shake hands with this life, and did not like their salt liquor,\nthey might have the good luck to meet with some kind whale which might set\nthem ashore safe and sound on some blessed land of Gotham, after a famous\nexample.\n\nThe ship being cleared of Dingdong and his tups:  Is there ever another\nsheepish soul left lurking on board? cried Panurge.  Where are those of\nToby Lamb and Robin Ram that sleep while the rest are a-feeding?  Faith, I\ncan't tell myself.  This was an old coaster's trick.  What think'st of it,\nFriar John, hah?  Rarely performed, answered Friar John; only methinks that\nas formerly in war, on the day of battle, a double pay was commonly\npromised the soldiers for that day; for if they overcame, there was enough\nto pay them; and if they lost, it would have been shameful for them to\ndemand it, as the cowardly foresters did after the battle of Cerizoles;\nlikewise, my friend, you ought not to have paid your man, and the money had\nbeen saved.  A fart for the money, said Panurge; have I not had above fifty\nthousand pounds' worth of sport?  Come now, let's be gone; the wind is\nfair.  Hark you me, my friend John; never did man do me a good turn, but I\nreturned, or at least acknowledged it; no, I scorn to be ungrateful; I\nnever was, nor ever will be.  Never did man do me an ill one without rueing\nthe day that he did it, either in this world or the next.  I am not yet so\nmuch a fool neither.  Thou damn'st thyself like any old devil, quoth Friar\nJohn; it is written, Mihi vindictam, &c.  Matter of breviary, mark ye me\n(Motteux adds unnecessarily (by way of explanation), 'that's holy stuff.').\n\n\n\nChapter 4.IX.\n\nHow Pantagruel arrived at the island of Ennasin, and of the strange ways of\nbeing akin in that country.\n\nWe had still the wind at south-south-west, and had been a whole day without\nmaking land.  On the third day, at the flies' uprising (which, you know, is\nsome two or three hours after the sun's), we got sight of a triangular\nisland, very much like Sicily for its form and situation.  It was called\nthe Island of Alliances.\n\nThe people there are much like your carrot-pated Poitevins, save only that\nall of them, men, women, and children, have their noses shaped like an ace\nof clubs.  For that reason the ancient name of the country was Ennasin.\nThey were all akin, as the mayor of the place told us; at least they\nboasted so.\n\nYou people of the other world esteem it a wonderful thing that, out of the\nfamily of the Fabii at Rome, on a certain day, which was the 13th of\nFebruary, at a certain gate, which was the Porta Carmentalis, since named\nScelerata, formerly situated at the foot of the Capitol, between the\nTarpeian rock and the Tiber, marched out against the Veientes of Etruria\nthree hundred and six men bearing arms, all related to each other, with\nfive thousand other soldiers, every one of them their vassals, who were all\nslain near the river Cremera, that comes out of the lake of Beccano.  Now\nfrom this same country of Ennasin, in case of need, above three hundred\nthousand, all relations and of one family, might march out.  Their degrees\nof consanguinity and alliance are very strange; for being thus akin and\nallied to one another, we found that none was either father or mother,\nbrother or sister, uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, son-in-law or\ndaughter-in-law, godfather or godmother, to the other; unless, truly, a tall\nflat-nosed old fellow, who, as I perceived, called a little shitten-arsed\ngirl of three or four years old, father, and the child called him daughter.\n\nTheir distinction of degrees of kindred was thus:  a man used to call a\nwoman, my lean bit; the woman called him, my porpoise.  Those, said Friar\nJohn, must needs stink damnably of fish when they have rubbed their bacon\none with the other.  One, smiling on a young buxom baggage, said, Good\nmorrow, dear currycomb.  She, to return him his civility, said, The like to\nyou, my steed.  Ha! ha! ha! said Panurge, that is pretty well, in faith;\nfor indeed it stands her in good stead to currycomb this steed.  Another\ngreeted his buttock with a Farewell, my case.  She replied, Adieu, trial.\nBy St. Winifred's placket, cried Gymnast, this case has been often tried.\nAnother asked a she-friend of his, How is it, hatchet?  She answered him,\nAt your service, dear helve.  Odds belly, saith Carpalin, this helve and\nthis hatchet are well matched.  As we went on, I saw one who, calling his\nshe-relation, styled her my crumb, and she called him, my crust.\n\nQuoth one to a brisk, plump, juicy female, I am glad to see you, dear tap.\nSo am I to find you so merry, sweet spiggot, replied she.  One called a\nwench, his shovel; she called him, her peal:  one named his, my slipper;\nand she, my foot:  another, my boot; she, my shasoon.\n\nIn the same degree of kindred, one called his, my butter; she called him,\nmy eggs; and they were akin just like a dish of buttered eggs.  I heard one\ncall his, my tripe, and she him, my faggot.  Now I could not, for the\nheart's blood of me, pick out or discover what parentage, alliance,\naffinity, or consanguinity was between them, with reference to our custom;\nonly they told us that she was faggot's tripe.  (Tripe de fagot means the\nsmallest sticks in a faggot.)  Another, complimenting his convenient, said,\nYours, my shell; she replied, I was yours before, sweet oyster.  I reckon,\nsaid Carpalin, she hath gutted his oyster.  Another long-shanked ugly\nrogue, mounted on a pair of high-heeled wooden slippers, meeting a\nstrapping, fusty, squabbed dowdy, says he to her, How is't my top?  She was\nshort upon him, and arrogantly replied, Never the better for you, my whip.\nBy St. Antony's hog, said Xenomanes, I believe so; for how can this whip be\nsufficient to lash this top?\n\nA college professor, well provided with cod, and powdered and prinked up,\nhaving a while discoursed with a great lady, taking his leave with these\nwords, Thank you, sweetmeat; she cried, There needs no thanks, sour-sauce.\nSaith Pantagruel, This is not altogether incongruous, for sweet meat must\nhave sour sauce.  A wooden loggerhead said to a young wench, It is long\nsince I saw you, bag; All the better, cried she, pipe.  Set them together,\nsaid Panurge, then blow in their arses, it will be a bagpipe.  We saw,\nafter that, a diminutive humpbacked gallant, pretty near us, taking leave\nof a she-relation of his, thus:  Fare thee well, friend hole; she\nreparteed, Save thee, friend peg.  Quoth Friar John, What could they say\nmore, were he all peg and she all hole?  But now would I give something to\nknow if every cranny of the hole can be stopped up with that same peg.\n\nA bawdy bachelor, talking with an old trout, was saying, Remember, rusty\ngun.  I will not fail, said she, scourer.  Do you reckon these two to be\nakin? said Pantagruel to the mayor.  I rather take them to be foes.  In our\ncountry a woman would take this as a mortal affront.  Good people of\nt'other world, replied the mayor, you have few such and so near relations\nas this gun and scourer are to one another; for they both come out of one\nshop.  What, was the shop their mother? quoth Panurge.  What mother, said\nthe mayor, does the man mean?  That must be some of your world's affinity;\nwe have here neither father nor mother.  Your little paltry fellows that\nlive on t'other side the water, poor rogues, booted with wisps of hay, may\nindeed have such; but we scorn it.  The good Pantagruel stood gazing and\nlistening; but at those words he had like to have lost all patience. (Here\nMotteux adds an aside--'os kai nun o Ermeneutes.  P.M.').\n\nHaving very exactly viewed the situation of the island and the way of\nliving of the Enassed nation, we went to take a cup of the creature at a\ntavern, where there happened to be a wedding after the manner of the\ncountry.  Bating that shocking custom, there was special good cheer.\n\nWhile we were there, a pleasant match was struck up betwixt a female called\nPear (a tight thing, as we thought, but by some, who knew better things,\nsaid to be quaggy and flabby), and a young soft male, called Cheese,\nsomewhat sandy.  (Many such matches have been, and they were formerly much\ncommended.)  In our country we say, Il ne fut onques tel mariage, qu'est de\nla poire et du fromage; there is no match like that made between the pear\nand the cheese; and in many other places good store of such bargains have\nbeen driven.  Besides, when the women are at their last prayers, it is to\nthis day a noted saying, that after cheese comes nothing.\n\nIn another room I saw them marrying an old greasy boot to a young pliable\nbuskin.  Pantagruel was told that young buskin took old boot to have and to\nhold because she was of special leather, in good case, and waxed, seared,\nliquored, and greased to the purpose, even though it had been for the\nfisherman that went to bed with his boots on.  In another room below, I saw\na young brogue taking a young slipper for better for worse; which, they\ntold us, was neither for the sake of her piety, parts, or person, but for\nthe fourth comprehensive p, portion; the spankers, spur-royals,\nrose-nobles, and other coriander seed with which she was quilted all over.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.X.\n\nHow Pantagruel went ashore at the island of Chely, where he saw King St.\nPanigon.\n\nWe sailed right before the wind, which we had at west, leaving those odd\nalliancers with their ace-of-clubs snouts, and having taken height by the\nsun, stood in for Chely, a large, fruitful, wealthy, and well-peopled\nisland.  King St. Panigon, first of the name, reigned there, and, attended\nby the princes his sons and the nobles of his court, came as far as the\nport to receive Pantagruel, and conducted him to his palace; near the gate\nof which the queen, attended by the princesses her daughters and the court\nladies, received us.  Panigon directed her and all her retinue to salute\nPantagruel and his men with a kiss; for such was the civil custom of the\ncountry; and they were all fairly bussed accordingly, except Friar John,\nwho stepped aside and sneaked off among the king's officers.  Panigon used\nall the entreaties imaginable to persuade Pantagruel to tarry there that\nday and the next; but he would needs be gone, and excused himself upon the\nopportunity of wind and weather, which, being oftener desired than enjoyed,\nought not to be neglected when it comes.  Panigon, having heard these\nreasons, let us go, but first made us take off some five-and-twenty or\nthirty bumpers each.\n\nPantagruel, returning to the port, missed Friar John, and asked why he was\nnot with the rest of the company.  Panurge could not tell how to excuse\nhim, and would have gone back to the palace to call him, when Friar John\novertook them, and merrily cried, Long live the noble Panigon!  As I love\nmy belly, he minds good eating, and keeps a noble house and a dainty\nkitchen.  I have been there, boys.  Everything goes about by dozens.  I was\nin good hopes to have stuffed my puddings there like a monk.  What! always\nin a kitchen, friend? said Pantagruel.  By the belly of St. Cramcapon,\nquoth the friar, I understand the customs and ceremonies which are used\nthere much better than all the formal stuff, antique postures, and\nnonsensical fiddle-faddle that must be used with those women, magni magna,\nshittencumshita, cringes, grimaces, scrapes, bows, and congees; double\nhonours this way, triple salutes that way, the embrace, the grasp, the\nsqueeze, the hug, the leer, the smack, baso las manos de vostra merce, de\nvostra maesta.  You are most tarabin, tarabas, Stront; that's downright\nDutch.  Why all this ado?  I don't say but a man might be for a bit by the\nbye and away, to be doing as well as his neighbours; but this little nasty\ncringing and courtesying made me as mad as any March devil.  You talk of\nkissing ladies; by the worthy and sacred frock I wear, I seldom venture\nupon it, lest I be served as was the Lord of Guyercharois.  What was it?\nsaid Pantagruel; I know him.  He is one of the best friends I have.\n\nHe was invited to a sumptuous feast, said Friar John, by a relation and\nneighbour of his, together with all the gentlemen and ladies in the\nneighbourhood.  Now some of the latter expecting his coming, dressed the\npages in women's clothes, and finified them like any babies; then ordered\nthem to meet my lord at his coming near the drawbridge.  So the\ncomplimenting monsieur came, and there kissed the petticoated lads with\ngreat formality.  At last the ladies, who minded passages in the gallery,\nburst out with laughing, and made signs to the pages to take off their\ndress; which the good lord having observed, the devil a bit he durst make\nup to the true ladies to kiss them, but said, that since they had disguised\nthe pages, by his great grandfather's helmet, these were certainly the very\nfootmen and grooms still more cunningly disguised.  Odds fish, da jurandi,\nwhy do not we rather remove our humanities into some good warm kitchen of\nGod, that noble laboratory, and there admire the turning of the spits, the\nharmonious rattling of the jacks and fenders, criticise on the position of\nthe lard, the temperature of the pottages, the preparation for the dessert,\nand the order of the wine service?  Beati immaculati in via.  Matter of\nbreviary, my masters.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XI.\n\nWhy monks love to be in kitchens.\n\nThis, said Epistemon, is spoke like a true monk; I mean like a right\nmonking monk, not a bemonked monastical monkling.  Truly you put me in mind\nof some passages that happened at Florence, some twenty years ago, in a\ncompany of studious travellers, fond of visiting the learned, and seeing\nthe antiquities of Italy, among whom I was.  As we viewed the situation and\nbeauty of Florence, the structure of the dome, the magnificence of the\nchurches and palaces, we strove to outdo one another in giving them their\ndue; when a certain monk of Amiens, Bernard Lardon by name, quite angry,\nscandalized, and out of all patience, told us, I don't know what the devil\nyou can find in this same town, that is so much cried up; for my part I\nhave looked and pored and stared as well as the best of you; I think my\neyesight is as clear as another body's, and what can one see after all?\nThere are fine houses, indeed and that's all.  But the cage does not feed\nthe birds.  God and Monsieur St. Bernard, our good patron, be with us! in\nall this same town I have not seen one poor lane of roasting cooks; and yet\nI have not a little looked about and sought for so necessary a part of a\ncommonwealth:  ay, and I dare assure you that I have pried up and down with\nthe exactness of an informer; as ready to number, both to the right and\nleft, how many, and on what side, we might find most roasting cooks, as a\nspy would be to reckon the bastions of a town.  Now at Amiens, in four,\nnay, five times less ground than we have trod in our contemplations, I\ncould have shown you above fourteen streets of roasting cooks, most\nancient, savoury, and aromatic.  I cannot imagine what kind of pleasure you\ncan have taken in gazing on the lions and Africans (so methinks you call\ntheir tigers) near the belfry, or in ogling the porcupines and estridges in\nthe Lord Philip Strozzi's palace.  Faith and truth I had rather see a good\nfat goose at the spit.  This porphyry, those marbles are fine; I say\nnothing to the contrary; but our cheesecakes at Amiens are far better in my\nmind.  These ancient statues are well made; I am willing to believe it;\nbut, by St. Ferreol of Abbeville, we have young wenches in our country\nwhich please me better a thousand times.\n\nWhat is the reason, asked Friar John, that monks are always to be found in\nkitchens, and kings, emperors, and popes are never there?  Is there not,\nsaid Rhizotome, some latent virtue and specific propriety hid in the\nkettles and pans, which, as the loadstone attracts iron, draws the monks\nthere, and cannot attract emperors, popes, or kings?  Or is it a natural\ninduction and inclination, fixed in the frocks and cowls, which of itself\nleads and forceth those good religious men into kitchens, whether they will\nor no?  He would speak of forms following matter, as Averroes calls them,\nanswered Epistemon.  Right, said Friar John.\n\nI will not offer to solve this problem, said Pantagruel; for it is somewhat\nticklish, and you can hardly handle it without coming off scurvily; but I\nwill tell you what I have heard.\n\nAntigonus, King of Macedon, one day coming into one of the tents, where his\ncooks used to dress his meat, and finding there poet Antagoras frying a\nconger, and holding the pan himself, merrily asked him, Pray, Mr. Poet, was\nHomer frying congers when he wrote the deeds of Agamemnon?  Antagoras\nreadily answered:  But do you think, sir, that when Agamemnon did them he\nmade it his business to know if any in his camp were frying congers?  The\nking thought it an indecency that a poet should be thus a-frying in a\nkitchen; and the poet let the king know that it was a more indecent thing\nfor a king to be found in such a place.  I'll clap another story upon the\nneck of this, quoth Panurge, and will tell you what Breton Villandry\nanswered one day to the Duke of Guise.\n\nThey were saying that at a certain battle of King Francis against Charles\nthe Fifth, Breton, armed cap-a-pie to the teeth, and mounted like St.\nGeorge, yet sneaked off, and played least in sight during the engagement.\nBlood and oons, answered Breton, I was there, and can prove it easily; nay,\neven where you, my lord, dared not have been.  The duke began to resent\nthis as too rash and saucy; but Breton easily appeased him, and set them\nall a-laughing.  Egad, my lord, quoth he, I kept out of harm's way; I was\nall the while with your page Jack, skulking in a certain place where you\nhad not dared hide your head as I did.  Thus discoursing, they got to their\nships, and left the island of Chely.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XII.\n\nHow Pantagruel passed by the land of Pettifogging, and of the strange way\nof living among the Catchpoles.\n\nSteering our course forwards the next day, we passed through Pettifogging,\na country all blurred and blotted, so that I could hardly tell what to make\non't.  There we saw some pettifoggers and catchpoles, rogues that will hang\ntheir father for a groat.  They neither invited us to eat or drink; but,\nwith a multiplied train of scrapes and cringes, said they were all at our\nservice for the Legem pone.\n\nOne of our droggermen related to Pantagruel their strange way of living,\ndiametrically opposed to that of our modern Romans; for at Rome a world of\nfolks get an honest livelihood by poisoning, drubbing, lambasting,\nstabbing, and murthering; but the catchpoles earn theirs by being thrashed;\nso that if they were long without a tight lambasting, the poor dogs with\ntheir wives and children would be starved.  This is just, quoth Panurge,\nlike those who, as Galen tells us, cannot erect the cavernous nerve towards\nthe equinoctial circle unless they are soundly flogged.  By St. Patrick's\nslipper, whoever should jerk me so, would soon, instead of setting me\nright, throw me off the saddle, in the devil's name.\n\nThe way is this, said the interpreter.  When a monk, levite, close-fisted\nusurer, or lawyer owes a grudge to some neighbouring gentleman, he sends to\nhim one of those catchpoles or apparitors, who nabs, or at least cites him,\nserves a writ or warrant upon him, thumps, abuses, and affronts him\nimpudently by natural instinct, and according to his pious instructions;\ninsomuch, that if the gentleman hath but any guts in his brains, and is not\nmore stupid than a gyrin frog, he will find himself obliged either to apply\na faggot-stick or his sword to the rascal's jobbernowl, give him the gentle\nlash, or make him cut a caper out at the window, by way of correction.\nThis done, Catchpole is rich for four months at least, as if bastinadoes\nwere his real harvest; for the monk, levite, usurer, or lawyer will reward\nhim roundly; and my gentleman must pay him such swingeing damages that his\nacres must bleed for it, and he be in danger of miserably rotting within a\nstone doublet, as if he had struck the king.\n\nQuoth Panurge, I know an excellent remedy against this used by the Lord of\nBasche.  What is it? said Pantagruel.  The Lord of Basche, said Panurge,\nwas a brave, honest, noble-spirited gentleman, who, at his return from the\nlong war in which the Duke of Ferrara, with the help of the French, bravely\ndefended himself against the fury of Pope Julius the Second, was every day\ncited, warned, and prosecuted at the suit and for the sport and fancy of\nthe fat prior of St. Louant.\n\nOne morning, as he was at breakfast with some of his domestics (for he\nloved to be sometimes among them) he sent for one Loire, his baker, and his\nspouse, and for one Oudart, the vicar of his parish, who was also his\nbutler, as the custom was then in France; then said to them before his\ngentlemen and other servants:  You all see how I am daily plagued with\nthese rascally catchpoles.  Truly, if you do not lend me your helping hand,\nI am finally resolved to leave the country, and go fight for the sultan, or\nthe devil, rather than be thus eternally teased.  Therefore, to be rid of\ntheir damned visits, hereafter, when any of them come here, be ready, you\nbaker and your wife, to make your personal appearance in my great hall, in\nyour wedding clothes, as if you were going to be affianced.  Here, take\nthese ducats, which I give you to keep you in a fitting garb.  As for you,\nSir Oudart, be sure you make your personal appearance there in your fine\nsurplice and stole, not forgetting your holy water, as if you were to wed\nthem.  Be you there also, Trudon, said he to his drummer, with your pipe\nand tabor.  The form of matrimony must be read, and the bride kissed; then\nall of you, as the witnesses used to do in this country, shall give one\nanother the remembrance of the wedding, which you know is to be a blow with\nyour fist, bidding the party struck remember the nuptials by that token.\nThis will but make you have the better stomach to your supper; but when you\ncome to the catchpole's turn, thrash him thrice and threefold, as you would\na sheaf of green corn; do not spare him; maul him, drub him, lambast him,\nswinge him off, I pray you.  Here, take these steel gauntlets, covered with\nkid.  Head, back, belly, and sides, give him blows innumerable; he that\ngives him most shall be my best friend.  Fear not to be called to an\naccount about it; I will stand by you; for the blows must seem to be given\nin jest, as it is customary among us at all weddings.\n\nAy, but how shall we know the catchpole? said the man of God.  All sorts of\npeople daily resort to this castle.  I have taken care of that, replied the\nlord.  When some fellow, either on foot, or on a scurvy jade, with a large\nbroad silver ring on his thumb, comes to the door, he is certainly a\ncatchpole; the porter having civilly let him in, shall ring the bell; then\nbe all ready, and come into the hall, to act the tragi-comedy whose plot I\nhave now laid for you.\n\nThat numerical day, as chance would have it, came an old fat ruddy\ncatchpole.  Having knocked at the gate, and then pissed, as most men will\ndo, the porter soon found him out, by his large greasy spatterdashes, his\njaded hollow-flanked mare, his bagful of writs and informations dangling at\nhis girdle, but, above all, by the large silver hoop on his left thumb.\n\nThe porter was civil to him, admitted him in kindly, and rung the bell\nbriskly. As soon as the baker and his wife heard it, they clapped on their\nbest clothes, and made their personal appearance in the hall, keeping their\ngravities like a new-made judge.  The dominie put on his surplice and\nstole, and as he came out of his office, met the catchpole, had him in\nthere, and made him suck his face a good while, while the gauntlets were\ndrawing on all hands; and then told him, You are come just in pudding-time;\nmy lord is in his right cue.  We shall feast like kings anon; here is to be\nswingeing doings; we have a wedding in the house; here, drink and cheer up;\npull away.\n\nWhile these two were at it hand-to-fist, Basche, seeing all his people in\nthe hall in their proper equipage, sends for the vicar.  Oudart comes with\nthe holy-water pot, followed by the catchpole, who, as he came into the\nhall, did not forget to make good store of awkward cringes, and then served\nBasche with a writ.  Basche gave him grimace for grimace, slipped an angel\ninto his mutton-fist, and prayed him to assist at the contract and\nceremony; which he did.  When it was ended, thumps and fisticuffs began to\nfly about among the assistants; but when it came to the catchpole's turn,\nthey all laid on him so unmercifully with their gauntlets that they at last\nsettled him, all stunned and battered, bruised and mortified, with one of\nhis eyes black and blue, eight ribs bruised, his brisket sunk in, his\nomoplates in four quarters, his under jawbone in three pieces; and all this\nin jest, and no harm done.  God wot how the levite belaboured him, hiding\nwithin the long sleeve of his canonical shirt his huge steel gauntlet lined\nwith ermine; for he was a strong-built ball, and an old dog at fisticuffs.\nThe catchpole, all of a bloody tiger-like stripe, with much ado crawled\nhome to L'Isle Bouchart, well pleased and edified, however, with Basche's\nkind reception; and, with the help of the good surgeons of the place, lived\nas long as you would have him.  From that time to this, not a word of the\nbusiness; the memory of it was lost with the sound of the bells that rung\nwith joy at his funeral.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XIII.\n\nHow, like Master Francis Villon, the Lord of Basche commended his servants.\n\nThe catchpole being packed off on blind Sorrel--so he called his one-eyed\nmare--Basche sent for his lady, her women, and all his servants, into the\narbour of his garden; had wine brought, attended with good store of\npasties, hams, fruit, and other table-ammunition, for a nunchion; drank\nwith them joyfully, and then told them this story:\n\nMaster Francis Villon in his old age retired to St. Maxent in Poitou, under\nthe patronage of a good honest abbot of the place.  There to make sport for\nthe mob, he undertook to get the Passion acted, after the way, and in the\ndialect of the country.  The parts being distributed, the play having been\nrehearsed, and the stage prepared, he told the mayor and aldermen that the\nmystery might be ready after Niort fair, and that there only wanted\nproperties and necessaries, but chiefly clothes fit for the parts; so the\nmayor and his brethren took care to get them.\n\nVillon, to dress an old clownish father greybeard, who was to represent God\nthe father, begged of Friar Stephen Tickletoby, sacristan to the Franciscan\nfriars of the place, to lend him a cope and a stole.  Tickletoby refused\nhim, alleging that by their provincial statutes it was rigorously forbidden\nto give or lend anything to players.  Villon replied that the statute\nreached no farther than farces, drolls, antics, loose and dissolute games,\nand that he asked no more than what he had seen allowed at Brussels and\nother places.  Tickletoby notwithstanding peremptorily bid him provide\nhimself elsewhere if he would, and not to hope for anything out of his\nmonastical wardrobe.  Villon gave an account of this to the players, as of\na most abominable action; adding, that God would shortly revenge himself,\nand make an example of Tickletoby.\n\nThe Saturday following he had notice given him that Tickletoby, upon the\nfilly of the convent--so they call a young mare that was never leaped yet\n--was gone a-mumping to St. Ligarius, and would be back about two in the\nafternoon.  Knowing this, he made a cavalcade of his devils of the Passion\nthrough the town.  They were all rigged with wolves', calves', and rams'\nskins, laced and trimmed with sheep's heads, bull's feathers, and large\nkitchen tenterhooks, girt with broad leathern girdles, whereat hanged\ndangling huge cow-bells and horse-bells, which made a horrid din.  Some\nheld in their claws black sticks full of squibs and crackers; others had\nlong lighted pieces of wood, upon which, at the corner of every street,\nthey flung whole handfuls of rosin-dust, that made a terrible fire and\nsmoke.  Having thus led them about, to the great diversion of the mob and\nthe dreadful fear of little children, he finally carried them to an\nentertainment at a summer-house without the gate that leads to St.\nLigarius.\n\nAs they came near to the place, he espied Tickletoby afar off, coming home\nfrom mumping, and told them in macaronic verse:\n\n  Hic est de patria, natus, de gente belistra,\n  Qui solet antiqua bribas portare bisacco. (Motteux reads:\n\n  'Hic est mumpator natus de gente Cucowli,\n  Qui solet antiquo Scrappas portare bisacco.')\n\nA plague on his friarship, said the devils then; the lousy beggar would not\nlend a poor cope to the fatherly father; let us fright him.  Well said,\ncried Villon; but let us hide ourselves till he comes by, and then charge\nhim home briskly with your squibs and burning sticks.  Tickletoby being\ncome to the place, they all rushed on a sudden into the road to meet him,\nand in a frightful manner threw fire from all sides upon him and his filly\nfoal, ringing and tingling their bells, and howling like so many real\ndevils, Hho, hho, hho, hho, brrou, rrou, rrourrs, rrrourrs, hoo, hou, hou\nhho, hho, hhoi.  Friar Stephen, don't we play the devils rarely?  The filly\nwas soon scared out of her seven senses, and began to start, to funk it, to\nsquirt it, to trot it, to fart it, to bound it, to gallop it, to kick it,\nto spurn it, to calcitrate it, to wince it, to frisk it, to leap it, to\ncurvet it, with double jerks, and bum-motions; insomuch that she threw down\nTickletoby, though he held fast by the tree of the pack-saddle with might\nand main.  Now his straps and stirrups were of cord; and on the right side\nhis sandals were so entangled and twisted that he could not for the heart's\nblood of him get out his foot.  Thus he was dragged about by the filly\nthrough the road, scratching his bare breech all the way; she still\nmultiplying her kicks against him, and straying for fear over hedge and\nditch, insomuch that she trepanned his thick skull so that his cockle\nbrains were dashed out near the Osanna or high-cross.  Then his arms fell\nto pieces, one this way and the other that way; and even so were his legs\nserved at the same time.  Then she made a bloody havoc with his puddings;\nand being got to the convent, brought back only his right foot and twisted\nsandal, leaving them to guess what was become of the rest.\n\nVillon, seeing that things had succeeded as he intended, said to his\ndevils, You will act rarely, gentlemen devils, you will act rarely; I dare\nengage you'll top your parts.  I defy the devils of Saumur, Douay,\nMontmorillon, Langez, St. Espain, Angers; nay, by gad, even those of\nPoictiers, for all their bragging and vapouring, to match you.\n\nThus, friends, said Basche, I foresee that hereafter you will act rarely\nthis tragical farce, since the very first time you have so skilfully\nhampered, bethwacked, belammed, and bebumped the catchpole.  From this day\nI double your wages.  As for you, my dear, said he to his lady, make your\ngratifications as you please; you are my treasurer, you know.  For my part,\nfirst and foremost, I drink to you all.  Come on, box it about; it is good\nand cool.  In the second place, you, Mr. Steward, take this silver basin; I\ngive it you freely.  Then you, my gentlemen of the horse, take these two\nsilver-gilt cups, and let not the pages be horsewhipped these three months.\nMy dear, let them have my best white plumes of feathers, with the gold\nbuckles to them.  Sir Oudart, this silver flagon falls to your share; this\nother I give to the cooks.  To the valets de chambre I give this silver\nbasket; to the grooms, this silver-gilt boat; to the porter, these two\nplates; to the hostlers, these ten porringers.  Trudon, take you these\nsilver spoons and this sugar-box.  You, footman, take this large salt.\nServe me well, and I will remember you.  For, on the word of a gentleman, I\nhad rather bear in war one hundred blows on my helmet in the service of my\ncountry than be once cited by these knavish catchpoles merely to humour\nthis same gorbellied prior.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XIV.\n\nA further account of catchpoles who were drubbed at Basche's house.\n\nFour days after another young, long-shanked, raw-boned catchpole coming to\nserve Basche with a writ at the fat prior's request, was no sooner at the\ngate but the porter smelt him out and rung the bell; at whose second pull\nall the family understood the mystery.  Loire was kneading his dough; his\nwife was sifting meal; Oudart was toping in his office; the gentlemen were\nplaying at tennis; the Lord Basche at in-and-out with my lady; the\nwaiting-men and gentle-women at push-pin; the officers at lanterloo, and the\npages at hot-cockles, giving one another smart bangs.  They were all\nimmediately informed that a catchpole was housed.\n\nUpon this Oudart put on his sacerdotal, and Loire and his wife their\nnuptial badges; Trudon piped it, and then tabored it like mad; all made\nhaste to get ready, not forgetting the gauntlets.  Basche went into the\noutward yard; there the catchpole meeting him fell on his marrow-bones,\nbegged of him not to take it ill if he served him with a writ at the suit\nof the fat prior; and in a pathetic speech let him know that he was a\npublic person, a servant to the monking tribe, apparitor to the abbatial\nmitre, ready to do as much for him, nay, for the least of his servants,\nwhensoever he would employ and use him.\n\nNay, truly, said the lord, you shall not serve your writ till you have\ntasted some of my good Quinquenays wine, and been a witness to a wedding\nwhich we are to have this very minute.  Let him drink and refresh himself,\nadded he, turning towards the levitical butler, and then bring him into the\nhall.  After which, Catchpole, well stuffed and moistened, came with Oudart\nto the place where all the actors in the farce stood ready to begin.  The\nsight of their game set them a-laughing, and the messenger of mischief\ngrinned also for company's sake.  Then the mysterious words were muttered\nto and by the couple, their hands joined, the bride bussed, and all\nbesprinkled with holy water.  While they were bringing wine and kickshaws,\nthumps began to trot about by dozens.  The catchpole gave the levite\nseveral blows.  Oudart, who had his gauntlet hid under his canonical shirt,\ndraws it on like a mitten, and then, with his clenched fist, souse he fell\non the catchpole and mauled him like a devil; the junior gauntlets dropped\non him likewise like so many battering rams.  Remember the wedding by this,\nby that, by these blows, said they.  In short, they stroked him so to the\npurpose that he pissed blood out at mouth, nose, ears, and eyes, and was\nbruised, thwacked, battered, bebumped, and crippled at the back, neck,\nbreast, arms, and so forth.  Never did the bachelors at Avignon in carnival\ntime play more melodiously at raphe than was then played on the catchpole's\nmicrocosm.  At last down he fell.\n\nThey threw a great deal of wine on his snout, tied round the sleeve of his\ndoublet a fine yellow and green favour, and got him upon his snotty beast,\nand God knows how he got to L'Isle Bouchart; where I cannot truly tell you\nwhether he was dressed and looked after or no, both by his spouse and the\nable doctors of the country; for the thing never came to my ears.\n\nThe next day they had a third part to the same tune, because it did not\nappear by the lean catchpole's bag that he had served his writ.  So the fat\nprior sent a new catchpole, at the head of a brace of bums for his garde du\ncorps, to summon my lord.  The porter ringing the bell, the whole family\nwas overjoyed, knowing that it was another rogue.  Basche was at dinner\nwith his lady and the gentlemen; so he sent for the catchpole, made him sit\nby him, and the bums by the women, and made them eat till their bellies\ncracked with their breeches unbuttoned.  The fruit being served, the\ncatchpole arose from table, and before the bums cited Basche.  Basche\nkindly asked him for a copy of the warrant, which the other had got ready;\nhe then takes witness and a copy of the summons.  To the catchpole and his\nbums he ordered four ducats for civility money.  In the meantime all were\nwithdrawn for the farce.  So Trudon gave the alarm with his tabor.  Basche\ndesired the catchpole to stay and see one of his servants married, and\nwitness the contract of marriage, paying him his fee.  The catchpole\nslapdash was ready, took out his inkhorn, got paper immediately, and his\nbums by him.\n\nThen Loire came into the hall at one door, and his wife with the\ngentlewomen at another, in nuptial accoutrements.  Oudart, in\npontificalibus, takes them both by their hands, asketh them their will,\ngiveth them the matrimonial blessing, and was very liberal of holy water.\nThe contract written, signed, and registered, on one side was brought wine\nand comfits; on the other, white and orange-tawny-coloured favours were\ndistributed; on another, gauntlets privately handed about.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XV.\n\nHow the ancient custom at nuptials is renewed by the catchpole.\n\nThe catchpole, having made shift to get down a swingeing sneaker of Breton\nwine, said to Basche, Pray, sir, what do you mean?  You do not give one\nanother the memento of the wedding.  By St. Joseph's wooden shoe, all good\ncustoms are forgot.  We find the form, but the hare is scampered; and the\nnest, but the birds are flown.  There are no true friends nowadays.  You\nsee how, in several churches, the ancient laudable custom of tippling on\naccount of the blessed saints O O, at Christmas, is come to nothing.  The\nworld is in its dotage, and doomsday is certainly coming all so fast.  Now\ncome on; the wedding, the wedding, the wedding; remember it by this.  This\nhe said, striking Basche and his lady; then her women and the levite.  Then\nthe tabor beat a point of war, and the gauntlets began to do their duty;\ninsomuch that the catchpole had his crown cracked in no less than nine\nplaces.  One of the bums had his right arm put out of joint, and the other\nhis upper jaw-bone or mandibule dislocated so that it hid half his chin,\nwith a denudation of the uvula, and sad loss of the molar, masticatory, and\ncanine teeth.  Then the tabor beat a retreat; the gauntlets were carefully\nhid in a trice, and sweetmeats afresh distributed to renew the mirth of the\ncompany.  So they all drank to one another, and especially to the catchpole\nand his bums.  But Oudart cursed and damned the wedding to the pit of hell,\ncomplaining that one of the bums had utterly disincornifistibulated his\nnether shoulder-blade.  Nevertheless, he scorned to be thought a flincher,\nand made shift to tope to him on the square.\n\nThe jawless bum shrugged up his shoulders, joined his hands, and by signs\nbegged his pardon; for speak he could not.  The sham bridegroom made his\nmoan, that the crippled bum had struck him such a horrid thump with his\nshoulder-of-mutton fist on the nether elbow that he was grown quite\nesperruquanchuzelubelouzerireliced down to his very heel, to the no small\nloss of mistress bride.\n\nBut what harm had poor I done? cried Trudon, hiding his left eye with his\nkerchief, and showing his tabor cracked on one side; they were not\nsatisfied with thus poaching, black and bluing, and\nmorrambouzevezengouzequoquemorgasacbaquevezinemaffreliding my poor eyes,\nbut they have also broke my harmless drum.  Drums indeed are commonly\nbeaten at weddings, and it is fit they should; but drummers are well\nentertained and never beaten.  Now let Beelzebub e'en take the drum, to\nmake his devilship a nightcap.  Brother, said the lame catchpole, never\nfret thyself; I will make thee a present of a fine, large, old patent,\nwhich I have here in my bag, to patch up thy drum, and for Madame St.\nAnn's sake I pray thee forgive us.  By Our Lady of Riviere, the blessed\ndame, I meant no more harm than the child unborn.  One of the equerries,\nwho, hopping and halting like a mumping cripple, mimicked the good limping\nLord de la Roche Posay, directed his discourse to the bum with the pouting\njaw, and told him:  What, Mr. Manhound, was it not enough thus to have\nmorcrocastebezasteverestegrigeligoscopapopondrillated us all in our upper\nmembers with your botched mittens, but you must also apply such\nmorderegripippiatabirofreluchamburelurecaquelurintimpaniments on our\nshinbones with the hard tops and extremities of your cobbled shoes.  Do\nyou call this children's play?  By the mass, 'tis no jest.  The bum,\nwringing his hands, seemed to beg his pardon, muttering with his tongue,\nMon, mon, mon, vrelon, von, von, like a dumb man.  The bride crying\nlaughed, and laughing cried, because the catchpole was not satisfied with\ndrubbing her without choice or distinction of members, but had also rudely\nroused and toused her, pulled off her topping, and not having the fear of\nher husband before his eyes, treacherously\ntrepignemanpenillorifrizonoufresterfumbled tumbled and squeezed her lower\nparts.  The devil go with it, said Basche; there was much need indeed that\nthis same Master King (this was the catchpole's name) should thus break my\nwife's back; however, I forgive him now; these are little nuptial\ncaresses. But this I plainly perceive, that he cited me like an angel, and\ndrubbed me like a devil.  He had something in him of Friar Thumpwell.\nCome, for all this, I must drink to him, and to you likewise, his trusty\nesquires.  But, said his lady, why hath he been so very liberal of his\nmanual kindness to me, without the least provocation?  I assure you, I by\nno means like it; but this I dare say for him, that he hath the hardest\nknuckles that ever I felt on my shoulders.  The steward held his left arm\nin a scarf, as if it had been rent and torn in twain.  I think it was the\ndevil, said he, that moved me to assist at these nuptials; shame on ill\nluck; I must needs be meddling with a pox, and now see what I have got by\nthe bargain, both my arms are wretchedly engoulevezinemassed and bruised.\nDo you call this a wedding?  By St. Bridget's tooth, I had rather be at\nthat of a Tom T--d-man.  This is, o' my word, even just such another feast\nas was that of the Lapithae, described by the philosopher of Samosata.\nOne of the bums had lost his tongue.  The other two, tho' they had more\nneed to complain, made their excuse as well as they could, protesting that\nthey had no ill design in this dumbfounding; begging that, for goodness\nsake, they would forgive them; and so, tho' they could hardly budge a\nfoot, or wag along, away they crawled.  About a mile from Basche's seat,\nthe catchpole found himself somewhat out of sorts.  The bums got to L'Isle\nBouchart, publicly saying that since they were born they had never seen an\nhonester gentleman than the Lord of Basche, or civiller people than his,\nand that they had never been at the like wedding (which I verily believe);\nbut that it was their own faults if they had been tickled off, and tossed\nabout from post to pillar, since themselves had began the beating.  So\nthey lived I cannot exactly tell you how many days after this.  But from\nthat time to this it was held for a certain truth that Basche's money was\nmore pestilential, mortal, and pernicious to the catchpoles and bums than\nwere formerly the aurum Tholosanum and the Sejan horse to those that\npossessed them.  Ever since this he lived quietly, and Basche's wedding\ngrew into a common proverb.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XVI.\n\nHow Friar John made trial of the nature of the catchpoles.\n\nThis story would seem pleasant enough, said Pantagruel, were we not to have\nalways the fear of God before our eyes.  It had been better, said\nEpistemon, if those gauntlets had fallen upon the fat prior.  Since he took\na pleasure in spending his money partly to vex Basche, partly to see those\ncatchpoles banged, good lusty thumps would have done well on his shaved\ncrown, considering the horrid concussions nowadays among those puny judges.\nWhat harm had done those poor devils the catchpoles?  This puts me in mind,\nsaid Pantagruel, of an ancient Roman named L. Neratius.  He was of noble\nblood, and for some time was rich; but had this tyrannical inclination,\nthat whenever he went out of doors he caused his servants to fill their\npockets with gold and silver, and meeting in the street your spruce\ngallants and better sort of beaux, without the least provocation, for his\nfancy, he used to strike them hard on the face with his fist; and\nimmediately after that, to appease them and hinder them from complaining to\nthe magistrates, he would give them as much money as satisfied them\naccording to the law of the twelve tables.  Thus he used to spend his\nrevenue, beating people for the price of his money.  By St. Bennet's sacred\nboot, quoth Friar John, I will know the truth of it presently.\n\nThis said, he went on shore, put his hand in his fob, and took out twenty\nducats; then said with a loud voice, in the hearing of a shoal of the\nnation of catchpoles, Who will earn twenty ducats for being beaten like the\ndevil?  Io, Io, Io, said they all; you will cripple us for ever, sir, that\nis most certain; but the money is tempting.  With this they were all\nthronging who should be first to be thus preciously beaten.  Friar John\nsingled him out of the whole knot of these rogues in grain, a red-snouted\ncatchpole, who upon his right thumb wore a thick broad silver hoop, wherein\nwas set a good large toadstone.  He had no sooner picked him out from the\nrest, but I perceived that they all muttered and grumbled; and I heard a\nyoung thin-jawed catchpole, a notable scholar, a pretty fellow at his pen,\nand, according to public report, much cried up for his honesty at Doctors'\nCommons, making his complaint and muttering because this same crimson phiz\ncarried away all the practice, and that if there were but a score and a\nhalf of bastinadoes to be got, he would certainly run away with eight and\ntwenty of them.  But all this was looked upon to be nothing but mere envy.\n\nFriar John so unmercifully thrashed, thumped, and belaboured Red-snout,\nback and belly, sides, legs, and arms, head, feet, and so forth, with the\nhome and frequently repeated application of one of the best members of a\nfaggot, that I took him to be a dead man; then he gave him the twenty\nducats, which made the dog get on his legs, pleased like a little king or\ntwo.  The rest were saying to Friar John, Sir, sir, brother devil, if it\nplease you to do us the favour to beat some of us for less money, we are\nall at your devilship's command, bags, papers, pens, and all.  Red-snout\ncried out against them, saying, with a loud voice, Body of me, you little\nprigs, will you offer to take the bread out of my mouth? will you take my\nbargain over my head? would you draw and inveigle from me my clients and\ncustomers?  Take notice, I summon you before the official this day\nsevennight; I will law and claw you like any old devil of Vauverd, that I\nwill--Then turning himself towards Friar John, with a smiling and joyful\nlook, he said to him, Reverend father in the devil, if you have found me a\ngood hide, and have a mind to divert yourself once more by beating your\nhumble servant, I will bate you half in half this time rather than lose\nyour custom; do not spare me, I beseech you; I am all, and more than all,\nyours, good Mr. Devil; head, lungs, tripes, guts, and garbage; and that at\na pennyworth, I'll assure you.  Friar John never heeded his proffers, but\neven left them.  The other catchpoles were making addresses to Panurge,\nEpistemon, Gymnast, and others, entreating them charitably to bestow upon\ntheir carcasses a small beating, for otherwise they were in danger of\nkeeping a long fast; but none of them had a stomach to it.  Some time\nafter, seeking fresh water for the ship's company, we met a couple of old\nfemale catchpoles of the place, miserably howling and weeping in concert.\nPantagruel had kept on board, and already had caused a retreat to be\nsounded.  Thinking that they might be related to the catchpole that was\nbastinadoed, we asked them the occasion of their grief.  They replied that\nthey had too much cause to weep; for that very hour, from an exalted triple\ntree, two of the honestest gentlemen in Catchpole-land had been made to cut\na caper on nothing.  Cut a caper on nothing, said Gymnast; my pages use to\ncut capers on the ground; to cut a caper on nothing should be hanging and\nchoking, or I am out.  Ay, ay, said Friar John; you speak of it like St.\nJohn de la Palisse.\n\nWe asked them why they treated these worthy persons with such a choking\nhempen salad.  They told us they had only borrowed, alias stolen, the tools\nof the mass and hid them under the handle of the parish.  This is a very\nallegorical way of speaking, said Epistemon.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel came to the islands of Tohu and Bohu; and of the strange\ndeath of Wide-nostrils, the swallower of windmills.\n\nThat day Pantagruel came to the two islands of Tohu and Bohu, where the\ndevil a bit we could find anything to fry with.  For one Wide-nostrils,\na huge giant, had swallowed every individual pan, skillet, kettle,\nfrying-pan, dripping-pan, and brass and iron pot in the land, for want of\nwindmills, which were his daily food.  Whence it happened that somewhat\nbefore day, about the hour of his digestion, the greedy churl was taken\nvery ill with a kind of a surfeit, or crudity of stomach, occasioned, as\nthe physicians said, by the weakness of the concocting faculty of his\nstomach, naturally disposed to digest whole windmills at a gust, yet unable\nto consume perfectly the pans and skillets; though it had indeed pretty\nwell digested the kettles and pots, as they said they knew by the\nhypostases and eneoremes of four tubs of second-hand drink which he had\nevacuated at two different times that morning.  They made use of divers\nremedies, according to art, to give him ease; but all would not do; the\ndistemper prevailed over the remedies; insomuch that the famous\nWide-nostrils died that morning of so strange a death that I think you ought\nno longer to wonder at that of the poet Aeschylus.  It had been foretold him\nby the soothsayers that he would die on a certain day by the ruin of\nsomething that should fall on him.  The fatal day being come in its turn, he\nremoved himself out of town, far from all houses, trees, (rocks,) or any\nother things that can fall and endanger by their ruin; and strayed in a\nlarge field, trusting himself to the open sky; there very secure, as he\nthought, unless indeed the sky should happen to fall, which he held to be\nimpossible.  Yet they say that the larks are much afraid of it; for if it\nshould fall, they must all be taken.\n\nThe Celts that once lived near the Rhine--they are our noble valiant\nFrench--in ancient times were also afraid of the sky's falling; for being\nasked by Alexander the Great what they feared most in this world, hoping\nwell they would say that they feared none but him, considering his great\nachievements, they made answer that they feared nothing but the sky's\nfalling; however, not refusing to enter into a confederacy with so brave a\nking, if you believe Strabo, lib. 7, and Arrian, lib. I.\n\nPlutarch also, in his book of the face that appears on the body of the\nmoon, speaks of one Phenaces, who very much feared the moon should fall on\nthe earth, and pitied those that live under that planet, as the Aethiopians\nand Taprobanians, if so heavy a mass ever happened to fall on them, and\nwould have feared the like of heaven and earth had they not been duly\npropped up and borne by the Atlantic pillars, as the ancients believed,\naccording to Aristotle's testimony, lib. 5, Metaphys.  Notwithstanding all\nthis, poor Aeschylus was killed by the fall of the shell of a tortoise,\nwhich falling from betwixt the claws of an eagle high in the air, just on\nhis head, dashed out his brains.\n\nNeither ought you to wonder at the death of another poet, I mean old jolly\nAnacreon, who was choked with a grape-stone.  Nor at that of Fabius the\nRoman praetor, who was choked with a single goat's hair as he was supping\nup a porringer of milk.  Nor at the death of that bashful fool, who by\nholding in his wind, and for want of letting out a bum-gunshot, died\nsuddenly in the presence of the Emperor Claudius.  Nor at that of the\nItalian buried on the Via Flaminia at Rome, who in his epitaph complains\nthat the bite of a she-puss on his little finger was the cause of his\ndeath.  Nor of that of Q. Lecanius Bassus, who died suddenly of so small a\nprick with a needle on his left thumb that it could hardly be discerned.\nNor of Quenelault, a Norman physician, who died suddenly at Montpellier,\nmerely for having sideways took a worm out of his hand with a penknife.\nNor of Philomenes, whose servant having got him some new figs for the first\ncourse of his dinner, whilst he went to fetch wine, a straggling well-hung\nass got into the house, and seeing the figs on the table, without further\ninvitation soberly fell to.  Philomenes coming into the room and nicely\nobserving with what gravity the ass ate its dinner, said to the man, who\nwas come back, Since thou hast set figs here for this reverend guest of\nours to eat, methinks it is but reason thou also give him some of this wine\nto drink.  He had no sooner said this, but he was so excessively pleased,\nand fell into so exorbitant a fit of laughter, that the use of his spleen\ntook that of his breath utterly away, and he immediately died.  Nor of\nSpurius Saufeius, who died supping up a soft-boiled egg as he came out of a\nbath.  Nor of him who, as Boccaccio tells us, died suddenly by picking his\ngrinders with a sage-stalk.  Nor of Phillipot Placut, who being brisk and\nhale, fell dead as he was paying an old debt; which causes, perhaps, many\nnot to pay theirs, for fear of the like accident.  Nor of the painter\nZeuxis, who killed himself with laughing at the sight of the antique\njobbernowl of an old hag drawn by him.  Nor, in short, of a thousand more\nof which authors write, as Varrius, Pliny, Valerius, J. Baptista Fulgosus,\nand Bacabery the elder.  In short, Gaffer Wide-nostrils choked himself with\neating a huge lump of fresh butter at the mouth of a hot oven by the advice\nof physicians.\n\nThey likewise told us there that the King of Cullan in Bohu had routed the\ngrandees of King Mecloth, and made sad work with the fortresses of Belima.\n\nAfter this, we sailed by the islands of Nargues and Zargues; also by the\nislands of Teleniabin and Geleniabin, very fine and fruitful in ingredients\nfor clysters; and then by the islands of Enig and Evig, on whose account\nformerly the Landgrave of Hesse was swinged off with a vengeance.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XVIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel met with a great storm at sea.\n\nThe next day we espied nine sail that came spooning before the wind; they\nwere full of Dominicans, Jesuits, Capuchins, Hermits, Austins, Bernardins,\nEgnatins, Celestins, Theatins, Amadeans, Cordeliers, Carmelites, Minims,\nand the devil and all of other holy monks and friars, who were going to the\nCouncil of Chesil, to sift and garble some new articles of faith against\nthe new heretics.  Panurge was overjoyed to see them, being most certain of\ngood luck for that day and a long train of others.  So having courteously\nsaluted the blessed fathers, and recommended the salvation of his precious\nsoul to their devout prayers and private ejaculations, he caused\nseventy-eight dozen of Westphalia hams, units of pots of caviare, tens of\nBolonia sausages, hundreds of botargoes, and thousands of fine angels, for\nthe souls of the dead, to be thrown on board their ships.  Pantagruel seemed\nmetagrabolized, dozing, out of sorts, and as melancholic as a cat.  Friar\nJohn, who soon perceived it, was inquiring of him whence should come this\nunusual sadness; when the master, whose watch it was, observing the\nfluttering of the ancient above the poop, and seeing that it began to\novercast, judged that we should have wind; therefore he bid the boatswain\ncall all hands upon deck, officers, sailors, foremast-men, swabbers, and\ncabin-boys, and even the passengers; made them first settle their topsails,\ntake in their spritsail; then he cried, In with your topsails, lower the\nforesail, tallow under parrels, braid up close all them sails, strike your\ntopmasts to the cap, make all sure with your sheeps-feet, lash your guns\nfast.  All this was nimbly done.  Immediately it blowed a storm; the sea\nbegan to roar and swell mountain-high; the rut of the sea was great, the\nwaves breaking upon our ship's quarter; the north-west wind blustered and\noverblowed; boisterous gusts, dreadful clashing, and deadly scuds of wind\nwhistled through our yards and made our shrouds rattle again.  The thunder\ngrumbled so horridly that you would have thought heaven had been tumbling\nabout our ears; at the same time it lightened, rained, hailed; the sky lost\nits transparent hue, grew dusky, thick, and gloomy, so that we had no other\nlight than that of the flashes of lightning and rending of the clouds.  The\nhurricanes, flaws, and sudden whirlwinds began to make a flame about us by\nthe lightnings, fiery vapours, and other aerial ejaculations.  Oh, how our\nlooks were full of amazement and trouble, while the saucy winds did rudely\nlift up above us the mountainous waves of the main!  Believe me, it seemed\nto us a lively image of the chaos, where fire, air, sea, land, and all the\nelements were in a refractory confusion.  Poor Panurge having with the full\ncontents of the inside of his doublet plentifully fed the fish, greedy\nenough of such odious fare, sat on the deck all in a heap, with his nose and\narse together, most sadly cast down, moping and half dead; invoked and\ncalled to his assistance all the blessed he- and she-saints he could muster\nup; swore and vowed to confess in time and place convenient, and then bawled\nout frightfully, Steward, maitre d'hotel, see ho! my friend, my father, my\nuncle, prithee let us have a piece of powdered beef or pork; we shall drink\nbut too much anon, for aught I see.  Eat little and drink the more will\nhereafter be my motto, I fear.  Would to our dear Lord, and to our blessed,\nworthy, and sacred Lady, I were now, I say, this very minute of an hour,\nwell on shore, on terra firma, hale and easy.  O twice and thrice happy\nthose that plant cabbages!  O destinies, why did you not spin me for a\ncabbage-planter?  O how few are there to whom Jupiter hath been so\nfavourable as to predestinate them to plant cabbages!  They have always one\nfoot on the ground, and the other not far from it.  Dispute who will of\nfelicity and summum bonum, for my part whosoever plants cabbages is now, by\nmy decree, proclaimed most happy; for as good a reason as the philosopher\nPyrrho, being in the same danger, and seeing a hog near the shore eating\nsome scattered oats, declared it happy in two respects; first, because it\nhad plenty of oats, and besides that, was on shore.  Ha, for a divine and\nprincely habitation, commend me to the cows' floor.\n\nMurder!  This wave will sweep us away, blessed Saviour!  O my friends! a\nlittle vinegar.  I sweat again with mere agony.  Alas! the mizen-sail's\nsplit, the gallery's washed away, the masts are sprung, the\nmaintop-masthead dives into the sea; the keel is up to the sun; our shrouds\nare almost all broke, and blown away.  Alas! alas! where is our main course?\nAl is verlooren, by Godt! our topmast is run adrift.  Alas! who shall have\nthis wreck?  Friend, lend me here behind you one of these whales.  Your\nlantern is fallen, my lads.  Alas! do not let go the main-tack nor the\nbowline.  I hear the block crack; is it broke?  For the Lord's sake, let us\nhave the hull, and let all the rigging be damned.  Be, be, be, bous, bous,\nbous.  Look to the needle of your compass, I beseech you, good Sir\nAstrophil, and tell us, if you can, whence comes this storm.  My heart's\nsunk down below my midriff.  By my troth, I am in a sad fright, bou, bou,\nbou, bous, bous, I am lost for ever.  I conskite myself for mere madness and\nfear.  Bou, bou, bou, bou, Otto to to to to ti.  Bou, bou, bou, ou, ou, ou,\nbou, bou, bous.  I sink, I'm drowned, I'm gone, good people, I'm drowned.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XIX.\n\nWhat countenances Panurge and Friar John kept during the storm.\n\nPantagruel, having first implored the help of the great and Almighty\nDeliverer, and prayed publicly with fervent devotion, by the pilot's advice\nheld tightly the mast of the ship.  Friar John had stripped himself to his\nwaistcoat, to help the seamen.  Epistemon, Ponocrates, and the rest did as\nmuch.  Panurge alone sat on his breech upon deck, weeping and howling.\nFriar John espied him going on the quarter-deck, and said to him, Odzoons!\nPanurge the calf, Panurge the whiner, Panurge the brayer, would it not\nbecome thee much better to lend us here a helping hand than to lie lowing\nlike a cow, as thou dost, sitting on thy stones like a bald-breeched\nbaboon?  Be, be, be, bous, bous, bous, returned Panurge; Friar John, my\nfriend, my good father, I am drowning, my dear friend!  I drown!  I am a\ndead man, my dear father in God; I am a dead man, my friend; your cutting\nhanger cannot save me from this; alas! alas! we are above ela.  Above the\npitch, out of tune, and off the hinges.  Be, be, be, bou, bous.  Alas! we\nare now above g sol re ut.  I sink, I sink, ha, my father, my uncle, my\nall.  The water is got into my shoes by the collar; bous, bous, bous,\npaish, hu, hu, hu, he, he, he, ha, ha, I drown.  Alas! alas!  Hu, hu, hu,\nhu, hu, hu, hu, be, be, bous, bous, bobous, bobous, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,\nalas! alas!  Now I am like your tumblers, my feet stand higher than my\nhead.  Would to heaven I were now with those good holy fathers bound for\nthe council whom we met this morning, so godly, so fat, so merry, so plump\nand comely.  Holos, bolos, holas, holas, alas!  This devilish wave (mea\nculpa Deus), I mean this wave of God, will sink our vessel.  Alas!  Friar\nJohn, my father, my friend, confession.  Here I am down on my knees;\nconfiteor; your holy blessing.  Come hither and be damned, thou pitiful\ndevil, and help us, said Friar John (who fell a-swearing and cursing like a\ntinker), in the name of thirty legions of black devils, come; will you\ncome?  Do not let us swear at this time, said Panurge; holy father, my\nfriend, do not swear, I beseech you; to-morrow as much as you please.\nHolos, holos, alas! our ship leaks.  I drown, alas, alas!  I will give\neighteen hundred thousand crowns to anyone that will set me on shore, all\nberayed and bedaubed as I am now.  If ever there was a man in my country in\nthe like pickle.  Confiteor, alas! a word or two of testament or codicil at\nleast.  A thousand devils seize the cuckoldy cow-hearted mongrel, cried\nFriar John.  Ods-belly, art thou talking here of making thy will now we are\nin danger, and it behoveth us to bestir our stumps lustily, or never?  Wilt\nthou come, ho devil?  Midshipman, my friend; O the rare lieutenant; here\nGymnast, here on the poop.  We are, by the mass, all beshit now; our light\nis out.  This is hastening to the devil as fast as it can.  Alas, bou, bou,\nbou, bou, bou, alas, alas, alas, alas! said Panurge; was it here we were\nborn to perish?  Oh! ho! good people, I drown, I die.  Consummatum est.  I\nam sped--Magna, gna, gna, said Friar John.  Fie upon him, how ugly the\nshitten howler looks.  Boy, younker, see hoyh.  Mind the pumps or the devil\nchoke thee.  Hast thou hurt thyself?  Zoons, here fasten it to one of these\nblocks.  On this side, in the devil's name, hay--so, my boy.  Ah, Friar\nJohn, said Panurge, good ghostly father, dear friend, don't let us swear,\nyou sin.  Oh, ho, oh, ho, be be be bous, bous, bhous, I sink, I die, my\nfriends.  I die in charity with all the world.  Farewell, in manus.  Bohus\nbohous, bhousowauswaus.  St. Michael of Aure!  St. Nicholas! now, now or\nnever, I here make you a solemn vow, and to our Saviour, that if you stand\nby me this time, I mean if you set me ashore out of this danger, I will\nbuild you a fine large little chapel or two, between Quande and Montsoreau,\nwhere neither cow nor calf shall feed.  Oh ho, oh ho.  Above eighteen\npailfuls or two of it are got down my gullet; bous, bhous, bhous, bhous,\nhow damned bitter and salt it is!  By the virtue, said Friar John, of the\nblood, the flesh, the belly, the head, if I hear thee again howling, thou\ncuckoldy cur, I'll maul thee worse than any sea-wolf.  Ods-fish, why don't\nwe take him up by the lugs and throw him overboard to the bottom of the\nsea?  Hear, sailor; ho, honest fellow.  Thus, thus, my friend, hold fast\nabove.  In truth, here is a sad lightning and thundering; I think that all\nthe devils are got loose; it is holiday with them; or else Madame\nProserpine is in child's labour:  all the devils dance a morrice.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XX.\n\nHow the pilots were forsaking their ships in the greatest stress of\nweather.\n\n\nOh, said Panurge, you sin, Friar John, my former crony! former, I say, for\nat this time I am no more, you are no more.  It goes against my heart to\ntell it you; for I believe this swearing doth your spleen a great deal of\ngood; as it is a great ease to a wood-cleaver to cry hem at every blow, and\nas one who plays at ninepins is wonderfully helped if, when he hath not\nthrown his bowl right, and is like to make a bad cast, some ingenious\nstander-by leans and screws his body halfway about on that side which the\nbowl should have took to hit the pins.  Nevertheless, you offend, my sweet\nfriend.  But what do you think of eating some kind of cabirotadoes?\nWouldn't this secure us from this storm?  I have read that the ministers of\nthe gods Cabiri, so much celebrated by Orpheus, Apollonius, Pherecydes,\nStrabo, Pausanias, and Herodotus were always secure in time of storm.  He\ndotes, he raves, the poor devil!  A thousand, a million, nay, a hundred\nmillion of devils seize the hornified doddipole.  Lend's a hand here, hoh,\ntiger, wouldst thou?  Here, on the starboard side.  Ods-me, thou buffalo's\nhead stuffed with relics, what ape's paternoster art thou muttering and\nchattering here between thy teeth?  That devil of a sea-calf is the cause\nof all this storm, and is the only man who doth not lend a helping hand.\nBy G--, if I come near thee, I'll fetch thee out by the head and ears with\na vengeance, and chastise thee like any tempestative devil.  Here, mate, my\nlad, hold fast, till I have made a double knot.  O brave boy!  Would to\nheaven thou wert abbot of Talemouze, and that he that is were guardian of\nCroullay.  Hold, brother Ponocrates, you will hurt yourself, man.\nEpistemon, prithee stand off out of the hatchway.  Methinks I saw the\nthunder fall there but just now.  Con the ship, so ho--Mind your steerage.\nWell said, thus, thus, steady, keep her thus, get the longboat clear\n--steady.  Ods-fish, the beak-head is staved to pieces.  Grumble, devils,\nfart, belch, shite, a t--d o' the wave.  If this be weather, the devil's a\nram.  Nay, by G--, a little more would have washed me clear away into the\ncurrent.  I think all the legions of devils hold here their provincial\nchapter, or are polling, canvassing, and wrangling for the election of a\nnew rector.  Starboard; well said.  Take heed; have a care of your noddle,\nlad, in the devil's name.  So ho, starboard, starboard.  Be, be, be, bous,\nbous, bous, cried Panurge; bous, bous, be, be, be, bous, bous, I am lost.\nI see neither heaven nor earth; of the four elements we have here only fire\nand water left.  Bou, bou, bou, bous, bous, bous.  Would it were the\npleasure of the worthy divine bounty that I were at this present hour in\nthe close at Seuille, or at Innocent's the pastry-cook over against the\npainted wine-vault at Chinon, though I were to strip to my doublet, and\nbake the petti-pasties myself.\n\nHonest man, could not you throw me ashore? you can do a world of good\nthings, they say.  I give you all Salmigondinois, and my large shore full\nof whelks, cockles, and periwinkles, if, by your industry, I ever set foot\non firm ground.  Alas, alas!  I drown.  Harkee, my friends, since we cannot\nget safe into port, let us come to an anchor in some road, no matter\nwhither.  Drop all your anchors; let us be out of danger, I beseech you.\nHere, honest tar, get you into the chains, and heave the lead, an't please\nyou.  Let us know how many fathom water we are in.  Sound, friend, in the\nLord Harry's name.  Let us know whether a man might here drink easily\nwithout stooping.  I am apt to believe one might.  Helm a-lee, hoh, cried\nthe pilot.  Helm a-lee; a hand or two at the helm; about ships with her;\nhelm a-lee, helm a-lee.  Stand off from the leech of the sail.  Hoh! belay,\nhere make fast below; hoh, helm a-lee, lash sure the helm a-lee, and let\nher drive.  Is it come to that? said Pantagruel; our good Saviour then help\nus.  Let her lie under the sea, cried James Brahier, our chief mate; let\nher drive.  To prayers, to prayers; let all think on their souls, and fall\nto prayers; nor hope to escape but by a miracle.  Let us, said Panurge,\nmake some good pious kind of vow; alas, alas, alas! bou, bou, be, be, be,\nbous, bous, bous, oho, oho, oho, oho, let us make a pilgrim; come, come,\nlet every man club his penny towards it, come on.  Here, here, on this\nside, said Friar John, in the devil's name.  Let her drive, for the Lord's\nsake unhang the rudder; hoh, let her drive, let her drive, and let us\ndrink, I say, of the best and most cheering; d'ye hear, steward? produce,\nexhibit; for, d'ye see this, and all the rest will as well go to the devil\nout of hand.  A pox on that wind-broker Aeolus, with his fluster-blusters.\nSirrah, page, bring me here my drawer (for so he called his breviary); stay\na little here; haul, friend, thus.  Odzoons, here is a deal of hail and\nthunder to no purpose.  Hold fast above, I pray you.  When have we\nAll-saints day?  I believe it is the unholy holiday of all the devil's crew.\nAlas! said Panurge, Friar John damns himself here as black as buttermilk\nfor the nonce.  Oh, what a good friend I lose in him.  Alas, alas! this is\nanother gats-bout than last year's.  We are falling out of Scylla into\nCharybdis.  Oho! I drown.  Confiteor; one poor word or two by way of\ntestament, Friar John, my ghostly father; good Mr. Abstractor, my crony,\nmy Achates, Xenomanes, my all.  Alas! I drown; two words of testament here\nupon this ladder.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXI.\n\nA continuation of the storm, with a short discourse on the subject of\nmaking testaments at sea.\n\nTo make one's last will, said Epistemon, at this time that we ought to\nbestir ourselves and help our seamen, on the penalty of being drowned,\nseems to me as idle and ridiculous a maggot as that of some of Caesar's\nmen, who, at their coming into the Gauls, were mightily busied in making\nwills and codicils; bemoaned their fortune and the absence of their spouses\nand friends at Rome, when it was absolutely necessary for them to run to\ntheir arms and use their utmost strength against Ariovistus their enemy.\n\nThis also is to be as silly as that jolt-headed loblolly of a carter, who,\nhaving laid his waggon fast in a slough, down on his marrow-bones was\ncalling on the strong-backed deity, Hercules, might and main, to help him\nat a dead lift, but all the while forgot to goad on his oxen and lay his\nshoulder to the wheels, as it behoved him; as if a Lord have mercy upon us\nalone would have got his cart out of the mire.\n\nWhat will it signify to make your will now? for either we shall come off or\ndrown for it.  If we 'scape, it will not signify a straw to us; for\ntestaments are of no value or authority but by the death of the testators.\nIf we are drowned, will it not be drowned too?  Prithee, who will transmit\nit to the executors?  Some kind wave will throw it ashore, like Ulysses,\nreplied Panurge; and some king's daughter, going to fetch a walk in the\nfresco, on the evening will find it, and take care to have it proved and\nfulfilled; nay, and have some stately cenotaph erected to my memory, as\nDido had to that of her goodman Sichaeus; Aeneas to Deiphobus, upon the\nTrojan shore, near Rhoete; Andromache to Hector, in the city of Buthrot;\nAristotle to Hermias and Eubulus; the Athenians to the poet Euripides; the\nRomans to Drusus in Germany, and to Alexander Severus, their emperor, in\nthe Gauls; Argentier to Callaischre; Xenocrates to Lysidices; Timares to\nhis son Teleutagoras; Eupolis and Aristodice to their son Theotimus;\nOnestus to Timocles; Callimachus to Sopolis, the son of Dioclides; Catullus\nto his brother; Statius to his father; Germain of Brie to Herve, the Breton\ntarpaulin.  Art thou mad, said Friar John, to run on at this rate?  Help,\nhere, in the name of five hundred thousand millions of cartloads of devils,\nhelp! may a shanker gnaw thy moustachios, and the three rows of pock-royals\nand cauliflowers cover thy bum and turd-barrel instead of breeches and\ncodpiece.  Codsooks, our ship is almost overset.  Ods-death, how shall we\nclear her? it is well if she do not founder.  What a devilish sea there\nruns!  She'll neither try nor hull; the sea will overtake her, so we shall\nnever 'scape; the devil 'scape me.  Then Pantagruel was heard to make a sad\nexclamation, saying, with a loud voice, Lord save us, we perish; yet not as\nwe would have it, but thy holy will be done.  The Lord and the blessed\nVirgin be with us, said Panurge.  Holos, alas, I drown; be be be bous, be\nbous, bous; in manus.  Good heavens, send me some dolphin to carry me safe\non shore, like a pretty little Arion.  I shall make shift to sound the\nharp, if it be not unstrung.  Let nineteen legions of black devils seize\nme, said Friar John.  (The Lord be with us! whispered Panurge, between his\nchattering teeth.)  If I come down to thee, I'll show thee to some purpose\nthat the badge of thy humanity dangles at a calf's breech, thou ragged,\nhorned, cuckoldy booby--mgna, mgnan, mgnan--come hither and help us, thou\ngreat weeping calf, or may thirty millions of devils leap on thee.  Wilt\nthou come, sea-calf?  Fie; how ugly the howling whelp looks.  What, always\nthe same ditty?  Come on now, my bonny drawer.  This he said, opening his\nbreviary.  Come forward, thou and I must be somewhat serious for a while;\nlet me peruse thee stiffly.  Beatus vir qui non abiit.  Pshaw, I know all\nthis by heart; let us see the legend of Mons. St. Nicholas.\n\n  Horrida tempestas montem turbavit acutum.\n\nTempest was a mighty flogger of lads at Mountagu College.  If pedants be\ndamned for whipping poor little innocent wretches their scholars, he is,\nupon my honour, by this time fixed within Ixion's wheel, lashing the\ncrop-eared, bobtailed cur that gives it motion.  If they are saved for\nhaving whipped innocent lads, he ought to be above the--\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXII.\n\nAn end of the storm.\n\nShore, shore! cried Pantagruel.  Land to, my friends, I see land!  Pluck up\na good spirit, boys, 'tis within a kenning.  So! we are not far from a\nport.--I see the sky clearing up to the northwards.--Look to the\nsouth-east!  Courage, my hearts, said the pilot; now she'll bear the hullock\nof a sail; the sea is much smoother; some hands aloft to the maintop.  Put\nthe helm a-weather.  Steady! steady!  Haul your after-mizen bowlines.  Haul,\nhaul, haul!  Thus, thus, and no near.  Mind your steerage; bring your\nmain-tack aboard.  Clear your sheets; clear your bowlines; port, port.  Helm\na-lee.  Now to the sheet on the starboard side, thou son of a whore.  Thou\nart mightily pleased, honest fellow, quoth Friar John, with hearing make\nmention of thy mother.  Luff, luff, cried the quartermaster that conned the\nship, keep her full, luff the helm.  Luff.  It is, answered the steersman.\nKeep her thus.  Get the bonnets fixed.  Steady, steady.\n\nThat is well said, said Friar John now, this is something like a tansy.\nCome, come, come, children, be nimble.  Good.  Luff, luff, thus.  Helm\na-weather.  That's well said and thought on.  Methinks the storm is almost\nover.  It was high time, faith; however, the Lord be thanked.  Our devils\nbegin to scamper.  Out with all your sails.  Hoist your sails.  Hoist.\nThat is spoke like a man, hoist, hoist.  Here, a God's name, honest\nPonocrates; thou art a lusty fornicator; the whoreson will get none but\nboys.  Eusthenes, thou art a notable fellow.  Run up to the fore-topsail.\nThus, thus.  Well said, i' faith; thus, thus.  I dare not fear anything all\nthis while, for it is holiday.  Vea, vea, vea! huzza!  This shout of the\nseaman is not amiss, and pleases me, for it is holiday.  Keep her full\nthus.  Good.  Cheer up, my merry mates all, cried out Epistemon; I see\nalready Castor on the right.  Be, be, bous, bous, bous, said Panurge; I am\nmuch afraid it is the bitch Helen.  It is truly Mixarchagenas, returned\nEpistemon, if thou likest better that denomination, which the Argives give\nhim.  Ho, ho! I see land too; let her bear in with the harbour; I see a\ngood many people on the beach; I see a light on an obeliscolychny.  Shorten\nyour sails, said the pilot; fetch the sounding line; we must double that\npoint of land, and mind the sands.  We are clear of them, said the sailors.\nSoon after, Away she goes, quoth the pilot, and so doth the rest of our\nfleet; help came in good season.\n\nBy St. John, said Panurge, this is spoke somewhat like.  O the sweet word!\nthere is the soul of music in it.  Mgna, mgna, mgna, said Friar John; if\never thou taste a drop of it, let the devil's dam taste me, thou ballocky\ndevil.  Here, honest soul, here's a full sneaker of the very best.  Bring\nthe flagons; dost hear, Gymnast: and that same large pasty jambic,\ngammonic, as you will have it.  Take heed you pilot her in right.\n\nCheer up, cried out Pantagruel; cheer up, my boys; let us be ourselves\nagain.  Do you see yonder, close by our ship, two barks, three sloops, five\nships, eight pinks, four yawls, and six frigates making towards us, sent by\nthe good people of the neighbouring island to our relief?  But who is this\nUcalegon below, that cries and makes such a sad moan?  Were it not that I\nhold the mast firmly with both my hands, and keep it straighter than two\nhundred tacklings--I would--It is, said Friar John, that poor devil\nPanurge, who is troubled with a calf's ague; he quakes for fear when his\nbelly's full.  If, said Pantagruel, he hath been afraid during this\ndreadful hurricane and dangerous storm, provided (waiving that) he hath\ndone his part like a man, I do not value him a jot the less for it.  For as\nto fear in all encounters is the mark of a heavy and cowardly heart, as\nAgamemnon did, who for that reason is ignominiously taxed by Achilles with\nhaving dog's eyes and a stag's heart; so, not to fear when the case is\nevidently dreadful is a sign of want or smallness of judgment.  Now, if\nanything ought to be feared in this life, next to offending God, I will not\nsay it is death.  I will not meddle with the disputes of Socrates and the\nacademics, that death of itself is neither bad nor to be feared, but I will\naffirm that this kind of shipwreck is to be feared, or nothing is.  For, as\nHomer saith, it is a grievous, dreadful, and unnatural thing to perish at\nsea.  And indeed Aeneas, in the storm that took his fleet near Sicily, was\ngrieved that he had not died by the hand of the brave Diomedes, and said\nthat those were three, nay four times happy, who perished in the\nconflagration at Troy.  No man here hath lost his life, the Lord our\nSaviour be eternally praised for it! but in truth here is a ship sadly out\nof order.  Well, we must take care to have the damage repaired.  Take heed\nwe do not run aground and bulge her.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXIII.\n\nHow Panurge played the good fellow when the storm was over.\n\nWhat cheer, ho, fore and aft? quoth Panurge.  Oh ho! all is well, the storm\nis over.  I beseech ye, be so kind as to let me be the first that is sent\non shore; for I would by all means a little untruss a point.  Shall I help\nyou still?  Here, let me see, I will coil this rope; I have plenty of\ncourage, and of fear as little as may be.  Give it me yonder, honest tar.\nNo, no, I have not a bit of fear.  Indeed, that same decumane wave that\ntook us fore and aft somewhat altered my pulse.  Down with your sails; well\nsaid.  How now, Friar John? you do nothing.  Is it time for us to drink\nnow?  Who can tell but St. Martin's running footman Belzebuth may still be\nhatching us some further mischief?  Shall I come and help you again?  Pork\nand peas choke me, if I do heartily repent, though too late, not having\nfollowed the doctrine of the good philosopher who tells us that to walk by\nthe sea and to navigate by the shore are very safe and pleasant things;\njust as 'tis to go on foot when we hold our horse by the bridle.  Ha! ha!\nha! by G--, all goes well.  Shall I help you here too?  Let me see, I will\ndo this as it should be, or the devil's in't.\n\nEpistemon, who had the inside of one of his hands all flayed and bloody,\nhaving held a tackling with might and main, hearing what Pantagruel had\nsaid, told him:  You may believe, my lord, I had my share of fear as well\nas Panurge; yet I spared no pains in lending my helping hand.  I considered\nthat, since by fatal and unavoidable necessity we must all die, it is the\nblessed will of God that we die this or that hour, and this or that kind of\ndeath.  Nevertheless, we ought to implore, invoke, pray, beseech, and\nsupplicate him; but we must not stop there; it behoveth us also to use our\nendeavours on our side, and, as the holy writ saith, to co-operate with\nhim.\n\nYou know what C. Flaminius, the consul, said when by Hannibal's policy he\nwas penned up near the lake of Peruse, alias Thrasymene.  Friends, said he\nto his soldiers, you must not hope to get out of this place barely by vows\nor prayers to the gods; no, 'tis by fortitude and strength we must escape\nand cut ourselves a way with the edge of our swords through the midst of\nour enemies.\n\nSallust likewise makes M. Portius Cato say this:  The help of the gods is\nnot obtained by idle vows and womanish complaints; 'tis by vigilance,\nlabour, and repeated endeavours that all things succeed according to our\nwishes and designs.  If a man in time of need and danger is negligent,\nheartless, and lazy, in vain he implores the gods; they are then justly\nangry and incensed against him.  The devil take me, said Friar John,--I'll\ngo his halves, quoth Panurge,--if the close of Seville had not been all\ngathered, vintaged, gleaned, and destroyed, if I had only sung contra\nhostium insidias (matter of breviary) like all the rest of the monking\ndevils, and had not bestirred myself to save the vineyard as I did,\ndespatching the truant picaroons of Lerne with the staff of the cross.\n\nLet her sink or swim a God's name, said Panurge, all's one to Friar John;\nhe doth nothing; his name is Friar John Do-little; for all he sees me here\na-sweating and puffing to help with all my might this honest tar, first of\nthe name.--Hark you me, dear soul, a word with you; but pray be not angry.\nHow thick do you judge the planks of our ship to be?  Some two good inches\nand upwards, returned the pilot; don't fear.  Ods-kilderkins, said Panurge,\nit seems then we are within two fingers' breadth of damnation.\n\nIs this one of the nine comforts of matrimony?  Ah, dear soul, you do well\nto measure the danger by the yard of fear.  For my part, I have none on't;\nmy name is William Dreadnought.  As for heart, I have more than enough\non't.  I mean none of your sheep's heart; but of wolf's heart--the courage\nof a bravo.  By the pavilion of Mars, I fear nothing but danger.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXIV.\n\nHow Panurge was said to have been afraid without reason during the storm.\n\nGood morrow, gentlemen, said Panurge; good morrow to you all; you are in\nvery good health, thanks to heaven and yourselves; you are all heartily\nwelcome, and in good time.  Let us go on shore.--Here, coxswain, get the\nladder over the gunnel; man the sides; man the pinnace, and get her by the\nship's side.  Shall I lend you a hand here?  I am stark mad for want of\nbusiness, and would work like any two yokes of oxen.  Truly this is a fine\nplace, and these look like a very good people.  Children, do you want me\nstill in anything? do not spare the sweat of my body, for God's sake.\nAdam--that is, man--was made to labour and work, as the birds were made to\nfly.  Our Lord's will is that we get our bread with the sweat of our brows,\nnot idling and doing nothing, like this tatterdemalion of a monk here, this\nFriar Jack, who is fain to drink to hearten himself up, and dies for fear.\n--Rare weather.--I now find the answer of Anacharsis, the noble philosopher,\nvery proper.  Being asked what ship he reckoned the safest, he replied:\nThat which is in the harbour.  He made a yet better repartee, said\nPantagruel, when somebody inquiring which is greater, the number of the\nliving or that of the dead, he asked them amongst which of the two they\nreckoned those that are at sea, ingeniously implying that they are\ncontinually in danger of death, dying alive, and living die.  Portius Cato\nalso said that there were but three things of which he would repent:  if\never he had trusted his wife with his secret, if he had idled away a day,\nand if he had ever gone by sea to a place which he could visit by land.  By\nthis dignified frock of mine, said Friar John to Panurge, friend, thou hast\nbeen afraid during the storm without cause or reason; for thou wert not\nborn to be drowned, but rather to be hanged and exalted in the air, or to\nbe roasted in the midst of a jolly bonfire.  My lord, would you have a good\ncloak for the rain; leave me off your wolf and badger-skin mantle; let\nPanurge but be flayed, and cover yourself with his hide.  But do not come\nnear the fire, nor near your blacksmith's forges, a God's name; for in a\nmoment you will see it in ashes.  Yet be as long as you please in the rain,\nsnow, hail, nay, by the devil's maker, throw yourself or dive down to the\nvery bottom of the water, I'll engage you'll not be wet at all.  Have some\nwinter boots made of it, they'll never take in a drop of water; make\nbladders of it to lay under boys to teach them to swim, instead of corks,\nand they will learn without the least danger.  His skin, then, said\nPantagruel, should be like the herb called true maiden's hair, which never\ntakes wet nor moistness, but still keeps dry, though you lay it at the\nbottom of the water as long as you please; and for that reason is called\nAdiantos.\n\nFriend Panurge, said Friar John, I pray thee never be afraid of water; thy\nlife for mine thou art threatened with a contrary element.  Ay, ay, replied\nPanurge, but the devil's cooks dote sometimes, and are apt to make horrid\nblunders as well as others; often putting to boil in water what was\ndesigned to be roasted on the fire; like the head-cooks of our kitchen, who\noften lard partridges, queests, and stock-doves with intent to roast them,\none would think; but it happens sometimes that they e'en turn the\npartridges into the pot to be boiled with cabbages, the queests with leek\npottage, and the stock-doves with turnips.  But hark you me, good friends,\nI protest before this noble company, that as for the chapel which I vowed\nto Mons. St. Nicholas between Quande and Montsoreau, I honestly mean that\nit shall be a chapel of rose-water, which shall be where neither cow nor\ncalf shall be fed; for between you and I, I intend to throw it to the\nbottom of the water.  Here is a rare rogue for you, said Eusthenes; here is\na pure rogue, a rogue in grain, a rogue enough, a rogue and a half.  He is\nresolved to make good the Lombardic proverb, Passato el pericolo, gabbato\nel santo.\n\n  The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;\n  The devil was well, the devil a monk was he.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXV.\n\nHow, after the storm, Pantagruel went on shore in the islands of the\nMacreons.\n\nImmediately after we went ashore at the port of an island which they called\nthe island of the Macreons.  The good people of the place received us very\nhonourably.  An old Macrobius (so they called their eldest elderman)\ndesired Pantagruel to come to the town-house to refresh himself and eat\nsomething, but he would not budge a foot from the mole till all his men\nwere landed.  After he had seen them, he gave order that they should all\nchange clothes, and that some of all the stores in the fleet should be\nbrought on shore, that every ship's crew might live well; which was\naccordingly done, and God wot how well they all toped and caroused.  The\npeople of the place brought them provisions in abundance.  The\nPantagruelists returned them more; as the truth is, theirs were somewhat\ndamaged by the late storm.  When they had well stuffed the insides of their\ndoublets, Pantagruel desired everyone to lend their help to repair the\ndamage; which they readily did.  It was easy enough to refit there; for all\nthe inhabitants of the island were carpenters and all such handicrafts as\nare seen in the arsenal at Venice.  None but the largest island was\ninhabited, having three ports and ten parishes; the rest being overrun with\nwood and desert, much like the forest of Arden.  We entreated the old\nMacrobius to show us what was worth seeing in the island; which he did; and\nin the desert and dark forest we discovered several old ruined temples,\nobelisks, pyramids, monuments, and ancient tombs, with divers inscriptions\nand epitaphs; some of them in hieroglyphic characters; others in the Ionic\ndialect; some in the Arabic, Agarenian, Slavonian, and other tongues; of\nwhich Epistemon took an exact account.  In the interim, Panurge said to\nFriar John, Is this the island of the Macreons?  Macreon signifies in Greek\nan old man, or one much stricken in years.  What is that to me? said Friar\nJohn; how can I help it?  I was not in the country when they christened it.\nNow I think on't, quoth Panurge, I believe the name of mackerel (Motteux\nadds, between brackets,--'that's a Bawd in French.') was derived from it;\nfor procuring is the province of the old, as buttock-riggling is that of\nthe young.  Therefore I do not know but this may be the bawdy or Mackerel\nIsland, the original and prototype of the island of that name at Paris.\nLet's go and dredge for cock-oysters.  Old Macrobius asked, in the Ionic\ntongue, How, and by what industry and labour, Pantagruel got to their port\nthat day, there having been such blustering weather and such a dreadful\nstorm at sea.  Pantagruel told him that the Almighty Preserver of mankind\nhad regarded the simplicity and sincere affection of his servants, who did\nnot travel for gain or sordid profit, the sole design of their voyage being\na studious desire to know, see, and visit the Oracle of Bacbuc, and take\nthe word of the Bottle upon some difficulties offered by one of the\ncompany; nevertheless this had not been without great affliction and\nevident danger of shipwreck.  After that, he asked him what he judged to be\nthe cause of that terrible tempest, and if the adjacent seas were thus\nfrequently subject to storms; as in the ocean are the Ratz of Sammaieu,\nMaumusson, and in the Mediterranean sea the Gulf of Sataly, Montargentan,\nPiombino, Capo Melio in Laconia, the Straits of Gibraltar, Faro di Messina,\nand others.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXVI.\n\nHow the good Macrobius gave us an account of the mansion and decease of the\nheroes.\n\nThe good Macrobius then answered, Friendly strangers, this island is one of\nthe Sporades; not of your Sporades that lie in the Carpathian sea, but one\nof the Sporades of the ocean; in former times rich, frequented, wealthy,\npopulous, full of traffic, and in the dominions of the rulers of Britain,\nbut now, by course of time, and in these latter ages of the world, poor and\ndesolate, as you see.  In this dark forest, above seventy-eight thousand\nPersian leagues in compass, is the dwelling-place of the demons and heroes\nthat are grown old, and we believe that some one of them died yesterday;\nsince the comet which we saw for three days before together, shines no\nmore; and now it is likely that at his death there arose this horrible\nstorm; for while they are alive all happiness attends both this and the\nadjacent islands, and a settled calm and serenity.  At the death of every\none of them, we commonly hear in the forest loud and mournful groans, and\nthe whole land is infested with pestilence, earthquakes, inundations, and\nother calamities; the air with fogs and obscurity, and the sea with storms\nand hurricanes.  What you tell us seems to me likely enough, said\nPantagruel.  For as a torch or candle, as long as it hath life enough and\nis lighted, shines round about, disperses its light, delights those that\nare near it, yields them its service and clearness, and never causes any\npain or displeasure; but as soon as 'tis extinguished, its smoke and\nevaporation infects the air, offends the bystanders, and is noisome to all;\nso, as long as those noble and renowned souls inhabit their bodies, peace,\nprofit, pleasure, and honour never leave the places where they abide; but\nas soon as they leave them, both the continent and adjacent islands are\nannoyed with great commotions; in the air fogs, darkness, thunder, hail;\ntremblings, pulsations, agitations of the earth; storms and hurricanes at\nsea; together with sad complaints amongst the people, broaching of\nreligions, changes in governments, and ruins of commonwealths.\n\nWe had a sad instance of this lately, said Epistemon, at the death of that\nvaliant and learned knight, William du Bellay; during whose life France\nenjoyed so much happiness, that all the rest of the world looked upon it\nwith envy, sought friendship with it, and stood in awe of its power; but\nsoon after his decease it hath for a considerable time been the scorn of\nthe rest of the world.\n\nThus, said Pantagruel, Anchises being dead at Drepani in Sicily, Aeneas was\ndreadfully tossed and endangered by a storm; and perhaps for the same\nreason Herod, that tyrant and cruel King of Judaea, finding himself near\nthe pangs of a horrid kind of death--for he died of a phthiriasis, devoured\nby vermin and lice; as before him died L. Sylla, Pherecydes the Syrian, the\npreceptor of Pythagoras, the Greek poet Alcmaeon, and others--and\nforeseeing that the Jews would make bonfires at his death, caused all the\nnobles and magistrates to be summoned to his seraglio out of all the\ncities, towns, and castles of Judaea, fraudulently pretending that he had\nsome things of moment to impart to them.  They made their personal\nappearance; whereupon he caused them all to be shut up in the hippodrome of\nthe seraglio; then said to his sister Salome and Alexander her husband:  I\nam certain that the Jews will rejoice at my death; but if you will observe\nand perform what I tell you, my funeral shall be honourable, and there will\nbe a general mourning.  As soon as you see me dead, let my guards, to whom\nI have already given strict commission to that purpose, kill all the\nnoblemen and magistrates that are secured in the hippodrome.  By these\nmeans all Jewry shall, in spite of themselves, be obliged to mourn and\nlament, and foreigners will imagine it to be for my death, as if some\nheroic soul had left her body.  A desperate tyrant wished as much when he\nsaid, When I die, let earth and fire be mixed together; which was as good\nas to say, let the whole world perish.  Which saying the tyrant Nero\naltered, saying, While I live, as Suetonius affirms it.  This detestable\nsaying, of which Cicero, lib. De Finib., and Seneca, lib. 2, De Clementia,\nmake mention, is ascribed to the Emperor Tiberius by Dion Nicaeus and\nSuidas.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXVII.\n\nPantagruel's discourse of the decease of heroic souls; and of the dreadful\nprodigies that happened before the death of the late Lord de Langey.\n\nI would not, continued Pantagruel, have missed the storm that hath thus\ndisordered us, were I also to have missed the relation of these things told\nus by this good Macrobius.  Neither am I unwilling to believe what he said\nof a comet that appears in the sky some days before such a decease.  For\nsome of those souls are so noble, so precious, and so heroic that heaven\ngives us notice of their departing some days before it happens.  And as a\nprudent physician, seeing by some symptoms that his patient draws towards\nhis end, some days before gives notice of it to his wife, children,\nkindred, and friends, that, in that little time he hath yet to live, they\nmay admonish him to settle all things in his family, to tutor and instruct\nhis children as much as he can, recommend his relict to his friends in her\nwidowhood, and declare what he knows to be necessary about a provision for\nthe orphans; that he may not be surprised by death without making his will,\nand may take care of his soul and family; in the same manner the heavens,\nas it were joyful for the approaching reception of those blessed souls,\nseem to make bonfires by those comets and blazing meteors, which they at\nthe same time kindly design should prognosticate to us here that in a few\ndays one of those venerable souls is to leave her body and this terrestrial\nglobe.  Not altogether unlike this was what was formerly done at Athens by\nthe judges of the Areopagus.  For when they gave their verdict to cast or\nclear the culprits that were tried before them, they used certain notes\naccording to the substance of the sentences; by Theta signifying\ncondemnation to death; by T, absolution; by A, ampliation or a demur, when\nthe case was not sufficiently examined.  Thus having publicly set up those\nletters, they eased the relations and friends of the prisoners, and such\nothers as desired to know their doom, of their doubts.  Likewise by these\ncomets, as in ethereal characters, the heavens silently say to us, Make\nhaste, mortals, if you would know or learn of the blessed souls anything\nconcerning the public good or your private interest; for their catastrophe\nis near, which being past, you will vainly wish for them afterwards.\n\nThe good-natured heavens still do more; and that mankind may be declared\nunworthy of the enjoyment of those renowned souls, they fright and astonish\nus with prodigies, monsters, and other foreboding signs that thwart the\norder of nature.\n\nOf this we had an instance several days before the decease of the heroic\nsoul of the learned and valiant Chevalier de Langey, of whom you have\nalready spoken.  I remember it, said Epistemon; and my heart still trembles\nwithin me when I think on the many dreadful prodigies that we saw five or\nsix days before he died.  For the Lords D'Assier, Chemant, one-eyed Mailly,\nSt. Ayl, Villeneufue-la-Guyart, Master Gabriel, physician of Savillan,\nRabelais, Cohuau, Massuau, Majorici, Bullou, Cercu, alias Bourgmaistre,\nFrancis Proust, Ferron, Charles Girard, Francis Bourre, and many other\nfriends and servants to the deceased, all dismayed, gazed on each other\nwithout uttering one word; yet not without foreseeing that France would in\na short time be deprived of a knight so accomplished and necessary for its\nglory and protection, and that heaven claimed him again as its due.  By the\ntufted tip of my cowl, cried Friar John, I am e'en resolved to become a\nscholar before I die.  I have a pretty good headpiece of my own, you must\nown.  Now pray give me leave to ask you a civil question.  Can these same\nheroes or demigods you talk of die?  May I never be damned if I was not so\nmuch a lobcock as to believe they had been immortal, like so many fine\nangels.  Heaven forgive me! but this most reverend father, Macroby, tells\nus they die at last.  Not all, returned Pantagruel.\n\nThe Stoics held them all to be mortal, except one, who alone is immortal,\nimpassible, invisible.  Pindar plainly saith that there is no more thread,\nthat is to say, no more life, spun from the distaff and flax of the\nhard-hearted Fates for the goddesses Hamadryades than there is for those\ntrees that are preserved by them, which are good, sturdy, downright oaks;\nwhence they derived their original, according to the opinion of Callimachus\nand Pausanias in Phoci.  With whom concurs Martianus Capella.  As for the\ndemigods, fauns, satyrs, sylvans, hobgoblins, aegipanes, nymphs, heroes, and\ndemons, several men have, from the total sum, which is the result of the\ndivers ages calculated by Hesiod, reckoned their life to be 9720 years; that\nsum consisting of four special numbers orderly arising from one, the same\nadded together and multiplied by four every way amounts to forty; these\nforties, being reduced into triangles by five times, make up the total of\nthe aforesaid number.  See Plutarch, in his book about the Cessation of\nOracles.\n\nThis, said Friar John, is not matter of breviary; I may believe as little\nor as much of it as you and I please.  I believe, said Pantagruel, that all\nintellectual souls are exempted from Atropos's scissors.  They are all\nimmortal, whether they be of angels, or demons, or human; yet I will tell\nyou a story concerning this that is very strange, but is written and\naffirmed by several learned historians.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXVIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel related a very sad story of the death of the heroes.\n\nEpitherses, the father of Aemilian the rhetorician, sailing from Greece to\nItaly in a ship freighted with divers goods and passengers, at night the\nwind failed 'em near the Echinades, some islands that lie between the Morea\nand Tunis, and the vessel was driven near Paxos.  When they were got\nthither, some of the passengers being asleep, others awake, the rest eating\nand drinking, a voice was heard that called aloud, Thamous! which cry\nsurprised them all.  This same Thamous was their pilot, an Egyptian by\nbirth, but known by name only to some few travellers.  The voice was heard\na second time calling Thamous, in a frightful tone; and none making answer,\nbut trembling and remaining silent, the voice was heard a third time, more\ndreadful than before.\n\nThis caused Thamous to answer:  Here am I; what dost thou call me for?\nWhat wilt thou have me do?  Then the voice, louder than before, bid him\npublish when he should come to Palodes, that the great god Pan was dead.\n\nEpitherses related that all the mariners and passengers, having heard this,\nwere extremely amazed and frighted; and that, consulting among themselves\nwhether they had best conceal or divulge what the voice had enjoined,\nThamous said his advice was that if they happened to have a fair wind they\nshould proceed without mentioning a word on't, but if they chanced to be\nbecalmed he would publish what he had heard.  Now when they were near\nPalodes they had no wind, neither were they in any current.  Thamous then\ngetting up on the top of the ship's forecastle, and casting his eyes on the\nshore, said that he had been commanded to proclaim that the great god Pan\nwas dead.  The words were hardly out of his mouth, when deep groans, great\nlamentations, and doleful shrieks, not of one person, but of many together,\nwere heard from the land.\n\nThe news of this--many being present then--was soon spread at Rome;\ninsomuch that Tiberius, who was then emperor, sent for this Thamous, and\nhaving heard him gave credit to his words.  And inquiring of the learned in\nhis court and at Rome who was that Pan, he found by their relation that he\nwas the son of Mercury and Penelope, as Herodotus and Cicero in his third\nbook of the Nature of the Gods had written before.\n\nFor my part, I understand it of that great Saviour of the faithful who was\nshamefully put to death at Jerusalem by the envy and wickedness of the\ndoctors, priests, and monks of the Mosaic law.  And methinks my\ninterpretation is not improper; for he may lawfully be said in the Greek\ntongue to be Pan, since he is our all.  For all that we are, all that we\nlive, all that we have, all that we hope, is him, by him, from him, and in\nhim.  He is the good Pan, the great shepherd, who, as the loving shepherd\nCorydon affirms, hath not only a tender love and affection for his sheep,\nbut also for their shepherds.  At his death, complaints, sighs, fears, and\nlamentations were spread through the whole fabric of the universe, whether\nheavens, land, sea, or hell.\n\nThe time also concurs with this interpretation of mine; for this most good,\nmost mighty Pan, our only Saviour, died near Jerusalem during the reign of\nTiberius Caesar.\n\nPantagruel, having ended this discourse, remained silent and full of\ncontemplation.  A little while after we saw the tears flow out of his eyes\nas big as ostrich's eggs.  God take me presently if I tell you one single\nsyllable of a lie in the matter.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXIX.\n\nHow Pantagruel sailed by the Sneaking Island, where Shrovetide reigned.\n\nThe jovial fleet being refitted and repaired, new stores taken in, the\nMacreons over and above satisfied and pleased with the money spent there by\nPantagruel, our men in better humour than they used to be, if possible, we\nmerrily put to sea the next day, near sunset, with a delicious fresh gale.\n\nXenomanes showed us afar off the Sneaking Island, where reigned Shrovetide,\nof whom Pantagruel had heard much talk formerly; for that reason he would\ngladly have seen him in person, had not Xenomanes advised him to the\ncontrary; first, because this would have been much out of our way, and then\nfor the lean cheer which he told us was to be found at that prince's court,\nand indeed all over the island.\n\nYou can see nothing there for your money, said he, but a huge greedy-guts,\na tall woundy swallower of hot wardens and mussels; a long-shanked\nmole-catcher; an overgrown bottler of hay; a mossy-chinned demi-giant, with\na double shaven crown, of lantern breed; a very great loitering noddy-peaked\nyoungster, banner-bearer to the fish-eating tribe, dictator of mustard-land,\nflogger of little children, calciner of ashes, father and foster-father to\nphysicians, swarming with pardons, indulgences, and stations; a very honest\nman; a good catholic, and as brimful of devotion as ever he can hold.\n\nHe weeps the three-fourth parts of the day, and never assists at any\nweddings; but, give the devil his due, he is the most industrious\nlarding-stick and skewer-maker in forty kingdoms.\n\nAbout six years ago, as I passed by Sneaking-land, I brought home a large\nskewer from thence, and made a present of it to the butchers of Quande, who\nset a great value upon them, and that for a cause.  Some time or other, if\never we live to come back to our own country, I will show you two of them\nfastened on the great church porch.  His usual food is pickled coats of\nmail, salt helmets and head-pieces, and salt sallets; which sometimes makes\nhim piss pins and needles.  As for his clothing, 'tis comical enough o'\nconscience, both for make and colour; for he wears grey and cold, nothing\nbefore, and nought behind, with the sleeves of the same.\n\nYou will do me a kindness, said Pantagruel, if, as you have described his\nclothes, food, actions, and pastimes, you will also give me an account of\nhis shape and disposition in all his parts.  Prithee do, dear cod, said\nFriar John, for I have found him in my breviary, and then follow the\nmovable holy days.  With all my heart, answered Xenomanes; we may chance to\nhear more of him as we touch at the Wild Island, the dominions of the squab\nChitterlings, his enemies, against whom he is eternally at odds; and were\nit not for the help of the noble Carnival, their protector and good\nneighbour, this meagre-looked lozelly Shrovetide would long before this\nhave made sad work among them, and rooted them out of their habitation.\nAre these same Chitterlings, said Friar John, male or female, angels or\nmortals, women or maids?  They are, replied Xenomanes, females in sex,\nmortal in kind, some of them maids, others not.  The devil have me, said\nFriar John, if I ben't for them.  What a shameful disorder in nature, is it\nnot, to make war against women?  Let's go back and hack the villain to\npieces.  What! meddle with Shrovetide? cried Panurge, in the name of\nBeelzebub, I am not yet so weary of my life.  No, I'm not yet so mad as\nthat comes to.  Quid juris?  Suppose we should find ourselves pent up\nbetween the Chitterlings and Shrovetide? between the anvil and the hammers?\nShankers and buboes! stand off! godzooks, let us make the best of our way.\nI bid you good night, sweet Mr. Shrovetide; I recommend to you the\nChitterlings, and pray don't forget the puddings.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXX.\n\nHow Shrovetide is anatomized and described by Xenomanes.\n\nAs for the inward parts of Shrovetide, said Xenomanes; his brain is (at\nleast, it was in my time) in bigness, colours, substance, and strength,\nmuch like the left cod of a he hand-worm.\n\nThe ventricles of his said brain,     The stomach, like a belt.\n  like an auger.

I'll tell you what I read of them in some\nancient apologues, replied Pantagruel.\n\nPhysis--that is to say, Nature--at her first burthen begat Beauty and\nHarmony without carnal copulation, being of herself very fruitful and\nprolific.  Antiphysis, who ever was the counter part of Nature,\nimmediately, out of a malicious spite against her for her beautiful and\nhonourable productions, in opposition begot Amodunt and Dissonance by\ncopulation with Tellumon.  Their heads were round like a football, and not\ngently flatted on both sides, like the common shape of men.  Their ears\nstood pricked up like those of asses; their eyes, as hard as those of\ncrabs, and without brows, stared out of their heads, fixed on bones like\nthose of our heels; their feet were round like tennis-balls; their arms and\nhands turned backwards towards their shoulders; and they walked on their\nheads, continually turning round like a ball, topsy-turvy, heels over head.\n\nYet--as you know that apes esteem their young the handsomest in the world\n--Antiphysis extolled her offspring, and strove to prove that their shape\nwas handsomer and neater than that of the children of Physis, saying that\nthus to have spherical heads and feet, and walk in a circular manner,\nwheeling round, had something in it of the perfection of the divine power,\nwhich makes all beings eternally turn in that fashion; and that to have our\nfeet uppermost, and the head below them, was to imitate the Creator of the\nuniverse; the hair being like the roots, and the legs like the branches of\nman; for trees are better planted by their roots than they could be by their\nbranches.  By this demonstration she implied that her children were much\nmore to be praised for being like a standing tree, than those of Physis,\nthat made a figure of a tree upside down.  As for the arms and hands, she\npretended to prove that they were more justly turned towards the shoulders,\nbecause that part of the body ought not to be without defence, while the\nforepart is duly fenced with teeth, which a man cannot only use to chew, but\nalso to defend himself against those things that offend him. Thus, by the\ntestimony and astipulation of the brute beasts, she drew all the witless\nherd and mob of fools into her opinion, and was admired by all brainless and\nnonsensical people.\n\nSince that, she begot the hypocritical tribes of eavesdropping dissemblers,\nsuperstitious pope-mongers, and priest-ridden bigots, the frantic\nPistolets, (the demoniacal Calvins, impostors of Geneva,) the scrapers of\nbenefices, apparitors with the devil in them, and other grinders and\nsqueezers of livings, herb-stinking hermits, gulligutted dunces of the\ncowl, church vermin, false zealots, devourers of the substance of men, and\nmany more other deformed and ill-favoured monsters, made in spite of\nnature.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel discovered a monstrous physeter, or whirlpool, near the Wild\nIsland.\n\nAbout sunset, coming near the Wild Island, Pantagruel spied afar off a huge\nmonstrous physeter (a sort of whale, which some call a whirlpool), that\ncame right upon us, neighing, snorting, raised above the waves higher than\nour main-tops, and spouting water all the way into the air before itself,\nlike a large river falling from a mountain.  Pantagruel showed it to the\npilot and to Xenomanes.\n\nBy the pilot's advice the trumpets of the Thalamege were sounded to warn\nall the fleet to stand close and look to themselves.  This alarm being\ngiven, all the ships, galleons, frigates, brigantines, according to their\nnaval discipline, placed themselves in the order and figure of an Y\n(upsilon), the letter of Pythagoras, as cranes do in their flight, and like\nan acute angle, in whose cone and basis the Thalamege placed herself ready\nto fight smartly.  Friar John with the grenadiers got on the forecastle.\n\nPoor Panurge began to cry and howl worse than ever.  Babille-babou, said\nhe, shrugging up his shoulders, quivering all over with fear, there will be\nthe devil upon dun.  This is a worse business than that t'other day.  Let\nus fly, let us fly; old Nick take me if it is not Leviathan, described by\nthe noble prophet Moses in the life of patient Job.  It will swallow us\nall, ships and men, shag, rag, and bobtail, like a dose of pills.  Alas! it\nwill make no more of us, and we shall hold no more room in its hellish\njaws, than a sugarplum in an ass's throat.  Look, look, 'tis upon us; let\nus wheel off, whip it away, and get ashore.  I believe 'tis the very\nindividual sea-monster that was formerly designed to devour Andromeda; we\nare all undone.  Oh! for some valiant Perseus here now to kill the dog.\n\nI'll do its business presently, said Pantagruel; fear nothing.  Ods-belly,\nsaid Panurge, remove the cause of my fear then.  When the devil would you\nhave a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?  If your destiny be\nsuch as Friar John was saying a while ago, replied Pantagruel, you ought to\nbe afraid of Pyroeis, Eous, Aethon, and Phlegon, the sun's coach-horses,\nthat breathe fire at the nostrils; and not of physeters, that spout nothing\nbut water at the snout and mouth.  Their water will not endanger your life;\nand that element will rather save and preserve than hurt or endanger you.\n\nAy, ay, trust to that, and hang me, quoth Panurge; yours is a very pretty\nfancy.  Ods-fish! did I not give you a sufficient account of the elements'\ntransmutation, and the blunders that are made of roast for boiled, and\nboiled for roast?  Alas! here 'tis; I'll go hide myself below.  We are dead\nmen, every mother's son of us.  I see upon our main-top that merciless hag\nAtropos, with her scissors new ground, ready to cut our threads all at one\nsnip.  Oh! how dreadful and abominable thou art; thou hast drowned a good\nmany beside us, who never made their brags of it.  Did it but spout good,\nbrisk, dainty, delicious white wine, instead of this damned bitter salt\nwater, one might better bear with it, and there would be some cause to be\npatient; like that English lord, who being doomed to die, and had leave to\nchoose what kind of death he would, chose to be drowned in a butt of\nmalmsey.  Here it is.  Oh, oh! devil!  Sathanas!  Leviathan!  I cannot\nabide to look upon thee, thou art so abominably ugly.  Go to the bar, go\ntake the pettifoggers.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXIV.\n\nHow the monstrous physeter was slain by Pantagruel.\n\nThe physeter, coming between the ships and the galleons, threw water by\nwhole tuns upon them, as if it had been the cataracts of the Nile in\nEthiopia.  On the other side, arrows, darts, gleaves, javelins, spears,\nharping-irons, and partizans, flew upon it like hail.  Friar John did not\nspare himself in it.  Panurge was half dead for fear.  The artillery roared\nand thundered like mad, and seemed to gall it in good earnest, but did but\nlittle good; for the great iron and brass cannon-shot entering its skin\nseemed to melt like tiles in the sun.\n\nPantagruel then, considering the weight and exigency of the matter,\nstretched out his arms and showed what he could do.  You tell us, and it is\nrecorded, that Commudus, the Roman emperor, could shoot with a bow so\ndexterously that at a good distance he would let fly an arrow through a\nchild's fingers and never touch them.  You also tell us of an Indian\narcher, who lived when Alexander the Great conquered India, and was so\nskilful in drawing the bow, that at a considerable distance he would shoot\nhis arrows through a ring, though they were three cubits long, and their\niron so large and weighty that with them he used to pierce steel cutlasses,\nthick shields, steel breastplates, and generally what he did hit, how firm,\nresisting, hard, and strong soever it were.  You also tell us wonders of\nthe industry of the ancient Franks, who were preferred to all others in\npoint of archery; and when they hunted either black or dun beasts, used to\nrub the head of their arrows with hellebore, because the flesh of the\nvenison struck with such an arrow was more tender, dainty, wholesome, and\ndelicious--paring off, nevertheless, the part that was touched round about.\nYou also talk of the Parthians, who used to shoot backwards more\ndexterously than other nations forwards; and also celebrate the skill of\nthe Scythians in that art, who sent once to Darius, King of Persia, an\nambassador that made him a present of a bird, a frog, a mouse, and five\narrows, without speaking one word; and being asked what those presents\nmeant, and if he had commission to say anything, answered that he had not;\nwhich puzzled and gravelled Darius very much, till Gobrias, one of the\nseven captains that had killed the magi, explained it, saying to Darius:\nBy these gifts and offerings the Scythians silently tell you that except\nthe Persians like birds fly up to heaven, or like mice hide themselves near\nthe centre of the earth, or like frogs dive to the very bottom of ponds and\nlakes, they shall be destroyed by the power and arrows of the Scythians.\n\nThe noble Pantagruel was, without comparison, more admirable yet in the art\nof shooting and darting; for with his dreadful piles and darts, nearly\nresembling the huge beams that support the bridges of Nantes, Saumur,\nBergerac, and at Paris the millers' and the changers' bridges, in length,\nsize, weight, and iron-work, he at a mile's distance would open an oyster\nand never touch the edges; he would snuff a candle without putting it out;\nwould shoot a magpie in the eye; take off a boot's under-sole, or a\nriding-hood's lining, without soiling them a bit; turn over every leaf\nof Friar John's breviary, one after another, and not tear one.\n\nWith such darts, of which there was good store in the ship, at the first\nblow he ran the physeter in at the forehead so furiously that he pierced\nboth its jaws and tongue; so that from that time to this it no more opened\nits guttural trapdoor, nor drew and spouted water.  At the second blow he\nput out its right eye, and at the third its left; and we had all the\npleasure to see the physeter bearing those three horns in its forehead,\nsomewhat leaning forwards in an equilateral triangle.\n\nMeanwhile it turned about to and fro, staggering and straying like one\nstunned, blinded, and taking his leave of the world.  Pantagruel, not\nsatisfied with this, let fly another dart, which took the monster under the\ntail likewise sloping; then with three other on the chine, in a\nperpendicular line, divided its flank from the tail to the snout at an\nequal distance.  Then he larded it with fifty on one side, and after that,\nto make even work, he darted as many on its other side; so that the body of\nthe physeter seemed like the hulk of a galleon with three masts, joined by\na competent dimension of its beams, as if they had been the ribs and\nchain-wales of the keel; which was a pleasant sight.  The physeter then\ngiving up the ghost, turned itself upon its back, as all dead fishes do; and\nbeing thus overturned, with the beams and darts upside down in the sea, it\nseemed a scolopendra or centipede, as that serpent is described by the\nancient sage Nicander.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXV.\n\nHow Pantagruel went on shore in the Wild Island, the ancient abode of the\nChitterlings.\n\nThe boat's crew of the ship Lantern towed the physeter ashore on the\nneighbouring shore, which happened to be the Wild Island, to make an\nanatomical dissection of its body and save the fat of its kidneys, which,\nthey said, was very useful and necessary for the cure of a certain\ndistemper, which they called want of money.  As for Pantagruel, he took no\nmanner of notice of the monster; for he had seen many such, nay, bigger, in\nthe Gallic ocean.  Yet he condescended to land in the Wild Island, to dry\nand refresh some of his men (whom the physeter had wetted and bedaubed), at\na small desert seaport towards the south, seated near a fine pleasant\ngrove, out of which flowed a delicious brook of fresh, clear, and purling\nwater.  Here they pitched their tents and set up their kitchens; nor did\nthey spare fuel.\n\nEveryone having shifted as they thought fit, Friar John rang the bell, and\nthe cloth was immediately laid, and supper brought in.  Pantagruel eating\ncheerfully with his men, much about the second course perceived certain\nlittle sly Chitterlings clambering up a high tree near the pantry, as still\nas so many mice.  Which made him ask Xenomanes what kind of creatures these\nwere, taking them for squirrels, weasels, martins, or ermines.  They are\nChitterlings, replied Xenomanes.  This is the Wild Island of which I spoke\nto you this morning; there hath been an irreconcilable war this long time\nbetween them and Shrovetide, their malicious and ancient enemy.  I believe\nthat the noise of the guns which we fired at the physeter hath alarmed\nthem, and made them fear their enemy was come with his forces to surprise\nthem, or lay the island waste, as he hath often attempted to do; though he\nstill came off but bluely, by reason of the care and vigilance of the\nChitterlings, who (as Dido said to Aeneas's companions that would have\nlanded at Carthage without her leave or knowledge) were forced to watch and\nstand upon their guard, considering the malice of their enemy and the\nneighbourhood of his territories.\n\nPray, dear friend, said Pantagruel, if you find that by some honest means\nwe may bring this war to an end, and reconcile them together, give me\nnotice of it; I will use my endeavours in it with all my heart, and spare\nnothing on my side to moderate and accommodate the points in dispute\nbetween both parties.\n\nThat's impossible at this time, answered Xenomanes.  About four years ago,\npassing incognito by this country, I endeavoured to make a peace, or at\nleast a long truce among them; and I had certainly brought them to be good\nfriends and neighbours if both one and the other parties would have yielded\nto one single article.  Shrovetide would not include in the treaty of peace\nthe wild puddings nor the highland sausages, their ancient gossips and\nconfederates.  The Chitterlings demanded that the fort of Cacques might be\nunder their government, as is the Castle of Sullouoir, and that a parcel of\nI don't know what stinking villains, murderers, robbers, that held it then,\nshould be expelled.  But they could not agree in this, and the terms that\nwere offered seemed too hard to either party.  So the treaty broke off, and\nnothing was done.  Nevertheless, they became less severe, and gentler\nenemies than they were before; but since the denunciation of the national\nCouncil of Chesil, whereby they were roughly handled, hampered, and cited;\nwhereby also Shrovetide was declared filthy, beshitten, and berayed, in\ncase he made any league or agreement with them; they are grown wonderfully\ninveterate, incensed, and obstinate against one another, and there is no\nway to remedy it.  You might sooner reconcile cats and rats, or hounds and\nhares together.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXVI.\n\nHow the wild Chitterlings laid an ambuscado for Pantagruel.\n\nWhile Xenomanes was saying this, Friar John spied twenty or thirty young\nslender-shaped Chitterlings posting as fast as they could towards their\ntown, citadel, castle, and fort of Chimney, and said to Pantagruel, I smell\na rat; there will be here the devil upon two sticks, or I am much out.\nThese worshipful Chitterlings may chance to mistake you for Shrovetide,\nthough you are not a bit like him.  Let us once in our lives leave our\njunketing for a while, and put ourselves in a posture to give 'em a\nbellyful of fighting, if they would be at that sport.  There can be no\nfalse Latin in this, said Xenomanes; Chitterlings are still Chitterlings,\nalways double-hearted and treacherous.\n\nPantagruel then arose from table to visit and scour the thicket, and\nreturned presently; having discovered, on the left, an ambuscade of squab\nChitterlings; and on the right, about half a league from thence, a large\nbody of huge giant-like armed Chitterlings ranged in battalia along a\nlittle hill, and marching furiously towards us at the sound of bagpipes,\nsheep's paunches, and bladders, the merry fifes and drums, trumpets, and\nclarions, hoping to catch us as Moss caught his mare.  By the conjecture of\nseventy-eight standards which we told, we guessed their number to be two\nand forty thousand, at a modest computation.\n\nTheir order, proud gait, and resolute looks made us judge that they were\nnone of your raw, paltry links, but old warlike Chitterlings and Sausages.\nFrom the foremost ranks to the colours they were all armed cap-a-pie with\nsmall arms, as we reckoned them at a distance, yet very sharp and\ncase-hardened.  Their right and left wings were lined with a great number of\nforest puddings, heavy pattipans, and horse sausages, all of them tall and\nproper islanders, banditti, and wild.\n\nPantagruel was very much daunted, and not without cause; though Epistemon\ntold him that it might be the use and custom of the Chitterlingonians to\nwelcome and receive thus in arms their foreign friends, as the noble kings\nof France are received and saluted at their first coming into the chief\ncities of the kingdom after their advancement to the crown.  Perhaps, said\nhe, it may be the usual guard of the queen of the place, who, having notice\ngiven her by the junior Chitterlings of the forlorn hope whom you saw on\nthe tree, of the arrival of your fine and pompous fleet, hath judged that\nit was without doubt some rich and potent prince, and is come to visit you\nin person.\n\nPantagruel, little trusting to this, called a council, to have their advice\nat large in this doubtful case.  He briefly showed them how this way of\nreception with arms had often, under colour of compliment and friendship,\nbeen fatal.  Thus, said he, the Emperor Antonius Caracalla at one time\ndestroyed the citizens of Alexandria, and at another time cut off the\nattendants of Artabanus, King of Persia, under colour of marrying his\ndaughter, which, by the way, did not pass unpunished, for a while after\nthis cost him his life.\n\nThus Jacob's children destroyed the Sichemites, to revenge the rape of\ntheir sister Dinah.  By such another hypocritical trick Gallienus, the\nRoman emperor, put to death the military men in Constantinople.  Thus,\nunder colour of friendship, Antonius enticed Artavasdes, King of Armenia;\nthen, having caused him to be bound in heavy chains and shackled, at last\nput him to death.\n\nWe find a thousand such instances in history; and King Charles VI. is\njustly commended for his prudence to this day, in that, coming back\nvictorious over the Ghenters and other Flemings to his good city of Paris,\nand when he came to Bourget, a league from thence, hearing that the\ncitizens with their mallets--whence they got the name of Maillotins--were\nmarched out of town in battalia, twenty thousand strong, he would not go\ninto the town till they had laid down their arms and retired to their\nrespective homes; though they protested to him that they had taken arms\nwith no other design than to receive him with the greater demonstration of\nhonour and respect.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel sent for Colonel Maul-chitterling and Colonel Cut-pudding;\nwith a discourse well worth your hearing about the names of places and\npersons.\n\nThe resolution of the council was that, let things be how they would, it\nbehoved the Pantagruelists to stand upon their guard.  Therefore Carpalin\nand Gymnast were ordered by Pantagruel to go for the soldiers that were on\nboard the Cup galley, under the command of Colonel Maul-chitterling, and\nthose on board the Vine-tub frigate, under the command of Colonel\nCut-pudding the younger.  I will ease Gymnast of that trouble, said Panurge,\nwho wanted to be upon the run; you may have occasion for him here.  By\nthis worthy frock of mine, quoth Friar John, thou hast a mind to slip thy\nneck out of the collar and absent thyself from the fight, thou\nwhite-livered son of a dunghill!  Upon my virginity thou wilt never come\nback. Well, there can be no great loss in thee; for thou wouldst do nothing\nhere but howl, bray, weep, and dishearten the good soldiers.  I will\ncertainly come back, said Panurge, Friar John, my ghostly father, and\nspeedily too; do but take care that these plaguy Chitterlings do not board\nour ships. All the while you will be a-fighting I will pray heartily for\nyour victory, after the example of the valiant captain and guide of the\npeople of Israel, Moses. Having said this, he wheeled off.\n\nThen said Epistemon to Pantagruel:  The denomination of these two colonels\nof yours, Maul-chitterling and Cut-pudding, promiseth us assurance,\nsuccess, and victory, if those Chitterlings should chance to set upon us.\nYou take it rightly, said Pantagruel, and it pleaseth me to see you foresee\nand prognosticate our victory by the names of our colonels.\n\nThis way of foretelling by names is not new; it was in old times celebrated\nand religiously observed by the Pythagoreans.  Several great princes and\nemperors have formerly made good use of it.  Octavianus Augustus, second\nemperor of the Romans, meeting on a day a country fellow named Eutychus\n--that is, fortunate--driving an ass named Nicon--that is, in Greek,\nVictorian--moved by the signification of the ass's and ass-driver's names,\nremained assured of all prosperity and victory.\n\nThe Emperor Vespasian being once all alone at prayers in the temple of\nSerapis, at the sight and unexpected coming of a certain servant of his\nnamed Basilides--that is, royal--whom he had left sick a great way behind,\ntook hopes and assurance of obtaining the empire of the Romans.  Regilian\nwas chosen emperor by the soldiers for no other reason but the\nsignification of his name.  See the Cratylus of the divine Plato.  (By my\nthirst, I will read it, said Rhizotome; I hear you so often quote it.)  See\nhow the Pythagoreans, by reason of the names and numbers, conclude that\nPatroclus was to fall by the hand of Hector; Hector by Achilles; Achilles\nby Paris; Paris by Philoctetes.  I am quite lost in my understanding when I\nreflect upon the admirable invention of Pythagoras, who by the number,\neither even or odd, of the syllables of every name, would tell you of what\nside a man was lame, hulch-backed, blind, gouty, troubled with the palsy,\npleurisy, or any other distemper incident to humankind; allotting even\nnumbers to the left (Motteux reads--'even numbers to the Right, and odd\nones to the Left.'), and odd ones to the right side of the body.\n\nIndeed, said Epistemon, I saw this way of syllabizing tried at Xaintes at a\ngeneral procession, in the presence of that good, virtuous, learned and\njust president, Brian Vallee, Lord of Douhait.  When there went by a man or\nwoman that was either lame, blind of one eye, or humpbacked, he had an\naccount brought him of his or her name; and if the syllables of the name\nwere of an odd number, immediately, without seeing the persons, he declared\nthem to be deformed, blind, lame, or crooked of the right side; and of the\nleft, if they were even in number; and such indeed we ever found them.\n\nBy this syllabical invention, said Pantagruel, the learned have affirmed\nthat Achilles kneeling was wounded by the arrow of Paris in the right heel,\nfor his name is of odd syllables (here we ought to observe that the\nancients used to kneel the right foot); and that Venus was also wounded\nbefore Troy in the left hand, for her name in Greek is Aphrodite, of four\nsyllables; Vulcan lamed of his left foot for the same reason; Philip, King\nof Macedon, and Hannibal, blind of the right eye; not to speak of\nsciaticas, broken bellies, and hemicranias, which may be distinguished by\nthis Pythagorean reason.\n\nBut returning to names:  do but consider how Alexander the Great, son of\nKing Philip, of whom we spoke just now, compassed his undertaking merely by\nthe interpretation of a name.  He had besieged the strong city of Tyre, and\nfor several weeks battered it with all his power; but all in vain.  His\nengines and attempts were still baffled by the Tyrians, which made him\nfinally resolve to raise the siege, to his great grief; foreseeing the\ngreat stain which such a shameful retreat would be to his reputation.  In\nthis anxiety and agitation of mind he fell asleep and dreamed that a satyr\nwas come into his tent, capering, skipping, and tripping it up and down,\nwith his goatish hoofs, and that he strove to lay hold on him.  But the\nsatyr still slipped from him, till at last, having penned him up into a\ncorner, he took him.  With this he awoke, and telling his dream to the\nphilosophers and sages of his court, they let him know that it was a\npromise of victory from the gods, and that he should soon be master of\nTyre; the word satyros divided in two being sa Tyros, and signifying Tyre\nis thine; and in truth, at the next onset, he took the town by storm, and\nby a complete victory reduced that stubborn people to subjection.\n\nOn the other hand, see how, by the signification of one word, Pompey fell\ninto despair.  Being overcome by Caesar at the battle of Pharsalia, he had\nno other way left to escape but by flight; which attempting by sea, he\narrived near the island of Cyprus, and perceived on the shore near the city\nof Paphos a beautiful and stately palace; now asking the pilot what was the\nname of it, he told him that it was called kakobasilea, that is, evil king;\nwhich struck such a dread and terror in him that he fell into despair, as\nbeing assured of losing shortly his life; insomuch that his complaints,\nsighs, and groans were heard by the mariners and other passengers.  And\nindeed, a while after, a certain strange peasant, called Achillas, cut off\nhis head.\n\nTo all these examples might be added what happened to L. Paulus Emilius\nwhen the senate elected him imperator, that is, chief of the army which\nthey sent against Perses, King of Macedon.  That evening returning home to\nprepare for his expedition, and kissing a little daughter of his called\nTrasia, she seemed somewhat sad to him.  What is the matter, said he, my\nchicken?  Why is my Trasia thus sad and melancholy?  Daddy, replied the\nchild, Persa is dead.  This was the name of a little bitch which she loved\nmightily.  Hearing this, Paulus took assurance of a victory over Perses.\n\nIf time would permit us to discourse of the sacred Hebrew writ, we might\nfind a hundred noted passages evidently showing how religiously they\nobserved proper names and their significations.\n\nHe had hardly ended this discourse, when the two colonels arrived with\ntheir soldiers, all well armed and resolute.  Pantagruel made them a short\nspeech, entreating them to behave themselves bravely in case they were\nattacked; for he could not yet believe that the Chitterlings were so\ntreacherous; but he bade them by no means to give the first offence, giving\nthem Carnival for the watchword.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXVIII.\n\nHow Chitterlings are not to be slighted by men.\n\nYou shake your empty noddles now, jolly topers, and do not believe what I\ntell you here, any more than if it were some tale of a tub.  Well, well, I\ncannot help it.  Believe it if you will; if you won't, let it alone.  For\nmy part, I very well know what I say.  It was in the Wild Island, in our\nvoyage to the Holy Bottle.  I tell you the time and place; what would you\nhave more?  I would have you call to mind the strength of the ancient\ngiants that undertook to lay the high mountain Pelion on the top of Ossa,\nand set among those the shady Olympus, to dash out the gods' brains,\nunnestle them, and scour their heavenly lodgings.  Theirs was no small\nstrength, you may well think, and yet they were nothing but Chitterlings\nfrom the waist downwards, or at least serpents, not to tell a lie for the\nmatter.\n\nThe serpent that tempted Eve, too, was of the Chitterling kind, and yet it\nis recorded of him that he was more subtle than any beast of the field.\nEven so are Chitterlings.  Nay, to this very hour they hold in some\nuniversities that this same tempter was the Chitterling called Ithyphallus,\ninto which was transformed bawdy Priapus, arch-seducer of females in\nparadise, that is, a garden, in Greek.\n\nPray now tell me who can tell but that the Swiss, now so bold and warlike,\nwere formerly Chitterlings?  For my part, I would not take my oath to the\ncontrary.  The Himantopodes, a nation very famous in Ethiopia, according to\nPliny's description, are Chitterlings, and nothing else.  If all this will\nnot satisfy your worships, or remove your incredulity, I would have you\nforthwith (I mean drinking first, that nothing be done rashly) visit\nLusignan, Parthenay, Vouant, Mervant, and Ponzauges in Poitou.  There you\nwill find a cloud of witnesses, not of your affidavit-men of the right\nstamp, but credible time out of mind, that will take their corporal oath,\non Rigome's knuckle-bone, that Melusina their founder or foundress, which\nyou please, was woman from the head to the prick-purse, and thence\ndownwards was a serpentine Chitterling, or if you'll have it otherwise, a\nChitterlingdized serpent.  She nevertheless had a genteel and noble gait,\nimitated to this very day by your hop-merchants of Brittany, in their\npaspie and country dances.\n\nWhat do you think was the cause of Erichthonius's being the first inventor\nof coaches, litters, and chariots?  Nothing but because Vulcan had begot\nhim with Chitterlingdized legs, which to hide he chose to ride in a litter,\nrather than on horseback; for Chitterlings were not yet in esteem at that\ntime.\n\nThe Scythian nymph, Ora, was likewise half woman and half Chitterling, and\nyet seemed so beautiful to Jupiter that nothing could serve him but he must\ngive her a touch of his godship's kindness; and accordingly he had a brave\nboy by her, called Colaxes; and therefore I would have you leave off\nshaking your empty noddles at this, as if it were a story, and firmly\nbelieve that nothing is truer than the gospel.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XXXIX.\n\nHow Friar John joined with the cooks to fight the Chitterlings.\n\nFriar John seeing these furious Chitterlings thus boldly march up, said to\nPantagruel, Here will be a rare battle of hobby-horses, a pretty kind of\npuppet-show fight, for aught I see.  Oh! what mighty honour and wonderful\nglory will attend our victory!  I would have you only be a bare spectator\nof this fight, and for anything else leave me and my men to deal with them.\nWhat men? said Pantagruel.  Matter of breviary, replied Friar John.  How\ncame Potiphar, who was head-cook of Pharaoh's kitchens, he that bought\nJoseph, and whom the said Joseph might have made a cuckold if he had not\nbeen a Joseph; how came he, I say, to be made general of all the horse in\nthe kingdom of Egypt?  Why was Nabuzardan, King Nebuchadnezzar's head-cook,\nchosen to the exclusion of all other captains to besiege and destroy\nJerusalem?  I hear you, replied Pantagruel.  By St. Christopher's whiskers,\nsaid Friar John, I dare lay a wager that it was because they had formerly\nengaged Chitterlings, or men as little valued; whom to rout, conquer, and\ndestroy, cooks are without comparison more fit than cuirassiers and\ngendarmes armed at all points, or all the horse and foot in the world.\n\nYou put me in mind, said Pantagruel, of what is written amongst the\nfacetious and merry sayings of Cicero.  During the more than civil wars\nbetween Caesar and Pompey, though he was much courted by the first, he\nnaturally leaned more to the side of the latter.  Now one day hearing that\nthe Pompeians in a certain rencontre had lost a great many men, he took a\nfancy to visit their camp.  There he perceived little strength, less\ncourage, but much disorder.  From that time, foreseeing that things would\ngo ill with them, as it since happened, he began to banter now one and then\nanother, and be very free of his cutting jests; so some of Pompey's\ncaptains, playing the good fellows to show their assurance, told him, Do\nyou see how many eagles we have yet?  (They were then the device of the\nRomans in war.)  They might be of use to you, replied Cicero, if you had to\ndo with magpies.\n\nThus, seeing we are to fight Chitterlings, pursued Pantagruel, you infer\nthence that it is a culinary war, and have a mind to join with the cooks.\nWell, do as you please, I'll stay here in the meantime, and wait for the\nevent of the rumpus.\n\nFriar John went that very moment among the sutlers, into the cooks' tents,\nand told them in a pleasing manner:  I must see you crowned with honour and\ntriumph this day, my lads; to your arms are reserved such achievements as\nnever yet were performed within the memory of man.  Ods-belly, do they make\nnothing of the valiant cooks?  Let us go fight yonder fornicating\nChitterlings!  I'll be your captain.  But first let's drink, boys.  Come\non! let us be of good cheer.  Noble captain, returned the kitchen tribe,\nthis was spoken like yourself; bravely offered.  Huzza! we are all at your\nexcellency's command, and we live and die by you.  Live, live, said Friar\nJohn, a God's name; but die by no means.  That is the Chitterlings' lot;\nthey shall have their bellyful of it.  Come on then, let us put ourselves\nin order; Nabuzardan's the word.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XL.\n\nHow Friar John fitted up the sow; and of the valiant cooks that went into\nit.\n\nThen, by Friar John's order, the engineers and their workmen fitted up the\ngreat sow that was in the ship Leathern Bottle.  It was a wonderful\nmachine, so contrived that, by means of large engines that were round about\nit in rows, it throw'd forked iron bars and four-squared steel bolts; and\nin its hold two hundred men at least could easily fight, and be sheltered.\nIt was made after the model of the sow of Riole, by the means of which\nBergerac was retaken from the English in the reign of Charles the Sixth.\n\nHere are the names of the noble and valiant cooks who went into the sow, as\nthe Greeks did into the Trojan horse:\n\nSour-sauce.

Hasty.             Calf's-pluck.\nFrig-palate.       Red-herring.       Leather-breeches.\nPowdering-tub.     Cheesecake.\n\nAll these noble cooks went into the sow, merry, cheery, hale, brisk, old\ndogs at mischief, and ready to fight stoutly.  Friar John ever and anon\nwaving his huge scimitar, brought up the rear, and double-locked the doors\non the inside.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLI.\n\nHow Pantagruel broke the Chitterlings at the knees.\n\nThe Chitterlings advanced so near that Pantagruel perceived that they\nstretched their arms and already began to charge their lances, which caused\nhim to send Gymnast to know what they meant, and why they thus, without the\nleast provocation, came to fall upon their old trusty friends, who had\nneither said nor done the least ill thing to them.  Gymnast being advanced\nnear their front, bowed very low, and said to them as loud as ever he\ncould:  We are friends, we are friends; all, all of us your friends, yours,\nand at your command; we are for Carnival, your old confederate.  Some have\nsince told me that he mistook, and said cavernal instead of carnival.\n\nWhatever it was, the word was no sooner out of his mouth but a huge little\nsquab Sausage, starting out of the front of their main body, would have\ngriped him by the collar.  By the helmet of Mars, said Gymnast, I will\nswallow thee; but thou shalt only come in in chips and slices; for, big as\nthou art, thou couldst never come in whole.  This spoke, he lugs out his\ntrusty sword, Kiss-mine-arse (so he called it) with both his fists, and cut\nthe Sausage in twain.  Bless me, how fat the foul thief was! it puts me in\nmind of the huge bull of Berne, that was slain at Marignan when the drunken\nSwiss were so mauled there.  Believe me, it had little less than four\ninches' lard on its paunch.\n\nThe Sausage's job being done, a crowd of others flew upon Gymnast, and had\nmost scurvily dragged him down when Pantagruel with his men came up to his\nrelief.  Then began the martial fray, higgledy-piggledy.  Maul-chitterling\ndid maul chitterlings; Cut-pudding did cut puddings; Pantagruel did break\nthe Chitterlings at the knees; Friar John played at least in sight within\nhis sow, viewing and observing all things; when the Pattipans that lay in\nambuscade most furiously sallied out upon Pantagruel.\n\nFriar John, who lay snug all this while, by that time perceiving the rout\nand hurlyburly, set open the doors of his sow and sallied out with his\nmerry Greeks, some of them armed with iron spits, others with andirons,\nracks, fire-shovels, frying-pans, kettles, grid-irons, oven forks, tongs,\ndripping pans, brooms, iron pots, mortars, pestles, all in battle array,\nlike so many housebreakers, hallooing and roaring out all together most\nfrightfully, Nabuzardan, Nabuzardan, Nabuzardan.  Thus shouting and hooting\nthey fought like dragons, and charged through the Pattipans and Sausages.\nThe Chitterlings perceiving this fresh reinforcement, and that the others\nwould be too hard for 'em, betook themselves to their heels, scampering off\nwith full speed, as if the devil had come for them.  Friar John, with an\niron crow, knocked them down as fast as hops; his men, too, were not\nsparing on their side.  Oh, what a woeful sight it was! the field was all\nover strewed with heaps of dead or wounded Chitterlings; and history\nrelates that had not heaven had a hand in it, the Chitterling tribe had\nbeen totally routed out of the world by the culinary champions.  But there\nhappened a wonderful thing, you may believe as little or as much of it as\nyou please.\n\nFrom the north flew towards us a huge, fat, thick, grizzly swine, with long\nand large wings, like those of a windmill; its plumes red crimson, like\nthose of a phenicoptere (which in Languedoc they call flaman); its eyes\nwere red, and flaming like a carbuncle; its ears green, like a Prasin\nemerald; its teeth like a topaz; its tail long and black, like jet; its\nfeet white, diaphanous and transparent like a diamond, somewhat broad, and\nof the splay kind, like those of geese, and as Queen Dick's used to be at\nToulouse in the days of yore.  About its neck it wore a gold collar, round\nwhich were some Ionian characters, whereof I could pick out but two words,\nUS ATHENAN, hog-teaching Minerva.\n\nThe sky was clear before; but at that monster's appearance it changed so\nmightily for the worse that we were all amazed at it.  As soon as the\nChitterlings perceived the flying hog, down they all threw their weapons\nand fell on their knees, lifting up their hands joined together, without\nspeaking one word, in a posture of adoration.  Friar John and his party\nkept on mincing, felling, braining, mangling, and spitting the Chitterlings\nlike mad; but Pantagruel sounded a retreat, and all hostility ceased.\n\nThe monster having several times hovered backwards and forwards between the\ntwo armies, with a tail-shot voided above twenty-seven butts of mustard on\nthe ground; then flew away through the air, crying all the while, Carnival,\nCarnival, Carnival.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLII.\n\nHow Pantagruel held a treaty with Niphleseth, Queen of the Chitterlings.\n\nThe monster being out of sight, and the two armies remaining silent,\nPantagruel demanded a parley with the lady Niphleseth, Queen of the\nChitterlings, who was in her chariot by the standards; and it was easily\ngranted.  The queen alighted, courteously received Pantagruel, and was glad\nto see him.  Pantagruel complained to her of this breach of peace; but she\ncivilly made her excuse, telling him that a false information had caused\nall this mischief; her spies having brought her word that Shrovetide, their\nmortal foe, was landed, and spent his time in examining the urine of\nphyseters.\n\nShe therefore entreated him to pardon them their offence, telling him that\nsir-reverence was sooner found in Chitterlings than gall; and offering, for\nherself and all her successors, to hold of him and his the whole island and\ncountry; to obey him in all his commands, be friends to his friends, and\nfoes to his foes; and also to send every year, as an acknowledgment of\ntheir homage, a tribute of seventy-eight thousand royal Chitterlings, to\nserve him at his first course at table six months in the year; which was\npunctually performed.  For the next day she sent the aforesaid quantity of\nroyal Chitterlings to the good Gargantua, under the conduct of young\nNiphleseth, infanta of the island.\n\nThe good Gargantua made a present of them to the great King of Paris.  But\nby change of air, and for want of mustard (the natural balsam and restorer\nof Chitterlings), most of them died.  By the great king's particular grant\nthey were buried in heaps in a part of Paris to this day called La Rue\npavee d'Andouilles, the street paved with Chitterlings.  At the request of\nthe ladies at his court young Niphleseth was preserved, honourably used,\nand since that married to heart's content; and was the mother of many\nchildren, for which heaven be praised.\n\nPantagruel civilly thanked the queen, forgave all offences, refused the\noffer she had made of her country, and gave her a pretty little knife.\nAfter that he asked several nice questions concerning the apparition of\nthat flying hog.  She answered that it was the idea of Carnival, their\ntutelary god in time of war, first founder and original of all the\nChitterling race; for which reason he resembled a hog, for Chitterlings\ndrew their extraction from hogs.\n\nPantagruel asking to what purpose and curative indication he had voided so\nmuch mustard on the earth, the queen replied that mustard was their\nsanc-greal and celestial balsam, of which, laying but a little in the wounds\nof the fallen Chitterlings, in a very short time the wounded were healed and\nthe dead restored to life.  Pantagruel held no further discourse with the\nqueen, but retired a-shipboard.  The like did all the boon companions, with\ntheir implements of destruction and their huge sow.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel went into the island of Ruach.\n\nTwo days after we arrived at the island of Ruach; and I swear to you, by\nthe celestial hen and chickens, that I found the way of living of the\npeople so strange and wonderful that I can't, for the heart's blood of me,\nhalf tell it you.  They live on nothing but wind, eat nothing but wind, and\ndrink nothing but wind.  They have no other houses but weathercocks.  They\nsow no other seeds but the three sorts of windflowers, rue, and herbs that\nmay make one break wind to the purpose; these scour them off carefully.\nThe common sort of people to feed themselves make use of feather, paper, or\nlinen fans, according to their abilities.  As for the rich, they live by\nthe means of windmills.\n\nWhen they would have some noble treat, the tables are spread under one or\ntwo windmills.  There they feast as merry as beggars, and during the meal\ntheir whole talk is commonly of the goodness, excellency, salubrity, and\nrarity of winds; as you, jolly topers, in your cups philosophize and argue\nupon wines.  The one praises the south-east, the other the south-west; this\nthe west and by south, and this the east and by north; another the west,\nand another the east; and so of the rest.  As for lovers and amorous\nsparks, no gale for them like a smock-gale.  For the sick they use bellows\nas we use clysters among us.\n\nOh! said to me a little diminutive swollen bubble, that I had now but a\nbladderful of that same Languedoc wind which they call Cierce.  The famous\nphysician, Scurron, passing one day by this country, was telling us that it\nis so strong that it will make nothing of overturning a loaded waggon.  Oh!\nwhat good would it not do my Oedipodic leg.  The biggest are not the best;\nbut, said Panurge, rather would I had here a large butt of that same good\nLanguedoc wine that grows at Mirevaux, Canteperdrix, and Frontignan.\n\nI saw a good likely sort of a man there, much resembling Ventrose, tearing\nand fuming in a grievous fret with a tall burly groom and a pimping little\npage of his, laying them on, like the devil, with a buskin.  Not knowing\nthe cause of his anger, at first I thought that all this was by the\ndoctor's advice, as being a thing very healthy to the master to be in a\npassion and to his man to be banged for it.  But at last I heard him taxing\nhis man with stealing from him, like a rogue as he was, the better half of\na large leathern bag of an excellent southerly wind, which he had carefully\nlaid up, like a hidden reserve, against the cold weather.\n\nThey neither exonerate, dung, piss, nor spit in that island; but, to make\namends, they belch, fizzle, funk, and give tail-shots in abundance.  They\nare troubled with all manner of distempers; and, indeed, all distempers are\nengendered and proceed from ventosities, as Hippocrates demonstrates, lib.\nDe Flatibus.  But the most epidemical among them is the wind-cholic.  The\nremedies which they use are large clysters, whereby they void store of\nwindiness.  They all die of dropsies and tympanies, the men farting and the\nwomen fizzling; so that their soul takes her leave at the back-door.\n\nSome time after, walking in the island, we met three hairbrained airy\nfellows, who seemed mightily puffed up, and went to take their pastime and\nview the plovers, who live on the same diet as themselves, and abound in\nthe island.  I observed that, as your true topers when they travel carry\nflasks, leathern bottles, and small runlets along with them, so each of\nthem had at his girdle a pretty little pair of bellows.  If they happened\nto want wind, by the help of those pretty bellows they immediately drew\nsome, fresh and cool, by attraction and reciprocal expulsion; for, as you\nwell know, wind essentially defined is nothing but fluctuating and agitated\nair.\n\nA while after, we were commanded, in the king's name, not to receive for\nthree hours any man or woman of the country on board our ships; some having\nstolen from him a rousing fart, of the very individual wind which old\ngoodman Aeolus the snorer gave Ulysses to conduct his ship whenever it\nshould happen to be becalmed.  Which fart the king kept religiously, like\nanother sanc-greal, and performed a world of wonderful cures with it in\nmany dangerous diseases, letting loose and distributing to the patient only\nas much of it as might frame a virginal fart; which is, if you must know,\nwhat our sanctimonials, alias nuns, in their dialect call ringing\nbackwards.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLIV.\n\nHow small rain lays a high wind.\n\nPantagruel commended their government and way of living, and said to their\nhypenemian mayor:  If you approve Epicurus's opinion, placing the summum\nbonum in pleasure (I mean pleasure that's easy and free from toil), I\nesteem you happy; for your food being wind, costs you little or nothing,\nsince you need but blow.  True, sir, returned the mayor; but, alas! nothing\nis perfect here below; for too often when we are at table, feeding on some\ngood blessed wind of God as on celestial manna, merry as so many friars,\ndown drops on a sudden some small rain, which lays our wind, and so robs us\nof it.  Thus many a meal's lost for want of meat.\n\nJust so, quoth Panurge, Jenin Toss-pot of Quinquenais, evacuating some wine\nof his own burning on his wife's posteriors, laid the ill-fumed wind that\nblowed out of their centre as out of some magisterial Aeolipile.  Here is a\nkind of a whim on that subject which I made formerly:\n\n  One evening when Toss-pot had been at his butts,\n  And Joan his fat spouse crammed with turnips her guts,\n  Together they pigged, nor did drink so besot him\n  But he did what was done when his daddy begot him.\n  Now when to recruit he'd fain have been snoring,\n  Joan's back-door was filthily puffing and roaring;\n  So for spite he bepissed her, and quickly did find\n  That a very small rain lays a very high wind.\n\nWe are also plagued yearly with a very great calamity, cried the mayor; for\na giant called Wide-nostrils, who lives in the island of Tohu, comes hither\nevery spring to purge, by the advice of his physicians, and swallows us,\nlike so many pills, a great number of windmills, and of bellows also, at\nwhich his mouth waters exceedingly.\n\nNow this is a sad mortification to us here, who are fain to fast over three\nor four whole Lents every year for this, besides certain petty Lents, ember\nweeks, and other orison and starving tides.  And have you no remedy for\nthis? asked Pantagruel.  By the advice of our Mezarims, replied the mayor,\nabout the time that he uses to give us a visit, we garrison our windmills\nwith good store of cocks and hens.  The first time that the greedy thief\nswallowed them, they had like to have done his business at once; for they\ncrowed and cackled in his maw, and fluttered up and down athwart and along\nin his stomach, which threw the glutton into a lipothymy cardiac passion\nand dreadful and dangerous convulsions, as if some serpent, creeping in at\nhis mouth, had been frisking in his stomach.\n\nHere is a comparative as altogether incongruous and impertinent, cried\nFriar John, interrupting them; for I have formerly heard that if a serpent\nchance to get into a man's stomach it will not do him the least hurt, but\nwill immediately get out if you do but hang the patient by the heels and\nlay a panful of warm milk near his mouth.  You were told this, said\nPantagruel, and so were those who gave you this account; but none ever saw\nor read of such a cure.  On the contrary, Hippocrates, in his fifth book of\nEpidem, writes that such a case happening in his time the patient presently\ndied of a spasm and convulsion.\n\nBesides the cocks and hens, said the mayor, continuing his story, all the\nfoxes in the country whipped into Wide-nostril's mouth, posting after the\npoultry; which made such a stir with Reynard at their heels, that he\ngrievously fell into fits each minute of an hour.\n\nAt last, by the advice of a Baden enchanter, at the time of the paroxysm he\nused to flay a fox by way of antidote and counter-poison.  Since that he\ntook better advice, and eases himself with taking a clyster made with a\ndecoction of wheat and barley corns, and of livers of goslings; to the\nfirst of which the poultry run, and the foxes to the latter.  Besides, he\nswallows some of your badgers or fox-dogs by the way of pills and boluses.\nThis is our misfortune.\n\nCease to fear, good people, cried Pantagruel; this huge Wide-nostrils, this\nsame swallower of windmills, is no more, I will assure you; he died, being\nstifled and choked with a lump of fresh butter at the mouth of a hot oven,\nby the advice of his physicians.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLV.\n\nHow Pantagruel went ashore in the island of Pope-Figland.\n\nThe next morning we arrived at the island of Pope-figs; formerly a rich and\nfree people, called the Gaillardets, but now, alas! miserably poor, and\nunder the yoke of the Papimen.  The occasion of it was this:\n\nOn a certain yearly high holiday, the burgomaster, syndics, and topping\nrabbies of the Gaillardets chanced to go into the neighbouring island\nPapimany to see the festival and pass away the time.  Now one of them\nhaving espied the pope's picture (with the sight of which, according to a\nlaudable custom, the people were blessed on high-offering holidays), made\nmouths at it, and cried, A fig for it! as a sign of manifest contempt and\nderision.  To be revenged of this affront, the Papimen, some days after,\nwithout giving the others the least warning, took arms, and surprised,\ndestroyed, and ruined the whole island of the Gaillardets; putting the men\nto the sword, and sparing none but the women and children, and those too\nonly on condition to do what the inhabitants of Milan were condemned to by\nthe Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nThese had rebelled against him in his absence, and ignominiously turned the\nempress out of the city, mounting her a-horseback on a mule called Thacor,\nwith her breech foremost towards the old jaded mule's head, and her face\nturned towards the crupper.  Now Frederick being returned, mastered them,\nand caused so careful a search to be made that he found out and got the\nfamous mule Thacor.  Then the hangman by his order clapped a fig into the\nmule's jimcrack, in the presence of the enslaved cits that were brought\ninto the middle of the great market-place, and proclaimed in the emperor's\nname, with trumpets, that whosoever of them would save his own life should\npublicly pull the fig out with his teeth, and after that put it in again in\nthe very individual cranny whence he had draw'd it without using his hands,\nand that whoever refused to do this should presently swing for it and die\nin his shoes.  Some sturdy fools, standing upon their punctilio, chose\nhonourably to be hanged rather than submit to so shameful and abominable a\ndisgrace; and others, less nice in point of ceremony, took heart of grace,\nand even resolved to have at the fig, and a fig for't, rather than make a\nworse figure with a hempen collar, and die in the air at so short warning.\nAccordingly, when they had neatly picked out the fig with their teeth from\nold Thacor's snatch-blatch, they plainly showed it the headsman, saying,\nEcco lo fico, Behold the fig!\n\nBy the same ignominy the rest of these poor distressed Gaillardets saved\ntheir bacon, becoming tributaries and slaves, and the name of Pope-figs was\ngiven them, because they said, A fig for the pope's image.  Since this, the\npoor wretches never prospered, but every year the devil was at their doors,\nand they were plagued with hail, storms, famine, and all manner of woes, as\nan everlasting punishment for the sin of their ancestors and relations.\nPerceiving the misery and calamity of that generation, we did not care to\ngo further up into the country, contenting ourselves with going into a\nlittle chapel near the haven to take some holy water.  It was dilapidated\nand ruined, wanting also a cover--like Saint Peter at Rome.  When we were\nin, as we dipped our fingers in the sanctified cistern, we spied in the\nmiddle of that holy pickle a fellow muffled up with stoles, all under\nwater, like a diving duck, except the tip of his snout to draw his breath.\nAbout him stood three priests, true shavelings, clean shorn and polled, who\nwere muttering strange words to the devils out of a conjuring book.\n\nPantagruel was not a little amazed at this, and inquiring what kind of\nsport these were at, was told that for three years last past the plague had\nso dreadfully raged in the island that the better half of it had been\nutterly depopulated, and the lands lay fallow and unoccupied.  Now, the\nmortality being over, this same fellow who had crept into the holy tub,\nhaving a large piece of ground, chanced to be sowing it with white winter\nwheat at the very minute of an hour that a kind of a silly sucking devil,\nwho could not yet write or read, or hail and thunder, unless it were on\nparsley or coleworts, and got leave of his master Lucifer to go into this\nisland of Pope-figs, where the devils were very familiar with the men and\nwomen, and often went to take their pastime.\n\nThis same devil being got thither, directed his discourse to the\nhusbandman, and asked him what he was doing.  The poor man told him that he\nwas sowing the ground with corn to help him to subsist the next year.  Ay,\nbut the ground is none of thine, Mr. Plough-jobber, cried the devil, but\nmine; for since the time that you mocked the pope all this land has been\nproscribed, adjudged, and abandoned to us.  However, to sow corn is not my\nprovince; therefore I will give thee leave to sow the field, that is to\nsay, provided we share the profit.  I will, replied the farmer.  I mean,\nsaid the devil, that of what the land shall bear, two lots shall be made,\none of what shall grow above ground, the other of what shall be covered\nwith earth.  The right of choosing belongs to me; for I am a devil of noble\nand ancient race; thou art a base clown.  I therefore choose what shall lie\nunder ground, take thou what shall be above.  When dost thou reckon to\nreap, hah?  About the middle of July, quoth the farmer.  Well, said the\ndevil, I'll not fail thee then; in the meantime, slave as thou oughtest.\nWork, clown, work.  I am going to tempt to the pleasing sin of whoring the\nnuns of Dryfart, the sham saints of the cowl, and the gluttonish crew.  I\nam more than sure of these.  They need but meet, and the job is done; true\nfire and tinder, touch and take; down falls nun, and up gets friar.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLVI.\n\nHow a junior devil was fooled by a husbandman of Pope-Figland.\n\nIn the middle of July the devil came to the place aforesaid with all his\ncrew at his heels, a whole choir of the younger fry of hell; and having met\nthe farmer, said to him, Well, clodpate, how hast thou done since I went?\nThou and I must share the concern.  Ay, master devil, quoth the clown; it\nis but reason we should.  Then he and his men began to cut and reap the\ncorn; and, on the other side, the devil's imps fell to work, grubbing up\nand pulling out the stubble by the root.\n\nThe countryman had his corn thrashed, winnowed it, put in into sacks, and\nwent with it to market.  The same did the devil's servants, and sat them\ndown there by the man to sell their straw.  The countryman sold off his\ncorn at a good rate, and with the money filled an old kind of a demi-buskin\nwhich was fastened to his girdle.  But the devil a sou the devils took; far\nfrom taking handsel, they were flouted and jeered by the country louts.\n\nMarket being over, quoth the devil to the farmer, Well, clown, thou hast\nchoused me once, it is thy fault; chouse me twice, 'twill be mine.  Nay,\ngood sir devil, replied the farmer; how can I be said to have choused you,\nsince it was your worship that chose first?  The truth is, that by this\ntrick you thought to cheat me, hoping that nothing would spring out of the\nearth for my share, and that you should find whole underground the corn\nwhich I had sowed, and with it tempt the poor and needy, the close\nhypocrite, or the covetous griper; thus making them fall into your snares.\nBut troth, you must e'en go to school yet; you are no conjurer, for aught I\nsee; for the corn that was sow'd is dead and rotten, its corruption having\ncaused the generation of that which you saw me sell.  So you chose the\nworst, and therefore are cursed in the gospel.  Well, talk no more of it,\nquoth the devil; what canst thou sow our field with for next year?  If a\nman would make the best of it, answered the ploughman, 'twere fit he sow it\nwith radish.  Now, cried the devil, thou talkest like an honest fellow,\nbumpkin.  Well, sow me good store of radish, I'll see and keep them safe\nfrom storms, and will not hail a bit on them.  But hark ye me, this time I\nbespeak for my share what shall be above ground; what's under shall be\nthine.  Drudge on, looby, drudge on.  I am going to tempt heretics; their\nsouls are dainty victuals when broiled in rashers and well powdered.  My\nLord Lucifer has the griping in the guts; they'll make a dainty warm dish\nfor his honour's maw.\n\nWhen the season of radishes was come, our devil failed not to meet in the\nfield, with a train of rascally underlings, all waiting devils, and finding\nthere the farmer and his men, he began to cut and gather the leaves of the\nradishes.  After him the farmer with his spade dug up the radishes, and\nclapped them up into pouches.  This done, the devil, the farmer, and their\ngangs, hied them to market, and there the farmer presently made good money\nof his radishes; but the poor devil took nothing; nay, what was worse, he\nwas made a common laughing-stock by the gaping hoidens.  I see thou hast\nplayed me a scurvy trick, thou villainous fellow, cried the angry devil; at\nlast I am fully resolved even to make an end of the business betwixt thee\nand myself about the ground, and these shall be the terms:  we will\nclapperclaw each other, and whoever of us two shall first cry Hold, shall\nquit his share of the field, which shall wholly belong to the conqueror.  I\nfix the time for this trial of skill on this day seven-night; assure\nthyself that I'll claw thee off like a devil.  I was going to tempt your\nfornicators, bailiffs, perplexers of causes, scriveners, forgers of deeds,\ntwo-handed counsellors, prevaricating solicitors, and other such vermin;\nbut they were so civil as to send me word by an interpreter that they are\nall mine already.  Besides, our master Lucifer is so cloyed with their\nsouls that he often sends them back to the smutty scullions and slovenly\ndevils of his kitchen, and they scarce go down with them, unless now and\nthen, when they are high-seasoned.\n\nSome say there is no breakfast like a student's, no dinner like a lawyer's,\nno afternoon's nunchion like a vine-dresser's, no supper like a\ntradesman's, no second supper like a serving-wench's, and none of these\nmeals equal to a frockified hobgoblin's.  All this is true enough.\nAccordingly, at my Lord Lucifer's first course, hobgoblins, alias imps in\ncowls, are a standing dish.  He willingly used to breakfast on students;\nbut, alas!  I do not know by what ill luck they have of late years joined\nthe Holy Bible to their studies; so the devil a one we can get down among\nus; and I verily believe that unless the hypocrites of the tribe of Levi\nhelp us in it, taking from the enlightened book-mongers their St. Paul,\neither by threats, revilings, force, violence, fire, and faggot, we shall\nnot be able to hook in any more of them to nibble at below.  He dines\ncommonly on counsellors, mischief-mongers, multipliers of lawsuits, such as\nwrest and pervert right and law and grind and fleece the poor; he never\nfears to want any of these.  But who can endure to be wedded to a dish?\n\nHe said t'other day, at a full chapter, that he had a great mind to eat the\nsoul of one of the fraternity of the cowl that had forgot to speak for\nhimself in his sermon, and he promised double pay and a large pension to\nanyone that should bring him such a titbit piping hot.  We all went\na-hunting after such a rarity, but came home without the prey; for they all\nadmonish the good women to remember their convent.  As for afternoon\nnunchions, he has left them off since he was so woefully griped with the\ncolic; his fosterers, sutlers, charcoal-men, and boiling cooks having been\nsadly mauled and peppered off in the northern countries.\n\nHis high devilship sups very well on tradesmen, usurers, apothecaries,\ncheats, coiners, and adulterers of wares.  Now and then, when he is on the\nmerry pin, his second supper is of serving-wenches who, after they have by\nstealth soaked their faces with their master's good liquor, fill up the\nvessel with it at second hand, or with other stinking water.\n\nWell, drudge on, boor, drudge on; I am going to tempt the students of\nTrebisonde to leave father and mother, forego for ever the established and\ncommon rule of living, disclaim and free themselves from obeying their\nlawful sovereign's edicts, live in absolute liberty, proudly despise\neveryone, laugh at all mankind, and taking the fine jovial little cap of\npoetic licence, become so many pretty hobgoblins.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLVII.\n\nHow the devil was deceived by an old woman of Pope-Figland.\n\nThe country lob trudged home very much concerned and thoughtful, you may\nswear; insomuch that his good woman, seeing him thus look moping, weened\nthat something had been stolen from him at market; but when she had heard\nthe cause of his affliction and seen his budget well lined with coin, she\nbade him be of good cheer, assuring him that he would be never the worse\nfor the scratching bout in question; wishing him only to leave her to\nmanage that business, and not trouble his head about it; for she had\nalready contrived how to bring him off cleverly.  Let the worst come to the\nworst, said the husbandman, it will be but a scratch; for I'll yield at the\nfirst stroke, and quit the field.  Quit a fart, replied the wife; he shall\nhave none of the field.  Rely upon me, and be quiet; let me alone to deal\nwith him.  You say he is a pimping little devil, that is enough; I will\nsoon make him give up the field, I will warrant you.  Indeed, had he been a\ngreat devil, it had been somewhat.\n\nThe day that we landed in the island happened to be that which the devil\nhad fixed for the combat.  Now the countryman having, like a good Catholic,\nvery fairly confessed himself, and received betimes in the morning, by the\nadvice of the vicar had hid himself, all but the snout, in the holy-water\npot, in the posture in which we found him; and just as they were telling us\nthis story, news came that the old woman had fooled the devil and gained\nthe field.  You may not be sorry, perhaps, to hear how this happened.\n\nThe devil, you must know, came to the poor man's door, and rapping there,\ncried, So ho! ho, the house! ho, clodpate! where art thou?  Come out with a\nvengeance; come out with a wannion; come out and be damned; now for\nclawing.  Then briskly and resolutely entering the house, and not finding\nthe countryman there, he spied his wife lying on the ground, piteously\nweeping and howling.  What is the matter? asked the devil.  Where is he?\nwhat does he?  Oh! that I knew where he is, replied threescore and five;\nthe wicked rogue, the butcherly dog, the murderer!  He has spoiled me; I am\nundone; I die of what he has done me.  How, cried the devil, what is it?\nI'll tickle him off for you by-and-by.  Alas! cried the old dissembler, he\ntold me, the butcher, the tyrant, the tearer of devils told me that he had\nmade a match to scratch with you this day, and to try his claws he did but\njust touch me with his little finger here betwixt the legs, and has spoiled\nme for ever.  Oh! I am a dead woman; I shall never be myself again; do but\nsee!  Nay, and besides, he talked of going to the smith's to have his\npounces sharpened and pointed.  Alas! you are undone, Mr. Devil; good sir,\nscamper quickly, I am sure he won't stay; save yourself, I beseech you.\nWhile she said this she uncovered herself up to the chin, after the manner\nin which the Persian women met their children who fled from the fight, and\nplainly showed her what do ye call them.  The frightened devil, seeing the\nenormous solution of the continuity in all its dimensions, blessed himself,\nand cried out, Mahon, Demiourgon, Megaera, Alecto, Persephone! 'slife,\ncatch me here when he comes!  I am gone! 'sdeath, what a gash!  I resign\nhim the field.\n\nHaving heard the catastrophe of the story, we retired a-shipboard, not\nbeing willing to stay there any longer.  Pantagruel gave to the poor's box\nof the fabric of the church eighteen thousand good royals, in commiseration\nof the poverty of the people and the calamity of the place.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLVIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel went ashore at the island of Papimany.\n\nHaving left the desolate island of the Pope-figs, we sailed for the space\nof a day very fairly and merrily, and made the blessed island of Papimany.\nAs soon as we had dropt anchor in the road, before we had well moored our\nship with ground-tackle, four persons in different garbs rowed towards us\nin a skiff.  One of them was dressed like a monk in his frock,\ndraggle-tailed, and booted; the other like a falconer, with a lure, and a\nlong-winged hawk on his fist; the third like a solicitor, with a large bag,\nfull of informations, subpoenas, breviates, bills, writs, cases, and other\nimplements of pettifogging; the fourth looked like one of your vine-barbers\nabout Ocleans, with a jaunty pair of canvas trousers, a dosser, and a\npruning knife at his girdle.\n\nAs soon as the boat had clapped them on board, they all with one voice\nasked, Have you seen him, good passengers, have you seen him?  Who? asked\nPantagruel.  You know who, answered they.  Who is it? asked Friar John.\n'Sblood and 'ounds, I'll thrash him thick and threefold.  This he said\nthinking that they inquired after some robber, murderer, or church-breaker.\nOh, wonderful! cried the four; do not you foreign people know the one?\nSirs, replied Epistemon, we do not understand those terms; but if you will\nbe pleased to let us know who you mean, we will tell you the truth of the\nmatter without any more ado.  We mean, said they, he that is.  Did you ever\nsee him?  He that is, returned Pantagruel, according to our theological\ndoctrine, is God, who said to Moses, I am that I am.  We never saw him, nor\ncan he be beheld by mortal eyes.  We mean nothing less than that supreme\nGod who rules in heaven, replied they; we mean the god on earth.  Did you\never see him?  Upon my honour, replied Carpalin, they mean the pope.  Ay,\nay, answered Panurge; yea, verily, gentlemen, I have seen three of them,\nwhose sight has not much bettered me.  How! cried they, our sacred\ndecretals inform us that there never is more than one living.  I mean\nsuccessively, one after the other, returned Panurge; otherwise I never saw\nmore than one at a time.\n\nO thrice and four times happy people! cried they; you are welcome, and more\nthan double welcome!  They then kneeled down before us and would have\nkissed our feet, but we would not suffer it, telling them that should the\npope come thither in his own person, 'tis all they could do to him.  No,\ncertainly, answered they, for we have already resolved upon the matter.  We\nwould kiss his bare arse without boggling at it, and eke his two pounders;\nfor he has a pair of them, the holy father, that he has; we find it so by\nour fine decretals, otherwise he could not be pope.  So that, according to\nour subtle decretaline philosophy, this is a necessary consequence:  he is\npope; therefore he has genitories, and should genitories no more be found\nin the world, the world could no more have a pope.\n\nWhile they were talking thus, Pantagruel inquired of one of the coxswain's\ncrew who those persons were.  He answered that they were the four estates\nof the island, and added that we should be made as welcome as princes,\nsince we had seen the pope.  Panurge having been acquainted with this by\nPantagruel, said to him in his ear, I swear and vow, sir, 'tis even so; he\nthat has patience may compass anything.  Seeing the pope had done us no\ngood; now, in the devil's name, 'twill do us a great deal.  We then went\nashore, and the whole country, men, women, and children, came to meet us as\nin a solemn procession.  Our four estates cried out to them with a loud\nvoice, They have seen him! they have seen him! they have seen him!  That\nproclamation being made, all the mob kneeled before us, lifting up their\nhands towards heaven, and crying, O happy men!  O most happy! and this\nacclamation lasted above a quarter of an hour.\n\nThen came the Busby (!) of the place, with all his pedagogues, ushers, and\nschoolboys, whom he magisterially flogged, as they used to whip children in\nour country formerly when some criminal was hanged, that they might\nremember it.  This displeased Pantagruel, who said to them, Gentlemen, if\nyou do not leave off whipping these poor children, I am gone.  The people\nwere amazed, hearing his stentorian voice; and I saw a little hump with\nlong fingers say to the hypodidascal, What, in the name of wonder! do all\nthose that see the pope grow as tall as yon huge fellow that threatens us?\nAh! how I shall think time long till I have seen him too, that I may grow\nand look as big.  In short, the acclamations were so great that Homenas (so\nthey called their bishop) hastened thither on an unbridled mule with green\ntrappings, attended by his apposts (as they said) and his supposts, or\nofficers bearing crosses, banners, standards, canopies, torches, holy-water\npots, &c.  He too wanted to kiss our feet (as the good Christian Valfinier\ndid to Pope Clement), saying that one of their hypothetes, that's one of\nthe scavengers, scourers, and commentators of their holy decretals, had\nwritten that, in the same manner as the Messiah, so long and so much\nexpected by the Jews, at last appeared among them; so, on some happy day of\nGod, the pope would come into that island; and that, while they waited for\nthat blessed time, if any who had seen him at Rome or elsewhere chanced to\ncome among them, they should be sure to make much of them, feast them\nplentifully, and treat them with a great deal of reverence.  However, we\ncivilly desired to be excused.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.XLIX.\n\nHow Homenas, Bishop of Papimany, showed us the Uranopet decretals.\n\nHomenas then said to us:  'Tis enjoined us by our holy decretals to visit\nchurches first and taverns after.  Therefore, not to decline that fine\ninstitution, let us go to church; we will afterwards go and feast\nourselves.  Man of God, quoth Friar John, do you go before, we'll follow\nyou.  You spoke in the matter properly, and like a good Christian; 'tis\nlong since we saw any such.  For my part, this rejoices my mind very much,\nand I verily believe that I shall have the better stomach after it.  Well,\n'tis a happy thing to meet with good men!  Being come near the gate of the\nchurch, we spied a huge thick book, gilt, and covered all over with\nprecious stones, as rubies, emeralds, (diamonds,) and pearls, more, or at\nleast as valuable as those which Augustus consecrated to Jupiter\nCapitolinus.  This book hanged in the air, being fastened with two thick\nchains of gold to the zoophore of the porch.  We looked on it and admired\nit.  As for Pantagruel, he handled it and dandled it and turned it as he\npleased, for he could reach it without straining; and he protested that\nwhenever he touched it, he was seized with a pleasant tickling at his\nfingers' end, new life and activity in his arms, and a violent temptation\nin his mind to beat one or two sergeants, or such officers, provided they\nwere not of the shaveling kind.  Homenas then said to us, The law was\nformerly given to the Jews by Moses, written by God himself.  At Delphos,\nbefore the portal of Apollo's temple, this sentence, GNOTHI SEAUTON, was\nfound written with a divine hand.  And some time after it, EI was also\nseen, and as divinely written and transmitted from heaven. Cybele's image\nwas brought out of heaven, into a field called Pessinunt, in Phrygia; so\nwas that of Diana to Tauris, if you will believe Euripides; the oriflamme,\nor holy standard, was transmitted out of heaven to the noble and most\nChristian kings of France, to fight against the unbelievers.  In the reign\nof Numa Pompilius, second King of the Romans, the famous copper buckler\ncalled Ancile was seen to descend from heaven.  At Acropolis, near Athens,\nMinerva's statue formerly fell from the empyreal heaven.  In like manner\nthe sacred decretals which you see were written with the hand of an angel\nof the cherubim kind.  You outlandish people will hardly believe this, I\nfear.  Little enough, of conscience, said Panurge.  And then, continued\nHomenas, they were miraculously transmitted to us here from the very heaven\nof heavens; in the same manner as the river Nile is called Diipetes by\nHomer, the father of all philosophy--the holy decretals always excepted.\nNow, because you have seen the pope, their evangelist and everlasting\nprotector, we will give you leave to see and kiss them on the inside, if\nyou think meet.  But then you must fast three days before, and canonically\nconfess; nicely and strictly mustering up and inventorizing your sins,\ngreat and small, so thick that one single circumstance of them may not\nescape you; as our holy decretals, which you see, direct.  This will take\nup some time.  Man of God, answered Panurge, we have seen and descried\ndecrees, and eke decretals enough o' conscience; some on paper, other on\nparchment, fine and gay like any painted paper lantern, some on vellum,\nsome in manuscript, and others in print; so you need not take half these\npains to show us these.  We'll take the goodwill for the deed, and thank\nyou as much as if we had.  Ay, marry, said Homenas, but you never saw these\nthat are angelically written.  Those in your country are only transcripts\nfrom ours; as we find it written by one of our old decretaline scholiasts.\nFor me, do not spare me; I do not value the labour, so I may serve you.  Do\nbut tell me whether you will be confessed and fast only three short little\ndays of God?  As for shriving, answered Panurge, there can be no great harm\nin't; but this same fasting, master of mine, will hardly down with us at\nthis time, for we have so very much overfasted ourselves at sea that the\nspiders have spun their cobwebs over our grinders.  Do but look on this\ngood Friar John des Entomeures (Homenas then courteously demi-clipped him\nabout the neck), some moss is growing in his throat for want of bestirring\nand exercising his chaps.  He speaks the truth, vouched Friar John; I have\nso much fasted that I'm almost grown hump-shouldered.  Come, then, let's go\ninto the church, said Homenas; and pray forgive us if for the present we do\nnot sing you a fine high mass.  The hour of midday is past, and after it\nour sacred decretals forbid us to sing mass, I mean your high and lawful\nmass.  But I'll say a low and dry one for you.  I had rather have one\nmoistened with some good Anjou wine, cried Panurge; fall to, fall to your\nlow mass, and despatch.  Ods-bodikins, quoth Friar John, it frets me to the\nguts that I must have an empty stomach at this time of day; for, had I\neaten a good breakfast and fed like a monk, if he should chance to sing us\nthe Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, I had then brought thither bread and\nwine for the traits passes (those that are gone before).  Well, patience;\npull away, and save tide; short and sweet, I pray you, and this for a\ncause.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.L.\n\nHow Homenas showed us the archetype, or representation of a pope.\n\nMass being mumbled over, Homenas took a huge bundle of keys out of a trunk\nnear the head altar, and put thirty-two of them into so many keyholes; put\nback so many springs; then with fourteen more mastered so many padlocks,\nand at last opened an iron window strongly barred above the said altar.\nThis being done, in token of great mystery he covered himself with wet\nsackcloth, and drawing a curtain of crimson satin, showed us an image\ndaubed over, coarsely enough, to my thinking; then he touched it with a\npretty long stick, and made us all kiss the part of the stick that had\ntouched the image.  After this he said unto us, What think you of this\nimage?  It is the likeness of a pope, answered Pantagruel; I know it by the\ntriple crown, his furred amice, his rochet, and his slipper.  You are in\nthe right, said Homenas; it is the idea of that same good god on earth\nwhose coming we devoutly await, and whom we hope one day to see in this\ncountry.  O happy, wished-for, and much-expected day! and happy, most happy\nyou, whose propitious stars have so favoured you as to let you see the\nliving and real face of this good god on earth! by the single sight of\nwhose picture we obtain full remission of all the sins which we remember\nthat we have committed, as also a third part and eighteen quarantaines of\nthe sins which we have forgot; and indeed we only see it on high annual\nholidays.\n\nThis caused Pantagruel to say that it was a work like those which Daedalus\nused to make, since, though it were deformed and ill drawn, nevertheless\nsome divine energy, in point of pardons, lay hid and concealed in it.\nThus, said Friar John, at Seuille, the rascally beggars being one evening\non a solemn holiday at supper in the spital, one bragged of having got six\nblancs, or twopence halfpenny; another eight liards, or twopence; a third,\nseven caroluses, or sixpence; but an old mumper made his vaunts of having\ngot three testons, or five shillings.  Ah, but, cried his comrades, thou\nhast a leg of God; as if, continued Friar John, some divine virtue could\nlie hid in a stinking ulcerated rotten shank.  Pray, said Pantagruel, when\nyou are for telling us some such nauseous tale, be so kind as not to forget\nto provide a basin, Friar John; I'll assure you, I had much ado to forbear\nbringing up my breakfast.  Fie! I wonder a man of your coat is not ashamed\nto use thus the sacred name of God in speaking of things so filthy and\nabominable! fie, I say.  If among your monking tribes such an abuse of\nwords is allowed, I beseech you leave it there, and do not let it come out\nof the cloisters.  Physicians, said Epistemon, thus attribute a kind of\ndivinity to some diseases.  Nero also extolled mushrooms, and, in a Greek\nproverb, termed them divine food, because with them he had poisoned\nClaudius his predecessor.  But methinks, gentlemen, this same picture is\nnot over-like our late popes.  For I have seen them, not with their\npallium, amice, or rochet on, but with helmets on their heads, more like\nthe top of a Persian turban; and while the Christian commonwealth was in\npeace, they alone were most furiously and cruelly making war.  This must\nhave been then, returned Homenas, against the rebellious, heretical\nProtestants; reprobates who are disobedient to the holiness of this good\ngod on earth.  'Tis not only lawful for him to do so, but it is enjoined\nhim by the sacred decretals; and if any dare transgress one single iota\nagainst their commands, whether they be emperors, kings, dukes, princes, or\ncommonwealths, he is immediately to pursue them with fire and sword, strip\nthem of all their goods, take their kingdoms from them, proscribe them,\nanathematize them, and destroy not only their bodies, those of their\nchildren, relations, and others, but damn also their souls to the very\nbottom of the most hot and burning cauldron in hell.  Here, in the devil's\nname, said Panurge, the people are no heretics; such as was our\nRaminagrobis, and as they are in Germany and England.  You are Christians\nof the best edition, all picked and culled, for aught I see.  Ay, marry are\nwe, returned Homenas, and for that reason we shall all be saved.  Now let\nus go and bless ourselves with holy water, and then to dinner.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LI.\n\nTable-talk in praise of the decretals.\n\nNow, topers, pray observe that while Homenas was saying his dry mass, three\ncollectors, or licensed beggars of the church, each of them with a large\nbasin, went round among the people, with a loud voice:  Pray remember the\nblessed men who have seen his face.  As we came out of the temple they\nbrought their basins brimful of Papimany chink to Homenas, who told us that\nit was plentifully to feast with; and that, of this contribution and\nvoluntary tax, one part should be laid out in good drinking, another in\ngood eating, and the remainder in both, according to an admirable\nexposition hidden in a corner of their holy decretals; which was performed\nto a T, and that at a noted tavern not much unlike that of Will's at\nAmiens.  Believe me, we tickled it off there with copious cramming and\nnumerous swilling.\n\nI made two notable observations at that dinner:  the one, that there was\nnot one dish served up, whether of cabrittas, capons, hogs (of which latter\nthere is great plenty in Papimany), pigeons, coneys, leverets, turkeys, or\nothers, without abundance of magistral stuff; the other, that every course,\nand the fruit also, were served up by unmarried females of the place, tight\nlasses, I'll assure you, waggish, fair, good-conditioned, and comely,\nspruce, and fit for business.  They were all clad in fine long white albs,\nwith two girts; their hair interwoven with narrow tape and purple ribbon,\nstuck with roses, gillyflowers, marjoram, daffadowndillies, thyme, and\nother sweet flowers.\n\nAt every cadence they invited us to drink and bang it about, dropping us\nneat and genteel courtesies; nor was the sight of them unwelcome to all the\ncompany; and as for Friar John, he leered on them sideways, like a cur that\nsteals a capon.  When the first course was taken off, the females\nmelodiously sung us an epode in the praise of the sacrosanct decretals; and\nthen the second course being served up, Homenas, joyful and cheery, said to\none of the she-butlers, Light here, Clerica.  Immediately one of the girls\nbrought him a tall-boy brimful of extravagant wine.  He took fast hold of\nit, and fetching a deep sigh, said to Pantagruel, My lord, and you, my good\nfriends, here's t'ye, with all my heart; you are all very welcome.  When he\nhad tipped that off, and given the tall-boy to the pretty creature, he\nlifted up his voice and said, O most holy decretals, how good is good wine\nfound through your means!  This is the best jest we have had yet, observed\nPanurge.  But it would still be a better, said Pantagruel, if they could\nturn bad wine into good.\n\nO seraphic Sextum! continued Homenas, how necessary are you not to the\nsalvation of poor mortals!  O cherubic Clementinae! how perfectly the\nperfect institution of a true Christian is contained and described in you!\nO angelical Extravagantes! how many poor souls that wander up and down in\nmortal bodies through this vale of misery would perish were it not for you!\nWhen, ah! when shall this special gift of grace be bestowed on mankind, as\nto lay aside all other studies and concerns, to use you, to peruse you, to\nunderstand you, to know you by heart, to practise you, to incorporate you,\nto turn you into blood, and incentre you into the deepest ventricles of\ntheir brains, the inmost marrow of their bones, and most intricate\nlabyrinth of their arteries?  Then, ah! then, and no sooner than then, nor\notherwise than thus, shall the world be happy!  While the old man was thus\nrunning on, Epistemon rose and softly said to Panurge:  For want of a\nclose-stool, I must even leave you for a moment or two; this stuff has\nunbunged the orifice of my mustard-barrel; but I'll not tarry long.\n\nThen, ah! then, continued Homenas, no hail, frost, ice, snow, overflowing,\nor vis major; then plenty of all earthly goods here below.  Then\nuninterrupted and eternal peace through the universe, an end of all wars,\nplunderings, drudgeries, robbing, assassinates, unless it be to destroy\nthese cursed rebels the heretics.  Oh! then, rejoicing, cheerfulness,\njollity, solace, sports, and delicious pleasures, over the face of the\nearth.  Oh! what great learning, inestimable erudition, and god-like\nprecepts are knit, linked, rivetted, and mortised in the divine chapters of\nthese eternal decretals!\n\nOh! how wonderfully, if you read but one demi-canon, short paragraph, or\nsingle observation of these sacrosanct decretals, how wonderfully, I say,\ndo you not perceive to kindle in your hearts a furnace of divine love,\ncharity towards your neighbour (provided he be no heretic), bold contempt\nof all casual and sublunary things, firm content in all your affections,\nand ecstatic elevation of soul even to the third heaven.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LII.\n\nA continuation of the miracles caused by the decretals.\n\nWisely, brother Timothy, quoth Panurge, did am, did am; he says blew; but,\nfor my part, I believe as little of it as I can.  For one day by chance I\nhappened to read a chapter of them at Poictiers, at the most\ndecretalipotent Scotch doctor's, and old Nick turn me into bumfodder, if\nthis did not make me so hide-bound and costive, that for four or five days\nI hardly scumbered one poor butt of sir-reverence; and that, too, was full\nas dry and hard, I protest, as Catullus tells us were those of his\nneighbour Furius:\n\n  Nec toto decies cacas in anno,\n  Atque id durius est faba, et lapillis:\n  Quod tu si manibus teras, fricesque,\n  Non unquam digitum inquinare posses.\n\nOh, ho! cried Homenas; by'r lady, it may be you were then in the state of\nmortal sin, my friend.  Well turned, cried Panurge; this was a new strain,\negad.\n\nOne day, said Friar John, at Seuille, I had applied to my posteriors, by\nway of hind-towel, a leaf of an old Clementinae which our rent-gatherer,\nJohn Guimard, had thrown out into the green of our cloister.  Now the devil\nbroil me like a black pudding, if I wasn't so abominably plagued with\nchaps, chawns, and piles at the fundament, that the orifice of my poor\nnockandroe was in a most woeful pickle for I don't know how long.  By'r our\nlady, cried Homenas, it was a plain punishment of God for the sin that you\nhad committed in beraying that sacred book, which you ought rather to have\nkissed and adored; I say with an adoration of latria, or of hyperdulia at\nleast.  The Panormitan never told a lie in the matter.\n\nSaith Ponocrates:  At Montpelier, John Chouart having bought of the monks\nof St. Olary a delicate set of decretals, written on fine large parchment\nof Lamballe, to beat gold between the leaves, not so much as a piece that\nwas beaten in them came to good, but all were dilacerated and spoiled.\nMark this! cried Homenas; 'twas a divine punishment and vengeance.\n\nAt Mans, said Eudemon, Francis Cornu, apothecary, had turned an old set of\nExtravagantes into waste paper.  May I never stir, if whatever was lapped\nup in them was not immediately corrupted, rotten, and spoiled; incense,\npepper, cloves, cinnamon, saffron, wax, cassia, rhubarb, tamarinds, all\ndrugs and spices, were lost without exception.  Mark, mark, quoth Homenas,\nan effect of divine justice!  This comes of putting the sacred Scriptures\nto such profane uses.\n\nAt Paris, said Carpalin, Snip Groignet the tailor had turned an old\nClementinae into patterns and measures, and all the clothes that were cut\non them were utterly spoiled and lost; gowns, hoods, cloaks, cassocks,\njerkins, jackets, waistcoats, capes, doublets, petticoats, corps de robes,\nfarthingales, and so forth.  Snip, thinking to cut a hood, would cut you\nout a codpiece; instead of a cassock he would make you a high-crowned hat;\nfor a waistcoat he'd shape you out a rochet; on the pattern of a doublet\nhe'd make you a thing like a frying-pan.  Then his journeymen having\nstitched it up did jag it and pink it at the bottom, and so it looked like\na pan to fry chestnuts.  Instead of a cape he made a buskin; for a\nfarthingale he shaped a montero cap; and thinking to make a cloak, he'd cut\nout a pair of your big out-strouting Swiss breeches, with panes like the\noutside of a tabor.  Insomuch that Snip was condemned to make good the\nstuffs to all his customers; and to this day poor Cabbage's hair grows\nthrough his hood and his arse through his pocket-holes.  Mark, an effect of\nheavenly wrath and vengeance! cried Homenas.\n\nAt Cahusac, said Gymnast, a match being made by the lords of Estissac and\nViscount Lausun to shoot at a mark, Perotou had taken to pieces a set of\ndecretals and set one of the leaves for the white to shoot at.  Now I sell,\nnay, I give and bequeath for ever and aye, the mould of my doublet to\nfifteen hundred hampers full of black devils, if ever any archer in the\ncountry (though they are singular marksmen in Guienne) could hit the white.\nNot the least bit of the holy scribble was contaminated or touched; nay,\nand Sansornin the elder, who held stakes, swore to us, figues dioures, hard\nfigs (his greatest oath), that he had openly, visibly, and manifestly seen\nthe bolt of Carquelin moving right to the round circle in the middle of the\nwhite; and that just on the point, when it was going to hit and enter, it\nhad gone aside above seven foot and four inches wide of it towards the\nbakehouse.\n\nMiracle! cried Homenas, miracle! miracle!  Clerica, come wench, light,\nlight here.  Here's to you all, gentlemen; I vow you seem to me very sound\nChristians.  While he said this, the maidens began to snicker at his elbow,\ngrinning, giggling, and twittering among themselves.  Friar John began to\npaw, neigh, and whinny at the snout's end, as one ready to leap, or at\nleast to play the ass, and get up and ride tantivy to the devil like a\nbeggar on horseback.\n\nMethinks, said Pantagruel, a man might have been more out of danger near\nthe white of which Gymnast spoke than was formerly Diogenes near another.\nHow is that? asked Homenas; what was it?  Was he one of our decretalists?\nRarely fallen in again, egad, said Epistemon, returning from stool; I see\nhe will hook his decretals in, though by the head and shoulders.\n\nDiogenes, said Pantagruel, one day for pastime went to see some archers\nthat shot at butts, one of whom was so unskilful, that when it was his turn\nto shoot all the bystanders went aside, lest he should mistake them for the\nmark.  Diogenes had seen him shoot extremely wide of it; so when the other\nwas taking aim a second time, and the people removed at a great distance to\nthe right and left of the white, he placed himself close by the mark,\nholding that place to be the safest, and that so bad an archer would\ncertainly rather hit any other.\n\nOne of the Lord d'Estissac's pages at last found out the charm, pursued\nGymnast, and by his advice Perotou put in another white made up of some\npapers of Pouillac's lawsuit, and then everyone shot cleverly.\n\nAt Landerousse, said Rhizotome, at John Delif's wedding were very great\ndoings, as 'twas then the custom of the country.  After supper several\nfarces, interludes, and comical scenes were acted; they had also several\nmorris-dancers with bells and tabors, and divers sorts of masks and mummers\nwere let in.  My schoolfellows and I, to grace the festival to the best of\nour power (for fine white and purple liveries had been given to all of us\nin the morning), contrived a merry mask with store of cockle-shells, shells\nof snails, periwinkles, and such other.  Then for want of cuckoo-pint, or\npriest-pintle, lousebur, clote, and paper, we made ourselves false faces\nwith the leaves of an old Sextum that had been thrown by and lay there for\nanyone that would take it up, cutting out holes for the eyes, nose, and\nmouth.  Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?  When we had\nplayed our little boyish antic tricks, and came to take off our sham faces,\nwe appeared more hideous and ugly than the little devils that acted the\nPassion at Douay; for our faces were utterly spoiled at the places which\nhad been touched by those leaves.  One had there the small-pox; another,\nGod's token, or the plague-spot; a third, the crinckums; a fourth, the\nmeasles; a fifth, botches, pushes, and carbuncles; in short, he came off\nthe least hurt who only lost his teeth by the bargain.  Miracle! bawled out\nHomenas, miracle!\n\nHold, hold! cried Rhizotome; it is not yet time to clap.  My sister Kate\nand my sister Ren had put the crepines of their hoods, their ruffles,\nsnuffekins, and neck-ruffs new washed, starched, and ironed, into that very\nbook of decretals; for, you must know, it was covered with thick boards and\nhad strong clasps.  Now, by the virtue of God--Hold, interrupted Homenas,\nwhat god do you mean?  There is but one, answered Rhizotome.  In heaven, I\ngrant, replied Homenas; but we have another here on earth, do you see?  Ay,\nmarry have we, said Rhizotome; but on my soul I protest I had quite forgot\nit.  Well then, by the virtue of god the pope, their pinners, neck-ruffs,\nbib, coifs, and other linen turned as black as a charcoal-man's sack.\nMiracle! cried Homenas.  Here, Clerica, light me here; and prithee, girl,\nobserve these rare stories.  How comes it to pass then, asked Friar John,\nthat people say,\n\n  Ever since decrees had tails,\n  And gendarmes lugged heavy mails,\n  Since each monk would have a horse,\n  All went here from bad to worse.\n\nI understand you, answered Homenas; this is one of the quirks and little\nsatires of the new-fangled heretics.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LIII.\n\nHow by the virtue of the decretals, gold is subtilely drawn out of France\nto Rome.\n\nI would, said Epistemon, it had cost me a pint of the best tripe that ever\ncan enter into gut, so we had but compared with the original the dreadful\nchapters, Execrabilis, De multa, Si plures; De annatis per totum; Nisi\nessent; Cum ad monasterium; Quod delectio; Mandatum; and certain others,\nthat draw every year out of France to Rome four hundred thousand ducats and\nmore.\n\nDo you make nothing of this? asked Homenas.  Though, methinks, after all,\nit is but little, if we consider that France, the most Christian, is the\nonly nurse the see of Rome has.  However, find me in the whole world a\nbook, whether of philosophy, physic, law, mathematics, or other humane\nlearning, nay, even, by my God, of the Holy Scripture itself, will draw as\nmuch money thence?  None, none, psha, tush, blurt, pish; none can.  You may\nlook till your eyes drop out of your head, nay, till doomsday in the\nafternoon, before you can find another of that energy; I'll pass my word\nfor that.\n\nYet these devilish heretics refuse to learn and know it.  Burn 'em, tear\n'em, nip 'em with hot pincers, drown 'em, hang 'em, spit 'em at the\nbunghole, pelt 'em, paut 'em, bruise 'em, beat 'em, cripple 'em, dismember\n'em, cut 'em, gut 'em, bowel 'em, paunch 'em, thrash 'em, slash 'em, gash\n'em, chop 'em, slice 'em, slit 'em, carve 'em, saw 'em, bethwack 'em, pare\n'em, hack 'em, hew 'em, mince 'em, flay 'em, boil 'em, broil 'em, roast\n'em, toast 'em, bake 'em, fry 'em, crucify 'em, crush 'em, squeeze 'em,\ngrind 'em, batter 'em, burst 'em, quarter 'em, unlimb 'em, behump 'em,\nbethump 'em, belam 'em, belabour 'em, pepper 'em, spitchcock 'em, and\ncarbonade 'em on gridirons, these wicked heretics! decretalifuges,\ndecretalicides, worse than homicides, worse than patricides,\ndecretalictones of the devil of hell.\n\nAs for you other good people, I must earnestly pray and beseech you to\nbelieve no other thing, to think on, say, undertake, or do no other thing,\nthan what's contained in our sacred decretals and their corollaries, this\nfine Sextum, these fine Clementinae, these fine Extravagantes.  O deific\nbooks!  So shall you enjoy glory, honour, exaltation, wealth, dignities,\nand preferments in this world; be revered and dreaded by all, preferred,\nelected, and chosen above all men.\n\nFor there is not under the cope of heaven a condition of men out of which\nyou'll find persons fitter to do and handle all things than those who by\ndivine prescience, eternal predestination, have applied themselves to the\nstudy of the holy decretals.\n\nWould you choose a worthy emperor, a good captain, a fit general in time of\nwar, one that can well foresee all inconveniences, avoid all dangers,\nbriskly and bravely bring his men on to a breach or attack, still be on\nsure grounds, always overcome without loss of his men, and know how to make\na good use of his victory?  Take me a decretist.  No, no, I mean a\ndecretalist.  Ho, the foul blunder, whispered Epistemon.\n\nWould you, in time of peace, find a man capable of wisely governing the\nstate of a commonwealth, of a kingdom, of an empire, of a monarchy;\nsufficient to maintain the clergy, nobility, senate, and commons in wealth,\nfriendship, unity, obedience, virtue, and honesty?  Take a decretalist.\n\nWould you find a man who, by his exemplary life, eloquence, and pious\nadmonitions, may in a short time, without effusion of human blood, conquer\nthe Holy Land, and bring over to the holy Church the misbelieving Turks,\nJews, Tartars, Muscovites, Mamelukes, and Sarrabonites?  Take me a\ndecretalist.\n\nWhat makes, in many countries, the people rebellious and depraved, pages\nsaucy and mischievous, students sottish and duncical?  Nothing but that\ntheir governors and tutors were not decretalists.\n\nBut what, on your conscience, was it, do you think, that established,\nconfirmed, and authorized those fine religious orders with whom you see the\nChristian world everywhere adorned, graced, and illustrated, as the\nfirmament is with its glorious stars?  The holy decretals.\n\nWhat was it that founded, underpropped, and fixed, and now maintains,\nnourishes, and feeds the devout monks and friars in convents, monasteries,\nand abbeys; so that did they not daily and mightily pray without ceasing,\nthe world would be in evident danger of returning to its primitive chaos?\nThe sacred decretals.\n\nWhat makes and daily increases the famous and celebrated patrimony of St.\nPeter in plenty of all temporal, corporeal, and spiritual blessings?  The\nholy decretals.\n\nWhat made the holy apostolic see and pope of Rome, in all times, and at\nthis present, so dreadful in the universe, that all kings, emperors,\npotentates, and lords, willing, nilling, must depend upon him, hold of him,\nbe crowned, confirmed, and authorized by him, come thither to strike sail,\nbuckle, and fall down before his holy slipper, whose picture you have seen?\nThe mighty decretals of God.\n\nI will discover you a great secret.  The universities of your world have\ncommonly a book, either open or shut, in their arms and devices; what book\ndo you think it is?  Truly, I do not know, answered Pantagruel; I never\nread it.  It is the decretals, said Homenas, without which the privileges\nof all universities would soon be lost.  You must own that I have taught\nyou this; ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\n\nHere Homenas began to belch, to fart, to funk, to laugh, to slaver, and to\nsweat; and then he gave his huge greasy four-cornered cap to one of the\nlasses, who clapped it on her pretty head with a great deal of joy, after\nshe had lovingly bussed it, as a sure token that she should be first\nmarried.  Vivat, cried Epistemon, fifat, bibat, pipat.\n\nO apocalyptic secret! continued Homenas; light, light, Clerica; light here\nwith double lanterns.  Now for the fruit, virgins.\n\nI was saying, then, that giving yourselves thus wholly to the study of the\nholy decretals, you will gain wealth and honour in this world.  I add, that\nin the next you will infallibly be saved in the blessed kingdom of heaven,\nwhose keys are given to our good god and decretaliarch.  O my good god,\nwhom I adore and never saw, by thy special grace open unto us, at the point\nof death at least, this most sacred treasure of our holy Mother Church,\nwhose protector, preserver, butler, chief-larder, administrator, and\ndisposer thou art; and take care, I beseech thee, O lord, that the precious\nworks of supererogation, the goodly pardons, do not fail us in time of\nneed; so that the devils may not find an opportunity to gripe our precious\nsouls, and the dreadful jaws of hell may not swallow us.  If we must pass\nthrough purgatory thy will be done.  It is in thy power to draw us out of\nit when thou pleasest.  Here Homenas began to shed huge hot briny tears, to\nbeat his breast, and kiss his thumbs in the shape of a cross.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LIV.\n\nHow Homenas gave Pantagruel some bon-Christian pears.\n\nEpistemon, Friar John, and Panurge, seeing this doleful catastrophe, began,\nunder the cover of their napkins, to cry Meeow, meeow, meeow; feigning to\nwipe their eyes all the while as if they had wept.  The wenches were doubly\ndiligent, and brought brimmers of Clementine wine to every one, besides\nstore of sweetmeats; and thus the feasting was revived.\n\nBefore we arose from table, Homenas gave us a great quantity of fair large\npears, saying, Here, my good friends, these are singular good pears.  You\nwill find none such anywhere else, I dare warrant.  Every soil bears not\neverything, you know.  India alone boasts black ebony; the best incense is\nproduced in Sabaea; the sphragitid earth at Lemnos; so this island is the\nonly place where such fine pears grow.  You may, if you please, make\nseminaries with their pippins in your country.\n\nI like their taste extremely, said Pantagruel.  If they were sliced, and\nput into a pan on the fire with wine and sugar, I fancy they would be very\nwholesome meat for the sick, as well as for the healthy.  Pray what do you\ncall 'em?  No otherwise than you have heard, replied Homenas.  We are a\nplain downright sort of people, as God would have it, and call figs, figs;\nplums, plums; and pears, pears.  Truly, said Pantagruel, if I live to go\nhome--which I hope will be speedily, God willing--I'll set off and graff\nsome in my garden in Touraine, by the banks of the Loire, and will call\nthem bon-Christian or good-Christian pears, for I never saw better\nChristians than are these good Papimans.  I would like him two to one\nbetter yet, said Friar John, would he but give us two or three cartloads of\nyon buxom lasses.  Why, what would you do with them? cried Homenas.  Quoth\nFriar John, No harm, only bleed the kind-hearted souls straight between the\ntwo great toes with certain clever lancets of the right stamp; by which\noperation good Christian children would be inoculated upon them, and the\nbreed be multiplied in our country, in which there are not many over-good,\nthe more's the pity.\n\nNay, verily, replied Homenas, we cannot do this; for you would make them\ntread their shoes awry, crack their pipkins, and spoil their shapes.  You\nlove mutton, I see; you will run at sheep.  I know you by that same nose\nand hair of yours, though I never saw your face before.  Alas! alas! how\nkind you are!  And would you indeed damn your precious soul?  Our decretals\nforbid this.  Ah, I wish you had them at your finger's-end.  Patience, said\nFriar John; but, si tu non vis dare, praesta, quaesumus.  Matter of\nbreviary.  As for that, I defy all the world, and I fear no man that wears\na head and a hood, though he were a crystalline, I mean a decretaline\ndoctor.\n\nDinner being over, we took our leave of the right reverend Homenas, and of\nall the good people, humbly giving thanks; and, to make them amends for\ntheir kind entertainment, promised them that, at our coming to Rome, we\nwould make our applications so effectually to the pope that he would\nspeedily be sure to come to visit them in person.  After this we went\no'board.\n\nPantagruel, by an act of generosity, and as an acknowledgment of the sight\nof the pope's picture, gave Homenas nine pieces of double friezed cloth of\ngold to be set before the grates of the window.  He also caused the church\nbox for its repairs and fabric to be quite filled with double crowns of\ngold; and ordered nine hundred and fourteen angels to be delivered to each\nof the lasses who had waited at table, to buy them husbands when they could\nget them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LV.\n\nHow Pantagruel, being at sea, heard various unfrozen words.\n\nWhen we were at sea, junketting, tippling, discoursing, and telling\nstories, Pantagruel rose and stood up to look out; then asked us, Do you\nhear nothing, gentlemen?  Methinks I hear some people talking in the air,\nyet I can see nobody.  Hark!  According to his command we listened, and\nwith full ears sucked in the air as some of you suck oysters, to find if we\ncould hear some sound scattered through the sky; and to lose none of it,\nlike the Emperor Antoninus some of us laid their hands hollow next to their\nears; but all this would not do, nor could we hear any voice.  Yet\nPantagruel continued to assure us he heard various voices in the air, some\nof men, and some of women.\n\nAt last we began to fancy that we also heard something, or at least that\nour ears tingled; and the more we listened, the plainer we discerned the\nvoices, so as to distinguish articulate sounds.  This mightily frightened\nus, and not without cause; since we could see nothing, yet heard such\nvarious sounds and voices of men, women, children, horses, &c., insomuch\nthat Panurge cried out, Cods-belly, there is no fooling with the devil; we\nare all beshit, let's fly.  There is some ambuscado hereabouts.  Friar\nJohn, art thou here my love?  I pray thee, stay by me, old boy.  Hast thou\ngot thy swindging tool?  See that it do not stick in thy scabbard; thou\nnever scourest it half as it should be.  We are undone.  Hark!  They are\nguns, gad judge me.  Let's fly, I do not say with hands and feet, as Brutus\nsaid at the battle of Pharsalia; I say, with sails and oars.  Let's whip it\naway.  I never find myself to have a bit of courage at sea; in cellars and\nelsewhere I have more than enough.  Let's fly and save our bacon.  I do not\nsay this for any fear that I have; for I dread nothing but danger, that I\ndon't; I always say it that shouldn't.  The free archer of Baignolet said\nas much.  Let us hazard nothing, therefore, I say, lest we come off bluely.\nTack about, helm a-lee, thou son of a bachelor.  Would I were now well in\nQuinquenais, though I were never to marry.  Haste away, let's make all the\nsail we can.  They'll be too hard for us; we are not able to cope with\nthem; they are ten to our one, I'll warrant you.  Nay, and they are on\ntheir dunghill, while we do not know the country.  They will be the death\nof us.  We'll lose no honour by flying.  Demosthenes saith that the man\nthat runs away may fight another day.  At least let us retreat to the\nleeward.  Helm a-lee; bring the main-tack aboard, haul the bowlines, hoist\nthe top-gallants.  We are all dead men; get off, in the devil's name, get\noff.\n\nPantagruel, hearing the sad outcry which Panurge made, said, Who talks of\nflying?  Let's first see who they are; perhaps they may be friends.  I can\ndiscover nobody yet, though I can see a hundred miles round me.  But let's\nconsider a little.  I have read that a philosopher named Petron was of\nopinion that there were several worlds that touched each other in an\nequilateral triangle; in whose centre, he said, was the dwelling of truth;\nand that the words, ideas, copies, and images of all things past and to\ncome resided there; round which was the age; and that with success of time\npart of them used to fall on mankind like rheums and mildews, just as the\ndew fell on Gideon's fleece, till the age was fulfilled.\n\nI also remember, continued he, that Aristotle affirms Homer's words to be\nflying, moving, and consequently animated.  Besides, Antiphanes said that\nPlato's philosophy was like words which, being spoken in some country\nduring a hard winter, are immediately congealed, frozen up, and not heard;\nfor what Plato taught young lads could hardly be understood by them when\nthey were grown old.  Now, continued he, we should philosophize and search\nwhether this be not the place where those words are thawed.\n\nYou would wonder very much should this be the head and lyre of Orpheus.\nWhen the Thracian women had torn him to pieces they threw his head and lyre\ninto the river Hebrus, down which they floated to the Euxine sea as far as\nthe island of Lesbos; the head continually uttering a doleful song, as it\nwere lamenting the death of Orpheus, and the lyre, with the wind's impulse\nmoving its strings and harmoniously accompanying the voice.  Let's see if\nwe cannot discover them hereabouts.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LVI.\n\nHow among the frozen words Pantagruel found some odd ones.\n\nThe skipper made answer:  Be not afraid, my lord; we are on the confines of\nthe Frozen Sea, on which, about the beginning of last winter, happened a\ngreat and bloody fight between the Arimaspians and the Nephelibates.  Then\nthe words and cries of men and women, the hacking, slashing, and hewing of\nbattle-axes, the shocking, knocking, and jolting of armours and harnesses,\nthe neighing of horses, and all other martial din and noise, froze in the\nair; and now, the rigour of the winter being over, by the succeeding\nserenity and warmth of the weather they melt and are heard.\n\nBy jingo, quoth Panurge, the man talks somewhat like.  I believe him.  But\ncouldn't we see some of 'em?  I think I have read that, on the edge of the\nmountain on which Moses received the Judaic law, the people saw the voices\nsensibly.  Here, here, said Pantagruel, here are some that are not yet\nthawed.  He then threw us on the deck whole handfuls of frozen words, which\nseemed to us like your rough sugar-plums, of many colours, like those used\nin heraldry; some words gules (this means also jests and merry sayings),\nsome vert, some azure, some black, some or (this means also fair words);\nand when we had somewhat warmed them between our hands, they melted like\nsnow, and we really heard them, but could not understand them, for it was a\nbarbarous gibberish.  One of them only, that was pretty big, having been\nwarmed between Friar John's hands, gave a sound much like that of chestnuts\nwhen they are thrown into the fire without being first cut, which made us\nall start.  This was the report of a field-piece in its time, cried Friar\nJohn.\n\nPanurge prayed Pantagruel to give him some more; but Pantagruel told him\nthat to give words was the part of a lover.  Sell me some then, I pray you,\ncried Panurge.  That's the part of a lawyer, returned Pantagruel.  I would\nsooner sell you silence, though at a dearer rate; as Demosthenes formerly\nsold it by the means of his argentangina, or silver squinsy.\n\nHowever, he threw three or four handfuls of them on the deck; among which I\nperceived some very sharp words, and some bloody words, which the pilot\nsaid used sometimes to go back and recoil to the place whence they came,\nbut it was with a slit weasand.  We also saw some terrible words, and some\nothers not very pleasant to the eye.\n\nWhen they had been all melted together, we heard a strange noise, hin, hin,\nhin, hin, his, tick, tock, taack, bredelinbrededack, frr, frr, frr, bou,\nbou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, track, track, trr, trr, trr, trrr,\ntrrrrrr, on, on, on, on, on, on, ououououon, gog, magog, and I do not know\nwhat other barbarous words, which the pilot said were the noise made by the\ncharging squadrons, the shock and neighing of horses.\n\nThen we heard some large ones go off like drums and fifes, and others like\nclarions and trumpets.  Believe me, we had very good sport with them.  I\nwould fain have saved some merry odd words, and have preserved them in oil,\nas ice and snow are kept, and between clean straw.  But Pantagruel would\nnot let me, saying that 'tis a folly to hoard up what we are never like to\nwant or have always at hand, odd, quaint, merry, and fat words of gules\nnever being scarce among all good and jovial Pantagruelists.\n\nPanurge somewhat vexed Friar John, and put him in the pouts; for he took\nhim at his word while he dreamed of nothing less.  This caused the friar to\nthreaten him with such a piece of revenge as was put upon G. Jousseaume,\nwho having taken the merry Patelin at his word when he had overbid himself\nin some cloth, was afterwards fairly taken by the horns like a bullock by\nhis jovial chapman, whom he took at his word like a man.  Panurge, well\nknowing that threatened folks live long, bobbed and made mouths at him in\ntoken of derision, then cried, Would I had here the word of the Holy\nBottle, without being thus obliged to go further in pilgrimage to her.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LVII.\n\nHow Pantagruel went ashore at the dwelling of Gaster, the first master of\narts in the world.\n\nThat day Pantagruel went ashore in an island which, for situation and\ngovernor, may be said not to have its fellow.  When you just come into it,\nyou find it rugged, craggy, and barren, unpleasant to the eye, painful to\nthe feet, and almost as inaccessible as the mountain of Dauphine, which is\nsomewhat like a toadstool, and was never climbed as any can remember by any\nbut Doyac, who had the charge of King Charles the Eighth's train of\nartillery.\n\nThis same Doyac with strange tools and engines gained that mountain's top,\nand there he found an old ram.  It puzzled many a wise head to guess how it\ngot thither.  Some said that some eagle or great horncoot, having carried\nit thither while it was yet a lambkin, it had got away and saved itself\namong the bushes.\n\nAs for us, having with much toil and sweat overcome the difficult ways at\nthe entrance, we found the top of the mountain so fertile, healthful, and\npleasant, that I thought I was then in the true garden of Eden, or earthly\nparadise, about whose situation our good theologues are in such a quandary\nand keep such a pother.\n\nAs for Pantagruel, he said that here was the seat of Arete--that is as much\nas to say, virtue--described by Hesiod.  This, however, with submission to\nbetter judgments.  The ruler of this place was one Master Gaster, the first\nmaster of arts in this world.  For, if you believe that fire is the great\nmaster of arts, as Tully writes, you very much wrong him and yourself;\nalas! Tully never believed this.  On the other side, if you fancy Mercury\nto be the first inventor of arts, as our ancient Druids believed of old,\nyou are mightily beside the mark.  The satirist's sentence, that affirms\nMaster Gaster to be the master of all arts, is true.  With him peacefully\nresided old goody Penia, alias Poverty, the mother of the ninety-nine\nMuses, on whom Porus, the lord of Plenty, formerly begot Love, that noble\nchild, the mediator of heaven and earth, as Plato affirms in Symposio.\n\nWe were all obliged to pay our homage and swear allegiance to that mighty\nsovereign; for he is imperious, severe, blunt, hard, uneasy, inflexible;\nyou cannot make him believe, represent to him, or persuade him anything.\n\nHe does not hear; and as the Egyptians said that Harpocrates, the god of\nsilence, named Sigalion in Greek, was astome, that is, without a mouth, so\nGaster was created without ears, even like the image of Jupiter in Candia.\n\nHe only speaks by signs, but those signs are more readily obeyed by\neveryone than the statutes of senates or commands of monarchs.  Neither\nwill he admit the least let or delay in his summons.  You say that when a\nlion roars all the beasts at a considerable distance round about, as far as\nhis roar can be heard, are seized with a shivering.  This is written, it is\ntrue, I have seen it. I assure you that at Master Gaster's command the very\nheavens tremble, and all the earth shakes.  His command is called, Do this\nor die.  Needs must when the devil drives; there's no gainsaying of it.\n\nThe pilot was telling us how, on a certain time, after the manner of the\nmembers that mutinied against the belly, as Aesop describes it, the whole\nkingdom of the Somates went off into a direct faction against Gaster,\nresolving to throw off his yoke; but they soon found their mistake, and\nmost humbly submitted, for otherwise they had all been famished.\n\nWhat company soever he is in, none dispute with him for precedence or\nsuperiority; he still goes first, though kings, emperors, or even the pope,\nwere there.  So he held the first place at the council of Basle; though\nsome will tell you that the council was tumultuous by the contention and\nambition of many for priority.\n\nEveryone is busied and labours to serve him, and indeed, to make amends for\nthis, he does this good to mankind, as to invent for them all arts,\nmachines, trades, engines, and crafts; he even instructs brutes in arts\nwhich are against their nature, making poets of ravens, jackdaws,\nchattering jays, parrots, and starlings, and poetesses of magpies, teaching\nthem to utter human language, speak, and sing; and all for the gut.  He\nreclaims and tames eagles, gerfalcons, falcons gentle, sakers, lanners,\ngoshawks, sparrowhawks, merlins, haggards, passengers, wild rapacious\nbirds; so that, setting them free in the air whenever he thinks fit, as\nhigh and as long as he pleases, he keeps them suspended, straying, flying,\nhovering, and courting him above the clouds.  Then on a sudden he makes\nthem stoop, and come down amain from heaven next to the ground; and all for\nthe gut.\n\nElephants, lions, rhinoceroses, bears, horses, mares, and dogs, he teaches\nto dance, prance, vault, fight, swim, hide themselves, fetch and carry what\nhe pleases; and all for the gut.\n\nSalt and fresh-water fish, whales, and the monsters of the main, he brings\nthem up from the bottom of the deep; wolves he forces out of the woods,\nbears out of the rocks, foxes out of their holes, and serpents out of the\nground, and all for the gut.\n\nIn short, he is so unruly, that in his rage he devours all men and beasts;\nas was seen among the Vascons, when Q. Metellus besieged them in the\nSertorian wars, among the Saguntines besieged by Hannibal; among the Jews\nbesieged by the Romans, and six hundred more; and all for the gut.  When\nhis regent Penia takes a progress, wherever she moves all senates are shut\nup, all statutes repealed, all orders and proclamations vain; she knows,\nobeys, and has no law.  All shun her, in every place choosing rather to\nexpose themselves to shipwreck at sea, and venture through fire, rocks,\ncaves, and precipices, than be seized by that most dreadful tormentor.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LVIII.\n\nHow, at the court of the master of ingenuity, Pantagruel detested the\nEngastrimythes and the Gastrolaters.\n\nAt the court of that great master of ingenuity, Pantagruel observed two\nsorts of troublesome and too officious apparitors, whom he very much\ndetested.  The first were called Engastrimythes; the others, Gastrolaters.\n\nThe first pretended to be descended of the ancient race of Eurycles, and\nfor this brought the authority of Aristophanes in his comedy called the\nWasps; whence of old they were called Euryclians, as Plato writes, and\nPlutarch in his book of the Cessation of Oracles.  In the holy decrees, 26,\nqu. 3, they are styled Ventriloqui; and the same name is given them in\nIonian by Hippocrates, in his fifth book of Epid., as men who speak from\nthe belly.  Sophocles calls them Sternomantes.  These were soothsayers,\nenchanters, cheats, who gulled the mob, and seemed not to speak and give\nanswers from the mouth, but from the belly.\n\nSuch a one, about the year of our Lord 1513, was Jacoba Rodogina, an\nItalian woman of mean extract; from whose belly we, as well as an infinite\nnumber of others at Ferrara and elsewhere, have often heard the voice of\nthe evil spirit speak, low, feeble, and small, indeed, but yet very\ndistinct, articulate, and intelligible, when she was sent for out of\ncuriosity by the lords and princes of the Cisalpine Gaul.  To remove all\nmanner of doubt, and be assured that this was not a trick, they used to\nhave her stripped stark naked, and caused her mouth and nose to be stopped.\nThis evil spirit would be called Curled-pate, or Cincinnatulo, seeming\npleased when any called him by that name, at which he was always ready to\nanswer.  If any spoke to him of things past or present, he gave pertinent\nanswers, sometimes to the amazement of the hearers; but if of things to\ncome, then the devil was gravelled, and used to lie as fast as a dog can\ntrot.  Nay, sometimes he seemed to own his ignorance, instead of an answer\nletting out a rousing fart, or muttering some words with barbarous and\nuncouth inflexions, and not to be understood.\n\nAs for the Gastrolaters, they stuck close to one another in knots and\ngangs.  Some of them merry, wanton, and soft as so many milk-sops; others\nlouring, grim, dogged, demure, and crabbed; all idle, mortal foes to\nbusiness, spending half their time in sleeping and the rest in doing\nnothing, a rent-charge and dead unnecessary weight on the earth, as Hesiod\nsaith; afraid, as we judged, of offending or lessening their paunch.\nOthers were masked, disguised, and so oddly dressed that it would have done\nyou good to have seen them.\n\nThere's a saying, and several ancient sages write, that the skill of nature\nappears wonderful in the pleasure which she seems to have taken in the\nconfiguration of sea-shells, so great is their variety in figures, colours,\nstreaks, and inimitable shapes.  I protest the variety we perceived in the\ndresses of the gastrolatrous coquillons was not less.  They all owned\nGaster for their supreme god, adored him as a god, offered him sacrifices\nas to their omnipotent deity, owned no other god, served, loved, and\nhonoured him above all things.\n\nYou would have thought that the holy apostle spoke of those when he said\n(Phil. chap. 3), Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you\neven weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:  whose end is\ndestruction, whose God is their belly.  Pantagruel compared them to the\nCyclops Polyphemus, whom Euripides brings in speaking thus:  I only\nsacrifice to myself--not to the gods--and to this belly of mine, the\ngreatest of all the gods.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LIX.\n\nOf the ridiculous statue Manduce; and how and what the Gastrolaters\nsacrifice to their ventripotent god.\n\nWhile we fed our eyes with the sight of the phizzes and actions of these\nlounging gulligutted Gastrolaters, we on a sudden heard the sound of a\nmusical instrument called a bell; at which all of them placed themselves in\nrank and file as for some mighty battle, everyone according to his office,\ndegree, and seniority.\n\nIn this order they moved towards Master Gaster, after a plump, young,\nlusty, gorbellied fellow, who on a long staff fairly gilt carried a wooden\nstatue, grossly carved, and as scurvily daubed over with paint; such a one\nas Plautus, Juvenal, and Pomp. Festus describe it.  At Lyons during the\nCarnival it is called Maschecroute or Gnawcrust; they call'd this Manduce.\n\nIt was a monstrous, ridiculous, hideous figure, fit to fright little\nchildren; its eyes were bigger than its belly, and its head larger than all\nthe rest of its body; well mouth-cloven however, having a goodly pair of\nwide, broad jaws, lined with two rows of teeth, upper tier and under tier,\nwhich, by the magic of a small twine hid in the hollow part of the golden\nstaff, were made to clash, clatter, and rattle dreadfully one against\nanother; as they do at Metz with St. Clement's dragon.\n\nComing near the Gastrolaters I saw they were followed by a great number of\nfat waiters and tenders, laden with baskets, dossers, hampers, dishes,\nwallets, pots, and kettles.  Then, under the conduct of Manduce, and\nsinging I do not know what dithyrambics, crepalocomes, and epenons, opening\ntheir baskets and pots, they offered their god:\n\nWhite hippocras,         Fricassees, nine       Cold loins of veal,\n  with dry toasts.         sorts.                 with spice.\nWhite bread.             Monastical brewis.     Zinziberine.\nBrown bread.             Gravy soup.            Beatille pies.\nCarbonadoes, six         Hotch-pots.            Brewis.\n  sorts.                 Soft bread.            Marrow-bones, toast,\nBrawn.                   Household bread.         and cabbage.\nSweetbreads.             Capirotadoes.          Hashes.\n\nEternal drink intermixed.  Brisk delicate white wine led the van; claret\nand champagne followed, cool, nay, as cold as the very ice, I say, filled\nand offered in large silver cups.  Then they offered:\n\nChitterlings, gar-       Chines and peas.       Hams.\n  nished with mus-       Hog's haslets.         Brawn heads.\n  tard.                  Scotch collops.        Powdered venison,\nSausages.                Puddings.                with turnips.\nNeats' tongues.          Cervelats.             Pickled olives.\nHung beef.               Bologna sausages.\n\nAll this associated with sempiternal liquor.  Then they housed within his\nmuzzle:\n\nLegs of mutton, with     Ribs of pork, with     Caponets.\n  shallots.                onion sauce.         Caviare and toast.\nOlias.

A reinforcement of     Olives.\nTeals.                     vinegar intermixed.  Thrushes.\nDuckers.                 Venison pasties.       Young sea-ravens.\nBitterns.

He then asked the\nskipper what the idle lobcocks used to sacrifice to their gorbellied god on\ninterlarded fish-days.  For his first course, said the skipper, they gave\nhim:\n\nCaviare.                  tops, bishop's-cods,    Red herrings.\nBotargoes.                celery, chives, ram-    Pilchards.\nFresh butter.             pions, jew's-ears (a    Anchovies.\nPease soup.               sort of mushrooms       Fry of tunny.\nSpinach.                  that sprout out of      Cauliflowers.\nFresh herrings, full      old elders), spara-     Beans.\n  roed.                   gus, wood-bind,         Salt salmon.\nSalads, a hundred         and a world of          Pickled grigs.\n  varieties, of cres-     others.

For\nthe latter part of their sacrifices they offer:\n\nRice milk, and hasty    Stewed prunes, and       Raisins.\n  pudding.                baked bullace.         Dates.\nButtered wheat, and     Pistachios, or fistic    Chestnut and wal-\n  flummery.               nuts.                    nuts.\nWater-gruel, and        Figs.                    Filberts.\n  milk-porridge.        Almond butter.           Parsnips.\nFrumenty and bonny      Skirret root.            Artichokes.\n  clamber.              White-pot.\n              Perpetuity of soaking with the whole.\n\nIt was none of their fault, I will assure you, if this same god of theirs\nwas not publicly, preciously, and plentifully served in the sacrifices,\nbetter yet than Heliogabalus's idol; nay, more than Bel and the Dragon in\nBabylon, under King Belshazzar.  Yet Gaster had the manners to own that he\nwas no god, but a poor, vile, wretched creature.  And as King Antigonus,\nfirst of the name, when one Hermodotus (as poets will flatter, especially\nprinces) in some of his fustian dubbed him a god, and made the sun adopt\nhim for his son, said to him:  My lasanophore (or, in plain English, my\ngroom of the close-stool) can give thee the lie; so Master Gaster very\ncivilly used to send back his bigoted worshippers to his close-stool, to\nsee, smell, taste, philosophize, and examine what kind of divinity they\ncould pick out of his sir-reverence.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXI.\n\nHow Gaster invented means to get and preserve corn.\n\nThose gastrolatrous hobgoblins being withdrawn, Pantagruel carefully minded\nthe famous master of arts, Gaster.  You know that, by the institution of\nnature, bread has been assigned him for provision and food; and that, as an\naddition to this blessing, he should never want the means to get bread.\n\nAccordingly, from the beginning he invented the smith's art, and husbandry\nto manure the ground, that it might yield him corn; he invented arms and\nthe art of war to defend corn; physic and astronomy, with other parts of\nmathematics which might be useful to keep corn a great number of years in\nsafety from the injuries of the air, beasts, robbers, and purloiners; he\ninvented water, wind, and handmills, and a thousand other engines to grind\ncorn and to turn it into meal; leaven to make the dough ferment, and the\nuse of salt to give it a savour; for he knew that nothing bred more\ndiseases than heavy, unleavened, unsavoury bread.\n\nHe found a way to get fire to bake it; hour-glasses, dials, and clocks to\nmark the time of its baking; and as some countries wanted corn, he\ncontrived means to convey some out of one country into another.\n\nHe had the wit to pimp for asses and mares, animals of different species,\nthat they might copulate for the generation of a third, which we call\nmules, more strong and fit for hard service than the other two.  He\ninvented carts and waggons to draw him along with greater ease; and as seas\nand rivers hindered his progress, he devised boats, galleys, and ships (to\nthe astonishment of the elements) to waft him over to barbarous, unknown,\nand far distant nations, thence to bring, or thither to carry corn.\n\nBesides, seeing that when he had tilled the ground, some years the corn\nperished in it for want of rain in due season, in others rotted or was\ndrowned by its excess, sometimes spoiled by hail, eat by worms in the ear,\nor beaten down by storms, and so his stock was destroyed on the ground; we\nwere told that ever since the days of yore he has found out a way to\nconjure the rain down from heaven only with cutting certain grass, common\nenough in the field, yet known to very few, some of which was then shown\nus.  I took it to be the same as the plant, one of whose boughs being\ndipped by Jove's priest in the Agrian fountain on the Lycian mountain in\nArcadia, in time of drought raised vapours which gathered into clouds, and\nthen dissolved into rain that kindly moistened the whole country.\n\nOur master of arts was also said to have found a way to keep the rain up in\nthe air, and make it to fall into the sea; also to annihilate the hail,\nsuppress the winds, and remove storms as the Methanensians of Troezene used\nto do.  And as in the fields thieves and plunderers sometimes stole and\ntook by force the corn and bread which others had toiled to get, he\ninvented the art of building towns, forts, and castles, to hoard and secure\nthat staff of life.  On the other hand, finding none in the fields, and\nhearing that it was hoarded up and secured in towns, forts, and castles,\nand watched with more care than ever were the golden pippins of the\nHesperides, he turned engineer, and found ways to beat, storm, and demolish\nforts and castles with machines and warlike thunderbolts, battering-rams,\nballists, and catapults, whose shapes were shown to us, not over-well\nunderstood by our engineers, architects, and other disciples of Vitruvius;\nas Master Philibert de l'Orme, King Megistus's principal architect, has\nowned to us.\n\nAnd seeing that sometimes all these tools of destruction were baffled by\nthe cunning subtlety or the subtle cunning (which you please) of\nfortifiers, he lately invented cannons, field-pieces, culverins, bombards,\nbasiliskos, murdering instruments that dart iron, leaden, and brazen balls,\nsome of them outweighing huge anvils.  This by the means of a most dreadful\npowder, whose hellish compound and effect has even amazed nature, and made\nher own herself outdone by art, the Oxydracian thunders, hails, and storms\nby which the people of that name immediately destroyed their enemies in the\nfield being but mere potguns to these.  For one of our great guns when used\nis more dreadful, more terrible, more diabolical, and maims, tears, breaks,\nslays, mows down, and sweeps away more men, and causes a greater\nconsternation and destruction than a hundred thunderbolts.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXII.\n\nHow Gaster invented an art to avoid being hurt or touched by cannon-balls.\n\nGaster having secured himself with his corn within strongholds, has\nsometimes been attacked by enemies; his fortresses, by that thrice\nthreefold cursed instrument, levelled and destroyed; his dearly beloved\ncorn and bread snatched out of his mouth and sacked by a titanic force;\ntherefore he then sought means to preserve his walls, bastions, rampiers,\nand sconces from cannon-shot, and to hinder the bullets from hitting him,\nstopping them in their flight, or at least from doing him or the besieged\nwalls any damage.  He showed us a trial of this which has been since used\nby Fronton, and is now common among the pastimes and harmless recreations\nof the Thelemites.  I will tell you how he went to work, and pray for the\nfuture be a little more ready to believe what Plutarch affirms to have\ntried.  Suppose a herd of goats were all scampering as if the devil drove\nthem, do but put a bit of eringo into the mouth of the hindmost nanny, and\nthey will all stop stock still in the time you can tell three.\n\nThus Gaster, having caused a brass falcon to be charged with a sufficient\nquantity of gunpowder well purged from its sulphur, and curiously made up\nwith fine camphor, he then had a suitable ball put into the piece, with\ntwenty-four little pellets like hail-shot, some round, some pearl fashion;\nthen taking his aim and levelling it at a page of his, as if he would have\nhit him on the breast.  About sixty strides off the piece, halfway between\nit and the page in a right line, he hanged on a gibbet by a rope a very\nlarge siderite or iron-like stone, otherwise called herculean, formerly\nfound on Ida in Phrygia by one Magnes, as Nicander writes, and commonly\ncalled loadstone; then he gave fire to the prime on the piece's touch-hole,\nwhich in an instant consuming the powder, the ball and hail-shot were with\nincredible violence and swiftness hurried out of the gun at its muzzle,\nthat the air might penetrate to its chamber, where otherwise would have\nbeen a vacuum, which nature abhors so much, that this universal machine,\nheaven, air, land, and sea, would sooner return to the primitive chaos than\nadmit the least void anywhere.  Now the ball and small shot, which\nthreatened the page with no less than quick destruction, lost their\nimpetuosity and remained suspended and hovering round the stone; nor did\nany of them, notwithstanding the fury with which they rushed, reach the\npage.\n\nMaster Gaster could do more than all this yet, if you will believe me; for\nhe invented a way how to cause bullets to fly backwards, and recoil on\nthose that sent them with as great a force, and in the very numerical\nparallel for which the guns were planted.  And indeed, why should he have\nthought this difficult? seeing the herb ethiopis opens all locks\nwhatsoever, and an echinus or remora, a silly weakly fish, in spite of all\nthe winds that blow from the thirty-two points of the compass, will in the\nmidst of a hurricane make you the biggest first-rate remain stock still, as\nif she were becalmed or the blustering tribe had blown their last.  Nay,\nand with the flesh of that fish, preserved with salt, you may fish gold out\nof the deepest well that was ever sounded with a plummet; for it will\ncertainly draw up the precious metal, since Democritus affirmed it.\nTheophrastus believed and experienced that there was an herb at whose\nsingle touch an iron wedge, though never so far driven into a huge log of\nthe hardest wood that is, would presently come out; and it is this same\nherb your hickways, alias woodpeckers, use, when with some mighty axe\nanyone stops up the hole of their nests, which they industriously dig and\nmake in the trunk of some sturdy tree.  Since stags and hinds, when deeply\nwounded with darts, arrows, and bolts, if they do but meet the herb called\ndittany, which is common in Candia, and eat a little of it, presently the\nshafts come out and all is well again; even as kind Venus cured her beloved\nbyblow Aeneas when he was wounded on the right thigh with an arrow by\nJuturna, Turnus's sister.  Since the very wind of laurels, fig-trees, or\nsea-calves makes the thunder sheer off insomuch that it never strikes them.\nSince at the sight of a ram, mad elephants recover their former senses.\nSince mad bulls coming near wild fig-trees, called caprifici, grow tame,\nand will not budge a foot, as if they had the cramp.  Since the venomous\nrage of vipers is assuaged if you but touch them with a beechen bough.\nSince also Euphorion writes that in the isle of Samos, before Juno's temple\nwas built there, he has seen some beasts called neades, whose voice made\nthe neighbouring places gape and sink into a chasm and abyss.  In short,\nsince elders grow of a more pleasing sound, and fitter to make flutes, in\nsuch places where the crowing of cocks is not heard, as the ancient sages\nhave writ and Theophrastus relates; as if the crowing of a cock dulled,\nflattened, and perverted the wood of the elder, as it is said to astonish\nand stupify with fear that strong and resolute animal, a lion.  I know that\nsome have understood this of wild elder, that grows so far from towns or\nvillages that the crowing of cocks cannot reach near it; and doubtless that\nsort ought to be preferred to the stenching common elder that grows about\ndecayed and ruined places; but others have understood this in a higher\nsense, not literal, but allegorical, according to the method of the\nPythagoreans, as when it was said that Mercury's statue could not be made\nof every sort of wood; to which sentence they gave this sense, that God is\nnot to be worshipped in a vulgar form, but in a chosen and religious\nmanner.  In the same manner, by this elder which grows far from places\nwhere cocks are heard, the ancients meant that the wise and studious ought\nnot to give their minds to trivial or vulgar music, but to that which is\ncelestial, divine, angelical, more abstracted, and brought from remoter\nparts, that is, from a region where the crowing of cocks is not heard; for,\nto denote a solitary and unfrequented place, we say cocks are never heard\nto crow there.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXIII.\n\nHow Pantagruel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, and of the problems\nproposed to be solved when he waked.\n\nThe next day, merrily pursuing our voyage, we came in sight of the island\nof Chaneph, where Pantagruel's ship could not arrive, the wind chopping\nabout, and then failing us so that we were becalmed, and could hardly get\nahead, tacking about from starboard to larboard, and larboard to starboard,\nthough to our sails we added drabblers.\n\nWith this accident we were all out of sorts, moping, drooping,\nmetagrabolized, as dull as dun in the mire, in C sol fa ut flat, out of\ntune, off the hinges, and I-don't-know-howish, without caring to speak one\nsingle syllable to each other.\n\nPantagruel was taking a nap, slumbering and nodding on the quarter-deck by\nthe cuddy, with an Heliodorus in his hand; for still it was his custom to\nsleep better by book than by heart.\n\nEpistemon was conjuring, with his astrolabe, to know what latitude we were\nin.\n\nFriar John was got into the cook-room, examining, by the ascendant of the\nspits and the horoscope of ragouts and fricassees, what time of day it\nmight then be.\n\nPanurge (sweet baby!) held a stalk of Pantagruelions, alias hemp, next his\ntongue, and with it made pretty bubbles and bladders.\n\nGymnast was making tooth-pickers with lentisk.\n\nPonocrates, dozing, dozed, and dreaming, dreamed; tickled himself to make\nhimself laugh, and with one finger scratched his noddle where it did not\nitch.\n\nCarpalin, with a nutshell and a trencher of verne (that's a card in\nGascony), was making a pretty little merry windmill, cutting the card\nlongways into four slips, and fastening them with a pin to the convex of\nthe nut, and its concave to the tarred side of the gunnel of the ship.\n\nEusthenes, bestriding one of the guns, was playing on it with his fingers\nas if it had been a trump-marine.\n\nRhizotome, with the soft coat of a field tortoise, alias ycleped a mole,\nwas making himself a velvet purse.\n\nXenomanes was patching up an old weather-beaten lantern with a hawk's\njesses.\n\nOur pilot (good man!) was pulling maggots out of the seamen's noses.\n\nAt last Friar John, returning from the forecastle, perceived that\nPantagruel was awake.  Then breaking this obstinate silence, he briskly and\ncheerfully asked him how a man should kill time, and raise good weather,\nduring a calm at sea.\n\nPanurge, whose belly thought his throat cut, backed the motion presently,\nand asked for a pill to purge melancholy.\n\nEpistemon also came on, and asked how a man might be ready to bepiss\nhimself with laughing when he has no heart to be merry.\n\nGymnast, arising, demanded a remedy for a dimness of eyes.\n\nPonocrates, after he had a while rubbed his noddle and shaken his ears,\nasked how one might avoid dog-sleep.  Hold! cried Pantagruel, the\nPeripatetics have wisely made a rule that all problems, questions, and\ndoubts which are offered to be solved ought to be certain, clear, and\nintelligible.  What do you mean by dog-sleep?  I mean, answered Ponocrates,\nto sleep fasting in the sun at noonday, as the dogs do.\n\nRhizotome, who lay stooping on the pump, raised his drowsy head, and lazily\nyawning, by natural sympathy set almost everyone in the ship a-yawning too;\nthen he asked for a remedy against oscitations and gapings.\n\nXenomanes, half puzzled, and tired out with new-vamping his antiquated\nlantern, asked how the hold of the stomach might be so well ballasted and\nfreighted from the keel to the main hatch, with stores well stowed, that\nour human vessels might not heel or be walt, but well trimmed and stiff.\n\nCarpalin, twirling his diminutive windmill, asked how many motions are to\nbe felt in nature before a gentleman may be said to be hungry.\n\nEusthenes, hearing them talk, came from between decks, and from the capstan\ncalled out to know why a man that is fasting, bit by a serpent also\nfasting, is in greater danger of death than when man and serpent have eat\ntheir breakfasts;--why a man's fasting-spittle is poisonous to serpents and\nvenomous creatures.\n\nOne single solution may serve for all your problems, gentlemen, answered\nPantagruel; and one single medicine for all such symptoms and accidents.\nMy answer shall be short, not to tire you with a long needless train of\npedantic cant.  The belly has no ears, nor is it to be filled with fair\nwords; you shall be answered to content by signs and gestures.  As formerly\nat Rome, Tarquin the Proud, its last king, sent an answer by signs to his\nson Sextus, who was among the Gabii at Gabii.  (Saying this, he pulled the\nstring of a little bell, and Friar John hurried away to the cook-room.)\nThe son having sent his father a messenger to know how he might bring the\nGabii under a close subjection, the king, mistrusting the messenger, made\nhim no answer, and only took him into his privy garden, and in his presence\nwith his sword lopped off the heads of the tall poppies that were there.\nThe express returned without any other despatch, yet having related to the\nprince what he had seen his father do, he easily understood that by those\nsigns he advised him to cut off the heads of the chief men in the town, the\nbetter to keep under the rest of the people.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXIV.\n\nHow Pantagruel gave no answer to the problems.\n\nPantagruel then asked what sort of people dwelt in that damned island.\nThey are, answered Xenomanes, all hypocrites, holy mountebanks, tumblers of\nbeads, mumblers of ave-marias, spiritual comedians, sham saints, hermits,\nall of them poor rogues who, like the hermit of Lormont between Blaye and\nBordeaux, live wholly on alms given them by passengers.  Catch me there if\nyou can, cried Panurge; may the devil's head-cook conjure my bumgut into a\npair of bellows if ever you find me among them!  Hermits, sham saints,\nliving forms of mortification, holy mountebanks, avaunt! in the name of\nyour father Satan, get out of my sight!  When the devil's a hog, you shall\neat bacon.  I shall not forget yet awhile our fat Concilipetes of Chesil.\nO that Beelzebub and Astaroth had counselled them to hang themselves out of\nthe way, and they had done't! we had not then suffered so much by devilish\nstorms as we did for having seen 'em.  Hark ye me, dear rogue, Xenomanes,\nmy friend, I prithee are these hermits, hypocrites, and eavesdroppers maids\nor married?  Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?  Could a\nbody hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?  Will they lie\nbackwards, and let out their fore-rooms?  There's a fine question to be\nasked, cried Pantagruel.  Yes, yes, answered Xenomanes; you may find there\nmany goodly hypocritesses, jolly spiritual actresses, kind hermitesses,\nwomen that have a plaguy deal of religion; then there's the copies of 'em,\nlittle hypocritillons, sham sanctitos, and hermitillons.  Foh! away with\nthem, cried Friar John; a young saint, an old devil!  (Mark this, an old\nsaying, and as true a one as, a young whore, an old saint.)  Were there not\nsuch, continued Xenomanes, the isle of Chaneph, for want of a\nmultiplication of progeny, had long ere this been desert and desolate.\n\nPantagruel sent them by Gymnast in the pinnace seventy-eight thousand fine\npretty little gold half-crowns, of those that are marked with a lantern.\nAfter this he asked, What's o'clock?  Past nine, answered Epistemon.  It is\nthen the best time to go to dinner, said Pantagruel; for the sacred line so\ncelebrated by Aristophanes in his play called Concionatrices is at hand,\nnever failing when the shadow is decempedal.\n\nFormerly, among the Persians, dinner-time was at a set hour only for kings;\nas for all others, their appetite and their belly was their clock; when\nthat chimed, they thought it time to go to dinner.  So we find in Plautus a\ncertain parasite making a heavy do, and sadly railing at the inventors of\nhour-glasses and dials as being unnecessary things, there being no clock\nmore regular than the belly.\n\nDiogenes being asked at what times a man ought to eat, answered, The rich\nwhen he is hungry, the poor when he has anything to eat.  Physicians more\nproperly say that the canonical hours are,\n\n  To rise at five, to dine at nine,\n  To sup at five, to sleep at nine.\n\nThe famous king Petosiris's magic was different,--Here the officers for the\ngut came in, and got ready the tables and cupboards; laid the cloth, whose\nsight and pleasant smell were very comfortable; and brought plates,\nnapkins, salts, tankards, flagons, tall-boys, ewers, tumblers, cups,\ngoblets, basins, and cisterns.\n\nFriar John, at the head of the stewards, sewers, yeomen of the pantry, and\nof the mouth, tasters, carvers, cupbearers, and cupboard-keepers, brought\nfour stately pasties, so huge that they put me in mind of the four bastions\nat Turin.  Ods-fish, how manfully did they storm them!  What havoc did they\nmake with the long train of dishes that came after them!  How bravely did\nthey stand to their pan-puddings, and paid off their dust!  How merrily did\nthey soak their noses!\n\nThe fruit was not yet brought in, when a fresh gale at west and by north\nbegan to fill the main-course, mizen-sail, fore-sail, tops, and\ntop-gallants; for which blessing they all sung divers hymns of thanks and\npraise.\n\nWhen the fruit was on the table, Pantagruel asked, Now tell me, gentlemen,\nare your doubts fully resolved or no?  I gape and yawn no more, answered\nRhizotome.  I sleep no longer like a dog, said Ponocrates.  I have cleared\nmy eyesight, said Gymnast.  I have broke my fast, said Eusthenes; so that\nfor this whole day I shall be secure from the danger of my spittle.\n\nAsps.             Black wag leg-flies.  Domeses.\nAmphisbenes.

Art thou speaking ill of women, cried Panurge,\nthou mangy scoundrel, thou sorry, noddy-peaked shaveling monk?  By the\ncenomanic paunch and gixy, said Epistemon, Euripides has written, and makes\nAndromache say it, that by industry, and the help of the gods, men had\nfound remedies against all poisonous creatures; but none was yet found\nagainst a bad wife.\n\nThis flaunting Euripides, cried Panurge, was gabbling against women every\nfoot, and therefore was devoured by dogs, as a judgment from above; as\nAristophanes observes.  Let's go on.  Let him speak that is next.  I can\nleak now like any stone-horse, said then Epistemon.  I am, said Xenomanes,\nfull as an egg and round as a hoop; my ship's hold can hold no more, and\nwill now make shift to bear a steady sail.  Said Carpalin, A truce with\nthirst, a truce with hunger; they are strong, but wine and meat are\nstronger.  I'm no more in the dumps cried Panurge; my heart's a pound\nlighter.  I'm in the right cue now, as brisk as a body-louse, and as merry\nas a beggar.  For my part, I know what I do when I drink; and it is a true\nthing (though 'tis in your Euripides) that is said by that jolly toper\nSilenus of blessed memory, that--\n\n  The man's emphatically mad,\n  Who drinks the best, yet can be sad.\n\nWe must not fail to return our humble and hearty thanks to the Being who,\nwith this good bread, this cool delicious wine, these good meats and rare\ndainties, removes from our bodies and minds these pains and perturbations,\nand at the same time fills us with pleasure and with food.\n\nBut methinks, sir, you did not give an answer to Friar John's question;\nwhich, as I take it, was how to raise good weather.  Since you ask no more\nthan this easy question, answered Pantagruel, I'll strive to give you\nsatisfaction; and some other time we'll talk of the rest of the problems,\nif you will.\n\nWell then, Friar John asked how good weather might be raised.  Have we not\nraised it?  Look up and see our full topsails.  Hark how the wind whistles\nthrough the shrouds, what a stiff gale it blows.  Observe the rattling of\nthe tacklings, and see the sheets that fasten the mainsail behind; the\nforce of the wind puts them upon the stretch.  While we passed our time\nmerrily, the dull weather also passed away; and while we raised the glasses\nto our mouths, we also raised the wind by a secret sympathy in nature.\n\nThus Atlas and Hercules clubbed to raise and underprop the falling sky, if\nyou'll believe the wise mythologists, but they raised it some half an inch\ntoo high, Atlas to entertain his guest Hercules more pleasantly, and\nHercules to make himself amends for the thirst which some time before had\ntormented him in the deserts of Africa.  Your good father, said Friar John,\ninterrupting him, takes care to free many people from such an\ninconveniency; for I have been told by many venerable doctors that his\nchief-butler, Turelupin, saves above eighteen hundred pipes of wine yearly\nto make servants, and all comers and goers, drink before they are a-dry.\nAs the camels and dromedaries of a caravan, continued Pantagruel, use to\ndrink for the thirst that's past, for the present, and for that to come, so\ndid Hercules; and being thus excessively raised, this gave new motion to\nthe sky, which is that of titubation and trepidation, about which our\ncrackbrained astrologers make such a pother.  This, said Panurge, makes the\nsaying good:\n\n  While jolly companions carouse it together,\n  A fig for the storm, it gives way to good weather.\n\nNay, continued Pantagruel, some will tell you that we have not only\nshortened the time of the calm, but also much disburthened the ship; not\nlike Aesop's basket, by easing it of the provision, but by breaking our\nfasts; and that a man is more terrestrial and heavy when fasting than when\nhe has eaten and drank, even as they pretend that he weighs more dead than\nliving.  However it is, you will grant they are in the right who take their\nmorning's draught and breakfast before a long journey; then say that the\nhorses will perform the better, and that a spur in the head is worth two in\nthe flank; or, in the same horse dialect--\n\n  That a cup in the pate\n  Is a mile in the gate.\n\nDon't you know that formerly the Amycleans worshipped the noble Bacchus\nabove all other gods, and gave him the name of Psila, which in the Doric\ndialect signifies wings; for, as the birds raise themselves by a towering\nflight with their wings above the clouds, so, with the help of soaring\nBacchus, the powerful juice of the grape, our spirits are exalted to a\npitch above themselves, our bodies are more sprightly, and their earthly\nparts become soft and pliant.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXVI.\n\nHow, by Pantagruel's order, the Muses were saluted near the isle of\nGanabim.\n\nThis fair wind and as fine talk brought us in sight of a high land, which\nPantagruel discovering afar off, showed it Xenomanes, and asked him, Do you\nsee yonder to the leeward a high rock with two tops, much like Mount\nParnassus in Phocis?  I do plainly, answered Xenomanes; 'tis the isle of\nGanabim.  Have you a mind to go ashore there?  No, returned Pantagruel.\nYou do well, indeed, said Xenomanes; for there is nothing worth seeing in\nthe place.  The people are all thieves; yet there is the finest fountain in\nthe world, and a very large forest towards the right top of the mountain.\nYour fleet may take in wood and water there.\n\nHe that spoke last, spoke well, quoth Panurge; let us not by any means be\nso mad as to go among a parcel of thieves and sharpers.  You may take my\nword for't, this place is just such another as, to my knowledge, formerly\nwere the islands of Sark and Herm, between the smaller and the greater\nBritain; such as was the Poneropolis of Philip in Thrace; islands of\nthieves, banditti, picaroons, robbers, ruffians, and murderers, worse than\nraw-head and bloody-bones, and full as honest as the senior fellows of the\ncollege of iniquity, the very outcasts of the county gaol's common-side.\nAs you love yourself, do not go among 'em.  If you go you'll come off but\nbluely, if you come off at all.  If you will not believe me, at least\nbelieve what the good and wise Xenomanes tells you; for may I never stir if\nthey are not worse than the very cannibals; they would certainly eat us\nalive.  Do not go among 'em, I pray you; it were safer to take a journey to\nhell.  Hark! by Cod's body, I hear 'em ringing the alarm-bell most\ndreadfully, as the Gascons about Bordeaux used formerly to do against the\ncommissaries and officers for the tax on salt, or my ears tingle.  Let's\nsheer off.\n\nBelieve me, sir, said Friar John, let's rather land; we will rid the world\nof that vermin, and inn there for nothing.  Old Nick go with thee for me,\nquoth Panurge.  This rash hairbrained devil of a friar fears nothing, but\nventures and runs on like a mad devil as he is, and cares not a rush what\nbecomes of others; as if everyone was a monk, like his friarship.  A pox on\ngrinning honour, say I.  Go to, returned the friar, thou mangy noddy-peak!\nthou forlorn druggle-headed sneaksby! and may a million of black devils\nanatomize thy cockle brain.  The hen-hearted rascal is so cowardly that he\nberays himself for fear every day.  If thou art so afraid, dunghill, do not\ngo; stay here and be hanged; or go and hide thy loggerhead under Madam\nProserpine's petticoat.\n\nPanurge hearing this, his breech began to make buttons; so he slunk in in\nan instant, and went to hide his head down in the bread-room among the\nmusty biscuits and the orts and scraps of broken bread.\n\nPantagruel in the meantime said to the rest:  I feel a pressing retraction\nin my soul, which like a voice admonishes me not to land there.  Whenever I\nhave felt such a motion within me I have found myself happy in avoiding\nwhat it directed me to shun, or in undertaking what it prompted me to do;\nand I never had occasion to repent following its dictates.\n\nAs much, said Epistemon, is related of the daemon of Socrates, so\ncelebrated among the Academics.  Well then, sir, said Friar John, while the\nship's crew water have you a mind to have good sport?  Panurge is got down\nsomewhere in the hold, where he is crept into some corner, and lurks like a\nmouse in a cranny.  Let 'em give the word for the gunner to fire yon gun\nover the round-house on the poop; this will serve to salute the Muses of\nthis Anti-parnassus; besides, the powder does but decay in it.  You are in\nthe right, said Pantagruel; here, give the word for the gunner.\n\nThe gunner immediately came, and was ordered by Pantagruel to fire that\ngun, and then charge it with fresh powder, which was soon done.  The\ngunners of the other ships, frigates, galleons, and galleys of the fleet,\nhearing us fire, gave every one a gun to the island; which made such a\nhorrid noise that you would have sworn heaven had been tumbling about our\nears.\n\n\n\nChapter 4.LXVII.\n\nHow Panurge berayed himself for fear; and of the huge cat Rodilardus, which\nhe took for a puny devil.\n\nPanurge, like a wild, addle-pated, giddy-goat, sallies out of the\nbread-room in his shirt, with nothing else about him but one of his\nstockings, half on, half off, about his heel, like a rough-footed pigeon;\nhis hair and beard all bepowdered with crumbs of bread in which he had been\nover head and ears, and a huge and mighty puss partly wrapped up in his\nother stocking.  In this equipage, his chaps moving like a monkey's who's\na-louse-hunting, his eyes staring like a dead pig's, his teeth chattering,\nand his bum quivering, the poor dog fled to Friar John, who was then sitting\nby the chain-wales of the starboard side of the ship, and prayed him\nheartily to take pity on him and keep him in the safeguard of his trusty\nbilbo; swearing, by his share of Papimany, that he had seen all hell broke\nloose.\n\nWoe is me, my Jacky, cried he, my dear Johnny, my old crony, my brother, my\nghostly father! all the devils keep holiday, all the devils keep their\nfeast to-day, man.  Pork and peas choke me if ever thou sawest such\npreparations in thy life for an infernal feast.  Dost thou see the smoke of\nhell's kitchens?  (This he said, showing him the smoke of the gunpowder\nabove the ships.)  Thou never sawest so many damned souls since thou wast\nborn; and so fair, so bewitching they seem, that one would swear they are\nStygian ambrosia.  I thought at first, God forgive me! that they had been\nEnglish souls; and I don't know but that this morning the isle of Horses,\nnear Scotland, was sacked, with all the English who had surprised it, by\nthe lords of Termes and Essay.\n\nFriar John, at the approach of Panurge, was entertained with a kind of\nsmell that was not like that of gunpowder, nor altogether so sweet as musk;\nwhich made him turn Panurge about, and then he saw that his shirt was\ndismally bepawed and berayed with fresh sir-reverence.  The retentive\nfaculty of the nerve which restrains the muscle called sphincter ('tis the\narse-hole, an it please you) was relaxated by the violence of the fear\nwhich he had been in during his fantastic visions.  Add to this the\nthundering noise of the shooting, which seems more dreadful between decks\nthan above.  Nor ought you to wonder at such a mishap; for one of the\nsymptoms and accidents of fear is, that it often opens the wicket of the\ncupboard wherein second-hand meat is kept for a time.  Let's illustrate\nthis noble theme with some examples.\n\nMesser Pantolfe de la Cassina of Siena, riding post from Rome, came to\nChambery, and alighting at honest Vinet's took one of the pitchforks in the\nstable; then turning to the innkeeper, said to him, Da Roma in qua io non\nson andato del corpo.  Di gratia piglia in mano questa forcha, et fa mi\npaura.  (I have not had a stool since I left Rome.  I pray thee take this\npitchfork and fright me.)  Vinet took it, and made several offers as if he\nwould in good earnest have hit the signor, but all in vain; so the Sienese\nsaid to him, Si tu non fai altramente, tu non fai nulla; pero sforzati di\nadoperarli piu guagliardamente.  (If thou dost not go another way to work,\nthou hadst as good do nothing; therefore try to bestir thyself more\nbriskly.)  With this, Vinet lent him such a swinging stoater with the\npitchfork souse between the neck and the collar of his jerkin, that down\nfell signor on the ground arsyversy, with his spindle shanks wide\nstraggling over his poll.  Then mine host sputtering, with a full-mouthed\nlaugh, said to his guest, By Beelzebub's bumgut, much good may it do you,\nSignore Italiano.  Take notice this is datum Camberiaci, given at Chambery.\n'Twas well the Sienese had untrussed his points and let down his drawers;\nfor this physic worked with him as soon as he took it, and as copious was\nthe evacuation as that of nine buffaloes and fourteen missificating\narch-lubbers.  Which operation being over, the mannerly Sienese courteously\ngave mine host a whole bushel of thanks, saying to him, Io ti ringratio, bel\nmessere; cosi facendo tu m' ai esparmiata la speza d'un servitiale.  (I\nthank thee, good landlord; by this thou hast e'en saved me the expense of a\nclyster.)\n\nI'll give you another example of Edward V., King of England.  Master\nFrancis Villon, being banished France, fled to him, and got so far into his\nfavour as to be privy to all his household affairs.  One day the king,\nbeing on his close-stool, showed Villon the arms of France, and said to\nhim, Dost thou see what respect I have for thy French kings?  I have none\nof their arms anywhere but in this backside, near my close-stool.\nOds-life, said the buffoon, how wise, prudent, and careful of your health\nyour highness is!  How carefully your learned doctor, Thomas Linacre, looks\nafter you!  He saw that now you grow old you are inclined to be somewhat\ncostive, and every day were fain to have an apothecary, I mean a suppository\nor clyster, thrust into your royal nockandroe; so he has, much to the\npurpose, induced you to place here the arms of France; for the very sight of\nthem puts you into such a dreadful fright that you immediately let fly as\nmuch as would come from eighteen squattering bonasi of Paeonia.  And if they\nwere painted in other parts of your house, by jingo, you would presently\nconskite yourself wherever you saw them.  Nay, had you but here a picture of\nthe great oriflamme of France, ods-bodikins, your tripes and bowels would be\nin no small danger of dropping out at the orifice of your posteriors.  But\nhenh, henh, atque iterum henh.\n\n  A silly cockney am I not,\n    As ever did from Paris come?\n  And with a rope and sliding knot\n    My neck shall know what weighs my bum.\n\nA cockney of short reach, I say, shallow of judgment and judging shallowly,\nto wonder that you should cause your points to be untrussed in your chamber\nbefore you come into this closet.  By'r lady, at first I thought your\nclose-stool had stood behind the hangings of your bed; otherwise it seemed\nvery odd to me you should untruss so far from the place of evacuation.  But\nnow I find I was a gull, a wittol, a woodcock, a mere ninny, a dolt-head, a\nnoddy, a changeling, a calf-lolly, a doddipoll.  You do wisely, by the\nmass, you do wisely; for had you not been ready to clap your hind face on\nthe mustard-pot as soon as you came within sight of these arms--mark ye me,\ncop's body--the bottom of your breeches had supplied the office of a\nclose-stool.\n\nFriar John, stopping the handle of his face with his left hand, did, with\nthe forefinger of the right, point out Panurge's shirt to Pantagruel, who,\nseeing him in this pickle, scared, appalled, shivering, raving, staring,\nberayed, and torn with the claws of the famous cat Rodilardus, could not\nchoose but laugh, and said to him, Prithee what wouldst thou do with this\ncat?  With this cat? quoth Panurge; the devil scratch me if I did not think\nit had been a young soft-chinned devil, which, with this same stocking\ninstead of mitten, I had snatched up in the great hutch of hell as\nthievishly as any sizar of Montague college could have done.  The devil\ntake Tybert!  I feel it has all bepinked my poor hide, and drawn on it to\nthe life I don't know how many lobsters' whiskers.  With this he threw his\nboar-cat down.\n\nGo, go, said Pantagruel, be bathed and cleaned, calm your fears, put on a\nclean shift, and then your clothes.  What! do you think I am afraid? cried\nPanurge.  Not I, I protest.  By the testicles of Hercules, I am more\nhearty, bold, and stout, though I say it that should not, than if I had\nswallowed as many flies as are put into plumcakes and other paste at Paris\nfrom Midsummer to Christmas.  But what's this?  Hah! oh, ho! how the devil\ncame I by this?  Do you call this what the cat left in the malt, filth,\ndirt, dung, dejection, faecal matter, excrement, stercoration,\nsir-reverence, ordure, second-hand meats, fumets, stronts, scybal, or\nspyrathe? 'Tis Hibernian saffron, I protest.  Hah, hah, hah! 'tis Irish\nsaffron, by Shaint Pautrick, and so much for this time.  Selah.  Let's\ndrink.\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH BOOK\n\n\nThe Author's Prologue.\n\nIndefatigable topers, and you, thrice precious martyrs of the smock, give\nme leave to put a serious question to your worships while you are idly\nstriking your codpieces, and I myself not much better employed.  Pray, why\nis it that people say that men are not such sots nowadays as they were in\nthe days of yore?  Sot is an old word that signifies a dunce, dullard,\njolthead, gull, wittol, or noddy, one without guts in his brains, whose\ncockloft is unfurnished, and, in short, a fool.  Now would I know whether\nyou would have us understand by this same saying, as indeed you logically\nmay, that formerly men were fools and in this generation are grown wise?\nHow many and what dispositions made them fools?  How many and what\ndispositions were wanting to make 'em wise?  Why were they fools?  How\nshould they be wise?  Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly\nfools?  How did you find that they are now wise?  Who the devil made 'em\nfools?  Who a God's name made 'em wise?  Who d'ye think are most, those\nthat loved mankind foolish, or those that love it wise?  How long has it\nbeen wise?  How long otherwise?  Whence proceeded the foregoing folly?\nWhence the following wisdom?  Why did the old folly end now, and no later?\nWhy did the modern wisdom begin now, and no sooner?  What were we the worse\nfor the former folly?  What the better for the succeeding wisdom?  How\nshould the ancient folly be come to nothing?  How should this same new\nwisdom be started up and established?\n\nNow answer me, an't please you.  I dare not adjure you in stronger terms,\nreverend sirs, lest I make your pious fatherly worships in the least\nuneasy.  Come, pluck up a good heart; speak the truth and shame the devil.\nBe cheery, my lads; and if you are for me, take me off three or five\nbumpers of the best, while I make a halt at the first part of the sermon;\nthen answer my question.  If you are not for me, avaunt! avoid, Satan!  For\nI swear by my great-grandmother's placket (and that's a horrid oath), that\nif you don't help me to solve that puzzling problem, I will, nay, I already\ndo repent having proposed it; for still I must remain nettled and\ngravelled, and a devil a bit I know how to get off.  Well, what say you?\nI'faith, I begin to smell you out.  You are not yet disposed to give me an\nanswer; nor I neither, by these whiskers.  Yet to give some light into the\nbusiness, I'll e'en tell you what had been anciently foretold in the matter\nby a venerable doctor, who, being moved by the spirit in a prophetic vein,\nwrote a book ycleped the Prelatical Bagpipe.  What d'ye think the old\nfornicator saith?  Hearken, you old noddies, hearken now or never.\n\n  The jubilee's year, when all like fools were shorn,\n  Is about thirty supernumerary.\n  O want of veneration! fools they seemed,\n  But, persevering, with long breves, at last\n  No more they shall be gaping greedy fools.\n  For they shall shell the shrub's delicious fruit,\n  Whose flower they in the spring so much had feared.\n\nNow you have it, what do you make on't?  The seer is ancient, the style\nlaconic, the sentences dark like those of Scotus, though they treat of\nmatters dark enough in themselves.  The best commentators on that good\nfather take the jubilee after the thirtieth to be the years that are\nincluded in this present age till 1550 (there being but one jubilee every\nfifty years).  Men shall no longer be thought fools next green peas season.\n\nThe fools, whose number, as Solomon certifies, is infinite, shall go to pot\nlike a parcel of mad bedlamites as they are; and all manner of folly shall\nhave an end, that being also numberless, according to Avicenna, maniae\ninfinitae sunt species.  Having been driven back and hidden towards the\ncentre during the rigour of the winter, 'tis now to be seen on the surface,\nand buds out like the trees.  This is as plain as a nose in a man's face;\nyou know it by experience; you see it.  And it was formerly found out by\nthat great good man Hippocrates, Aphorism Verae etenim maniae, &c.  This\nworld therefore wisifying itself, shall no longer dread the flower and\nblossoms of every coming spring, that is, as you may piously believe,\nbumper in hand and tears in eyes, in the woeful time of Lent, which used to\nkeep them company.\n\nWhole cartloads of books that seemed florid, flourishing, and flowery, gay,\nand gaudy as so many butterflies, but in the main were tiresome, dull,\nsoporiferous, irksome, mischievous, crabbed, knotty, puzzling, and dark as\nthose of whining Heraclitus, as unintelligible as the numbers of\nPythagoras, that king of the bean, according to Horace; those books, I say,\nhave seen their best days and shall soon come to nothing, being delivered\nto the executing worms and merciless petty chandlers; such was their\ndestiny, and to this they were predestinated.\n\nIn their stead beans in cod are started up; that is, these merry and\nfructifying Pantagruelian books, so much sought nowadays in expectation of\nthe following jubilee's period; to the study of which writings all people\nhave given their minds, and accordingly have gained the name of wise.\n\nNow I think I have fairly solved and resolved your problem; then reform,\nand be the better for it.  Hem once or twice like hearts of oak; stand to\nyour pan-puddings, and take me off your bumpers, nine go-downs, and huzza!\nsince we are like to have a good vintage, and misers hang themselves.  Oh!\nthey will cost me an estate in hempen collars if fair weather hold.  For I\nhereby promise to furnish them with twice as much as will do their business\non free cost, as often as they will take the pains to dance at a rope's end\nprovidently to save charges, to the no small disappointment of the finisher\nof the law.\n\nNow, my friends, that you may put in for a share of this new wisdom, and\nshake off the antiquated folly this very moment, scratch me out of your\nscrolls and quite discard the symbol of the old philosopher with the golden\nthigh, by which he has forbidden you to eat beans; for you may take it for\na truth granted among all professors in the science of good eating, that he\nenjoined you not to taste of them only with the same kind intent that a\ncertain fresh-water physician had when he did forbid to Amer, late Lord of\nCamelotiere, kinsman to the lawyer of that name, the wing of the partridge,\nthe rump of the chicken, and the neck of the pigeon, saying, Ala mala,\nrumpum dubium, collum bonum, pelle remota.  For the duncical dog-leech was\nso selfish as to reserve them for his own dainty chops, and allowed his\npoor patients little more than the bare bones to pick, lest they should\noverload their squeamish stomachs.\n\nTo the heathen philosopher succeeded a pack of Capuchins, monks who forbid\nus the use of beans, that is, Pantagruelian books.  They seem to follow the\nexample of Philoxenus and Gnatho, one of whom was a Sicilian of fulsome\nmemory, the ancient master-builders of their monastic cram-gut\nvoluptuousness, who, when some dainty bit was served up at a feast,\nfilthily used to spit on it, that none but their nasty selves might have\nthe stomach to eat of it, though their liquorish chops watered never so\nmuch after it.\n\nSo those hideous, snotty, phthisicky, eaves-dropping, musty, moving forms\nof mortification, both in public and private, curse those dainty books, and\nlike toads spit their venom upon them.\n\nNow, though we have in our mother-tongue several excellent works in verse\nand prose, and, heaven be praised! but little left of the trash and\ntrumpery stuff of those duncical mumblers of ave-maries and the barbarous\nforegoing Gothic age, I have made bold to choose to chirrup and warble my\nplain ditty, or, as they say, to whistle like a goose among the swans,\nrather than be thought deaf among so many pretty poets and eloquent\norators.  And thus I am prouder of acting the clown, or any other\nunder-part, among the many ingenious actors in that noble play, than of\nherding among those mutes, who, like so many shadows and ciphers, only serve\nto fill up the house and make up a number, gaping and yawning at the flies,\nand pricking up their lugs, like so many Arcadian asses, at the striking up\nof the music; thus silently giving to understand that their fopships are\ntickled in the right place.\n\nHaving taken this resolution, I thought it would not be amiss to move my\nDiogenical tub, that you might not accuse me of living without example.  I\nsee a swarm of our modern poets and orators, your Colinets, Marots,\nDrouets, Saint Gelais, Salels, Masuels, and many more, who, having\ncommenced masters in Apollo's academy on Mount Parnassus, and drunk\nbrimmers at the Caballin fountain among the nine merry Muses, have raised\nour vulgar tongue, and made it a noble and everlasting structure.  Their\nworks are all Parian marble, alabaster, porphyry, and royal cement; they\ntreat of nothing but heroic deeds, mighty things, grave and difficult\nmatters, and this in a crimson, alamode, rhetorical style.  Their writings\nare all divine nectar, rich, racy, sparkling, delicate, and luscious wine.\nNor does our sex wholly engross this honour; ladies have had their share of\nthe glory; one of them, of the royal blood of France, whom it were a\nprofanation but to name here, surprises the age at once by the transcendent\nand inventive genius in her writings and the admirable graces of her style.\nImitate those great examples if you can; for my part I cannot.  Everyone,\nyou know, cannot go to Corinth.  When Solomon built the temple, all could\nnot give gold by handfuls.\n\nSince then 'tis not in my power to improve our architecture as much as\nthey, I am e'en resolved to do like Renault of Montauban:  I'll wait on the\nmasons, set on the pot for the masons, cook for the stone-cutters; and\nsince it was not my good luck to be cut out for one of them, I will live\nand die the admirer of their divine writings.\n\nAs for you, little envious prigs, snarling bastards, puny critics, you'll\nsoon have railed your last; go hang yourselves, and choose you out some\nwell-spread oak, under whose shade you may swing in state, to the\nadmiration of the gaping mob; you shall never want rope enough.  While I\nhere solemnly protest before my Helicon, in the presence of my nine\nmistresses the Muses, that if I live yet the age of a dog, eked out with\nthat of three crows, sound wind and limbs, like the old Hebrew captain\nMoses, Xenophilus the musician, and Demonax the philosopher, by arguments\nno ways impertinent, and reasons not to be disputed, I will prove, in the\nteeth of a parcel of brokers and retailers of ancient rhapsodies and such\nmouldy trash, that our vulgar tongue is not so mean, silly, inept, poor,\nbarren, and contemptible as they pretend.  Nor ought I to be afraid of I\nknow not what botchers of old threadbare stuff, a hundred and a hundred\ntimes clouted up and pieced together; wretched bunglers that can do nothing\nbut new-vamp old rusty saws; beggarly scavengers that rake even the\nmuddiest canals of antiquity for scraps and bits of Latin as insignificant\nas they are often uncertain.  Beseeching our grandees of Witland that, as\nwhen formerly Apollo had distributed all the treasures of his poetical\nexchequer to his favourites, little hulchbacked Aesop got for himself the\noffice of apologue-monger; in the same manner, since I do not aspire\nhigher, they would not deny me that of puny rhyparographer, or riffraff\nfollower of the sect of Pyreicus.\n\nI dare swear they will grant me this; for they are all so kind, so\ngood-natured, and so generous, that they'll ne'er boggle at so small a\nrequest. Therefore, both dry and hungry souls, pot and trenchermen, fully\nenjoying those books, perusing, quoting them in their merry conventicles,\nand observing the great mysteries of which they treat, shall gain a singular\nprofit and fame; as in the like case was done by Alexander the Great with\nthe books of prime philosophy composed by Aristotle.\n\nO rare! belly on belly! what swillers, what twisters will there be!\n\nThen be sure all you that take care not to die of the pip, be sure, I say,\nyou take my advice, and stock yourselves with good store of such books as\nsoon as you meet with them at the booksellers; and do not only shell those\nbeans, but e'en swallow them down like an opiate cordial, and let them be\nin you; I say, let them be within you; then you shall find, my beloved,\nwhat good they do to all clever shellers of beans.\n\nHere is a good handsome basketful of them, which I here lay before your\nworships; they were gathered in the very individual garden whence the\nformer came.  So I beseech you, reverend sirs, with as much respect as was\never paid by dedicating author, to accept of the gift, in hopes of somewhat\nbetter against next visit the swallows give us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH BOOK.\n\n\nChapter 5.I.\n\nHow Pantagruel arrived at the Ringing Island, and of the noise that we\nheard.\n\nPursuing our voyage, we sailed three days without discovering anything; on\nthe fourth we made land.  Our pilot told us that it was the Ringing Island,\nand indeed we heard a kind of a confused and often repeated noise, that\nseemed to us at a great distance not unlike the sound of great,\nmiddle-sized, and little bells rung all at once, as 'tis customary at Paris,\nTours, Gergeau, Nantes, and elsewhere on high holidays; and the nearer we\ncame to the land the louder we heard that jangling.\n\nSome of us doubted that it was the Dodonian kettle, or the portico called\nHeptaphone in Olympia, or the eternal humming of the colossus raised on\nMemnon's tomb in Thebes of Egypt, or the horrid din that used formerly to\nbe heard about a tomb at Lipara, one of the Aeolian islands.  But this did\nnot square with chorography.\n\nI do not know, said Pantagruel, but that some swarms of bees hereabouts may\nbe taking a ramble in the air, and so the neighbourhood make this\ndingle-dangle with pans, kettles, and basins, the corybantine cymbals of\nCybele, grandmother of the gods, to call them back.  Let's hearken.  When we\nwere nearer, among the everlasting ringing of these indefatigable bells we\nheard the singing, as we thought, of some men.  For this reason, before we\noffered to land on the Ringing Island, Pantagruel was of opinion that we\nshould go in the pinnace to a small rock, near which we discovered an\nhermitage and a little garden.  There we found a diminutive old hermit,\nwhose name was Braguibus, born at Glenay.  He gave us a full account of all\nthe jangling, and regaled us after a strange sort of fashion--four livelong\ndays did he make us fast, assuring us that we should not be admitted into\nthe Ringing Island otherwise, because it was then one of the four fasting,\nor ember weeks.  As I love my belly, quoth Panurge, I by no means understand\nthis riddle.  Methinks this should rather be one of the four windy weeks;\nfor while we fast we are only puffed up with wind.  Pray now, good father\nhermit, have not you here some other pastime besides fasting? Methinks it is\nsomewhat of the leanest; we might well enough be without so many palace\nholidays and those fasting times of yours.  In my Donatus, quoth Friar John,\nI could find yet but three times or tenses, the preterit, the present, and\nthe future; doubtless here the fourth ought to be a work of supererogation.\nThat time or tense, said Epistemon, is aorist, derived from the\npreter-imperfect tense of the Greeks, admitted in war (?) and odd cases.\nPatience perforce is a remedy for a mad dog.  Saith the hermit:  It is, as I\ntold you, fatal to go against this; whosoever does it is a rank heretic, and\nwants nothing but fire and faggot, that's certain.  To deal plainly with\nyou, my dear pater, cried Panurge, being at sea, I much more fear being wet\nthan being warm, and being drowned than being burned.\n\nWell, however, let us fast, a God's name; yet I have fasted so long that it\nhas quite undermined my flesh, and I fear that at last the bastions of this\nbodily fort of mine will fall to ruin.  Besides, I am much more afraid of\nvexing you in this same trade of fasting; for the devil a bit I understand\nanything in it, and it becomes me very scurvily, as several people have\ntold me, and I am apt to believe them.  For my part, I have no great\nstomach to fasting; for alas! it is as easy as pissing a bed, and a trade\nof which anybody may set up; there needs no tools.  I am much more inclined\nnot to fast for the future; for to do so there is some stock required, and\nsome tools are set a-work.  No matter, since you are so steadfast, and\nwould have us fast, let us fast as fast as we can, and then breakfast in\nthe name of famine.  Now we are come to these esurial idle days.  I vow I\nhad quite put them out of my head long ago.  If we must fast, said\nPantagruel, I see no other remedy but to get rid of it as soon as we can,\nas we would out of a bad way.  I'll in that space of time somewhat look\nover my papers, and examine whether the marine study be as good as ours at\nland.  For Plato, to describe a silly, raw, ignorant fellow, compares him\nto those that are bred on shipboard, as we would do one bred up in a\nbarrel, who never saw anything but through the bung-hole.\n\nTo tell you the short and the long of the matter, our fasting was most\nhideous and terrible; for the first day we fasted on fisticuffs, the second\nat cudgels, the third at sharps, and the fourth at blood and wounds:  such\nwas the order of the fairies.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.II.\n\nHow the Ringing Island had been inhabited by the Siticines, who were become\nbirds.\n\nHaving fasted as aforesaid, the hermit gave us a letter for one whom he\ncalled Albian Camar, Master Aedituus of the Ringing Island; but Panurge\ngreeting him called him Master Antitus.  He was a little queer old fellow,\nbald-pated, with a snout whereat you might easily have lighted a\ncard-match, and a phiz as red as a cardinal's cap.  He made us all very\nwelcome, upon the hermit's recommendation, hearing that we had fasted, as I\nhave told you.\n\nWhen we had well stuffed our puddings, he gave us an account of what was\nremarkable in the island, affirming that it had been at first inhabited by\nthe Siticines; but that, according to the course of nature--as all things,\nyou know, are subject to change--they were become birds.\n\nThere I had a full account of all that Atteius Capito, Paulus, Marcellus,\nA. Gellius, Athenaeus, Suidas, Ammonius, and others had writ of the\nSiticines and Sicinnists; and then we thought we might as easily believe\nthe transmutations of Nectymene, Progne, Itys, Alcyone, Antigone, Tereus,\nand other birds.  Nor did we think it more reasonable to doubt of the\ntransmogrification of the Macrobian children into swans, or that of the men\nof Pallene in Thrace into birds, as soon as they had bathed themselves in\nthe Tritonic lake.  After this the devil a word could we get out of him but\nof birds and cages.\n\nThe cages were spacious, costly, magnificent, and of an admirable\narchitecture.  The birds were large, fine, and neat accordingly, looking as\nlike the men in my country as one pea does like another; for they ate and\ndrank like men, muted like men, endued or digested like men, farted like\nmen, but stunk like devils; slept, billed, and trod their females like men,\nbut somewhat oftener:  in short, had you seen and examined them from top to\ntoe, you would have laid your head to a turnip that they had been mere men.\nHowever, they were nothing less, as Master Aedituus told us; assuring us,\nat the same time, that they were neither secular nor laic; and the truth\nis, the diversity of their feathers and plumes did not a little puzzle us.\n\nSome of them were all over as white as swans, others as black as crows,\nmany as grey as owls, others black and white like magpies, some all red\nlike red-birds, and others purple and white like some pigeons.  He called\nthe males clerg-hawks, monk-hawks, priest-hawks, abbot-hawks, bish-hawks,\ncardin-hawks, and one pope-hawk, who is a species by himself.  He called\nthe females clerg-kites, nun-kites, priest-kites, abbess-kites, bish-kites,\ncardin-kites, and pope-kites.\n\nHowever, said he, as hornets and drones will get among the bees, and there\ndo nothing but buzz, eat, and spoil everything; so, for these last three\nhundred years, a vast swarm of bigottelloes flocked, I do not know how,\namong these goodly birds every fifth full moon, and have bemuted, berayed,\nand conskited the whole island.  They are so hard-favoured and monstrous\nthat none can abide them.  For their wry necks make a figure like a crooked\nbillet; their paws are hairy, like those of rough-footed pigeons; their\nclaws and pounces, belly and breech, like those of the Stymphalid harpies.\nNor is it possible to root them out, for if you get rid of one, straight\nfour-and-twenty new ones fly thither.\n\nThere had been need of another monster-hunter such as was Hercules; for\nFriar John had like to have run distracted about it, so much he was nettled\nand puzzled in the matter.  As for the good Pantagruel, he was even served\nas was Messer Priapus, contemplating the sacrifices of Ceres, for want of\nskin.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.III.\n\nHow there is but one pope-hawk in the Ringing Island.\n\nWe then asked Master Aedituus why there was but one pope-hawk among such\nvenerable birds multiplied in all their species.  He answered that such was\nthe first institution and fatal destiny of the stars that the clerg-hawks\nbegot the priest-hawks and monk-hawks without carnal copulation, as some\nbees are born of a young bull; the priest-hawks begat the bish-hawks, the\nbish-hawks the stately cardin-hawks, and the stately cardin-hawks, if they\nlive long enough, at last come to be pope-hawk.\n\nOf this last kind there never is more than one at a time, as in a beehive\nthere is but one king, and in the world is but one sun.\n\nWhen the pope-hawk dies, another arises in his stead out of the whole brood\nof cardin-hawks, that is, as you must understand it all along, without\ncarnal copulation.  So that there is in that species an individual unity,\nwith a perpetuity of succession, neither more or less than in the Arabian\nphoenix.\n\n'Tis true that, about two thousand seven hundred and sixty moons ago, two\npope-hawks were seen upon the face of the earth; but then you never saw in\nyour lives such a woeful rout and hurly-burly as was all over this island.\nFor all these same birds did so peck, clapperclaw, and maul one another all\nthat time, that there was the devil and all to do, and the island was in a\nfair way of being left without inhabitants.  Some stood up for this\npope-hawk, some for t'other.  Some, struck with a dumbness, were as mute as\nso many fishes; the devil a note was to be got out of them; part of the\nmerry bells here were as silent as if they had lost their tongues, I mean\ntheir clappers.\n\nDuring these troublesome times they called to their assistance the\nemperors, kings, dukes, earls, barons, and commonwealths of the world that\nlive on t'other side the water; nor was this schism and sedition at an end\ntill one of them died, and the plurality was reduced to a unity.\n\nWe then asked what moved those birds to be thus continually chanting and\nsinging.  He answered that it was the bells that hung on the top of their\ncages.  Then he said to us, Will you have me make these monk-hawks whom you\nsee bardocuculated with a bag such as you use to still brandy, sing like\nany woodlarks?  Pray do, said we.  He then gave half-a-dozen pulls to a\nlittle rope, which caused a diminutive bell to give so many ting-tangs; and\npresently a parcel of monk-hawks ran to him as if the devil had drove 'em,\nand fell a-singing like mad.\n\nPray, master, cried Panurge, if I also rang this bell could I make those\nother birds yonder, with red-herring-coloured feathers, sing?  Ay, marry\nwould you, returned Aedituus.  With this Panurge hanged himself (by the\nhands, I mean) at the bell-rope's end, and no sooner made it speak but\nthose smoked birds hied them thither and began to lift up their voices and\nmake a sort of untowardly hoarse noise, which I grudge to call singing.\nAedituus indeed told us that they fed on nothing but fish, like the herns\nand cormorants of the world, and that they were a fifth kind of cucullati\nnewly stamped.\n\nHe added that he had been told by Robert Valbringue, who lately passed that\nway in his return from Africa, that a sixth kind was to fly hither out of\nhand, which he called capus-hawks, more grum, vinegar-faced, brain-sick,\nfroward, and loathsome than any kind whatsoever in the whole island.\nAfrica, said Pantagruel, still uses to produce some new and monstrous\nthing.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.IV.\n\nHow the birds of the Ringing Island were all passengers.\n\nSince you have told us, said Pantagruel, how the pope-hawk is begot by the\ncardin-hawks, the cardin-hawks by the bish-hawks, and the bish-hawks by the\npriest-hawks, and the priest-hawks by the clerg-hawks, I would gladly know\nwhence you have these same clerg-hawks.  They are all of them passengers,\nor travelling birds, returned Aedituus, and come hither from t'other world;\npart out of a vast country called Want-o'-bread, the rest out of another\ntoward the west, which they style Too-many-of-'em.  From these two\ncountries flock hither, every year, whole legions of these clerg-hawks,\nleaving their fathers, mothers, friends, and relations.\n\nThis happens when there are too many children, whether male or female, in\nsome good family of the latter country; insomuch that the house would come\nto nothing if the paternal estate were shared among them all (as reason\nrequires, nature directs, and God commands).  For this cause parents use to\nrid themselves of that inconveniency by packing off the younger fry, and\nforcing them to seek their fortune in this isle Bossart (Crooked Island).\nI suppose he means L'Isle Bouchart, near Chinon, cried Panurge.  No,\nreplied t'other, I mean Bossart (Crooked), for there is not one in ten\namong them but is either crooked, crippled, blinking, limping,\nill-favoured, deformed, or an unprofitable load to the earth.\n\n'Twas quite otherwise among the heathens, said Pantagruel, when they used\nto receive a maiden among the number of vestals; for Leo Antistius affirms\nthat it was absolutely forbidden to admit a virgin into that order if she\nhad any vice in her soul or defect in her body, though it were but the\nsmallest spot on any part of it.  I can hardly believe, continued Aedituus,\nthat their dams on t'other side the water go nine months with them; for\nthey cannot endure them nine years, nay, scarce seven sometimes, in the\nhouse, but by putting only a shirt over the other clothes of the young\nurchins, and lopping off I don't well know how many hairs from their\ncrowns, mumbling certain apostrophized and expiatory words, they visibly,\nopenly, and plainly, by a Pythagorical metempsychosis, without the least\nhurt, transmogrify them into such birds as you now see; much after the\nfashion of the Egyptian heathens, who used to constitute their isiacs by\nshaving them and making them put on certain linostoles, or surplices.\nHowever, I don't know, my good friends, but that these she-things, whether\nclerg-kites, monk-kites, and abbess-kites, instead of singing pleasant\nverses and charisteres, such as used to be sung to Oromasis by Zoroaster's\ninstitution, may be bellowing out such catarates and scythropys (cursed\nlamentable and wretched imprecations) as were usually offered to the\nArimanian demon; being thus in devotion for their kind friends and\nrelations that transformed them into birds, whether when they were maids,\nor thornbacks, in their prime, or at their last prayers.\n\nBut the greatest numbers of our birds came out of Want-o'-bread, which,\nthough a barren country, where the days are of a most tedious lingering\nlength, overstocks this whole island with the lower class of birds.  For\nhither fly the asapheis that inhabit that land, either when they are in\ndanger of passing their time scurvily for want of belly-timber, being\nunable, or, what's more likely, unwilling to take heart of grace and follow\nsome honest lawful calling, or too proud-hearted and lazy to go to service\nin some sober family.  The same is done by your frantic inamoradoes, who,\nwhen crossed in their wild desires, grow stark staring mad, and choose this\nlife suggested to them by their despair, too cowardly to make them swing,\nlike their brother Iphis of doleful memory.  There is another sort, that\nis, your gaol-birds, who, having done some rogue's trick or other heinous\nvillainy, and being sought up and down to be trussed up and made to ride\nthe two or three-legged mare that groans for them, warily scour off and\ncome here to save their bacon; because all these sorts of birds are here\nprovided for, and grow in an instant as fat as hogs, though they came as\nlean as rakes; for having the benefit of the clergy, they are as safe as\nthieves in a mill within this sanctuary.\n\nBut, asked Pantagruel, do these birds never return to the world where they\nwere hatched?  Some do, answered Aedituus; formerly very few, very seldom,\nvery late, and very unwillingly; however, since some certain eclipses, by\nthe virtue of the celestial constellations, a great crowd of them fled back\nto the world.  Nor do we fret or vex ourselves a jot about it; for those\nthat stay wisely sing, The fewer the better cheer; and all those that fly\naway, first cast off their feathers here among these nettles and briars.\n\nAccordingly we found some thrown by there; and as we looked up and down, we\nchanced to light on what some people will hardly thank us for having\ndiscovered; and thereby hangs a tale.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.V.\n\nOf the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing Island.\n\nThese words were scarce out of his mouth when some five-and-twenty or\nthirty birds flew towards us; they were of a hue and feather like which we\nhad not seen anything in the whole island.  Their plumes were as changeable\nas the skin of the chameleon, and the flower of tripolion, or teucrion.\nThey had all under the left wing a mark like two diameters dividing a\ncircle into equal parts, or, if you had rather have it so, like a\nperpendicular line falling on a right line.  The marks which each of them\nbore were much of the same shape, but of different colours; for some were\nwhite, others green, some red, others purple, and some blue.  Who are\nthose? asked Panurge; and how do you call them?  They are mongrels, quoth\nAedituus.\n\nWe call them knight-hawks, and they have a great number of rich\ncommanderies (fat livings) in your world.  Good your worship, said I, make\nthem give us a song, an't please you, that we may know how they sing.  They\nscorn your words, cried Aedituus; they are none of your singing-birds; but,\nto make amends, they feed as much as the best two of them all.  Pray where\nare their hens? where are their females? said I.  They have none, answered\nAedituus.  How comes it to pass then, asked Panurge, that they are thus\nbescabbed, bescurfed, all embroidered o'er the phiz with carbuncles,\npushes, and pock-royals, some of which undermine the handles of their\nfaces?  This same fashionable and illustrious disease, quoth Aedituus, is\ncommon among that kind of birds, because they are pretty apt to be tossed\non the salt deep.\n\nHe then acquainted us with the occasion of their coming.  This next to us,\nsaid he, looks so wistfully upon you to see whether he may not find among\nyour company a stately gaudy kind of huge dreadful birds of prey, which yet\nare so untoward that they ne'er could be brought to the lure nor to perch\non the glove.  They tell us that there are such in your world, and that\nsome of them have goodly garters below the knee with an inscription about\nthem which condemns him (qui mal y pense) who shall think ill of it to be\nberayed and conskited.  Others are said to wear the devil in a string\nbefore their paunches; and others a ram's skin.  All that's true enough,\ngood Master Aedituus, quoth Panurge; but we have not the honour to be\nacquainted with their knightships.\n\nCome on, cried Aedituus in a merry mood, we have had chat enough o'\nconscience! let's e'en go drink.  And eat, quoth Panurge.  Eat, replied\nAedituus, and drink bravely, old boy; twist like plough-jobbers and swill\nlike tinkers.  Pull away and save tide, for nothing is so dear and precious\nas time; therefore we will be sure to put it to a good use.\n\nHe would fain have carried us first to bathe in the bagnios of the\ncardin-hawks, which are goodly delicious places, and have us licked over\nwith precious ointments by the alyptes, alias rubbers, as soon as we should\ncome out of the bath.  But Pantagruel told him that he could drink but too\nmuch without that.  He then led us into a spacious delicate refectory, or\nfratery-room, and told us:  Braguibus the hermit made you fast four days\ntogether; now, contrariwise, I'll make you eat and drink of the best four\ndays through stitch before you budge from this place.  But hark ye me, cried\nPanurge, may not we take a nap in the mean time?  Ay, ay, answered Aedituus;\nthat is as you shall think good; for he that sleeps, drinks. Good Lord! how\nwe lived! what good bub! what dainty cheer!  O what a honest cod was this\nsame Aedituus!\n\n\n\nChapter 5.VI.\n\nHow the birds are crammed in the Ringing Island.\n\nPantagruel looked I don't know howish, and seemed not very well pleased\nwith the four days' junketting which Aedituus enjoined us.  Aedituus, who\nsoon found it out, said to him, You know, sir, that seven days before\nwinter, and seven days after, there is no storm at sea; for then the\nelements are still out of respect for the halcyons, or king-fishers, birds\nsacred to Thetis, which then lay their eggs and hatch their young near the\nshore.  Now here the sea makes itself amends for this long calm; and\nwhenever any foreigners come hither it grows boisterous and stormy for four\ndays together.  We can give no other reason for it but that it is a piece\nof its civility, that those who come among us may stay whether they will or\nno, and be copiously feasted all the while with the incomes of the ringing.\nTherefore pray don't think your time lost; for, willing, nilling, you'll be\nforced to stay, unless you are resolved to encounter Juno, Neptune, Doris,\nAeolus, and his fluster-busters, and, in short, all the pack of ill-natured\nleft-handed godlings and vejoves.  Do but resolve to be cheery, and fall-to\nbriskly.\n\nAfter we had pretty well stayed our stomachs with some tight snatches,\nFriar John said to Aedituus, For aught I see, you have none but a parcel of\nbirds and cages in this island of yours, and the devil a bit of one of them\nall that sets his hand to the plough, or tills the land whose fat he\ndevours; their whole business is to be frolic, to chirp it, to whistle it,\nto warble it, tossing it, and roar it merrily night and day.  Pray then, if\nI may be so bold, whence comes this plenty and overflowing of all dainty\nbits and good things which we see among you?  From all the other world,\nreturned Aedituus, if you except some part of the northern regions, who of\nlate years have stirred up the jakes.  Mum! they may chance ere long to rue\nthe day they did so; their cows shall have porridge, and their dogs oats;\nthere will be work made among them, that there will.  Come, a fig for't,\nlet's drink.  But pray what countrymen are you?  Touraine is our country,\nanswered Panurge.  Cod so, cried Aedituus, you were not then hatched of an\nill bird, I will say that for you, since the blessed Touraine is your\nmother; for from thence there comes hither every year such a vast store of\ngood things, that we were told by some folks of the place that happened to\ntouch at this island, that your Duke of Touraine's income will not afford\nhim to eat his bellyful of beans and bacon (a good dish spoiled between\nMoses and Pythagoras) because his predecessors have been more than liberal\nto these most holy birds of ours, that we might here munch it, twist it,\ncram it, gorge it, craw it, riot it, junket it, and tickle it off, stuffing\nour puddings with dainty pheasants, partridges, pullets with eggs, fat\ncapons of Loudunois, and all sorts of venison and wild fowl.  Come, box it\nabout; tope on, my friends.  Pray do you see yon jolly birds that are\nperched together, how fat, how plump, and in good case they look, with the\nincome that Touraine yields us!  And in faith they sing rarely for their\ngood founders, that is the truth on't.  You never saw any Arcadian birds\nmumble more fairly than they do over a dish when they see these two gilt\nbatons, or when I ring for them those great bells that you see above their\ncages.  Drink on, sirs, whip it away.  Verily, friends, 'tis very fine\ndrinking to-day, and so 'tis every day o' the week; then drink on, toss it\nabout, here's to you with all my soul.  You are most heartily welcome;\nnever spare it, I pray you; fear not we should ever want good bub and\nbelly-timber; for, look here, though the sky were of brass, and the earth\nof iron, we should not want wherewithal to stuff the gut, though they were\nto continue so seven or eight years longer than the famine in Egypt.  Let\nus then, with brotherly love and charity, refresh ourselves here with the\ncreature.\n\nWoons, man, cried Panurge, what a rare time you have on't in this world!\nPsha, returned Aedituus, this is nothing to what we shall have in t'other;\nthe Elysian fields will be the least that can fall to our lot.  Come, in\nthe meantime let us drink here; come, here's to thee, old fuddlecap.\n\nYour first Siticines, said I, were superlatively wise in devising thus a\nmeans for you to compass whatever all men naturally covet so much, and so\nfew, or, to speak more properly, none can enjoy together--I mean, a\nparadise in this life, and another in the next.  Sure you were born wrapt\nin your mother's smickets!  O happy creatures!  O more than men!  Would I\nhad the luck to fare like you!  (Motteux inserts Chapter XVI. after Chapter\nVI.)\n\n\n\nChapter 5.VII.\n\nHow Panurge related to Master Aedituus the fable of the horse and the ass.\n\nWhen we had crammed and crammed again, Aedituus took us into a chamber that\nwas well furnished, hung with tapestry, and finely gilt.  Thither he caused\nto be brought store of mirobolans, cashou, green ginger preserved, with\nplenty of hippocras, and delicious wine.  With those antidotes, that were\nlike a sweet Lethe, he invited us to forget the hardships of our voyage;\nand at the same time he sent plenty of provisions on board our ship that\nrid in the harbour.  After this, we e'en jogged to bed for that night; but\nthe devil a bit poor pilgarlic could sleep one wink--the everlasting\njingle-jangle of the bells kept me awake whether I would or no.\n\nAbout midnight Aedituus came to wake us that we might drink.  He himself\nshowed us the way, saying:  You men of t'other world say that ignorance is\nthe mother of all evil, and so far you are right; yet for all that you do\nnot take the least care to get rid of it, but still plod on, and live in\nit, with it, and by it; for which a plaguy deal of mischief lights on you\nevery day, and you are right enough served--you are perpetually ailing\nsomewhat, making a moan, and never right.  It is what I was ruminating upon\njust now.  And, indeed, ignorance keeps you here fastened in bed, just as\nthat bully-rock Mars was detained by Vulcan's art; for all the while you do\nnot mind that you ought to spare some of your rest, and be as lavish as you\ncan of the goods of this famous island.  Come, come, you should have eaten\nthree breakfasts already; and take this from me for a certain truth, that\nif you would consume the mouth-ammunition of this island, you must rise\nbetimes; eat them, they multiply; spare them, they diminish.\n\nFor example, mow a field in due season, and the grass will grow thicker and\nbetter; don't mow it, and in a short time 'twill be floored with moss.\nLet's drink, and drink again, my friends; come, let's all carouse it.  The\nleanest of our birds are now singing to us all; we'll drink to them, if you\nplease.  Let's take off one, two, three, nine bumpers.  Non zelus, sed\ncaritas.\n\nWhen day, peeping in the east, made the sky turn from black to red like a\nboiling lobster, he waked us again to take a dish of monastical brewis.\nFrom that time we made but one meal, that only lasted the whole day; so\nthat I cannot well tell how I may call it, whether dinner, supper,\nnunchion, or after-supper; only, to get a stomach, we took a turn or two in\nthe island, to see and hear the blessed singing-birds.\n\nAt night Panurge said to Aedituus:  Give me leave, sweet sir, to tell you a\nmerry story of something that happened some three and twenty moons ago in\nthe country of Chastelleraud.\n\nOne day in April, a certain gentleman's groom, Roger by name, was walking\nhis master's horses in some fallow ground.  There 'twas his good fortune to\nfind a pretty shepherdess feeding her bleating sheep and harmless lambkins\non the brow of a neighbouring mountain, in the shade of an adjacent grove;\nnear her, some frisking kids tripped it over a green carpet of nature's own\nspreading, and, to complete the landscape, there stood an ass.  Roger, who\nwas a wag, had a dish of chat with her, and after some ifs, ands, and buts,\nhems and heighs on her side, got her in the mind to get up behind him, to\ngo and see his stable, and there take a bit by the bye in a civil way.\nWhile they were holding a parley, the horse, directing his discourse to the\nass (for all brute beasts spoke that year in divers places), whispered\nthese words in his ear:  Poor ass, how I pity thee! thou slavest like any\nhack, I read it on thy crupper.  Thou dost well, however, since God has\ncreated thee to serve mankind; thou art a very honest ass, but not to be\nbetter rubbed down, currycombed, trapped, and fed than thou art, seems to\nme indeed to be too hard a lot.  Alas! thou art all rough-coated, in ill\nplight, jaded, foundered, crestfallen, and drooping, like a mooting duck,\nand feedest here on nothing but coarse grass, or briars and thistles.\nTherefore do but pace it along with me, and thou shalt see how we noble\nsteeds, made by nature for war, are treated.  Come, thou'lt lose nothing by\ncoming; I'll get thee a taste of my fare.  I' troth, sir, I can but love\nyou and thank you, returned the ass; I'll wait on you, good Mr. Steed.\nMethinks, gaffer ass, you might as well have said Sir Grandpaw Steed.  O!\ncry mercy, good Sir Grandpaw, returned the ass; we country clowns are\nsomewhat gross, and apt to knock words out of joint.  However, an't please\nyou, I will come after your worship at some distance, lest for taking this\nrun my side should chance to be firked and curried with a vengeance, as it\nis but too often, the more is my sorrow.\n\nThe shepherdess being got behind Roger, the ass followed, fully resolved to\nbait like a prince with Roger's steed; but when they got to the stable, the\ngroom, who spied the grave animal, ordered one of his underlings to welcome\nhim with a pitchfork and currycomb him with a cudgel.  The ass, who heard\nthis, recommended himself mentally to the god Neptune, and was packing off,\nthinking and syllogizing within himself thus:  Had not I been an ass, I had\nnot come here among great lords, when I must needs be sensible that I was\nonly made for the use of the small vulgar.  Aesop had given me a fair\nwarning of this in one of his fables.  Well, I must e'en scamper or take\nwhat follows.  With this he fell a-trotting, and wincing, and yerking, and\ncalcitrating, alias kicking, and farting, and funking, and curvetting, and\nbounding, and springing, and galloping full drive, as if the devil had come\nfor him in propria persona.\n\nThe shepherdess, who saw her ass scour off, told Roger that it was her\ncattle, and desired he might be kindly used, or else she would not stir her\nfoot over the threshold.  Friend Roger no sooner knew this but he ordered\nhim to be fetched in, and that my master's horses should rather chop straw\nfor a week together than my mistress's beast should want his bellyful of\ncorn.\n\nThe most difficult point was to get him back; for in vain the youngsters\ncomplimented and coaxed him to come.  I dare not, said the ass; I am\nbashful.  And the more they strove by fair means to bring him with them,\nthe more the stubborn thing was untoward, and flew out at the heels;\ninsomuch that they might have been there to this hour, had not his mistress\nadvised them to toss oats in a sieve or in a blanket, and call him; which\nwas done, and made him wheel about and say, Oats, with a witness! oats\nshall go to pot.  Adveniat; oats will do, there's evidence in the case; but\nnone of the rubbing down, none of the firking.  Thus melodiously singing\n(for, as you know, that Arcadian bird's note is very harmonious) he came to\nthe young gentleman of the horse, alias black garb, who brought him to the\nstable.\n\nWhen he was there, they placed him next to the great horse his friend,\nrubbed him down, currycombed him, laid clean straw under him up to the\nchin, and there he lay at rack and manger, the first stuffed with sweet\nhay, the latter with oats; which when the horse's valet-dear-chambre\nsifted, he clapped down his lugs, to tell them by signs that he could eat\nit but too well without sifting, and that he did not deserve so great an\nhonour.\n\nWhen they had well fed, quoth the horse to the ass;  Well, poor ass, how is\nit with thee now?  How dost thou like this fare?  Thou wert so nice at\nfirst, a body had much ado to get thee hither.  By the fig, answered the\nass, which, one of our ancestors eating, Philemon died laughing, this is\nall sheer ambrosia, good Sir Grandpaw; but what would you have an ass say?\nMethinks all this is yet but half cheer.  Don't your worships here now and\nthen use to take a leap?  What leaping dost thou mean? asked the horse; the\ndevil leap thee! dost thou take me for an ass?  In troth, Sir Grandpaw,\nquoth the ass, I am somewhat of a blockhead, you know, and cannot, for the\nheart's blood of me, learn so fast the court way of speaking of you\ngentlemen horses; I mean, don't you stallionize it sometimes here among\nyour mettled fillies?  Tush, whispered the horse, speak lower; for, by\nBucephalus, if the grooms but hear thee they will maul and belam thee\nthrice and threefold, so that thou wilt have but little stomach to a\nleaping bout.  Cod so, man, we dare not so much as grow stiff at the tip of\nthe lowermost snout, though it were but to leak or so, for fear of being\njerked and paid out of our lechery.  As for anything else, we are as happy\nas our master, and perhaps more.  By this packsaddle, my old acquaintance,\nquoth the ass, I have done with you; a fart for thy litter and hay, and a\nfart for thy oats; give me the thistles of our fields, since there we leap\nwhen we list.  Eat less, and leap more, I say; it is meat, drink, and cloth\nto us.  Ah! friend Grandpaw, it would do thy heart good to see us at a\nfair, when we hold our provincial chapter!  Oh! how we leap it, while our\nmistresses are selling their goslings and other poultry!  With this they\nparted.  Dixi; I have done.\n\nPanurge then held his peace.  Pantagruel would have had him to have gone on\nto the end of the chapter; but Aedituus said, A word to the wise is enough;\nI can pick out the meaning of that fable, and know who is that ass, and who\nthe horse; but you are a bashful youth, I perceive.  Well, know that\nthere's nothing for you here; scatter no words.  Yet, returned Panurge, I\nsaw but even now a pretty kind of a cooing abbess-kite as white as a dove,\nand her I had rather ride than lead.  May I never stir if she is not a\ndainty bit, and very well worth a sin or two.  Heaven forgive me! I meant\nno more harm in it than you; may the harm I meant in it befall me\npresently.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.VIII.\n\nHow with much ado we got a sight of the pope-hawk.\n\nOur junketting and banqueting held on at the same rate the third day as the\ntwo former.  Pantagruel then earnestly desired to see the pope-hawk; but\nAedituus told him it was not such an easy matter to get a sight of him.\nHow, asked Pantagruel, has he Plato's helmet on his crown, Gyges's ring on\nhis pounces, or a chameleon on his breast, to make him invisible when he\npleases?  No, sir, returned Aedituus; but he is naturally of pretty\ndifficult access.  However, I'll see and take care that you may see him, if\npossible.  With this he left us piddling; then within a quarter of an hour\ncame back, and told us the pope-hawk is now to be seen.  So he led us,\nwithout the least noise, directly to the cage wherein he sat drooping, with\nhis feathers staring about him, attended by a brace of little cardin-hawks\nand six lusty fusty bish-hawks.\n\nPanurge stared at him like a dead pig, examining exactly his figure, size,\nand motions.  Then with a loud voice he said, A curse light on the hatcher\nof the ill bird; o' my word, this is a filthy whoop-hooper.  Tush, speak\nsoftly, said Aedituus; by G--, he has a pair of ears, as formerly Michael\nde Matiscones remarked.  What then? returned Panurge; so hath a whoopcat.\nSo, said Aedituus; if he but hear you speak such another blasphemous word,\nyou had as good be damned.  Do you see that basin yonder in his cage?  Out\nof it shall sally thunderbolts and lightnings, storms, bulls, and the devil\nand all, that will sink you down to Peg Trantum's, an hundred fathom under\nground.  It were better to drink and be merry, quoth Friar John.\n\nPanurge was still feeding his eyes with the sight of the pope-hawk and his\nattendants, when somewhere under his cage he perceived a madge-howlet.\nWith this he cried out, By the devil's maker, master, there's roguery in\nthe case; they put tricks upon travellers here more than anywhere else, and\nwould make us believe that a t--d's a sugarloaf.  What damned cozening,\ngulling, and coney-catching have we here!  Do you see this madge-howlet?\nBy Minerva, we are all beshit.  Odsoons, said Aedituus, speak softly, I\ntell you.  It is no madge-howlet, no she-thing on my honest word; but a\nmale, and a noble bird.\n\nMay we not hear the pope-hawk sing? asked Pantagruel.  I dare not promise\nthat, returned Aedituus; for he only sings and eats at his own hours.  So\ndon't I, quoth Panurge; poor pilgarlic is fain to make everybody's time his\nown; if they have time, I find time.  Come, then, let us go drink, if you\nwill.  Now this is something like a tansy, said Aedituus; you begin to talk\nsomewhat like; still speak in that fashion, and I'll secure you from being\nthought a heretic.  Come on, I am of your mind.\n\nAs we went back to have t'other fuddling bout, we spied an old green-headed\nbish-hawk, who sat moping with his mate and three jolly bittern attendants,\nall snoring under an arbour.  Near the old cuff stood a buxom abbess-kite\nthat sung like any linnet; and we were so mightily tickled with her singing\nthat I vow and swear we could have wished all our members but one turned\ninto ears, to have had more of the melody.  Quoth Panurge, This pretty\ncherubim of cherubims is here breaking her head with chanting to this huge,\nfat, ugly face, who lies grunting all the while like a hog as he is.  I\nwill make him change his note presently, in the devil's name.  With this he\nrang a bell that hung over the bish-hawk's head; but though he rang and\nrang again, the devil a bit bish-hawk would hear; the louder the sound, the\nlouder his snoring.  There was no making him sing.  By G--, quoth Panurge,\nyou old buzzard, if you won't sing by fair means, you shall by foul.\nHaving said this, he took up one of St. Stephen's loaves, alias a stone,\nand was going to hit him with it about the middle.  But Aedituus cried to\nhim, Hold, hold, honest friend! strike, wound, poison, kill, and murder all\nthe kings and princes in the world, by treachery or how thou wilt, and as\nsoon as thou wouldst unnestle the angels from their cockloft.  Pope-hawk\nwill pardon thee all this.  But never be so mad as to meddle with these\nsacred birds, as much as thou lovest the profit, welfare, and life not only\nof thyself, and thy friends and relations alive or dead, but also of those\nthat may be born hereafter to the thousandth generation; for so long thou\nwouldst entail misery upon them.  Do but look upon that basin.  Catso! let\nus rather drink, then, quoth Panurge.  He that spoke last, spoke well, Mr.\nAntitus, quoth Friar John; while we are looking on these devilish birds we\ndo nothing but blaspheme; and while we are taking a cup we do nothing but\npraise God.  Come on, then, let's go drink; how well that word sounds!\n\nThe third day (after we had drank, as you must understand) Aedituus\ndismissed us.  We made him a present of a pretty little Perguois knife,\nwhich he took more kindly than Artaxerxes did the cup of cold water that\nwas given him by a clown.  He most courteously thanked us, and sent all\nsorts of provisions aboard our ships, wished us a prosperous voyage and\nsuccess in our undertakings, and made us promise and swear by Jupiter of\nstone to come back by his territories.  Finally he said to us, Friends,\npray note that there are many more stones in the world than men; take care\nyou don't forget it.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.IX.\n\nHow we arrived at the island of Tools.\n\n\nHaving well ballasted the holds of our human vessels, we weighed anchor,\nhoised up sail, stowed the boats, set the land, and stood for the offing\nwith a fair loom gale, and for more haste unpareled the mizen-yard, and\nlaunched it and the sail over the lee-quarter, and fitted gyves to keep it\nsteady, and boomed it out; so in three days we made the island of Tools,\nthat is altogether uninhabited.  We saw there a great number of trees which\nbore mattocks, pickaxes, crows, weeding-hooks, scythes, sickles, spades,\ntrowels, hatchets, hedging-bills, saws, adzes, bills, axes, shears,\npincers, bolts, piercers, augers, and wimbles.\n\nOthers bore dags, daggers, poniards, bayonets, square-bladed tucks,\nstilettoes, poniardoes, skeans, penknives, puncheons, bodkins, swords,\nrapiers, back-swords, cutlasses, scimitars, hangers, falchions, glaives,\nraillons, whittles, and whinyards.\n\nWhoever would have any of these needed but to shake the tree, and\nimmediately they dropped down as thick as hops, like so many ripe plums;\nnay, what's more, they fell on a kind of grass called scabbard, and\nsheathed themselves in it cleverly.  But when they came down, there was\nneed of taking care lest they happened to touch the head, feet, or other\nparts of the body.  For they fell with the point downwards, and in they\nstuck, or slit the continuum of some member, or lopped it off like a twig;\neither of which generally was enough to have killed a man, though he were a\nhundred years old, and worth as many thousand spankers, spur-royals, and\nrose-nobles.\n\nUnder some other trees, whose names I cannot justly tell you, I saw some\ncertain sorts of weeds that grew and sprouted like pikes, lances, javelins,\njavelots, darts, dartlets, halberds, boar-spears, eel-spears, partizans,\ntridents, prongs, trout-staves, spears, half-pikes, and hunting-staves.  As\nthey sprouted up and chanced to touch the tree, straight they met with\ntheir heads, points, and blades, each suitable to its kind, made ready for\nthem by the trees over them, as soon as every individual wood was grown up,\nfit for its steel; even like the children's coats, that are made for them\nas soon as they can wear them and you wean them of their swaddling clothes.\nNor do you mutter, I pray you, at what Plato, Anaxagoras, and Democritus\nhave said.  Ods-fish! they were none of your lower-form gimcracks, were\nthey?\n\nThose trees seemed to us terrestrial animals, in no wise so different from\nbrute beasts as not to have skin, fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments,\nnerves, cartilages, kernels, bones, marrow, humours, matrices, brains, and\narticulations; for they certainly have some, since Theophrastus will have\nit so.  But in this point they differed from other animals, that their\nheads, that is, the part of their trunks next to the root, are downwards;\ntheir hair, that is, their roots, in the earth; and their feet, that is,\ntheir branches, upside down; as if a man should stand on his head with\noutstretched legs.  And as you, battered sinners, on whom Venus has\nbestowed something to remember her, feel the approach of rains, winds,\ncold, and every change of weather, at your ischiatic legs and your\nomoplates, by means of the perpetual almanack which she has fixed there; so\nthese trees have notice given them, by certain sensations which they have\nat their roots, stocks, gums, paps, or marrow, of the growth of the staves\nunder them, and accordingly they prepare suitable points and blades for\nthem beforehand.  Yet as all things, except God, are sometimes subject to\nerror, nature itself not free from it when it produceth monstrous things,\nlikewise I observed something amiss in these trees.  For a half-pike that\ngrew up high enough to reach the branches of one of these instrumentiferous\ntrees, happened no sooner to touch them but, instead of being joined to an\niron head, it impaled a stubbed broom at the fundament.  Well, no matter,\n'twill serve to sweep the chimney.  Thus a partizan met with a pair of\ngarden shears.  Come, all's good for something; 'twill serve to nip off\nlittle twigs and destroy caterpillars.  The staff of a halberd got the\nblade of a scythe, which made it look like a hermaphrodite.\nHappy-be-lucky, 'tis all a case; 'twill serve for some mower.  Oh, 'tis a\ngreat blessing to put our trust in the Lord!  As we went back to our ships I\nspied behind I don't know what bush, I don't know what folks, doing I don't\nknow what business, in I don't know what posture, scouring I don't know what\ntools, in I don't know what manner, and I don't know what place.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.X.\n\nHow Pantagruel arrived at the island of Sharping.\n\nWe left the island of Tools to pursue our voyage, and the next day stood in\nfor the island of Sharping, the true image of Fontainebleau, for the land\nis so very lean that the bones, that is, the rocks, shoot through its skin.\nBesides, 'tis sandy, barren, unhealthy, and unpleasant.  Our pilot showed\nus there two little square rocks which had eight equal points in the shape\nof a cube.  They were so white that I might have mistaken them for\nalabaster or snow, had he not assured us they were made of bone.\n\nHe told us that twenty chance devils very much feared in our country dwelt\nthere in six different storeys, and that the biggest twins or braces of\nthem were called sixes, and the smallest ambs-ace; the rest cinques,\nquatres, treys, and deuces.  When they were conjured up, otherwise coupled,\nthey were called either sice cinque, sice quatre, sice trey, sice deuce,\nand sice ace; or cinque quatre, cinque trey, and so forth.  I made there a\nshrewd observation.  Would you know what 'tis, gamesters?  'Tis that there\nare very few of you in the world but what call upon and invoke the devils.\nFor the dice are no sooner thrown on the board, and the greedy gazing\nsparks have hardly said, Two sixes, Frank; but Six devils damn it! cry as\nmany of them.  If ambs-ace; then, A brace of devils broil me! will they\nsay.  Quatre-deuce, Tom; The deuce take it! cries another.  And so on to\nthe end of the chapter.  Nay, they don't forget sometimes to call the black\ncloven-footed gentlemen by their Christian names and surnames; and what is\nstranger yet, they use them as their greatest cronies, and make them so\noften the executors of their wills, not only giving themselves, but\neverybody and everything, to the devil, that there's no doubt but he takes\ncare to seize, soon or late, what's so zealously bequeathed him.  Indeed,\n'tis true Lucifer does not always immediately appear by his lawful\nattorneys; but, alas! 'tis not for want of goodwill; he is really to be\nexcused for his delay; for what the devil would you have a devil do?  He\nand his black guards are then at some other places, according to the\npriority of the persons that call on them; therefore, pray let none be so\nventuresome as to think that the devils are deaf and blind.\n\nHe then told us that more wrecks had happened about those square rocks, and\na greater loss of body and goods, than about all the Syrtes, Scyllas and\nCharybdes, Sirens, Strophades, and gulfs in the universe.  I had not much\nado to believe it, remembering that formerly, among the wise Egyptians,\nNeptune was described in hieroglyphics for the first cube, Apollo by an\nace, Diana by a deuce, Minerva by seven, and so forth.\n\nHe also told us that there was a phial of sanc-greal, a most divine thing,\nand known to a few.  Panurge did so sweeten up the syndics of the place\nthat they blessed us with the sight of 't; but it was with three times more\npother and ado, with more formalities and antic tricks, than they show the\npandects of Justinian at Florence, or the holy Veronica at Rome.  I never\nsaw such a sight of flambeaux, torches, and hagios, sanctified tapers,\nrush-lights, and farthing candles in my whole life.  After all, that which\nwas shown us was only the ill-faced countenance of a roasted coney.\n\nAll that we saw there worth speaking of was a good face set upon an ill\ngame, and the shells of the two eggs formerly laid up and hatched by Leda,\nout of which came Castor and Pollux, fair Helen's brothers.  These same\nsyndics sold us a piece of 'em for a song, I mean, for a morsel of bread.\nBefore we went we bought a parcel of hats and caps of the manufacture of\nthe place, which, I fear, will turn to no very good account; nor are those\nwho shall take 'em off our hands more likely to commend their wearing.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XI.\n\nHow we passed through the wicket inhabited by Gripe-men-all, Archduke of\nthe Furred Law-cats.\n\nFrom thence Condemnation was passed by us.  'Tis another damned barren\nisland, whereat none for the world cared to touch.  Then we went through\nthe wicket; but Pantagruel had no mind to bear us company, and 'twas well\nhe did not, for we were nabbed there, and clapped into lob's-pound by order\nof Gripe-men-all, Archduke of the Furred Law-cats, because one of our\ncompany would ha' put upon a sergeant some hats of the Sharping Island.\n\nThe Furred Law-cats are most terrible and dreadful monsters, they devour\nlittle children, and trample over marble stones.  Pray tell me, noble\ntopers, do they not deserve to have their snouts slit?  The hair of their\nhides doesn't lie outward, but inwards, and every mother's son of 'em for\nhis device wears a gaping pouch, but not all in the same manner; for some\nwear it tied to their neck scarfwise, others upon the breech, some on the\npaunch, others on the side, and all for a cause, with reason and mystery.\nThey have claws so very strong, long, and sharp that nothing can get from\n'em that is once fast between their clutches.  Sometimes they cover their\nheads with mortar-like caps, at other times with mortified caparisons.\n\nAs we entered their den, said a common mumper, to whom we had given half a\nteston, Worshipful culprits, God send you a good deliverance!  Examine\nwell, said he, the countenance of these stout props and pillars of this\ncatch-coin law and iniquity; and pray observe, that if you still live but\nsix olympiads, and the age of two dogs more, you'll see these Furred\nLaw-cats lords of all Europe, and in peaceful possession of all the estates\nand dominions belonging to it; unless, by divine providence, what's got over\nthe devil's back is spent under his belly, or the goods which they unjustly\nget perish with their prodigal heirs.  Take this from an honest beggar.\n\nAmong 'em reigns the sixth essence; by the means of which they gripe all,\ndevour all, conskite all, burn all, draw all, hang all, quarter all, behead\nall, murder all, imprison all, waste all, and ruin all, without the least\nnotice of right or wrong; for among them vice is called virtue; wickedness,\npiety; treason, loyalty; robbery, justice.  Plunder is their motto, and\nwhen acted by them is approved by all men, except the heretics; and all\nthis they do because they dare; their authority is sovereign and\nirrefragable.  For a sign of the truth of what I tell you, you'll find that\nthere the mangers are above the racks.  Remember hereafter that a fool told\nyou this; and if ever plague, famine, war, fire, earthquakes, inundations,\nor other judgments befall the world, do not attribute 'em to the aspects\nand conjunctions of the malevolent planets; to the abuses of the court of\nRomania, or the tyranny of secular kings and princes; to the impostures of\nthe false zealots of the cowl, heretical bigots, false prophets, and\nbroachers of sects; to the villainy of griping usurers, clippers, and\ncoiners; or to the ignorance, impudence, and imprudence of physicians,\nsurgeons, and apothecaries; nor to the lewdness of adulteresses and\ndestroyers of by-blows; but charge them all, wholly and solely, to the\ninexpressible, incredible, and inestimable wickedness and ruin which is\ncontinually hatched, brewed, and practised in the den or shop of those\nFurred Law-cats.  Yet 'tis no more known in the world than the cabala of\nthe Jews, the more's the pity; and therefore 'tis not detested, chastised,\nand punished as 'tis fit it should be.  But should all their villainy be\nonce displayed in its true colours and exposed to the people, there never\nwas, is, nor will be any spokesman so sweet-mouthed, whose fine colloguing\ntongue could save 'em; nor any law so rigorous and draconic that could\npunish 'em as they deserve; nor yet any magistrate so powerful as to hinder\ntheir being burnt alive in their coneyburrows without mercy.  Even their\nown furred kittlings, friends, and relations would abominate 'em.\n\nFor this reason, as Hannibal was solemnly sworn by his father Amilcar to\npursue the Romans with the utmost hatred as long as ever he lived, so my\nlate father has enjoined me to remain here without, till God Almighty's\nthunder reduce them there within to ashes, like other presumptuous Titans,\nprofane wretches, and opposers of God; since mankind is so inured to their\noppressions that they either do not remember, foresee, or have a sense of\nthe woes and miseries which they have caused; or, if they have, either will\nnot, dare not, or cannot root 'em out.\n\nHow, said Panurge, say you so?  Catch me there and hang me!  Damme, let's\nmarch off!  This noble beggar has scared me worse than thunder in autumn\n(Motteux gives 'than the thunder would do them.').  Upon this we were\nfiling off; but, alas! we found ourselves trapped--the door was\ndouble-locked and barricadoed.  Some messengers of ill news told us it was\nfull as easy to get in there as into hell, and no less hard to get out.  Ay,\nthere indeed lay the difficulty, for there is no getting loose without a\npass and discharge in due course from the bench.  This for no other reason\nthan because folks go easier out of a church than out of a sponging-house,\nand because they could not have our company when they would.  The worst on't\nwas when we got through the wicket; for we were carried, to get out our pass\nor discharge, before a more dreadful monster than ever was read of in the\nlegends of knight-errantry.  They called him Gripe-men-all.  I can't tell\nwhat to compare it to better than to a Chimaera, a Sphinx, a Cerberus; or to\nthe image of Osiris, as the Egyptians represented him, with three heads, one\nof a roaring lion, t'other of a fawning cur, and the last of a howling,\nprowling wolf, twisted about with a dragon biting his tail, surrounded with\nfiery rays.  His hands were full of gore, his talons like those of the\nharpies, his snout like a hawk's bill, his fangs or tusks like those of an\novergrown brindled wild boar; his eyes were flaming like the jaws of hell,\nall covered with mortars interlaced with pestles, and nothing of his arms\nwas to be seen but his clutches.  His hutch, and that of the warren-cats his\ncollaterals, was a long, spick-and-span new rack, a-top of which (as the\nmumper told us) some large stately mangers were fixed in the reverse.  Over\nthe chief seat was the picture of an old woman holding the case or scabbard\nof a sickle in her right hand, a pair of scales in her left, with spectacles\non her nose; the cups or scales of the balance were a pair of velvet\npouches, the one full of bullion, which overpoised t'other, empty and long,\nhoisted higher than the middle of the beam.  I'm of opinion it was the true\neffigies of Justice Gripe-men-all; far different from the institution of the\nancient Thebans, who set up the statues of their dicasts without hands, in\nmarble, silver, or gold, according to their merit, even after their death.\n\nWhen we made our personal appearance before him, a sort of I don't know\nwhat men, all clothed with I don't know what bags and pouches, with long\nscrolls in their clutches, made us sit down upon a cricket (such as\ncriminals sit on when tried in France).  Quoth Panurge to 'em, Good my\nlords, I'm very well as I am; I'd as lief stand, an't please you.  Besides,\nthis same stool is somewhat of the lowest for a man that has new breeches\nand a short doublet.  Sit you down, said Gripe-men-all again, and look that\nyou don't make the court bid you twice.  Now, continued he, the earth shall\nimmediately open its jaws and swallow you up to quick damnation if you\ndon't answer as you should.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XII.\n\nHow Gripe-men-all propounded a riddle to us.\n\nWhen we were sat, Gripe-men-all, in the middle of his furred cats, called\nto us in a hoarse dreadful voice, Well, come on, give me presently--an\nanswer.  Well, come on, muttered Panurge between his teeth, give, give me\npresently--a comforting dram.  Hearken to the court, continued\nGripe-men-all.\n\n                An Enigma.\n\n  A young tight thing, as fair as may be,\n  Without a dad conceived a baby,\n  And brought him forth without the pother\n  In labour made by teeming mother.\n  Yet the cursed brat feared not to gripe her,\n  But gnawed, for haste, her sides like viper.\n  Then the black upstart boldly sallies,\n  And walks and flies o'er hills and valleys.\n  Many fantastic sons of wisdom,\n  Amazed, foresaw their own in his doom;\n  And thought like an old Grecian noddy,\n  A human spirit moved his body.\n\nGive, give me out of hand--an answer to this riddle, quoth Gripe-men-all.\nGive, give me--leave to tell you, good, good my lord, answered Panurge,\nthat if I had but a sphinx at home, as Verres one of your precursors had, I\nmight then solve your enigma presently.  But verily, good my lord, I was\nnot there; and, as I hope to be saved, am as innocent in the matter as the\nchild unborn.  Foh, give me--a better answer, cried Gripe-men-all; or, by\ngold, this shall not serve your turn.  I'll not be paid in such coin; if\nyou have nothing better to offer, I'll let your rascalship know that it had\nbeen better for you to have fallen into Lucifer's own clutches than into\nours.  Dost thou see 'em here, sirrah? hah? and dost thou prate here of thy\nbeing innocent, as if thou couldst be delivered from our racks and tortures\nfor being so?  Give me--Patience! thou widgeon.  Our laws are like cobwebs;\nyour silly little flies are stopped, caught, and destroyed therein, but\nyour stronger ones break them, and force and carry them which way they\nplease.  Likewise, don't think we are so mad as to set up our nets to snap\nup your great robbers and tyrants.  No, they are somewhat too hard for us,\nthere's no meddling with them; for they would make no more of us than we\nmake of the little ones.  But you paltry, silly, innocent wretches must\nmake us amends; and, by gold, we will innocentize your fopship with a\nwannion, you never were so innocentized in your days; the devil shall sing\nmass among ye.\n\nFriar John, hearing him run on at that mad rate, had no longer the power to\nremain silent, but cried to him, Heigh-day!  Prithee, Mr. Devil in a coif,\nwouldst thou have a man tell thee more than he knows?  Hasn't the fellow\ntold you he does not know a word of the business?  His name is Twyford.\nA plague rot you! won't truth serve your turns?  Why, how now,\nMr. Prate-apace, cried Gripe-men-all, taking him short, marry come up, who\nmade you so saucy as to open your lips before you were spoken to?  Give me\n--Patience!  By gold! this is the first time since I have reigned that\nanyone has had the impudence to speak before he was bidden.  How came this\nmad fellow to break loose?  (Villain, thou liest, said Friar John, without\nstirring his lips.)  Sirrah, sirrah, continued Gripe-men-all, I doubt thou\nwilt have business enough on thy hands when it comes to thy turn to answer.\n(Damme, thou liest, said Friar John, silently.)  Dost thou think, continued\nmy lord, thou art in the wilderness of your foolish university, wrangling\nand bawling among the idle, wandering searchers and hunters after truth? By\ngold, we have here other fish to fry; we go another gate's-way to work, that\nwe do.  By gold, people here must give categorical answers to what they\ndon't know.  By gold, they must confess they have done those things which\nthey have not nor ought to have done.  By gold, they must protest that they\nknow what they never knew in their lives; and, after all, patience perforce\nmust be their only remedy, as well as a mad dog's.  Here silly geese are\nplucked, yet cackle not.  Sirrah, give me--an account whether you had a\nletter of attorney, or whether you were feed or no, that you offered to bawl\nin another man's cause?  I see you had no authority to speak, and I may\nchance to have you wed to something you won't like.  Oh, you devils, cried\nFriar John, proto-devils, panto-devils, you would wed a monk, would you?  Ho\nhu! ho hu!  A heretic! a heretic!  I'll give thee out for a rank heretic.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XIII.\n\nHow Panurge solved Gripe-men-all's riddle.\n\nGripe-men-all, as if he had not heard what Friar John said, directed his\ndiscourse to Panurge, saying to him, Well, what have you to say for\nyourself, Mr. Rogue-enough, hah?  Give, give me out of hand--an answer.\nSay? quoth Panurge; why, what would you have me say?  I say that we are\ndamnably beshit, since you give no heed at all to the equity of the plea,\nand the devil sings among you.  Let this answer serve for all, I beseech\nyou, and let us go out about our business; I am no longer able to hold out,\nas gad shall judge me.\n\nGo to, go to, cried Gripe-men-all; when did you ever hear that for these\nthree hundred years last past anybody ever got out of this weel without\nleaving something of his behind him?  No, no, get out of the trap if you\ncan without losing leather, life, or at least some hair, and you will have\ndone more than ever was done yet.  For why, this would bring the wisdom of\nthe court into question, as if we had took you up for nothing, and dealt\nwrongfully by you.  Well, by hook or by crook, we must have something out\nof you.  Look ye, it is a folly to make a rout for a fart and ado; one word\nis as good as twenty.  I have no more to say to thee, but that, as thou\nlikest thy former entertainment, thou wilt tell me more of the next; for it\nwill go ten times worse with thee unless, by gold, you give me--a solution\nto the riddle I propounded.  Give, give--it, without any more ado.\n\nBy gold, quoth Panurge, 'tis a black mite or weevil which is born of a\nwhite bean, and sallies out at the hole which he makes gnawing it; the mite\nbeing turned into a kind of fly, sometimes walks and sometimes flies over\nhills and dales.  Now Pythagoras, the philosopher, and his sect, besides\nmany others, wondering at its birth in such a place (which makes some argue\nfor equivocal generation), thought that by a metempsychosis the body of\nthat insect was the lodging of a human soul.  Now, were you men here, after\nyour welcomed death, according to his opinion, your souls would most\ncertainly enter into the body of mites or weevils; for in your present\nstate of life you are good for nothing in the world but to gnaw, bite, eat,\nand devour all things, so in the next you'll e'en gnaw and devour your\nmother's very sides, as the vipers do.  Now, by gold, I think I have fairly\nsolved and resolved your riddle.\n\nMay my bauble be turned into a nutcracker, quoth Friar John, if I could not\nalmost find in my heart to wish that what comes out at my bunghole were\nbeans, that these evil weevils might feed as they deserve.\n\nPanurge then, without any more ado, threw a large leathern purse stuffed\nwith gold crowns (ecus au soleil) among them.\n\nThe Furred Law-cats no sooner heard the jingling of the chink but they all\nbegan to bestir their claws, like a parcel of fiddlers running a division;\nand then fell to't, squimble, squamble, catch that catch can.  They all\nsaid aloud, These are the fees, these are the gloves; now, this is somewhat\nlike a tansy.  Oh! 'twas a pretty trial, a sweet trial, a dainty trial.  O'\nmy word, they did not starve the cause.  These are none of your snivelling\nforma pauperis's; no, they are noble clients, gentlemen every inch of them.\nBy gold, it is gold, quoth Panurge, good old gold, I'll assure you.\n\nSaith Gripe-men-all, The court, upon a full hearing (of the gold, quoth\nPanurge), and weighty reasons given, finds the prisoners not guilty, and\naccordingly orders them to be discharged out of custody, paying their fees.\nNow, gentlemen, proceed, go forwards, said he to us; we have not so much of\nthe devil in us as we have of his hue; though we are stout, we are\nmerciful.\n\nAs we came out at the wicket, we were conducted to the port by a detachment\nof certain highland griffins, scribere cum dashoes, who advised us before\nwe came to our ships not to offer to leave the place until we had made the\nusual presents, first to the Lady Gripe-men-all, then to all the Furred\nLaw-pusses; otherwise we must return to the place from whence we came.\nWell, well, said Friar John, we'll fumble in our fobs, examine every one of\nus his concern, and e'en give the women their due; we'll ne'er boggle or\nstick out on that account; as we tickled the men in the palm, we'll tickle\nthe women in the right place.  Pray, gentlemen, added they, don't forget to\nleave somewhat behind you for us poor devils to drink your healths.  O\nlawd! never fear, answered Friar John, I don't remember that I ever went\nanywhere yet where the poor devils are not remembered and encouraged.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XIV.\n\nHow the Furred Law-cats live on corruption.\n\nFriar John had hardly said those words ere he perceived seventy-eight\ngalleys and frigates just arriving at the port.  So he hied him thither to\nlearn some news; and as he asked what goods they had o' board, he soon\nfound that their whole cargo was venison, hares, capons, turkeys, pigs,\nswine, bacon, kids, calves, hens, ducks, teals, geese, and other poultry\nand wildfowl.\n\nHe also spied among these some pieces of velvet, satin, and damask.  This\nmade him ask the new-comers whither and to whom they were going to carry\nthose dainty goods.  They answered that they were for Gripe-men-all and the\nFurred Law-cats.\n\nPray, asked he, what is the true name of all these things in your country\nlanguage?  Corruption, they replied.  If they live on corruption, said the\nfriar, they will perish with their generation.  May the devil be damned, I\nhave it now:  their fathers devoured the good gentlemen who, according to\ntheir state of life, used to go much a-hunting and hawking, to be the\nbetter inured to toil in time of war; for hunting is an image of a martial\nlife, and Xenophon was much in the right of it when he affirmed that\nhunting had yielded a great number of excellent warriors, as well as the\nTrojan horse.  For my part, I am no scholar; I have it but by hearsay, yet\nI believe it.  Now the souls of those brave fellows, according to\nGripe-men-all's riddle, after their decease enter into wild boars, stags,\nroebucks, herns, and such other creatures which they loved, and in quest of\nwhich they went while they were men; and these Furred Law-cats, having\nfirst destroyed and devoured their castles, lands, demesnes, possessions,\nrents, and revenues, are still seeking to have their blood and soul in\nanother life.  What an honest fellow was that same mumper who had\nforewarned us of all these things, and bid us take notice of the mangers\nabove the racks!\n\nBut, said Panurge to the new-comers, how do you come by all this venison?\nMethinks the great king has issued out a proclamation strictly inhibiting\nthe destroying of stags, does, wild boars, roebucks, or other royal game,\non pain of death.  All this is true enough, answered one for the rest, but\nthe great king is so good and gracious, you must know, and these Furred\nLaw-cats so curst and cruel, so mad, and thirsting after Christian blood,\nthat we have less cause to fear in trespassing against that mighty\nsovereign's commands than reason to hope to live if we do not continually\nstop the mouths of these Furred Law-cats with such bribes and corruption.\nBesides, added he, to-morrow Gripe-men-all marries a furred law-puss of his\nto a high and mighty double-furred law-tybert.  Formerly we used to call\nthem chop-hay; but alas! they are not such neat creatures now as to eat\nany, or chew the cud.  We call them chop-hares, chop-partridges,\nchop-woodcocks, chop-pheasants, chop-pullets, chop-venison, chop-coneys,\nchop-pigs, for they scorn to feed on coarser meat.  A t--d for their chops,\ncried Friar John, next year we'll have 'em called chop-dung, chop-stront,\nchop-filth.\n\nWould you take my advice? added he to the company.  What is it? answered\nwe.  Let's do two things, returned he.  First, let us secure all this\nvenison and wild fowl--I mean, paying well for them; for my part, I am but\ntoo much tired already with our salt meat, it heats my flanks so horribly.\nIn the next place, let's go back to the wicket, and destroy all these\ndevilish Furred Law-cats.  For my part, quoth Panurge, I know better\nthings; catch me there, and hang me.  No, I am somewhat more inclined to be\nfearful than bold; I love to sleep in a whole skin.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XV.\n\nHow Friar John talks of rooting out the Furred Law-cats.\n\nVirtue of the frock, quoth Friar John, what kind of voyage are we making?\nA shitten one, o' my word; the devil of anything we do but fizzling,\nfarting, funking, squattering, dozing, raving, and doing nothing.\nOds-belly, 'tisn't in my nature to lie idle; I mortally hate it.  Unless I\nam doing some heroic feat every foot, I can't sleep one wink o' nights.\nDamn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass\nand shrive you?  By Maundy Thursday, the first of ye all that comes to me on\nsuch an account shall be fitted; for the only penance I'll enjoin shall be,\nthat he immediately throw himself headlong overboard into the sea like a\nbase cowhearted son of ten fathers.  This in deduction of the pains of\npurgatory.\n\nWhat made Hercules such a famous fellow, d'ye think?  Nothing but that\nwhile he travelled he still made it his business to rid the world of\ntyrannies, errors, dangers, and drudgeries; he still put to death all\nrobbers, all monsters, all venomous serpents and hurtful creatures.  Why\nthen do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through\nwhich we pass?  He destroyed the Stymphalides, the Lernaean hydra, Cacus,\nAntheus, the Centaurs, and what not; I am no clericus, those that are such\ntell me so.\n\nIn imitation of that noble by-blow, let's destroy and root out these wicked\nFurred Law-cats, that are a kind of ravenous devils; thus we shall remove\nall manner of tyranny out of the land.  Mawmet's tutor swallow me body and\nsoul, tripes and guts, if I would stay to ask your help or advice in the\nmatter were I but as strong as he was.  Come, he that would be thought a\ngentleman, let him storm a town; well, then, shall we go?  I dare swear\nwe'll do their business for them with a wet finger; they'll bear it, never\nfear; since they could swallow down more foul language that came from us\nthan ten sows and their babies could swill hogwash.  Damn 'em, they don't\nvalue all the ill words or dishonour in the world at a rush, so they but\nget the coin into their purses, though they were to have it in a shitten\nclout.  Come, we may chance to kill 'em all, as Hercules would have done\nhad they lived in his time.  We only want to be set to work by another\nEurystheus, and nothing else for the present, unless it be what I heartily\nwish them, that Jupiter may give 'em a short visit, only some two or three\nhours long, and walk among their lordships in the same equipage that\nattended him when he came last to his Miss Semele, jolly Bacchus's mother.\n\n'Tis a very great mercy, quoth Panurge, that you have got out of their\nclutches.  For my part, I have no stomach to go there again; I'm hardly\ncome to myself yet, so scared and appalled I was.  My hair still stands up\nan end when I think on't; and most damnably troubled I was there, for three\nvery weighty reasons.  First, because I was troubled.  Secondly, because I\nwas troubled.  Thirdly and lastly, because I was troubled.  Hearken to me a\nlittle on thy right side, Friar John, my left cod, since thou'lt not hear\nat the other.  Whenever the maggot bites thee to take a trip down to hell\nand visit the tribunal of Minos, Aeacus, Rhadamanthus, (and Dis,) do but\ntell me, and I'll be sure to bear thee company, and never leave thee as\nlong as my name's Panurge, but will wade over Acheron, Styx, and Cocytus,\ndrink whole bumpers of Lethe's water--though I mortally hate that element\n--and even pay thy passage to that bawling, cross-grained ferryman, Charon.\nBut as for the damned wicket, if thou art so weary of thy life as to go\nthither again, thou mayst e'en look for somebody else to bear thee company,\nfor I'll not move one step that way; e'en rest satisfied with this positive\nanswer.  By my good will I'll not stir a foot to go thither as long as I\nlive, any more than Calpe will come over to Abyla (Here Motteux adds the\nfollowing note:  'Calpe is a mountain in Spain that faces another, called\nAbyla, in Mauritania, both said to have been severed by Hercules.').  Was\nUlysses so mad as to go back into the Cyclop's cave to fetch his sword?\nNo, marry was he not.  Now I have left nothing behind me at the wicket\nthrough forgetfulness; why then should I think of going thither?\n\nWell, quoth Friar John, as good sit still as rise up and fall; what cannot\nbe cured must be endured.  But, prithee, let's hear one another speak.\nCome, wert thou not a wise doctor to fling away a whole purse of gold on\nthose mangy scoundrels?  Ha!  A squinsy choke thee! we were too rich, were\nwe?  Had it not been enough to have thrown the hell-hounds a few cropped\npieces of white cash?\n\nHow could I help it? returned Panurge.  Did you not see how Gripe-men-all\nheld his gaping velvet pouch, and every moment roared and bellowed, By\ngold, give me out of hand; by gold, give, give, give me presently?  Now,\nthought I to myself, we shall never come off scot-free.  I'll e'en stop\ntheir mouths with gold, that the wicket may be opened, and we may get out;\nthe sooner the better.  And I judged that lousy silver would not do the\nbusiness; for, d'ye see, velvet pouches do not use to gape for little\npaltry clipt silver and small cash; no, they are made for gold, my friend\nJohn; that they are, my dainty cod.  Ah! when thou hast been larded,\nbasted, and roasted, as I was, thou wilt hardly talk at this rate, I doubt.\nBut now what is to be done?  We are enjoined by them to go forwards.\n\nThe scabby slabberdegullions still waited for us at the port, expecting to\nbe greased in the fist as well as their masters.  Now when they perceived\nthat we were ready to put to sea, they came to Friar John and begged that\nwe would not forget to gratify the apparitors before we went off, according\nto the assessment for the fees at our discharge.  Hell and damnation! cried\nFriar John; are ye here still, ye bloodhounds, ye citing, scribbling imps\nof Satan?  Rot you, am I not vexed enough already, but you must have the\nimpudence to come and plague me, ye scurvy fly-catchers you?  By\ncob's-body, I'll gratify your ruffianships as you deserve; I'll apparitorize\nyou presently with a wannion, that I will.  With this, he lugged out his\nslashing cutlass, and in a mighty heat came out of the ship to cut the\ncozening varlets into steaks, but they scampered away and got out of sight\nin a trice.\n\nHowever, there was somewhat more to do, for some of our sailors, having got\nleave of Pantagruel to go ashore while we were had before Gripe-men-all,\nhad been at a tavern near the haven to make much of themselves, and roar\nit, as seamen will do when they come into some port.  Now I don't know\nwhether they had paid their reckoning to the full or no, but, however it\nwas, an old fat hostess, meeting Friar John on the quay, was making a\nwoeful complaint before a sergeant, son-in-law to one of the furred\nlaw-cats, and a brace of bums, his assistants.\n\nThe friar, who did not much care to be tired with their impertinent\nprating, said to them, Harkee me, ye lubberly gnat-snappers! do ye presume\nto say that our seamen are not honest men?  I'll maintain they are, ye\ndotterels, and will prove it to your brazen faces, by justice--I mean, this\ntrusty piece of cold iron by my side.  With this he lugged it out and\nflourished with it.  The forlorn lobcocks soon showed him their backs,\nbetaking themselves to their heels; but the old fusty landlady kept her\nground, swearing like any butter-whore that the tarpaulins were very honest\ncods, but that they only forgot to pay for the bed on which they had lain\nafter dinner, and she asked fivepence, French money, for the said bed.  May\nI never sup, said the friar, if it be not dog-cheap; they are sorry guests\nand unkind customers, that they are; they do not know when they have a\npennyworth, and will not always meet with such bargains.  Come, I myself\nwill pay you the money, but I would willingly see it first.\n\nThe hostess immediately took him home with her, and showed him the bed, and\nhaving praised it for all its good qualifications, said that she thought as\ntimes went she was not out of the way in asking fivepence for it.  Friar\nJohn then gave her the fivepence; and she no sooner turned her back but he\npresently began to rip up the ticking of the feather-bed and bolster, and\nthrew all the feathers out at the window.  In the meantime the old hag came\ndown and roared out for help, crying out murder to set all the\nneighbourhood in an uproar.  Yet she also fell to gathering the feathers\nthat flew up and down in the air, being scattered by the wind.  Friar John\nlet her bawl on, and, without any further ado, marched off with the\nblanket, quilt, and both the sheets, which he brought aboard undiscovered,\nfor the air was darkened with the feathers, as it uses sometimes to be with\nsnow.  He gave them away to the sailors; then said to Pantagruel that beds\nwere much cheaper at that place than in Chinnonois, though we have there\nthe famous geese of Pautile; for the old beldam had asked him but fivepence\nfor a bed which in Chinnonois had been worth about twelve francs.  (As soon\nas Friar John and the rest of the company were embarked, Pantagruel set\nsail.  But there arose a south-east wind, which blew so vehemently they\nlost their way, and in a manner going back to the country of the Furred\nLaw-cats, they entered into a huge gulf, where the sea ran so high and\nterrible that the shipboy on the top of the mast cried out he again saw the\nhabitation of Gripe-men-all; upon which Panurge, frightened almost out of\nhis wits, roared out, Dear master, in spite of the wind and waves, change\nyour course, and turn the ship's head about.  O my friend, let us come no\nmore into that cursed country where I left my purse.  So the wind carried\nthem near an island, where however they did not dare at first to land, but\nentered about a mile off.  (Motteux omitted this passage altogether in the\nedition of 1694.  It was restored by Ozell in the edition of 1738.))\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XVI.\n\nHow Pantagruel came to the island of the Apedefers, or Ignoramuses, with\nlong claws and crooked paws, and of terrible adventures and monsters there.\n\nAs soon as we had cast anchor and had moored the ship, the pinnace was put\nover the ship's side and manned by the coxswain's crew.  When the good\nPantagruel had prayed publicly, and given thanks to the Lord that had\ndelivered him from so great a danger, he stepped into it with his whole\ncompany to go on shore, which was no ways difficult to do, for, as the sea\nwas calm and the winds laid, they soon got to the cliffs.  When they were\nset on shore, Epistemon, who was admiring the situation of the place and\nthe strange shape of the rocks, discovered some of the natives.  The first\nhe met had on a short purple gown, a doublet cut in panes, like a Spanish\nleather jerkin, half sleeves of satin, and the upper part of them leather,\na coif like a black pot tipped with tin.  He was a good likely sort of a\nbody, and his name, as we heard afterwards, was Double-fee.  Epistemon\nasked him how they called those strange craggy rocks and deep valleys.  He\ntold them it was a colony brought out of Attorneyland, and called Process,\nand that if we forded the river somewhat further beyond the rocks we should\ncome into the island of the Apedefers.  By the memory of the decretals,\nsaid Friar John, tell us, I pray you, what you honest men here live on?\nCould not a man take a chirping bottle with you to taste your wine?  I can\nsee nothing among you but parchment, ink-horns, and pens.  We live on\nnothing else, returned Double-fee; and all who live in this place must come\nthrough my hands.  How, quoth Panurge, are you a shaver, then?  Do you\nfleece 'em?  Ay, ay, their purse, answered Double-fee; nothing else.  By\nthe foot of Pharaoh, cried Panurge, the devil a sou will you get of me.\nHowever, sweet sir, be so kind as to show an honest man the way to those\nApedefers, or ignorant people, for I come from the land of the learned,\nwhere I did not learn over much.\n\nStill talking on, they got to the island of the Apedefers, for they were\nsoon got over the ford.  Pantagruel was not a little taken up with admiring\nthe structure and habitation of the people of the place.  For they live in\na swingeing wine-press, fifty steps up to it.  You must know there are some\nof all sorts, little, great, private, middle-sized, and so forth.  You go\nthrough a large peristyle, alias a long entry set about with pillars, in\nwhich you see, in a kind of landscape, the ruins of almost the whole world,\nbesides so many great robbers' gibbets, so many gallows and racks, that\n'tis enough to fright you out of your seven senses.  Double-fee perceiving\nthat Pantagruel was taken up with contemplating those things, Let us go\nfurther, sir, said he to him; all this is nothing yet.  Nothing, quotha,\ncried Friar John; by the soul of my overheated codpiece, friend Panurge and\nI here shake and quiver for mere hunger.  I had rather be drinking than\nstaring at these ruins.  Pray come along, sir, said Double-fee.  He then\nled us into a little wine-press that lay backwards in a blind corner, and\nwas called Pithies in the language of the country.  You need not ask\nwhether Master John and Panurge made much of their sweet selves there; it\nis enough that I tell you there was no want of Bolognia sausages, turkey\npoots, capons, bustards, malmsey, and all other sorts of good belly-timber,\nvery well dressed.\n\nA pimping son of ten fathers, who, for want of a better, did the office of\na butler, seeing that Friar John had cast a sheep's eye at a choice bottle\nthat stood near a cupboard by itself, at some distance from the rest of the\nbottellic magazine, like a jack-in-an-office said to Pantagruel, Sir, I\nperceive that one of your men here is making love to this bottle.  He ogles\nit, and would fain caress it; but I beg that none offer to meddle with it;\nfor it is reserved for their worships.  How, cried Panurge, there are some\ngrandees here then, I see.  It is vintage time with you, I perceive.\n\nThen Double-fee led us up to a private staircase, and showed us into a\nroom, whence, without being seen, out at a loophole we could see their\nworships in the great wine-press, where none could be admitted without\ntheir leave.  Their worships, as he called them, were about a score of\nfusty crack-ropes and gallow-clappers, or rather more, all posted before a\nbar, and staring at each other like so many dead pigs.  Their paws were as\nlong as a crane's foot, and their claws four-and-twenty inches long at\nleast; for you must know they are enjoined never to pare off the least chip\nof them, so that they grow as crooked as a Welsh hook or a hedging-bill.\n\nWe saw a swingeing bunch of grapes that are gathered and squeezed in that\ncountry, brought in by them.  As soon as it was laid down, they clapped it\ninto the press, and there was not a bit of it out of which each of them did\nnot squeeze some oil of gold; insomuch that the poor grape was tried with a\nwitness, and brought off so drained and picked, and so dry, that there was\nnot the least moisture, juice, or substance left in it; for they had\npressed out its very quintessence.\n\nDouble-fee told us they had not often such huge bunches; but, let the worst\ncome to the worst, they were sure never to be without others in their\npress.  But hark you me, master of mine, asked Panurge, have they not some\nof different growth?  Ay, marry have they, quoth Double-fee.  Do you see\nhere this little bunch, to which they are going to give t'other wrench?  It\nis of tithe-growth, you must know; they crushed, wrung, squeezed and\nstrained out the very heart's blood of it but the other day; but it did not\nbleed freely; the oil came hard, and smelt of the priest's chest; so that\nthey found there was not much good to be got out of it.  Why then, said\nPantagruel, do they put it again into the press?  Only, answered\nDouble-fee, for fear there should still lurk some juice among the husks and\nhullings in the mother of the grape.  The devil be damned! cried Friar\nJohn; do you call these same folks illiterate lobcocks and duncical\ndoddipolls?  May I be broiled like a red herring if I do not think they are\nwise enough to skin a flint and draw oil out of a brick wall.  So they are,\nsaid Double-fee; for they sometimes put castles, parks, and forests into\nthe press, and out of them all extract aurum potabile.  You mean portabile,\nI suppose, cried Epistemon, such as may be borne.  I mean as I said,\nreplied Double-fee, potabile, such as may be drunk; for it makes them drink\nmany a good bottle more than otherwise they should.\n\nBut I cannot better satisfy you as to the growth of the vine-tree sirup\nthat is here squeezed out of grapes, than in desiring you to look yonder in\nthat back-yard, where you will see above a thousand different growths that\nlie waiting to be squeezed every moment.  Here are some of the public and\nsome of the private growth; some of the builders' fortifications, loans,\ngifts, and gratuities, escheats, forfeitures, fines, and recoveries, penal\nstatutes, crown lands, and demesne, privy purse, post-offices, offerings,\nlordships of manors, and a world of other growths, for which we want names.\nPray, quoth Epistemon, tell me of what growth is that great one, with all\nthose little grapelings about it.  Oh, oh! returned Double-fee, that plump\none is of the treasury, the very best growth in the whole country.\nWhenever anyone of that growth is squeezed, there is not one of their\nworships but gets juice enough of it to soak his nose six months together.\nWhen their worships were up, Pantagruel desired Double-fee to take us into\nthat great wine-press, which he readily did.  As soon as we were in,\nEpistemon, who understood all sorts of tongues, began to show us many\ndevices on the press, which was large and fine, and made of the wood of the\ncross--at least Double-fee told us so.  On each part of it were names of\neverything in the language of the country.  The spindle of the press was\ncalled receipt; the trough, cost and damages; the hole for the vice-pin,\nstate; the side-boards, money paid into the office; the great beam, respite\nof homage; the branches, radietur; the side-beams, recuperetur; the fats,\nignoramus; the two-handled basket, the rolls; the treading-place,\nacquittance; the dossers, validation; the panniers, authentic decrees; the\npailes, potentials; the funnels, quietus est.\n\nBy the Queen of the Chitterlings, quoth Panurge, all the hieroglyphics of\nEgypt are mine a-- to this jargon.  Why! here are a parcel of words full as\nanalogous as chalk and cheese, or a cat and a cart-wheel!  But why,\nprithee, dear Double-fee, do they call these worshipful dons of yours\nignorant fellows?  Only, said Double-fee, because they neither are, nor\nought to be, clerks, and all must be ignorant as to what they transact\nhere; nor is there to be any other reason given, but, The court hath said\nit; The court will have it so; The court has decreed it.  Cop's body, quoth\nPantagruel, they might full as well have called 'em necessity; for\nnecessity has no law.\n\nFrom thence, as he was leading us to see a thousand little puny presses, we\nspied another paltry bar, about which sat four are five ignorant waspish\nchurls, of so testy, fuming a temper, (like an ass with squibs and crackers\ntied to its tail,) and so ready to take pepper in the nose for yea and nay,\nthat a dog would not have lived with 'em.  They were hard at it with the\nlees and dregs of the grapes, which they gripped over and over again, might\nand main, with their clenched fists.  They were called contractors in the\nlanguage of the country.  These are the ugliest, misshapen, grim-looking\nscrubs, said Friar John, that ever were beheld, with or without spectacles.\nThen we passed by an infinite number of little pimping wine-presses all\nfull of vintage-mongers, who were picking, examining, and raking the grapes\nwith some instruments called bills-of-charge.\n\nFinally we came into a hall downstairs, where we saw an overgrown cursed\nmangy cur with a pair of heads, a wolf's belly, and claws like the devil of\nhell.  The son of a bitch was fed with costs, for he lived on a\nmultiplicity of fine amonds and amerciaments by order of their worships, to\neach of whom the monster was worth more than the best farm in the land.  In\ntheir tongue of ignorance they called him Twofold.  His dam lay by him, and\nher hair and shape was like her whelp's, only she had four heads, two male\nand two female, and her name was Fourfold.  She was certainly the most\ncursed and dangerous creature of the place, except her grandam, which we\nsaw, and had been kept locked up in a dungeon time out of mind, and her\nname was Refusing-of-fees.\n\nFriar John, who had always twenty yards of gut ready empty to swallow a\ngallimaufry of lawyers, began to be somewhat out of humour, and desired\nPantagruel to remember he had not dined, and bring Double-fee along with\nhim.  So away we went, and as we marched out at the back-gate whom should\nwe meet but an old piece of mortality in chains.  He was half ignorant and\nhalf learned, like an hermaphrodite of Satan.  The fellow was all\ncaparisoned with spectacles as a tortoise is with shells, and lived on\nnothing but a sort of food which, in their gibberish, was called appeals.\nPantagruel asked Double-fee of what breed was that prothonotary, and what\nname they gave him.  Double-fee told us that time out of mind he had been\nkept there in chains, to the great grief of their worships, who starved\nhim, and his name was Review.  By the pope's sanctified two-pounders, cried\nFriar John, I do not much wonder at the meagre cheer which this old chuff\nfinds among their worships.  Do but look a little on the weather-beaten\nscratch-toby, friend Panurge; by the sacred tip of my cowl, I'll lay five\npounds to a hazel-nut the foul thief has the very looks of Gripe-me-now.\nThese same fellows here, ignorant as they be, are as sharp and knowing as\nother folk.  But were it my case, I would send him packing with a squib in\nhis breech like a rogue as he is.  By my oriental barnacles, quoth Panurge,\nhonest friar, thou art in the right; for if we but examine that treacherous\nReview's ill-favoured phiz, we find that the filthy snudge is yet more\nmischievous and ignorant than these ignorant wretches here, since they\n(honest dunces) grapple and glean with as little harm and pother as they\ncan, without any long fiddle-cum-farts or tantalizing in the case; nor do\nthey dally and demur in your suit, but in two or three words, whip-stitch,\nin a trice, they finish the vintage of the close, bating you all these\ndamned tedious interlocutories, examinations, and appointments which fret\nto the heart's blood your furred law-cats.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XVII.\n\nHow we went forwards, and how Panurge had like to have been killed.\n\nWe put to sea that very moment, steering our course forwards, and gave\nPantagruel a full account of our adventures, which so deeply struck him\nwith compassion that he wrote some elegies on that subject to divert\nhimself during the voyage.  When we were safe in the port we took some\nrefreshment, and took in fresh water and wood.  The people of the place,\nwho had the countenance of jolly fellows and boon companions, were all of\nthem forward folks, bloated and puffed up with fat.  And we saw some who\nslashed and pinked their skins to open a passage to the fat, that it might\nswell out at the slits and gashes which they made; neither more nor less\nthan the shit-breech fellows in our country bepink and cut open their\nbreeches that the taffety on the inside may stand out and be puffed up.\nThey said that what they did was not out of pride or ostentation, but\nbecause otherwise their skins would not hold them without much pain.\nHaving thus slashed their skin, they used to grow much bigger, like the\nyoung trees on whose barks the gardeners make incisions that they may grow\nthe better.\n\nNear the haven there was a tavern, which forwards seemed very fine and\nstately.  We repaired thither, and found it filled with people of the\nforward nation, of all ages, sexes, and conditions; so that we thought some\nnotable feast or other was getting ready, but we were told that all that\nthrong were invited to the bursting of mine host, which caused all his\nfriends and relations to hasten thither.\n\nWe did not understand that jargon, and therefore thought in that country by\nthat bursting they meant some merry meeting or other, as we do in ours by\nbetrothing, wedding, groaning, christening, churching (of women), shearing\n(of sheep), reaping (of corn, or harvest-home), and many other junketting\nbouts that end in -ing.  But we soon heard that there was no such matter in\nhand.\n\nThe master of the house, you must know, had been a good fellow in his time,\nloved heartily to wind up his bottom, to bang the pitcher, and lick his\ndish.  He used to be a very fair swallower of gravy soup, a notable\naccountant in matter of hours, and his whole life was one continual dinner,\nlike mine host at Rouillac (in Perigord).  But now, having farted out much\nfat for ten years together, according to the custom of the country, he was\ndrawing towards his bursting hour; for neither the inner thin kell\nwherewith the entrails are covered, nor his skin that had been jagged and\nmangled so many years, were able to hold and enclose his guts any longer,\nor hinder them from forcing their way out.  Pray, quoth Panurge, is there\nno remedy, no help for the poor man, good people?  Why don't you swaddle\nhim round with good tight girths, or secure his natural tub with a strong\nsorb-apple-tree hoop?  Nay, why don't you iron-bind him, if needs be?  This\nwould keep the man from flying out and bursting.  The word was not yet out\nof his mouth when we heard something give a loud report, as if a huge\nsturdy oak had been split in two.  Then some of the neighbours told us that\nthe bursting was over, and that the clap or crack which we heard was the\nlast fart, and so there was an end of mine host.\n\nThis made me call to mind a saying of the venerable abbot of Castilliers,\nthe very same who never cared to hump his chambermaids but when he was in\npontificalibus.  That pious person, being much dunned, teased, and\nimportuned by his relations to resign his abbey in his old age, said and\nprofessed that he would not strip till he was ready to go to bed, and that\nthe last fart which his reverend paternity was to utter should be the fart\nof an abbot.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XVIII.\n\nHow our ships were stranded, and we were relieved by some people that were\nsubject to Queen Whims (qui tenoient de la Quinte).\n\nWe weighed and set sail with a merry westerly gale.  When about seven\nleagues off (twenty-two miles) some gusts or scuds of wind suddenly arose,\nand the wind veering and shifting from point to point, was, as they say,\nlike an old woman's breech, at no certainty; so we first got our starboard\ntacks aboard, and hauled off our lee-sheets.  Then the gusts increased, and\nby fits blowed all at once from several quarters, yet we neither settled\nnor braided up close our sails, but only let fly the sheets, not to go\nagainst the master of the ship's direction; and thus having let go amain,\nlest we should spend our topsails, or the ship's quick-side should lie in\nthe water and she be overset, we lay by and run adrift; that is, in a\nlandloper's phrase, we temporized it.  For he assured us that, as these\ngusts and whirlwinds would not do us much good, so they could not do us\nmuch harm, considering their easiness and pleasant strife, as also the\nclearness of the sky and calmness of the current.  So that we were to\nobserve the philosopher's rule, bear and forbear; that is, trim, or go\naccording to the time.\n\nHowever, these whirlwinds and gusts lasted so long that we persuaded the\nmaster to let us go and lie at trie with our main course; that is, to haul\nthe tack aboard, the sheet close aft, the bowline set up, and the helm tied\nclose aboard; so, after a stormy gale of wind, we broke through the\nwhirlwind.  But it was like falling into Scylla to avoid Charybdis (out of\nthe frying-pan into the fire).  For we had not sailed a league ere our\nships were stranded upon some sands such as are the flats of St. Maixent.\n\nAll our company seemed mightily disturbed except Friar John, who was not a\njot daunted, and with sweet sugar-plum words comforted now one and then\nanother, giving them hopes of speedy assistance from above, and telling\nthem that he had seen Castor at the main-yardarm.  Oh! that I were but now\nashore, cried Panurge, that is all I wish for myself at present, and that\nyou who like the sea so well had each man of you two hundred thousand\ncrowns.  I would fairly let you set up shop on these sands, and would get a\nfat calf dressed and a hundred of faggots (i.e. bottles of wine) cooled for\nyou against you come ashore.  I freely consent never to mount a wife, so\nyou but set me ashore and mount me on a horse, that I may go home.  No\nmatter for a servant, I will be contented to serve myself; I am never\nbetter treated than when I am without a man.  Faith, old Plautus was in the\nright on't when he said the more servants the more crosses; for such they\nare, even supposing they could want what they all have but too much of, a\ntongue, that most busy, dangerous, and pernicious member of servants.\nAccordingly, 'twas for their sakes alone that the racks and tortures for\nconfession were invented, though some foreign civilians in our time have\ndrawn alogical and unreasonable consequences from it.\n\nThat very moment we spied a sail that made towards us.  When it was close\nby us, we soon knew what was the lading of the ship and who was aboard of\nher.  She was full freighted with drums.  I was acquainted with many of the\npassengers that came in her, who were most of 'em of good families; among\nthe rest Harry Cotiral, an old toast, who had got a swinging ass's\ntouch-tripe (penis) fastened to his waist, as the good women's beads are to their\ngirdle.  In his left hand he held an old overgrown greasy foul cap, such as\nyour scald-pated fellows wear, and in the right a huge cabbage-stump.\n\nAs soon as he saw me he was overjoyed, and bawled out to me, What cheer,\nho?  How dost like me now?  Behold the true Algamana (this he said showing\nme the ass's tickle-gizzard).  This doctor's cap is my true elixir; and\nthis (continued he, shaking the cabbage-stump in his fist) is lunaria\nmajor, you old noddy.  I have 'em, old boy, I have 'em; we'll make 'em when\nthou'rt come back.  But pray, father, said I, whence come you?  Whither are\nyou bound?  What's your lading?  Have you smelt the salt deep?  To these\nfour questions he answered, From Queen Whims; for Touraine; alchemy; to the\nvery bottom.\n\nWhom have you got o' board? said I.  Said he, Astrologers, fortune-tellers,\nalchemists, rhymers, poets, painters, projectors, mathematicians,\nwatchmakers, sing-songs, musicianers, and the devil and all of others that\nare subject to Queen Whims (Motteux gives the following footnote:--'La\nQuinte, This means a fantastic Humour, Maggots, or a foolish Giddiness of\nBrains; and also, a fifth, or the Proportion of Five in music, &c.').  They\nhave very fair legible patents to show for't, as anybody may see.  Panurge\nhad no sooner heard this but he was upon the high-rope, and began to rail\nat them like mad.  What o' devil d'ye mean, cried he, to sit idly here like\na pack of loitering sneaksbies, and see us stranded, while you may help us,\nand tow us off into the current?  A plague o' your whims! you can make all\nthings whatsoever, they say, so much as good weather and little children;\nyet won't make haste to fasten some hawsers and cables, and get us off.  I\nwas just coming to set you afloat, quoth Harry Cotiral; by Trismegistus,\nI'll clear you in a trice.  With this he caused 7,532,810 huge drums to be\nunheaded on one side, and set that open side so that it faced the end of\nthe streamers and pendants; and having fastened them to good tacklings and\nour ship's head to the stern of theirs, with cables fastened to the bits\nabaft the manger in the ship's loof, they towed us off ground at one pull\nso easily and pleasantly that you'd have wondered at it had you been there.\nFor the dub-a-dub rattling of the drums, with the soft noise of the gravel\nwhich murmuring disputed us our way, and the merry cheers and huzzas of the\nsailors, made an harmony almost as good as that of the heavenly bodies when\nthey roll and are whirled round their spheres, which rattling of the\ncelestial wheels Plato said he heard some nights in his sleep.\n\nWe scorned to be behindhand with 'em in civility, and gratefully gave 'em\nstore of our sausages and chitterlings, with which we filled their drums;\nand we were just a-hoisting two-and-sixty hogsheads of wine out of the\nhold, when two huge whirlpools with great fury made towards their ship,\nspouting more water than is in the river Vienne (Vigenne) from Chinon to\nSaumur; to make short, all their drums, all their sails, their concerns,\nand themselves were soused, and their very hose were watered by the collar.\n\nPanurge was so overjoyed, seeing this, and laughed so heartily, that he was\nforced to hold his sides, and it set him into a fit of the colic for two\nhours and more.  I had a mind, quoth he, to make the dogs drink, and those\nhonest whirlpools, egad, have saved me that labour and that cost.  There's\nsauce for them; ariston men udor.  Water is good, saith a poet; let 'em\nPindarize upon't.  They never cared for fresh water but to wash their hands\nor their glasses.  This good salt water will stand 'em in good stead for\nwant of sal ammoniac and nitre in Geber's kitchen.\n\nWe could not hold any further discourse with 'em; for the former whirlwind\nhindered our ship from feeling the helm.  The pilot advised us\nhenceforwards to let her run adrift and follow the stream, not busying\nourselves with anything, but making much of our carcasses.  For our only\nway to arrive safe at the queendom of Whims was to trust to the whirlwind\nand be led by the current.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XIX.\n\nHow we arrived at the queendom of Whims or Entelechy.\n\nWe did as he directed us for about twelve hours, and on the third day the\nsky seemed to us somewhat clearer, and we happily arrived at the port of\nMateotechny, not far distant from Queen Whims, alias the Quintessence.\n\nWe met full butt on the quay a great number of guards and other military\nmen that garrisoned the arsenal, and we were somewhat frighted at first\nbecause they made us all lay down our arms, and in a haughty manner asked\nus whence we came.\n\nCousin, quoth Panurge to him that asked the question, we are of Touraine,\nand come from France, being ambitious of paying our respects to the Lady\nQuintessence and visit this famous realm of Entelechy.\n\nWhat do you say? cried they; do you call it Entelechy or Endelechy?  Truly,\ntruly, sweet cousins, quoth Panurge, we are a silly sort of grout-headed\nlobcocks, an't please you; be so kind as to forgive us if we chance to\nknock words out of joint.  As for anything else, we are downright honest\nfellows and true hearts.\n\nWe have not asked you this question without a cause, said they; for a great\nnumber of others who have passed this way from your country of Touraine\nseemed as mere jolt-headed doddipolls as ever were scored o'er the coxcomb,\nyet spoke as correct as other folks.  But there has been here from other\ncountries a pack of I know not what overweening self-conceited prigs, as\nmoody as so many mules and as stout as any Scotch lairds, and nothing would\nserve these, forsooth, but they must wilfully wrangle and stand out against\nus at their coming; and much they got by it after all.  Troth, we e'en\nfitted them and clawed 'em off with a vengeance, for all they looked so big\nand so grum.\n\nPray tell me, does your time lie so heavy upon you in your world that you\ndo not know how to bestow it better than in thus impudently talking,\ndisputing, and writing of our sovereign lady?  There was much need that\nyour Tully, the consul, should go and leave the care of his commonwealth to\nbusy himself idly about her; and after him your Diogenes Laertius, the\nbiographer, and your Theodorus Gaza, the philosopher, and your Argiropilus,\nthe emperor, and your Bessario, the cardinal, and your Politian, the\npedant, and your Budaeus, the judge, and your Lascaris, the ambassador, and\nthe devil and all of those you call lovers of wisdom; whose number, it\nseems, was not thought great enough already, but lately your Scaliger,\nBigot, Chambrier, Francis Fleury, and I cannot tell how many such other\njunior sneaking fly-blows must take upon 'em to increase it.\n\nA squinsy gripe the cod's-headed changelings at the swallow and eke at the\ncover-weasel; we shall make 'em--But the deuce take 'em!  (They flatter the\ndevil here, and smoothify his name, quoth Panurge, between his teeth.)  You\ndon't come here, continued the captain, to uphold 'em in their folly; you\nhave no commission from 'em to this effect; well then, we will talk no more\non't.\n\nAristotle, that first of men and peerless pattern of all philosophy, was\nour sovereign lady's godfather, and wisely and properly gave her the name\nof Entelechy.  Her true name then is Entelechy, and may he be in tail\nbeshit, and entail a shit-a-bed faculty and nothing else on his family, who\ndares call her by any other name; for whoever he is, he does her wrong, and\nis a very impudent person.  You are heartily welcome, gentlemen.  With\nthis they colled and clipped us about the neck, which was no small comfort\nto us, I'll assure you.\n\nPanurge then whispered me, Fellow-traveller, quoth he, hast thou not been\nsomewhat afraid this bout?  A little, said I.  To tell you the truth of it,\nquoth he, never were the Ephraimites in a greater fear and quandary when\nthe Gileadites killed and drowned them for saying sibboleth instead of\nshibboleth; and among friends, let me tell you that perhaps there is not a\nman in the whole country of Beauce but might easily have stopped my\nbunghole with a cartload of hay.\n\nThe captain afterwards took us to the queen's palace, leading us silently\nwith great formality.  Pantagruel would have said something to him, but the\nother, not being able to come up to his height, wished for a ladder or a\nvery long pair of stilts; then said, Patience, if it were our sovereign\nlady's will, we would be as tall as you; well, we shall when she pleases.\n\nIn the first galleries we saw great numbers of sick persons, differently\nplaced according to their maladies.  The leprous were apart; those that\nwere poisoned on one side; those that had got the plague on another; those\nthat had the pox in the first rank, and the rest accordingly.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XX.\n\nHow the Quintessence cured the sick with a song.\n\nThe captain showed us the queen, attended with her ladies and gentlemen, in\nthe second gallery.  She looked young, though she was at least eighteen\nhundred years old, and was handsome, slender, and as fine as a queen, that\nis, as hands could make her.  He then said to us:  It is not yet a fit time\nto speak to the queen; be you but mindful of her doings in the meanwhile.\n\nYou have kings in your world that fantastically pretend to cure some\ncertain diseases, as, for example, scrofula or wens, swelled throats,\nnicknamed the king's evil, and quartan agues, only with a touch; now our\nqueen cures all manner of diseases without so much as touching the sick,\nbut barely with a song, according to the nature of the distemper.  He then\nshowed us a set of organs, and said that when it was touched by her those\nmiraculous cures were performed.  The organ was indeed the strangest that\never eyes beheld; for the pipes were of cassia fistula in the cod; the top\nand cornice of guiacum; the bellows of rhubarb; the pedas of turbith, and\nthe clavier or keys of scammony.\n\nWhile we were examining this wonderful new make of an organ, the leprous\nwere brought in by her abstractors, spodizators, masticators, pregustics,\ntabachins, chachanins, neemanins, rabrebans, nercins, rozuins, nebidins,\ntearins, segamions, perarons, chasinins, sarins, soteins, aboth, enilins,\narchasdarpenins, mebins, chabourins, and other officers, for whom I want\nnames; so she played 'em I don't know what sort of a tune or song, and they\nwere all immediately cured.\n\nThen those who were poisoned were had in, and she had no sooner given them\na song but they began to find a use for their legs, and up they got.  Then\ncame on the deaf, the blind, and the dumb, and they too were restored to\ntheir lost faculties and senses with the same remedy; which did so\nstrangely amaze us (and not without reason, I think) that down we fell on\nour faces, remaining prostrate, like men ravished in ecstasy, and were not\nable to utter one word through the excess of our admiration, till she came,\nand having touched Pantagruel with a fine fragrant nosegay of white roses\nwhich she held in her hand, thus made us recover our senses and get up.\nThen she made us the following speech in byssin words, such as Parisatis\ndesired should be spoken to her son Cyrus, or at least of crimson alamode:\n\nThe probity that scintillizes in the superfices of your persons informs my\nratiocinating faculty, in a most stupendous manner, of the radiant virtues\nlatent within the precious caskets and ventricles of your minds.  For,\ncontemplating the mellifluous suavity of your thrice discreet reverences,\nit is impossible not to be persuaded with facility that neither your\naffections nor your intellects are vitiated with any defect or privation of\nliberal and exalted sciences.  Far from it, all must judge that in you are\nlodged a cornucopia and encyclopaedia, an unmeasurable profundity of\nknowledge in the most peregrine and sublime disciplines, so frequently the\nadmiration, and so rarely the concomitants of the imperite vulgar.  This\ngently compels me, who in preceding times indefatigably kept my private\naffections absolutely subjugated, to condescend to make my application to\nyou in the trivial phrase of the plebeian world, and assure you that you\nare well, more than most heartily welcome.\n\nI have no hand at making of speeches, quoth Panurge to me privately;\nprithee, man, make answer to her for us, if thou canst.  This would not\nwork with me, however; neither did Pantagruel return a word.  So that Queen\nWhims, or Queen Quintessence (which you please), perceiving that we stood\nas mute as fishes, said:  Your taciturnity speaks you not only disciples of\nPythagoras, from whom the venerable antiquity of my progenitors in\nsuccessive propagation was emaned and derives its original, but also\ndiscovers, that through the revolution of many retrograde moons, you have\nin Egypt pressed the extremities of your fingers with the hard tenants of\nyour mouths, and scalptized your heads with frequent applications of your\nunguicules.  In the school of Pythagoras, taciturnity was the symbol of\nabstracted and superlative knowledge, and the silence of the Egyptians was\nagnited as an expressive manner of divine adoration; this caused the\npontiffs of Hierapolis to sacrifice to the great deity in silence,\nimpercussively, without any vociferous or obstreperous sound.  My design is\nnot to enter into a privation of gratitude towards you, but by a vivacious\nformality, though matter were to abstract itself from me, excentricate to\nyou my cogitations.\n\nHaving spoken this, she only said to her officers, Tabachins, a panacea;\nand straight they desired us not to take it amiss if the queen did not\ninvite us to dine with her; for she never ate anything at dinner but some\ncategories, jecabots, emnins, dimions, abstractions, harborins, chelemins,\nsecond intentions, carradoths, antitheses, metempsychoses, transcendent\nprolepsies, and such other light food.\n\nThen they took us into a little closet lined through with alarums, where we\nwere treated God knows how.  It is said that Jupiter writes whatever is\ntransacted in the world on the dipthera or skin of the Amalthaean goat that\nsuckled him in Crete, which pelt served him instead of a shield against the\nTitans, whence he was nicknamed Aegiochos.  Now, as I hate to drink water,\nbrother topers, I protest it would be impossible to make eighteen goatskins\nhold the description of all the good meat they brought before us, though it\nwere written in characters as small as those in which were penned Homer's\nIliads, which Tully tells us he saw enclosed in a nutshell.\n\nFor my part, had I one hundred mouths, as many tongues, a voice of iron, a\nheart of oak, and lungs of leather, together with the mellifluous abundance\nof Plato, yet I never could give you a full account of a third part of a\nsecond of the whole.\n\nPantagruel was telling me that he believed the queen had given the symbolic\nword used among her subjects to denote sovereign good cheer, when she said\nto her tabachins, A panacea; just as Lucullus used to say, In Apollo, when\nhe designed to give his friends a singular treat; though sometimes they\ntook him at unawares, as, among the rest, Cicero and Hortensius sometimes\nused to do.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXI.\n\nHow the Queen passed her time after dinner.\n\nWhen we had dined, a chachanin led us into the queen's hall, and there we\nsaw how, after dinner, with the ladies and the princes of her court, she\nused to sift, searce, bolt, range, and pass away time with a fine large\nwhite and blue silk sieve.  We also perceived how they revived ancient\nsports, diverting themselves together at--\n\n1.  Cordax.      6.  Phrygia.        11.  Monogas.\n2.  Emmelia.     7.  Thracia.        12.  Terminalia.\n3.  Sicinnia.    8.  Calabrisme.     13.  Floralia.\n4.  Jambics.     9.  Molossia.       14.  Pyrrhice.\n5.  Persica.    10.  Cernophorum.    15.  (Nicatism.)\n            And a thousand other dances.\n\n(Motteux has the following footnote:--'1. A sort of country-dance.  2. A\nstill tragic dance.  3. Dancing and singing used at funerals.  4. Cutting\nsarcasms and lampoons.  5. The Persian dance.  6. Tunes, whose measure\ninspired men with a kind of divine fury.  7. The Thracian movement.  8.\nSmutty verses.  9. A measure to which the Molossi of Epirus danced a\ncertain morrice.  10. A dance with bowls or pots in their hands.  11. A\nsong where one sings alone.  12.

The Trojan dance in\narmour.')\n\nAfterwards she gave orders that they should show us the apartments and\ncuriosities in her palace.  Accordingly we saw there such new, strange, and\nwonderful things, that I am still ravished in admiration every time I think\nof't.  However, nothing surprised us more than what was done by the\ngentlemen of her household, abstractors, parazons, nebidins, spodizators,\nand others, who freely and without the least dissembling told us that the\nqueen their mistress did all impossible things, and cured men of incurable\ndiseases; and they, her officers, used to do the rest.\n\nI saw there a young parazon cure many of the new consumption, I mean the\npox, though they were never so peppered.  Had it been the rankest Roan ague\n(Anglice, the Covent-garden gout), 'twas all one to him; touching only\ntheir dentiform vertebrae thrice with a piece of a wooden shoe, he made\nthem as wholesome as so many sucking-pigs.\n\nAnother did thoroughly cure folks of dropsies, tympanies, ascites, and\nhyposarcides, striking them on the belly nine times with a Tenedian\nhatchet, without any solution of the continuum.\n\nAnother cured all manner of fevers and agues on the spot, only with hanging\na fox-tail on the left side of the patient's girdle.\n\nOne removed the toothache only with washing thrice the root of the aching\ntooth with elder-vinegar, and letting it dry half-an-hour in the sun.\n\nAnother the gout, whether hot or cold, natural or accidental, by barely\nmaking the gouty person shut his mouth and open his eyes.\n\nI saw another ease nine gentlemen of St. Francis's distemper ('A\nconsumption in the pocket, or want of money; those of St. Francis's order\nmust carry none about 'em.'--Motteux.) in a very short space of time,\nhaving clapped a rope about their necks, at the end of which hung a box\nwith ten thousand gold crowns in't.\n\nOne with a wonderful engine threw the houses out at the windows, by which\nmeans they were purged of all pestilential air.\n\nAnother cured all the three kinds of hectics, the tabid, atrophes, and\nemaciated, without bathing, Tabian milk, dropax, alias depilatory, or other\nsuch medicaments, only turning the consumptive for three months into monks;\nand he assured me that if they did not grow fat and plump in a monastic way\nof living, they never would be fattened in this world, either by nature or\nby art.\n\nI saw another surrounded with a crowd of two sorts of women.  Some were\nyoung, quaint, clever, neat, pretty, juicy, tight, brisk, buxom, proper,\nkind-hearted, and as right as my leg, to any man's thinking.  The rest were\nold, weather-beaten, over-ridden, toothless, blear-eyed, tough, wrinkled,\nshrivelled, tawny, mouldy, phthisicky, decrepit hags, beldams, and walking\ncarcasses.  We were told that his office was to cast anew those she-pieces\nof antiquity, and make them such as the pretty creatures whom we saw, who\nhad been made young again that day, recovering at once the beauty, shape,\nsize, and disposition which they enjoyed at sixteen; except their heels,\nthat were now much shorter than in their former youth.\n\nThis made them yet more apt to fall backwards whenever any man happened to\ntouch 'em, than they had been before.  As for their counterparts, the old\nmother-scratch-tobies, they most devoutly waited for the blessed hour when\nthe batch that was in the oven was to be drawn, that they might have their\nturns, and in a mighty haste they were pulling and hauling the man like\nmad, telling him that 'tis the most grievous and intolerable thing in\nnature for the tail to be on fire and the head to scare away those who\nshould quench it.\n\nThe officer had his hands full, never wanting patients; neither did his\nplace bring him in little, you may swear.  Pantagruel asked him whether he\ncould also make old men young again.  He said he could not.  But the way to\nmake them new men was to get 'em to cohabit with a new-cast female; for\nthis they caught that fifth kind of crinckams, which some call pellade, in\nGreek, ophiasis, that makes them cast off their old hair and skin, just as\nthe serpents do, and thus their youth is renewed like the Arabian\nphoenix's.  This is the true fountain of youth, for there the old and\ndecrepit become young, active, and lusty.\n\nJust so, as Euripides tells us, Iolaus was transmogrified; and thus Phaon,\nfor whom kind-hearted Sappho run wild, grew young again, for Venus's use;\nso Tithon by Aurora's means; so Aeson by Medea, and Jason also, who, if\nyou'll believe Pherecides and Simonides, was new-vamped and dyed by that\nwitch; and so were the nurses of jolly Bacchus, and their husbands, as\nAeschylus relates.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXII.\n\nHow Queen Whims' officers were employed; and how the said lady retained us\namong her abstractors.\n\nI then saw a great number of the queen's officers, who made blackamoors\nwhite as fast as hops, just rubbing their bellies with the bottom of a\npannier.\n\nOthers, with three couples of foxes in one yoke, ploughed a sandy shore,\nand did not lose their seed.\n\nOthers washed burnt tiles, and made them lose their colour.\n\nOthers extracted water out of pumice-stones, braying them a good while in a\nmortar, and changed their substance.\n\nOthers sheared asses, and thus got long fleece wool.\n\nOthers gathered barberries and figs off of thistles.\n\nOthers stroked he-goats by the dugs, and saved their milk in a sieve; and\nmuch they got by it.\n\n(Others washed asses' heads without losing their soap.)\n\nOthers taught cows to dance, and did not lose their fiddling.\n\nOthers pitched nets to catch the wind, and took cock-lobsters in them.\n\nI saw a spodizator, who very artificially got farts out of a dead ass, and\nsold 'em for fivepence an ell.\n\nAnother did putrefy beetles.  O the dainty food!\n\nPoor Panurge fairly cast up his accounts, and gave up his halfpenny (i.e.\nvomited), seeing an archasdarpenin who laid a huge plenty of chamber lye to\nputrefy in horsedung, mishmashed with abundance of Christian sir-reverence.\nPugh, fie upon him, nasty dog!  However, he told us that with this sacred\ndistillation he watered kings and princes, and made their sweet lives a\nfathom or two the longer.\n\nOthers built churches to jump over the steeples.\n\nOthers set carts before the horses, and began to flay eels at the tail;\nneither did the eels cry before they were hurt, like those of Melun.\n\nOthers out of nothing made great things, and made great things return to\nnothing.\n\nOthers cut fire into steaks with a knife, and drew water with a fish-net.\n\nOthers made chalk of cheese, and honey of a dog's t--d.\n\nWe saw a knot of others, about a baker's dozen in number, tippling under an\narbour.  They toped out of jolly bottomless cups four sorts of cool,\nsparkling, pure, delicious, vine-tree sirup, which went down like mother's\nmilk; and healths and bumpers flew about like lightning.  We were told that\nthese true philosophers were fairly multiplying the stars by drinking till\nthe seven were fourteen, as brawny Hercules did with Atlas.\n\nOthers made a virtue of necessity, and the best of a bad market, which\nseemed to me a very good piece of work.\n\nOthers made alchemy (i.e. sir-reverence) with their teeth, and clapping\ntheir hind retort to the recipient, made scurvy faces, and then squeezed.\n\nOthers, in a large grass plot, exactly measured how far the fleas could go\nat a hop, a step, and jump; and told us that this was exceedingly useful\nfor the ruling of kingdoms, the conduct of armies, and the administration\nof commonwealths; and that Socrates, who first got philosophy out of\nheaven, and from idling and trifling made it profitable and of moment, used\nto spend half his philosophizing time in measuring the leaps of fleas, as\nAristophanes the quintessential affirms.\n\nI saw two gibroins by themselves keeping watch on the top of a tower, and\nwe were told they guarded the moon from the wolves.\n\nIn a blind corner I met four more very hot at it, and ready to go to\nloggerheads.  I asked what was the cause of the stir and ado, the mighty\ncoil and pother they made.  And I heard that for four livelong days those\noverwise roisters had been at it ding-dong, disputing on three high, more\nthan metaphysical propositions, promising themselves mountains of gold by\nsolving them.  The first was concerning a he-ass's shadow; the second, of\nthe smoke of a lantern; and the third of goat's hair, whether it were wool\nor no.  We heard that they did not think it a bit strange that two\ncontradictions in mode, form, figure, and time should be true; though I\nwill warrant the sophists of Paris had rather be unchristened than own so\nmuch.\n\nWhile we were admiring all those men's wonderful doings, the evening star\nalready twinkling, the queen (God bless her!) appeared, attended with her\ncourt, and again amazed and dazzled us.  She perceived it, and said to us:\n\nWhat occasions the aberrations of human cogitations through the perplexing\nlabyrinths and abysses of admiration, is not the source of the effects,\nwhich sagacious mortals visibly experience to be the consequential result\nof natural causes.  'Tis the novelty of the experiment which makes\nimpressions on their conceptive, cogitative faculties; that do not previse\nthe facility of the operation adequately, with a subact and sedate\nintellection, associated with diligent and congruous study.  Consequently\nlet all manner of perturbation abdicate the ventricles of your brains, if\nanyone has invaded them while they were contemplating what is transacted by\nmy domestic ministers.  Be spectators and auditors of every particular\nphenomenon and every individual proposition within the extent of my\nmansion; satiate yourselves with all that can fall here under the\nconsideration of your visual or auscultating powers, and thus emancipate\nyourselves from the servitude of crassous ignorance.  And that you may be\ninduced to apprehend how sincerely I desire this in consideration of the\nstudious cupidity that so demonstratively emicates at your external organs,\nfrom this present particle of time I retain you as my abstractors.  Geber,\nmy principal Tabachin, shall register and initiate you at your departing.\n\nWe humbly thanked her queenship without saying a word, accepting of the\nnoble office she conferred on us.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXIII.\n\nHow the Queen was served at dinner, and of her way of eating.\n\nQueen Whims after this said to her gentlemen:  The orifice of the\nventricle, that ordinary embassador for the alimentation of all members,\nwhether superior or inferior, importunes us to restore, by the apposition\nof idoneous sustenance, what was dissipated by the internal calidity's\naction on the radical humidity.  Therefore spodizators, gesinins, memains,\nand parazons, be not culpable of dilatory protractions in the apposition of\nevery re-roborating species, but rather let them pullulate and superabound\non the tables.  As for you, nobilissim praegustators, and my gentilissim\nmasticators, your frequently experimented industry, internected with\nperdiligent sedulity and sedulous perdiligence, continually adjuvates you\nto perficiate all things in so expeditious a manner that there is no\nnecessity of exciting in you a cupidity to consummate them.  Therefore I\ncan only suggest to you still to operate as you are assuefacted\nindefatigably to operate.\n\nHaving made this fine speech, she retired for a while with part of her\nwomen, and we were told that 'twas to bathe, as the ancients did more\ncommonly than we use nowadays to wash our hands before we eat.  The tables\nwere soon placed, the cloth spread, and then the queen sat down.  She ate\nnothing but celestial ambrosia, and drank nothing but divine nectar.  As\nfor the lords and ladies that were there, they, as well as we, fared on as\nrare, costly, and dainty dishes as ever Apicius wot or dreamed of in his\nlife.\n\nWhen we were as round as hoops, and as full as eggs, with stuffing the gut,\nan olla podrida ('Some call it an Olio.  Rabelais Pot-pourry.'--Motteux.)\nwas set before us to force hunger to come to terms with us, in case it had\nnot granted us a truce; and such a huge vast thing it was that the plate\nwhich Pythius Althius gave King Darius would hardly have covered it.  The\nolla consisted of several sorts of pottages, salads, fricassees,\nsaugrenees, cabirotadoes, roast and boiled meat, carbonadoes, swingeing\npieces of powdered beef, good old hams, dainty somates, cakes, tarts, a\nworld of curds after the Moorish way, fresh cheese, jellies, and fruit of\nall sorts.  All this seemed to me good and dainty; however, the sight of it\nmade me sigh; for alas! I could not taste a bit on't, so full I had filled\nmy puddings before, and a bellyful is a bellyful you know.  Yet I must tell\nyou what I saw that seemed to me odd enough o' conscience; 'twas some\npasties in paste; and what should those pasties in paste be, d'ye think,\nbut pasties in pots?  At the bottom I perceived store of dice, cards,\ntarots ('Great cards on which many different things are figured.'\n--Motteux.), luettes ('Pieces of ivory to play withal.'--Motteux.),\nchessmen, and chequers, besides full bowls of gold crowns, for those who had\na mind to have a game or two and try their chance.  Under this I saw a jolly\ncompany of mules in stately trappings, with velvet footcloths, and a troop\nof ambling nags, some for men and some for women; besides I don't know how\nmany litters all lined with velvet, and some coaches of Ferrara make; all\nthis for those who had a mind to take the air.\n\nThis did not seem strange to me; but if anything did 'twas certainly the\nqueen's way of eating, and truly 'twas very new, and very odd; for she\nchewed nothing, the good lady; not but that she had good sound teeth, and\nher meat required to be masticated, but such was her highness's custom.\nWhen her praegustators had tasted the meat, her masticators took it and\nchewed it most nobly; for their dainty chops and gullets were lined through\nwith crimson satin, with little welts and gold purls, and their teeth were\nof delicate white ivory.  Thus, when they had chewed the meat ready for her\nhighness's maw, they poured it down her throat through a funnel of fine\ngold, and so on to her craw.  For that reason they told us she never\nvisited a close-stool but by proxy.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXIV.\n\nHow there was a ball in the manner of a tournament, at which Queen Whims\nwas present.\n\nAfter supper there was a ball in the form of a tilt or a tournament, not\nonly worth seeing, but also never to be forgotten.  First, the floor of the\nhall was covered with a large piece of velveted white and yellow chequered\ntapestry, each chequer exactly square, and three full spans in breadth.\n\nThen thirty-two young persons came into the hall; sixteen of them arrayed\nin cloth of gold, and of these eight were young nymphs such as the ancients\ndescribed Diana's attendants; the other eight were a king, a queen, two\nwardens of the castle, two knights, and two archers.  Those of the other\nband were clad in cloth of silver.\n\nThey posted themselves on the tapestry in the following manner:  the kings\non the last line on the fourth square; so that the golden king was on a\nwhite square, and the silvered king on a yellow square, and each queen by\nher king; the golden queen on a yellow square, and the silvered queen on a\nwhite one:  and on each side stood the archers to guide their kings and\nqueens; by the archers the knights, and the wardens by them.  In the next\nrow before 'em stood the eight nymphs; and between the two bands of nymphs\nfour rows of squares stood empty.\n\nEach band had its musicians, eight on each side, dressed in its livery; the\none with orange-coloured damask, the other with white; and all played on\ndifferent instruments most melodiously and harmoniously, still varying in\ntime and measure as the figure of the dance required.  This seemed to me an\nadmirable thing, considering the numerous diversity of steps, back-steps,\nbounds, rebounds, jerks, paces, leaps, skips, turns, coupes, hops,\nleadings, risings, meetings, flights, ambuscadoes, moves, and removes.\n\nI was also at a loss when I strove to comprehend how the dancers could so\nsuddenly know what every different note meant; for they no sooner heard\nthis or that sound but they placed themselves in the place which was\ndenoted by the music, though their motions were all different.  For the\nnymphs that stood in the first file, as if they designed to begin the\nfight, marched straight forwards to their enemies from square to square,\nunless it were the first step, at which they were free to move over two\nsteps at once.  They alone never fall back (which is not very natural to\nother nymphs), and if any of them is so lucky as to advance to the opposite\nking's row, she is immediately crowned queen of her king, and after that\nmoves with the same state and in the same manner as the queen; but till\nthat happens they never strike their enemies but forwards, and obliquely in\na diagonal line.  However, they make it not their chief business to take\ntheir foes; for, if they did, they would leave their queen exposed to the\nadverse parties, who then might take her.\n\nThe kings move and take their enemies on all sides square-ways, and only\nstep from a white square into a yellow one, and vice versa, except at their\nfirst step the rank should want other officers than the wardens; for then\nthey can set 'em in their place, and retire by him.\n\nThe queens take a greater liberty than any of the rest; for they move\nbackwards and forwards all manner of ways, in a straight line as far as\nthey please, provided the place be not filled with one of her own party,\nand diagonally also, keeping to the colour on which she stands.\n\nThe archers move backwards or forwards, far and near, never changing the\ncolour on which they stand.  The knights move and take in a lineal manner,\nstepping over one square, though a friend or foe stand upon it, posting\nthemselves on the second square to the right or left, from one colour to\nanother, which is very unwelcome to the adverse party, and ought to be\ncarefully observed, for they take at unawares.\n\nThe wardens move and take to the right or left, before or behind them, like\nthe kings, and can advance as far as they find places empty; which liberty\nthe kings take not.\n\nThe law which both sides observe is, at the end of the fight, to besiege\nand enclose the king of either party, so that he may not be able to move;\nand being reduced to that extremity, the battle is over, and he loses the\nday.\n\nNow, to avoid this, there is none of either sex of each party but is\nwilling to sacrifice his or her life, and they begin to take one another on\nall sides in time, as soon as the music strikes up.  When anyone takes a\nprisoner, he makes his honours, and striking him gently in the hand, puts\nhim out of the field and combat, and encamps where he stood.\n\nIf one of the kings chance to stand where he might be taken, it is not\nlawful for any of his adversaries that had discovered him to lay hold on\nhim; far from it, they are strictly enjoined humbly to pay him their\nrespects, and give him notice, saying, God preserve you, sir! that his\nofficers may relieve and cover him, or he may remove, if unhappily he could\nnot be relieved.  However, he is not to be taken, but greeted with a\nGood-morrow, the others bending the knee; and thus the tournament uses\nto end.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXV.\n\nHow the thirty-two persons at the ball fought.\n\nThe two companies having taken their stations, the music struck up, and\nwith a martial sound, which had something of horrid in it, like a point of\nwar, roused and alarmed both parties, who now began to shiver, and then\nsoon were warmed with warlike rage; and having got in readiness to fight\ndesperately, impatient of delay stood waiting for the charge.\n\nThen the music of the silvered band ceased playing, and the instruments of\nthe golden side alone were heard, which denoted that the golden party\nattacked.  Accordingly, a new movement was played for the onset, and we saw\nthe nymph who stood before the queen turn to the left towards her king, as\nit were to ask leave to fight; and thus saluting her company at the same\ntime, she moved two squares forwards, and saluted the adverse party.\n\nNow the music of the golden brigade ceased playing, and their antagonists\nbegan again.  I ought to have told you that the nymph who began by saluting\nher company, had by that formality also given them to understand that they\nwere to fall on.  She was saluted by them in the same manner, with a full\nturn to the left, except the queen, who went aside towards her king to the\nright; and the same manner of salutation was observed on both sides during\nthe whole ball.\n\nThe silvered nymph that stood before her queen likewise moved as soon as\nthe music of her party sounded a charge; her salutations, and those of her\nside, were to the right, and her queen's to the left.  She moved in the\nsecond square forwards, and saluted her antagonists, facing the first\ngolden nymph; so that there was not any distance between them, and you\nwould have thought they two had been going to fight; but they only strike\nsideways.\n\nTheir comrades, whether silvered or golden, followed 'em in an intercalary\nfigure, and seemed to skirmish a while, till the golden nymph who had first\nentered the lists, striking a silvered nymph in the hand on the right, put\nher out of the field, and set herself in her place.  But soon the music\nplaying a new measure, she was struck by a silvered archer, who after that\nwas obliged himself to retire.  A silvered knight then sallied out, and the\ngolden queen posted herself before her king.\n\nThen the silvered king, dreading the golden queen's fury, removed to the\nright, to the place where his warden stood, which seemed to him strong and\nwell guarded.\n\nThe two knights on the left, whether golden or silvered, marched up, and on\neither side took up many nymphs who could not retreat; principally the\ngolden knight, who made this his whole business; but the silvered knight\nhad greater designs, dissembling all along, and even sometimes not taking a\nnymph when he could have done it, still moving on till he was come up to\nthe main body of the enemies in such a manner that he saluted their king\nwith a God save you, sir!\n\nThe whole golden brigade quaked for fear and anger, those words giving\nnotice of their king's danger; not but that they could soon relieve him,\nbut because their king being thus saluted they were to lose their warden on\nthe right wing without any hopes of a recovery.  Then the golden king\nretired to the left, and the silvered knight took the golden warden, which\nwas a mighty loss to that party.  However, they resolved to be revenged,\nand surrounded the knight that he might not escape.  He tried to get off,\nbehaving himself with a great deal of gallantry, and his friends did what\nthey could to save him; but at last he fell into the golden queen's hands,\nand was carried off.\n\nHer forces, not yet satisfied, having lost one of her best men, with more\nfury than conduct moved about, and did much mischief among their enemies.\nThe silvered party warily dissembled, watching their opportunity to be even\nwith them, and presented one of their nymphs to the golden queen, having\nlaid an ambuscado; so that the nymph being taken, a golden archer had like\nto have seized the silvered queen.  Then the golden knight undertakes to\ntake the silvered king and queen, and says, Good-morrow!  Then the silvered\narcher salutes them, and was taken by a golden nymph, and she herself by a\nsilvered one.\n\nThe fight was obstinate and sharp.  The wardens left their posts, and\nadvanced to relieve their friends.  The battle was doubtful, and victory\nhovered over both armies.  Now the silvered host charge and break through\ntheir enemy's ranks as far as the golden king's tent, and now they are\nbeaten back.  The golden queen distinguishes herself from the rest by her\nmighty achievements still more than by her garb and dignity; for at once\nshe takes an archer, and, going sideways, seizes a silvered warden.  Which\nthing the silvered queen perceiving, she came forwards, and, rushing on\nwith equal bravery, takes the last golden warden and some nymphs.  The two\nqueens fought a long while hand to hand; now striving to take each other by\nsurprise, then to save themselves, and sometimes to guard their kings.\nFinally, the golden queen took the silvered queen; but presently after she\nherself was taken by the silvered archer.\n\nThen the silvered king had only three nymphs, an archer, and a warden left,\nand the golden only three nymphs and the right knight, which made them\nfight more slowly and warily than before.  The two kings seemed to mourn\nfor the loss of their loving queens, and only studied and endeavoured to\nget new ones out of all their nymphs to be raised to that dignity, and thus\nbe married to them.  This made them excite those brave nymphs to strive to\nreach the farthest rank, where stood the king of the contrary party,\npromising them certainly to have them crowned if they could do this.  The\ngolden nymphs were beforehand with the others, and out of their number was\ncreated a queen, who was dressed in royal robes, and had a crown set on her\nhead.  You need not doubt the silvered nymphs made also what haste they\ncould to be queens.  One of them was within a step of the coronation place,\nbut there the golden knight lay ready to intercept her, so that she could\ngo no further.\n\nThe new golden queen, resolved to show herself valiant and worthy of her\nadvancement to the crown, achieved great feats of arms.  But in the\nmeantime the silvered knight takes the golden warden who guarded the camp;\nand thus there was a new silvered queen, who, like the other, strove to\nexcel in heroic deeds at the beginning of her reign.  Thus the fight grew\nhotter than before.  A thousand stratagems, charges, rallyings, retreats,\nand attacks were tried on both sides; till at last the silvered queen,\nhaving by stealth advanced as far as the golden king's tent, cried, God\nsave you, sir!  Now none but his new queen could relieve him; so she\nbravely came and exposed herself to the utmost extremity to deliver him out\nof it.  Then the silvered warden with his queen reduced the golden king to\nsuch a stress that, to save himself, he was forced to lose his queen; but\nthe golden king took him at last.  However, the rest of the golden party\nwere soon taken; and that king being left alone, the silvered party made\nhim a low bow, crying, Good morrow, sir! which denoted that the silvered\nking had got the day.\n\nThis being heard, the music of both parties loudly proclaimed the victory.\nAnd thus the first battle ended to the unspeakable joy of all the\nspectators.\n\nAfter this the two brigades took their former stations, and began to tilt a\nsecond time, much as they had done before, only the music played somewhat\nfaster than at the first battle, and the motions were altogether different.\nI saw the golden queen sally out one of the first, with an archer and a\nknight, as it were angry at the former defeat, and she had like to have\nfallen upon the silvered king in his tent among his officers; but having\nbeen baulked in her attempt, she skirmished briskly, and overthrew so many\nsilvered nymphs and officers that it was a most amazing sight.  You would\nhave sworn she had been another Penthesilea; for she behaved herself with\nas much bravery as that Amazonian queen did at Troy.\n\nBut this havoc did not last long; for the silvered party, exasperated by\ntheir loss, resolved to perish or stop her progress; and having posted an\narcher in ambuscado on a distant angle, together with a knight-errant, her\nhighness fell into their hands and was carried out of the field.  The rest\nwere soon routed after the taking of their queen, who, without doubt, from\nthat time resolved to be more wary and keep near her king, without\nventuring so far amidst her enemies unless with more force to defend her.\nThus the silvered brigade once more got the victory.\n\nThis did not dishearten or deject the golden party; far from it.  They soon\nappeared again in the field to face their enemies; and being posted as\nbefore, both the armies seemed more resolute and cheerful than ever.  Now\nthe martial concert began, and the music was above a hemiole the quicker,\naccording to the warlike Phrygian mode, such as was invented by Marsyas.\n\nThen our combatants began to wheel about, and charge with such a swiftness\nthat in an instant they made four moves, besides the usual salutations.  So\nthat they were continually in action, flying, hovering, jumping, vaulting,\ncurvetting, with petauristical turns and motions, and often intermingled.\n\nSeeing them then turn about on one foot after they had made their honours,\nwe compared them to your tops or gigs, such as boys use to whip about,\nmaking them turn round so swiftly that they sleep, as they call it, and\nmotion cannot be perceived, but resembles rest, its contrary; so that if\nyou make a point or mark on some part of one of those gigs, 'twill be\nperceived not as a point, but a continual line, in a most divine manner, as\nCusanus has wisely observed.\n\nWhile they were thus warmly engaged, we heard continually the claps and\nepisemapsies which those of the two bands reiterated at the taking of their\nenemies; and this, joined to the variety of their motions and music, would\nhave forced smiles out of the most severe Cato, the never-laughing Crassus,\nthe Athenian man-hater, Timon; nay, even whining Heraclitus, though he\nabhorred laughing, the action that is most peculiar to man.  For who could\nhave forborne? seeing those young warriors, with their nymphs and queens,\nso briskly and gracefully advance, retire, jump, leap, skip, spring, fly,\nvault, caper, move to the right, to the left, every way still in time, so\nswiftly, and yet so dexterously, that they never touched one another but\nmethodically.\n\nAs the number of the combatants lessened, the pleasure of the spectators\nincreased; for the stratagems and motions of the remaining forces were more\nsingular.  I shall only add that this pleasing entertainment charmed us to\nsuch a degree that our minds were ravished with admiration and delight, and\nthe martial harmony moved our souls so powerfully that we easily believed\nwhat is said of Ismenias's having excited Alexander to rise from table and\nrun to his arms, with such a warlike melody.  At last the golden king\nremained master of the field; and while we were minding those dances, Queen\nWhims vanished, so that we saw her no more from that day to this.\n\nThen Geber's michelots conducted us, and we were set down among her\nabstractors, as her queenship had commanded.  After that we returned to the\nport of Mateotechny, and thence straight aboard our ships; for the wind was\nfair, and had we not hoisted out of hand, we could hardly have got off in\nthree quarters of a moon in the wane.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXVI.\n\nHow we came to the island of Odes, where the ways go up and down.\n\nWe sailed before the wind, between a pair of courses, and in two days made\nthe island of Odes, at which place we saw a very strange thing.  The ways\nthere are animals; so true is Aristotle's saying, that all self-moving\nthings are animals.  Now the ways walk there.  Ergo, they are then animals.\nSome of them are strange unknown ways, like those of the planets; others\nare highways, crossways, and byways.  I perceived that the travellers and\ninhabitants of that country asked, Whither does this way go?  Whither does\nthat way go?  Some answered, Between Midy and Fevrolles, to the parish\nchurch, to the city, to the river, and so forth.  Being thus in their right\nway, they used to reach their journey's end without any further trouble,\njust like those who go by water from Lyons to Avignon or Arles.\n\nNow, as you know that nothing is perfect here below, we heard there was a\nsort of people whom they called highwaymen, waybeaters, and makers of\ninroads in roads; and that the poor ways were sadly afraid of them, and\nshunned them as you do robbers.  For these used to waylay them, as people\nlay trains for wolves, and set gins for woodcocks.  I saw one who was taken\nup with a lord chief justice's warrant for having unjustly, and in spite of\nPallas, taken the schoolway, which is the longest.  Another boasted that he\nhad fairly taken his shortest, and that doing so he first compassed his\ndesign.  Thus, Carpalin, meeting once Epistemon looking upon a wall with\nhis fiddle-diddle, or live urinal, in his hand, to make a little maid's\nwater, cried that he did not wonder now how the other came to be still the\nfirst at Pantagruel's levee, since he held his shortest and least used.\n\nI found Bourges highway among these.  It went with the deliberation of an\nabbot, but was made to scamper at the approach of some waggoners, who\nthreatened to have it trampled under their horses' feet, and make their\nwaggons run over it, as Tullia's chariot did over her father's body.\n\nI also espied there the old way between Peronne and St. Quentin, which\nseemed to me a very good, honest, plain way, as smooth as a carpet, and as\ngood as ever was trod upon by shoe of leather.\n\nAmong the rocks I knew again the good old way to La Ferrare, mounted on a\nhuge bear.  This at a distance would have put me in mind of St. Jerome's\npicture, had but the bear been a lion; for the poor way was all mortified,\nand wore a long hoary beard uncombed and entangled, which looked like the\npicture of winter, or at least like a white-frosted bush.\n\nOn that way were store of beads or rosaries, coarsely made of wild\npine-tree; and it seemed kneeling, not standing, nor lying flat; but its\nsides and middle were beaten with huge stones, insomuch that it proved to us\nat once an object of fear and pity.\n\nWhile we were examining it, a runner, bachelor of the place, took us aside,\nand showing us a white smooth way, somewhat filled with straw, said,\nHenceforth, gentlemen, do not reject the opinion of Thales the Milesian,\nwho said that water is the beginning of all things, nor that of Homer, who\ntells us that all things derive their original from the ocean; for this\nsame way which you see here had its beginning from water, and is to return\nwhence she came before two months come to an end; now carts are driven here\nwhere boats used to be rowed.\n\nTruly, said Pantagruel, you tell us no news; we see five hundred such\nchanges, and more, every year, in our world.  Then reflecting on the\ndifferent manner of going of those moving ways, he told us he believed that\nPhilolaus and Aristarchus had philosophized in this island, and that\nSeleucus (Motteux reads--'that some, indeed, were of opinion.'), indeed,\nwas of opinion the earth turns round about its poles, and not the heavens,\nwhatever we may think to the contrary; as, when we are on the river Loire,\nwe think the trees and the shore moves, though this is only an effect of\nour boat's motion.\n\nAs we went back to our ships, we saw three waylayers, who, having been\ntaken in ambuscado, were going to be broken on the wheel; and a huge\nfornicator was burned with a lingering fire for beating a way and breaking\none of its sides; we were told it was the way of the banks of the Nile in\nEgypt.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXVII.\n\nHow we came to the island of Sandals; and of the order of Semiquaver\nFriars.\n\nThence we went to the island of Sandals, whose inhabitants live on nothing\nbut ling-broth.  However, we were very kindly received and entertained by\nBenius the Third, king of the island, who, after he had made us drink, took\nus with him to show us a spick-and-span new monastery which he had\ncontrived for the Semiquaver Friars; so he called the religious men whom he\nhad there.  For he said that on t'other side the water lived friars who\nstyled themselves her sweet ladyship's most humble servants.  Item, the\ngoodly Friar-minors, who are semibreves of bulls; the smoked-herring tribe\nof Minim Friars; then the Crotchet Friars.  So that these diminutives could\nbe no more than Semiquavers.  By the statutes, bulls, and patents of Queen\nWhims, they were all dressed like so many house-burners, except that, as in\nAnjou your bricklayers use to quilt their knees when they tile houses, so\nthese holy friars had usually quilted bellies, and thick quilted paunches\nwere among them in much repute.  Their codpieces were cut slipper-fashion,\nand every monk among them wore two--one sewed before and another behind\n--reporting that some certain dreadful mysteries were duly represented by\nthis duplicity of codpieces.\n\nThey wore shoes as round as basins, in imitation of those who inhabit the\nsandy sea.  Their chins were close-shaved, and their feet iron-shod; and to\nshow they did not value fortune, Benius made them shave and poll the hind\npart of their polls as bare as a bird's arse, from the crown to the\nshoulder-blades; but they had leave to let their hair grow before, from the\ntwo triangular bones in the upper part of the skull.\n\nThus did they not value fortune a button, and cared no more for the goods\nof this world than you or I do for hanging.  And to show how much they\ndefied that blind jilt, all of them wore, not in their hands like her, but\nat their waist, instead of beads, sharp razors, which they used to\nnew-grind twice a day and set thrice a night.\n\nEach of them had a round ball on their feet, because Fortune is said to\nhave one under hers.\n\nThe flap of their cowls hanged forward, and not backwards, like those of\nothers.  Thus none could see their noses, and they laughed without fear\nboth at fortune and the fortunate; neither more nor less than our ladies\nlaugh at barefaced trulls when they have those mufflers on which they call\nmasks, and which were formerly much more properly called charity, because\nthey cover a multitude of sins.\n\nThe hind part of their faces were always uncovered, as are our faces, which\nmade them either go with their belly or the arse foremost, which they\npleased.  When their hind face went forwards, you would have sworn this had\nbeen their natural gait, as well on account of their round shoes as of the\ndouble codpiece, and their face behind, which was as bare as the back of my\nhand, and coarsely daubed over with two eyes and a mouth, such as you see\non some Indian nuts.  Now, if they offered to waddle along with their\nbellies forwards, you would have thought they were then playing at\nblindman's buff.  May I never be hanged if 'twas not a comical sight.\n\nTheir way of living was thus:  about owl-light they charitably began to\nboot and spur one another.  This being done, the least thing they did was\nto sleep and snore; and thus sleeping, they had barnacles on the handles of\ntheir faces, or spectacles at most.\n\nYou may swear we did not a little wonder at this odd fancy; but they\nsatisfied us presently, telling us that the day of judgment is to take\nmankind napping; therefore, to show they did not refuse to make their\npersonal appearance as fortune's darlings use to do, they were always thus\nbooted and spurred, ready to mount whenever the trumpet should sound.\n\nAt noon, as soon as the clock struck, they used to awake.  You must know\nthat their clock-bell, church-bells, and refectory-bells were all made\naccording to the pontial device, that is, quilted with the finest down, and\ntheir clappers of fox-tails.\n\nHaving then made shift to get up at noon, they pulled off their boots, and\nthose that wanted to speak with a maid, alias piss, pissed; those that\nwanted to scumber, scumbered; and those that wanted to sneeze, sneezed.\nBut all, whether they would or no (poor gentlemen!), were obliged largely\nand plentifully to yawn; and this was their first breakfast (O rigorous\nstatute!).  Methought 'twas very comical to observe their transactions;\nfor, having laid their boots and spurs on a rack, they went into the\ncloisters.  There they curiously washed their hands and mouths; then sat\nthem down on a long bench, and picked their teeth till the provost gave the\nsignal, whistling through his fingers; then every he stretched out his jaws\nas much as he could, and they gaped and yawned for about half-an-hour,\nsometimes more, sometimes less, according as the prior judged the breakfast\nto be suitable to the day.\n\nAfter that they went in procession, two banners being carried before them,\nin one of which was the picture of Virtue, and that of Fortune in the\nother.  The last went before, carried by a semi-quavering friar, at whose\nheels was another, with the shadow or image of Virtue in one hand and an\nholy-water sprinkle in the other--I mean of that holy mercurial water which\nOvid describes in his Fasti.  And as the preceding Semiquaver rang a\nhandbell, this shaked the sprinkle with his fist.  With that says\nPantagruel, This order contradicts the rule which Tully and the academics\nprescribed, that Virtue ought to go before, and Fortune follow.  But they\ntold us they did as they ought, seeing their design was to breech, lash,\nand bethwack Fortune.\n\nDuring the processions they trilled and quavered most melodiously betwixt\ntheir teeth I do not know what antiphones, or chantings, by turns.  For my\npart, 'twas all Hebrew-Greek to me, the devil a word I could pick out on't;\nat last, pricking up my ears, and intensely listening, I perceived they\nonly sang with the tip of theirs.  Oh, what a rare harmony it was!  How\nwell 'twas tuned to the sound of their bells!  You'll never find these to\njar, that you won't.  Pantagruel made a notable observation upon the\nprocessions; for says he, Have you seen and observed the policy of these\nSemiquavers?  To make an end of their procession they went out at one of\ntheir church doors and came in at the other; they took a deal of care not\nto come in at the place whereat they went out.  On my honour, these are a\nsubtle sort of people, quoth Panurge; they have as much wit as three folks,\ntwo fools and a madman; they are as wise as the calf that ran nine miles to\nsuck a bull, and when he came there 'twas a steer.  This subtlety and\nwisdom of theirs, cried Friar John, is borrowed from the occult philosophy.\nMay I be gutted like an oyster if I can tell what to make on't.  Then the\nmore 'tis to be feared, said Pantagruel; for subtlety suspected, subtlety\nforeseen, subtlety found out, loses the essence and very name of subtlety,\nand only gains that of blockishness.  They are not such fools as you take\nthem to be; they have more tricks than are good, I doubt.\n\nAfter the procession they went sluggingly into the fratery-room, by the way\nof walk and healthful exercise, and there kneeled under the tables, leaning\ntheir breasts on lanterns.  While they were in that posture, in came a huge\nSandal, with a pitchfork in his hand, who used to baste, rib-roast,\nswaddle, and swinge them well-favouredly, as they said, and in truth\ntreated them after a fashion.  They began their meal as you end yours, with\ncheese, and ended it with mustard and lettuce, as Martial tells us the\nancients did.  Afterwards a platterful of mustard was brought before every\none of them, and thus they made good the proverb, After meat comes mustard.\n\n      Their diet was this:\n\nO' Sundays they stuffed their puddings with puddings, chitterlings, links,\nBologna sausages, forced-meats, liverings, hogs' haslets, young quails, and\nteals.  You must also always add cheese for the first course, and mustard\nfor the last.\n\nO' Mondays they were crammed with peas and pork, cum commento, and\ninterlineary glosses.\n\nO' Tuesdays they used to twist store of holy-bread, cakes, buns, puffs,\nlenten loaves, jumbles, and biscuits.\n\nO' Wednesdays my gentlemen had fine sheep's heads, calves' heads, and\nbrocks' heads, of which there's no want in that country.\n\nO' Thursdays they guzzled down seven sorts of porridge, not forgetting\nmustard.\n\nO' Fridays they munched nothing but services or sorb-apples; neither were\nthese full ripe, as I guessed by their complexion.\n\nO' Saturdays they gnawed bones; not that they were poor or needy, for every\nmother's son of them had a very good fat belly-benefice.\n\nAs for their drink, 'twas an antifortunal; thus they called I don't know\nwhat sort of a liquor of the place.\n\nWhen they wanted to eat or drink, they turned down the back-points or flaps\nof their cowls forwards below their chins, and that served 'em instead of\ngorgets or slabbering-bibs.\n\nWhen they had well dined, they prayed rarely all in quavers and shakes; and\nthe rest of the day, expecting the day of judgment, they were taken up with\nacts of charity, and particularly--\n\nO' Sundays, rubbers at cuffs.\n\nO' Mondays, lending each other flirts and fillips on the nose.\n\nO' Tuesdays, clapperclawing one another.\n\nO' Wednesdays, sniting and fly-flapping.\n\nO' Thursdays, worming and pumping.\n\nO' Fridays, tickling.\n\nO' Saturdays, jerking and firking one another.\n\nSuch was their diet when they resided in the convent, and if the prior of\nthe monk-house sent any of them abroad, then they were strictly enjoined\nneither to touch nor eat any manner of fish as long as they were on sea or\nrivers, and to abstain from all manner of flesh whenever they were at land,\nthat everyone might be convinced that, while they enjoyed the object, they\ndenied themselves the power, and even the desire, and were no more moved\nwith it than the Marpesian rock.\n\nAll this was done with proper antiphones, still sung and chanted by ear, as\nwe have already observed.\n\nWhen the sun went to bed, they fairly booted and spurred each other as\nbefore, and having clapped on their barnacles e'en jogged to bed too.  At\nmidnight the Sandal came to them, and up they got, and having well whetted\nand set their razors, and been a-processioning, they clapped the tables\nover themselves, and like wire-drawers under their work fell to it as\naforesaid.\n\nFriar John des Entoumeures, having shrewdly observed these jolly Semiquaver\nFriars, and had a full account of their statutes, lost all patience, and\ncried out aloud:  Bounce tail, and God ha' mercy guts; if every fool should\nwear a bauble, fuel would be dear.  A plague rot it, we must know how many\nfarts go to an ounce.  Would Priapus were here, as he used to be at the\nnocturnal festivals in Crete, that I might see him play backwards, and\nwriggle and shake to the purpose.  Ay, ay, this is the world, and t'other\nis the country; may I never piss if this be not an antichthonian land, and\nour very antipodes.  In Germany they pull down monasteries and unfrockify\nthe monks; here they go quite kam, and act clean contrary to others,\nsetting new ones up, against the hair.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXVIII.\n\nHow Panurge asked a Semiquaver Friar many questions, and was only answered\nin monosyllables.\n\nPanurge, who had since been wholly taken up with staring at these royal\nSemiquavers, at last pulled one of them by the sleeve, who was as lean as a\nrake, and asked him,--\n\nHearkee me, Friar Quaver, Semiquaver, Demisemiquavering quaver, where is\nthe punk?\n\nThe Friar, pointing downwards, answered, There.\n\nPan.  Pray, have you many?  Fri.  Few.\n\nPan.  How many scores have you?  Fri.  One.\n\nPan.  How many would you have?  Fri.  Five.\n\nPan.  Where do you hide 'em?  Fri.  Here.\n\nPan.

Pumps.\n\nPan.  How do they use to be?  Fri.  Foul.\n\nPan.  How do they use to walk?  Fri.  Fast.\n\nPan.  Now let us talk of the kitchen, I mean that of the harlots, and\nwithout going hand over head let's a little examine things by particulars.\nWhat is in their kitchens?  Fri.  Fire.\n\nPan.  What fuel feeds it?  Fri.  Wood.\n\nPan.  What sort of wood is't?  Fri.  Dry.\n\nPan.  And of what kind of trees?  Fri.  Yews.\n\nPan.  What are the faggots and brushes of?  Fri.  Holm.\n\nPan.  What wood d'ye burn in your chambers?  Fri.  Pine.\n\nPan.  And of what other trees?  Fri.  Lime.\n\nPan.  Hearkee me; as for the buttocks, I'll go your halves.  Pray, how do\nyou feed 'em?  Fri.  Well.\n\nPan.  First, what do they eat?  Fri.  Bread.\n\nPan.  Of what complexion?  Fri.  White.\n\nPan.  And what else?  Fri.  Meat.\n\nPan.  How do they love it dressed?  Fri.  Roast.\n\nPan.

Eggs.\n\nPan.  How do they like 'em?  Fri.  Boiled.\n\nPan.  How must they be done?  Fri.  Hard.\n\nPan.  Is this all they have?  Fri.  No.\n\nPan.  What have they besides, then?  Fri.  Beef.\n\nPan.  And what else?  Fri.  Pork.\n\nPan.  And what more?  Fri.  Geese.\n\nPan.  What then?  Fri.  Ducks.\n\nPan.  And what besides?  Fri.  Cocks.\n\nPan.  What do they season their meat with?  Fri.  Salt.\n\nPan.  What sauce are they most dainty for?  Fri.  Must.\n\nPan.  What's their last course?  Fri.  Rice.\n\nPan.  And what else?  Fri.

Strong.\n\nPan.  In the spring.  Fri.  Brisk.\n\nPan.  In summer?  Fri.  Cool.\n\nPan.  In autumn?  Fri.  New.\n\nButtock of a monk! cried Friar John; how plump these plaguy trulls, these\narch Semiquavering strumpets, must be!  That damned cattle are so high fed\nthat they must needs be high-mettled, and ready to wince and give two ups\nfor one go-down when anyone offers to ride them below the crupper.\n\nPrithee, Friar John, quoth Panurge, hold thy prating tongue; stay till I\nhave done.\n\nTill what time do the doxies sit up?  Fri.  Night.\n\nPan.  When do they get up?  Fri.  Late.\n\nPan.  May I ride on a horse that was foaled of an acorn, if this be not as\nhonest a cod as ever the ground went upon, and as grave as an old gate-post\ninto the bargain.  Would to the blessed St. Semiquaver, and the blessed\nworthy virgin St. Semiquavera, he were lord chief president (justice) of\nParis!  Ods-bodikins, how he'd despatch!  With what expedition would he\nbring disputes to an upshot!  What an abbreviator and clawer off of\nlawsuits, reconciler of differences, examiner and fumbler of bags, peruser\nof bills, scribbler of rough drafts, and engrosser of deeds would he not\nmake!  Well, friar, spare your breath to cool your porridge.  Come, let's\nnow talk with deliberation, fairly and softly, as lawyers go to heaven.\nLet's know how you victual the venereal camp.  How is the snatchblatch?\nFri.  Rough.\n\nPan.  How is the gateway?  Fri.  Free.\n\nPan.  And how is it within?  Fri.  Deep.\n\nPan.  I mean, what weather is it there?  Fri.  Hot.\n\nPan.  What shadows the brooks?  Fri.  Groves.\n\nPan.  Of what's the colour of the twigs?  Fri.  Red.\n\nPan.  And that of the old?  Fri.  Grey.\n\nPan.  How are you when you shake?  Fri.  Brisk.\n\nPan.  How is their motion?  Fri.  Quick.\n\nPan.  Would you have them vault or wriggle more?  Fri.  Less.\n\nPan.  What kind of tools are yours?  Fri.  Big.\n\nPan.  And in their helves?  Fri.  Round.\n\nPan.  Of what colour is the tip?  Fri.  Red.\n\nPan.  When they've even used, how are they?  Fri.  Shrunk.\n\nPan.  How much weighs each bag of tools?  Fri.  Pounds.\n\nPan.  How hang your pouches?  Fri.  Tight.\n\nPan.  How are they when you've done?  Fri.  Lank.\n\nPan.  Now, by the oath you have taken, tell me, when you have a mind to\ncohabit, how you throw 'em?  Fri.  Down.\n\nPan.  And what do they say then?  Fri.  Fie.\n\nPan.  However, like maids, they say nay, and take it; and speak the less,\nbut think the more, minding the work in hand; do they not?  Fri.  True.\n\nPan.  Do they get you bairns?  Fri.  None.\n\nPan.  How do you pig together?  Fri.  Bare.\n\nPan.  Remember you're upon your oath, and tell me justly and bona fide how\nmany times a day you monk it?  Fri.  Six.\n\nPan.  How many bouts a-nights?  Fri.  Ten.\n\nCatso, quoth Friar John, the poor fornicating brother is bashful, and\nsticks at sixteen, as if that were his stint.  Right, quoth Panurge, but\ncouldst thou keep pace with him, Friar John, my dainty cod?  May the\ndevil's dam suck my teat if he does not look as if he had got a blow over\nthe nose with a Naples cowl-staff.\n\nPan.  Pray, Friar Shakewell, does your whole fraternity quaver and shake at\nthat rate?  Fri.  All.\n\nPan.  Who of them is the best cock o' the game?  Fri.  I.\n\nPan.  Do you never commit dry-bobs or flashes in the pan?  Fri.  None.\n\nPan.  I blush like any black dog, and could be as testy as an old cook when\nI think on all this; it passes my understanding.  But, pray, when you have\nbeen pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?  Fri.  More.\n\nPan.  By Priapus, they have the Indian herb of which Theophrastus spoke, or\nI'm much out.  But, hearkee me, thou man of brevity, should some\nimpediment, honestly or otherwise, impair your talents and cause your\nbenevolence to lessen, how would it fare with you, then?  Fri.  Ill.\n\nPan.  What would the wenches do?  Fri.  Rail.\n\nPan.  What if you skipped, and let 'em fast a whole day?  Fri.  Worse.\n\nPan.  What do you give 'em then?  Fri.  Thwacks.\n\nPan.  What do they say to this?  Fri.  Bawl.\n\nPan.  And what else?  Fri.  Curse.\n\nPan.  How do you correct 'em?  Fri.  Hard.\n\nPan.  What do you get out of 'em then?  Fri.  Blood.\n\nPan.  How's their complexion then?  Fri.  Odd.\n\nPan.  What do they mend it with?  Fri.  Paint.\n\nPan.  Then what do they do?  Fri.  Fawn.\n\nPan.  By the oath you have taken, tell me truly what time of the year do\nyou do it least in?  Fri.  Now (August.).\n\nPan.  What season do you do it best in?  Fri.  March.\n\nPan.  How is your performance the rest of the year?  Fri.  Brisk.\n\nThen quoth Panurge, sneering, Of all, and of all, commend me to Ball; this\nis the friar of the world for my money.  You've heard how short, concise,\nand compendious he is in his answers.  Nothing is to be got out of him but\nmonosyllables.  By jingo, I believe he would make three bites of a cherry.\n\nDamn him, cried Friar John, that's as true as I am his uncle.  The dog\nyelps at another gate's rate when he is among his bitches; there he is\npolysyllable enough, my life for yours.  You talk of making three bites of\na cherry!  God send fools more wit and us more money!  May I be doomed to\nfast a whole day if I don't verily believe he would not make above two\nbites of a shoulder of mutton and one swoop of a whole pottle of wine.\nZoons, do but see how down o' the mouth the cur looks!  He's nothing but\nskin and bones; he has pissed his tallow.\n\nTruly, truly, quoth Epistemon, this rascally monastical vermin all over the\nworld mind nothing but their gut, and are as ravenous as any kites, and\nthen, forsooth, they tell us they've nothing but food and raiment in this\nworld.  'Sdeath, what more have kings and princes?\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXIX.\n\nHow Epistemon disliked the institution of Lent.\n\nPray did you observe, continued Epistemon, how this damned ill-favoured\nSemiquaver mentioned March as the best month for caterwauling?  True, said\nPantagruel; yet Lent and March always go together, and the first was\ninstituted to macerate and bring down our pampered flesh, to weaken and\nsubdue its lusts, to curb and assuage the venereal rage.\n\nBy this, said Epistemon, you may guess what kind of a pope it was who first\nenjoined it to be kept, since this filthy wooden-shoed Semiquaver owns that\nhis spoon is never oftener nor deeper in the porringer of lechery than in\nLent.  Add to this the evident reasons given by all good and learned\nphysicians, affirming that throughout the whole year no food is eaten that\ncan prompt mankind to lascivious acts more than at that time.\n\nAs, for example, beans, peas, phasels, or long-peason, ciches, onions,\nnuts, oysters, herrings, salt-meats, garum (a kind of anchovy), and salads\nwholly made up of venereous herbs and fruits, as--\n\nRocket,         Parsley,        Hop-buds,\nNose-smart,     Rampions,       Figs,\nTaragon,        Poppy,          Rice,\nCresses,        Celery,         Raisins, and others.\n\nIt would not a little surprise you, said Pantagruel, should a man tell you\nthat the good pope who first ordered the keeping of Lent, perceiving that\nat that time o' year the natural heat (from the centre of the body, whither\nit was retired during the winter's cold) diffuses itself, as the sap does\nin trees, through the circumference of the members, did therefore in a\nmanner prescribe that sort of diet to forward the propagation of mankind.\nWhat makes me think so, is that by the registers of christenings at Touars\nit appears that more children are born in October and November than in the\nother ten months of the year, and reckoning backwards 'twill be easily\nfound that they were all made, conceived, and begotten in Lent.\n\nI listen to you with both my ears, quoth Friar John, and that with no small\npleasure, I'll assure you.  But I must tell you that the vicar of Jambert\nascribed this copious prolification of the women, not to that sort of food\nthat we chiefly eat in Lent, but to the little licensed stooping mumpers,\nyour little booted Lent-preachers, your little draggle-tailed father\nconfessors, who during all that time of their reign damn all husbands that\nrun astray three fathom and a half below the very lowest pit of hell.  So\nthe silly cod's-headed brothers of the noose dare not then stumble any more\nat the truckle-bed, to the no small discomfort of their maids, and are even\nforced, poor souls, to take up with their own bodily wives.  Dixi; I have\ndone.\n\nYou may descant on the institution of Lent as much as you please, cried\nEpistemon; so many men so many minds; but certainly all the physicians will\nbe against its being suppressed, though I think that time is at hand.  I\nknow they will, and have heard 'em say were it not for Lent their art would\nsoon fall into contempt, and they'd get nothing, for hardly anybody would\nbe sick.\n\nAll distempers are sowed in lent; 'tis the true seminary and native bed of\nall diseases; nor does it only weaken and putrefy bodies, but it also makes\nsouls mad and uneasy.  For then the devils do their best, and drive a\nsubtle trade, and the tribe of canting dissemblers come out of their holes.\n'Tis then term-time with your cucullated pieces of formality that have one\nface to God and another to the devil; and a wretched clutter they make with\ntheir sessions, stations, pardons, syntereses, confessions, whippings,\nanathematizations, and much prayer with as little devotion.  However, I'll\nnot offer to infer from this that the Arimaspians are better than we are in\nthat point; yet I speak to the purpose.\n\nWell, quoth Panurge to the Semiquaver friar, who happened to be by, dear\nbumbasting, shaking, trilling, quavering cod, what thinkest thou of this\nfellow?  Is he a rank heretic?  Fri.  Much.\n\nPan.  Ought he not to be singed?  Fri.  Well.\n\nPan.  As soon as may be?  Fri.  Right.\n\nPan.  Should not he be scalded first?  Fri.  No.\n\nPan.  How then, should he be roasted?  Fri.  Quick.\n\nPan.  Till at last he be?  Fri.  Dead.\n\nPan.  What has he made you?  Fri.  Mad.\n\nPan.  What d'ye take him to be?  Fri.  Damned.\n\nPan.  What place is he to go to?  Fri.  Hell.\n\nPan.  But, first, how would you have 'em served here?  Fri.  Burnt.\n\nPan.  Some have been served so?  Fri.  Store.\n\nPan.  That were heretics?  Fri.  Less.\n\nPan.  And the number of those that are to be warmed thus hereafter is?\nFri.  Great.\n\nPan.  How many of 'em do you intend to save?  Fri.  None.\n\nPan.  So you'd have them burned?  Fri.  All.\n\nI wonder, said Epistemon to Panurge, what pleasure you can find in talking\nthus with this lousy tatterdemalion of a monk.  I vow, did I not know you\nwell, I might be ready to think you had no more wit in your head than he\nhas in both his shoulders.  Come, come, scatter no words, returned Panurge;\neveryone as they like, as the woman said when she kissed her cow.  I wish I\nmight carry him to Gargantua; when I'm married he might be my wife's fool.\nAnd make you one, cried Epistemon.  Well said, quoth Friar John.  Now, poor\nPanurge, take that along with thee, thou'rt e'en fitted; 'tis a plain case\nthou'lt never escape wearing the bull's feather; thy wife will be as common\nas the highway, that's certain.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXX.\n\nHow we came to the land of Satin.\n\nHaving pleased ourselves with observing that new order of Semiquaver\nFriars, we set sail, and in three days our skipper made the finest and most\ndelightful island that ever was seen.  He called it the island of Frieze,\nfor all the ways were of frieze.\n\nIn that island is the land of Satin, so celebrated by our court pages.  Its\ntrees and herbage never lose their leaves or flowers, and are all damask\nand flowered velvet.  As for the beasts and birds, they are all of tapestry\nwork.  There we saw many beasts, birds on trees, of the same colour,\nbigness, and shape of those in our country; with this difference, however,\nthat these did eat nothing, and never sung or bit like ours; and we also\nsaw there many sorts of creatures which we never had seen before.\n\nAmong the rest, several elephants in various postures; twelve of which were\nthe six males and six females that were brought to Rome by their governor\nin the time of Germanicus, Tiberius's nephew.  Some of them were learned\nelephants, some musicians, others philosophers, dancers, and showers of\ntricks; and all sat down at table in good order, silently eating and\ndrinking like so many fathers in a fratery-room.\n\nWith their snouts or proboscises, some two cubits long, they draw up water\nfor their own drinking, and take hold of palm leaves, plums, and all manner\nof edibles, using them offensively or defensively as we do our fists; with\nthem tossing men high into the air in fight, and making them burst with\nlaughing when they come to the ground.\n\nThey have joints (in their legs), whatever some men, who doubtless never\nsaw any but painted, may have written to the contrary.  Between their teeth\nthey have two huge horns; thus Juba called 'em, and Pausanias tells us they\nare not teeth, but horns; however, Philostratus will have 'em to be teeth,\nand not horns.  'Tis all one to me, provided you will be pleased to own\nthem to be true ivory.  These are some three or four cubits long, and are\nfixed in the upper jawbone, and consequently not in the lowermost.  If you\nhearken to those who will tell you to the contrary, you will find yourself\ndamnably mistaken, for that's a lie with a latchet; though 'twere Aelian,\nthat long-bow man, that told you so, never believe him, for he lies as fast\nas a dog can trot.  'Twas in this very island that Pliny, his brother\ntell-truth, had seen some elephants dance on the rope with bells, and whip\nover the tables, presto, begone, while people were at feasts, without so\nmuch as touching the toping topers or the topers toping.\n\nI saw a rhinoceros there, just such a one as Harry Clerberg had formerly\nshowed me.  Methought it was not much unlike a certain boar which I had\nformerly seen at Limoges, except the sharp horn on its snout, that was\nabout a cubit long; by the means of which that animal dares encounter with\nan elephant, that is sometimes killed with its point thrust into its belly,\nwhich is its most tender and defenceless part.\n\nI saw there two and thirty unicorns.  They are a curst sort of creatures,\nmuch resembling a fine horse, unless it be that their heads are like a\nstag's, their feet like an elephant's, their tails like a wild boar's, and\nout of each of their foreheads sprouts out a sharp black horn, some six or\nseven feet long; commonly it dangles down like a turkey-cock's comb.  When\na unicorn has a mind to fight, or put it to any other use, what does it do\nbut make it stand, and then 'tis as straight as an arrow.\n\nI saw one of them, which was attended with a throng of other wild beasts,\npurify a fountain with its horn.  With that Panurge told me that his\nprancer, alias his nimble-wimble, was like the unicorn, not altogether in\nlength indeed, but in virtue and propriety; for as the unicorn purified\npools and fountains from filth and venom, so that other animals came and\ndrank securely there afterwards, in the like manner others might water\ntheir nags, and dabble after him without fear of shankers, carnosities,\ngonorrhoeas, buboes, crinkams, and such other plagues caught by those who\nventure to quench their amorous thirst in a common puddle; for with his\nnervous horn he removed all the infection that might be lurking in some\nblind cranny of the mephitic sweet-scented hole.\n\nWell, quoth Friar John, when you are sped, that is, when you are married,\nwe will make a trial of this on thy spouse, merely for charity sake, since\nyou are pleased to give us so beneficial an instruction.\n\nAy, ay, returned Panurge, and then immediately I'll give you a pretty\ngentle aggregative pill of God, made up of two and twenty kind stabs with a\ndagger, after the Caesarian way.  Catso, cried Friar John, I had rather\ntake off a bumper of good cool wine.\n\nI saw there the golden fleece formerly conquered by Jason, and can assure\nyou, on the word of an honest man, that those who have said it was not a\nfleece but a golden pippin, because melon signifies both an apple and a\nsheep, were utterly mistaken.\n\nI saw also a chameleon, such as Aristotle describes it, and like that which\nhad been formerly shown me by Charles Maris, a famous physician of the\nnoble city of Lyons on the Rhone; and the said chameleon lived on air just\nas the other did.\n\nI saw three hydras, like those I had formerly seen.  They are a kind of\nserpent, with seven different heads.\n\nI saw also fourteen phoenixes.  I had read in many authors that there was\nbut one in the whole world in every century; but, if I may presume to speak\nmy mind, I declare that those who said this had never seen any, unless it\nwere in the land of Tapestry; though 'twere vouched by Claudian or\nLactantius Firmianus.\n\nI saw the skin of Apuleius's golden ass.\n\nI saw three hundred and nine pelicans.\n\nItem, six thousand and sixteen Seleucid birds marching in battalia, and\npicking up straggling grasshoppers in cornfields.\n\nItem, some cynamologi, argatiles, caprimulgi, thynnunculs, onocrotals, or\nbitterns, with their wide swallows, stymphalides, harpies, panthers,\ndorcasses, or bucks, cemades, cynocephalises, satyrs, cartasans, tarands,\nuri, monopses, or bonasi, neades, steras, marmosets, or monkeys, bugles,\nmusimons, byturoses, ophyri, screech-owls, goblins, fairies, and griffins.\n\nI saw Mid-Lent o' horseback, with Mid-August and Mid-March holding its\nstirrups.\n\nI saw some mankind wolves, centaurs, tigers, leopards, hyenas,\ncamelopardals, and orixes, or huge wild goats with sharp horns.\n\nI saw a remora, a little fish called echineis by the Greeks, and near it a\ntall ship that did not get ahead an inch, though she was in the offing with\ntop and top-gallants spread before the wind.  I am somewhat inclined to\nbelieve that 'twas the very numerical ship in which Periander the tyrant\nhappened to be when it was stopped by such a little fish in spite of wind\nand tide.  It was in this land of Satin, and in no other, that Mutianus had\nseen one of them.\n\nFriar John told us that in the days of yore two sorts of fishes used to\nabound in our courts of judicature, and rotted the bodies and tormented the\nsouls of those who were at law, whether noble or of mean descent, high or\nlow, rich or poor:  the first were your April fish or mackerel (pimps,\npanders, and bawds); the others your beneficial remoras, that is, the\neternity of lawsuits, the needless lets that keep 'em undecided.\n\nI saw some sphynges, some raphes, some ounces, and some cepphi, whose\nfore-feet are like hands and their hind-feet like man's.\n\nAlso some crocutas and some eali as big as sea-horses, with elephants'\ntails, boars' jaws and tusks, and horns as pliant as an ass's ears.\n\nThe crocutas, most fleet animals, as big as our asses of Mirebalais, have\nnecks, tails, and breasts like a lion's, legs like a stag's, have mouths up\nto the ears, and but two teeth, one above and one below; they speak with\nhuman voices, but when they do they say nothing.\n\nSome people say that none e'er saw an eyrie, or nest of sakers; if you'll\nbelieve me, I saw no less than eleven, and I'm sure I reckoned right.\n\nI saw some left-handed halberds, which were the first that I had ever seen.\n\nI saw some manticores, a most strange sort of creatures, which have the\nbody of a lion, red hair, a face and ears like a man's, three rows of teeth\nwhich close together as if you joined your hands with your fingers between\neach other; they have a sting in their tails like a scorpion's, and a very\nmelodious voice.\n\nI saw some catablepases, a sort of serpents, whose bodies are small, but\ntheir heads large, without any proportion, so that they've much ado to lift\nthem up; and their eyes are so infectious that whoever sees 'em dies upon\nthe spot, as if he had seen a basilisk.\n\nI saw some beasts with two backs, and those seemed to me the merriest\ncreatures in the world.  They were most nimble at wriggling the buttocks,\nand more diligent in tail-wagging than any water-wagtails, perpetually\njogging and shaking their double rumps.\n\nI saw there some milched crawfish, creatures that I never had heard of\nbefore in my life.  These moved in very good order, and 'twould have done\nyour heart good to have seen 'em.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXI.\n\nHow in the land of Satin we saw Hearsay, who kept a school of vouching.\n\nWe went a little higher up into the country of Tapestry, and saw the\nMediterranean Sea open to the right and left down to the very bottom; just\nas the Red Sea very fairly left its bed at the Arabian Gulf to make a lane\nfor the Jews when they left Egypt.\n\nThere I found Triton winding his silver shell instead of a horn, and also\nGlaucus, Proteus, Nereus, and a thousand other godlings and sea monsters.\n\nI also saw an infinite number of fish of all kinds, dancing, flying,\nvaulting, fighting, eating, breathing, billing, shoving, milting, spawning,\nhunting, fishing, skirmishing, lying in ambuscado, making truces,\ncheapening, bargaining, swearing, and sporting.\n\nIn a blind corner we saw Aristotle holding a lantern in the posture in\nwhich the hermit uses to be drawn near St. Christopher, watching, prying,\nthinking, and setting everything down.\n\nBehind him stood a pack of other philosophers, like so many bums by a\nhead-bailiff, as Appian, Heliodorus, Athenaeus, Porphyrius, Pancrates,\nArcadian, Numenius, Possidonius, Ovidius, Oppianus, Olympius, Seleucus,\nLeonides, Agathocles, Theophrastus, Damostratus, Mutianus, Nymphodorus,\nAelian, and five hundred other such plodding dons, who were full of\nbusiness, yet had little to do; like Chrysippus or Aristarchus of Soli, who\nfor eight-and-fifty years together did nothing in the world but examine the\nstate and concerns of bees.\n\nI spied Peter Gilles among these, with a urinal in his hand, narrowly\nwatching the water of those goodly fishes.\n\nWhen we had long beheld everything in this land of Satin, Pantagruel said,\nI have sufficiently fed my eyes, but my belly is empty all this while, and\nchimes to let me know 'tis time to go to dinner.  Let's take care of the\nbody lest the soul abdicate it; and to this effect let's taste some of\nthese anacampserotes ('An herb, the touching of which is said to reconcile\nlovers.'--Motteux.) that hang over our heads.  Psha, cried one, they are\nmere trash, stark naught, o' my word; they're good for nothing.\n\nI then went to pluck some mirobolans off of a piece of tapestry whereon\nthey hung, but the devil a bit I could chew or swallow 'em; and had you had\nthem betwixt your teeth you would have sworn they had been thrown silk;\nthere was no manner of savour in 'em.\n\nOne might be apt to think Heliogabalus had taken a hint from thence, to\nfeast those whom he had caused to fast a long time, promising them a\nsumptuous, plentiful, and imperial feast after it; for all the treat used\nto amount to no more than several sorts of meat in wax, marble,\nearthenware, painted and figured tablecloths.\n\nWhile we were looking up and down to find some more substantial food, we\nheard a loud various noise, like that of paper-mills (or women bucking of\nlinen); so with all speed we went to the place whence the noise came, where\nwe found a diminutive, monstrous, misshapen old fellow, called Hearsay.\nHis mouth was slit up to his ears, and in it were seven tongues, each of\nthem cleft into seven parts.  However, he chattered, tattled, and prated\nwith all the seven at once, of different matters, and in divers languages.\n\nHe had as many ears all over his head and the rest of his body as Argus\nformerly had eyes, and was as blind as a beetle, and had the palsy in his\nlegs.\n\nAbout him stood an innumerable number of men and women, gaping, listening,\nand hearing very intensely.  Among 'em I observed some who strutted like\ncrows in a gutter, and principally a very handsome bodied man in the face,\nwho held then a map of the world, and with little aphorisms compendiously\nexplained everything to 'em; so that those men of happy memories grew\nlearned in a trice, and would most fluently talk with you of a world of\nprodigious things, the hundredth part of which would take up a man's whole\nlife to be fully known.\n\nAmong the rest they descanted with great prolixity on the pyramids and\nhieroglyphics of Egypt, of the Nile, of Babylon, of the Troglodytes, the\nHymantopodes, or crump-footed nation, the Blemiae, people that wear their\nheads in the middle of their breasts, the Pigmies, the Cannibals, the\nHyperborei and their mountains, the Egypanes with their goat's feet, and\nthe devil and all of others; every individual word of it by hearsay.\n\nI am much mistaken if I did not see among them Herodotus, Pliny, Solinus,\nBerosus, Philostratus, Pomponius Mela, Strabo, and God knows how many other\nantiquaries.\n\nThen Albert, the great Jacobin friar, Peter Tesmoin, alias Witness, Pope\nPius the Second, Volaterranus, Paulus Jovius the valiant, Jemmy Cartier,\nChaton the Armenian, Marco Polo the Venetian, Ludovico Romano, Pedro\nAliares, and forty cartloads of other modern historians, lurking behind a\npiece of tapestry, where they were at it ding-dong, privately scribbling\nthe Lord knows what, and making rare work of it; and all by hearsay.\n\nBehind another piece of tapestry (on which Naboth and Susanna's accusers\nwere fairly represented), I saw close by Hearsay, good store of men of the\ncountry of Perce and Maine, notable students, and young enough.\n\nI asked what sort of study they applied themselves to; and was told that\nfrom their youth they learned to be evidences, affidavit-men, and vouchers,\nand were instructed in the art of swearing; in which they soon became such\nproficients, that when they left that country, and went back into their\nown, they set up for themselves and very honestly lived by their trade of\nevidencing, positively giving their testimony of all things whatsoever to\nthose who feed them most roundly to do a job of journey-work for them; and\nall this by hearsay.\n\nYou may think what you will of it; but I can assure you they gave some of\nus corners of their cakes, and we merrily helped to empty their hogsheads.\nThen, in a friendly manner, they advised us to be as sparing of truth as\npossibly we could if ever we had a mind to get court preferment.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXII.\n\nHow we came in sight of Lantern-land.\n\nHaving been but scurvily entertained in the land of Satin, we went o'\nboard, and having set sail, in four days came near the coast of\nLantern-land.  We then saw certain little hovering fires on the sea.\n\nFor my part, I did not take them to be lanterns, but rather thought they\nwere fishes which lolled their flaming tongues on the surface of the sea,\nor lampyrides, which some call cicindelas, or glowworms, shining there as\nripe barley does o' nights in my country.\n\nBut the skipper satisfied us that they were the lanterns of the watch, or,\nmore properly, lighthouses, set up in many places round the precinct of the\nplace to discover the land, and for the safe piloting in of some outlandish\nlanterns, which, like good Franciscan and Jacobin friars, were coming to\nmake their personal appearance at the provincial chapter.\n\nHowever, some of us were somewhat suspicious that these fires were the\nforerunners of some storm, but the skipper assured us again they were not.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXIII.\n\nHow we landed at the port of the Lychnobii, and came to Lantern-land.\n\n\nSoon after we arrived at the port of Lantern-land, where Pantagruel\ndiscovered on a high tower the lantern of Rochelle, that stood us in good\nstead, for it cast a great light.  We also saw the lantern of Pharos, that\nof Nauplion, and that of Acropolis at Athens, sacred to Pallas.\n\nNear the port there's a little hamlet inhabited by the Lychnobii, that live\nby lanterns, as the gulligutted friars in our country live by nuns; they\nare studious people, and as honest men as ever shit in a trumpet.\nDemosthenes had formerly lanternized there.\n\nWe were conducted from that place to the palace by three obeliscolichnys\n('A kind of beacons.'--Motteux.), military guards of the port, with\nhigh-crowned hats, whom we acquainted with the cause of our voyage, and our\ndesign, which was to desire the queen of the country to grant us a lantern\nto light and conduct us during our voyage to the Oracle of the Holy Bottle.\n\nThey promised to assist us in this, and added that we could never have come\nin a better time, for then the lanterns held their provincial chapter.\n\nWhen we came to the royal palace we had audience of her highness the Queen\nof Lantern-land, being introduced by two lanterns of honour, that of\nAristophanes and that of Cleanthes (Motteux adds here--'Mistresses of the\nceremonies.').  Panurge in a few words acquainted her with the causes of\nour voyage, and she received us with great demonstrations of friendship,\ndesiring us to come to her at supper-time that we might more easily make\nchoice of one to be our guide; which pleased us extremely.  We did not fail\nto observe intensely everything we could see, as the garbs, motions, and\ndeportment of the queen's subjects, principally the manner after which she\nwas served.\n\nThe bright queen was dressed in virgin crystal of Tutia wrought damaskwise,\nand beset with large diamonds.\n\nThe lanterns of the royal blood were clad partly with bastard-diamonds,\npartly with diaphanous stones; the rest with horn, paper, and oiled cloth.\n\nThe cresset-lights took place according to the antiquity and lustre of\ntheir families.\n\nAn earthen dark-lantern, shaped like a pot, notwithstanding this took place\nof some of the first quality; at which I wondered much, till I was told it\nwas that of Epictetus, for which three thousand drachmas had been formerly\nrefused.\n\nMartial's polymix lantern (Motteux gives a footnote:--'A lamp with many\nwicks, or a branch'd candlestick with many springs coming out of it, that\nsupply all the branches with oil.') made a very good figure there.  I took\nparticular notice of its dress, and more yet of the lychnosimity formerly\nconsecrated by Canopa, the daughter of Tisias.\n\nI saw the lantern pensile formerly taken out of the temple of Apollo\nPalatinus at Thebes, and afterwards by Alexander the Great (carried to the\ntown of Cymos).  (The words in brackets have been omitted by Motteux.)\n\nI saw another that distinguished itself from the rest by a bushy tuft of\ncrimson silk on its head.  I was told 'twas that of Bartolus, the lantern\nof the civilians.\n\nTwo others were very remarkable for glister-pouches that dangled at their\nwaist.  We were told that one was the greater light and the other the\nlesser light of the apothecaries.\n\nWhen 'twas supper-time, the queen's highness first sat down, and then the\nlady lanterns, according to their rank and dignity.  For the first course\nthey were all served with large Christmas candles, except the queen, who\nwas served with a hugeous, thick, stiff, flaming taper of white wax,\nsomewhat red towards the tip; and the royal family, as also the provincial\nlantern of Mirebalais, who were served with nutlights; and the provincial\nof Lower Poitou, with an armed candle.\n\nAfter that, God wot, what a glorious light they gave with their wicks!  I\ndo not say all, for you must except a parcel of junior lanterns, under the\ngovernment of a high and mighty one.  These did not cast a light like the\nrest, but seemed to me dimmer than any long-snuff farthing candle whose\ntallow has been half melted away in a hothouse.\n\nAfter supper we withdrew to take some rest, and the next day the queen made\nus choose one of the most illustrious lanterns to guide us; after which we\ntook our leave.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXIV.\n\nHow we arrived at the Oracle of the Bottle.\n\nOur glorious lantern lighting and directing us to heart's content, we at\nlast arrived at the desired island where was the Oracle of the Bottle.  As\nsoon as friend Panurge landed, he nimbly cut a caper with one leg for joy,\nand cried to Pantagruel, Now we are where we have wished ourselves long\nago.  This is the place we've been seeking with such toil and labour.  He\nthen made a compliment to our lantern, who desired us to be of good cheer,\nand not be daunted or dismayed whatever we might chance to see.\n\nTo come to the Temple of the Holy Bottle we were to go through a large\nvineyard, in which were all sorts of vines, as the Falernian, Malvoisian,\nthe Muscadine, those of Taige, Beaune, Mirevaux, Orleans, Picardent,\nArbois, Coussi, Anjou, Grave, Corsica, Vierron, Nerac, and others.  This\nvineyard was formerly planted by the good Bacchus, with so great a blessing\nthat it yields leaves, flowers, and fruit all the year round, like the\norange trees at Suraine.\n\nOur magnificent lantern ordered every one of us to eat three grapes, to put\nsome vine-leaves in his shoes, and take a vine-branch in his left hand.\n\nAt the end of the close we went under an arch built after the manner of\nthose of the ancients.  The trophies of a toper were curiously carved on\nit.\n\nFirst, on one side was to be seen a long train of flagons, leathern\nbottles, flasks, cans, glass bottles, barrels, nipperkins, pint pots, quart\npots, pottles, gallons, and old-fashioned semaises (swingeing wooden pots,\nsuch as those out of which the Germans fill their glasses); these hung on a\nshady arbour.\n\nOn another side was store of garlic, onions, shallots, hams, botargos,\ncaviare, biscuits, neat's tongues, old cheese, and such like comfits, very\nartificially interwoven, and packed together with vine-stocks.\n\nOn another were a hundred sorts of drinking glasses, cups, cisterns, ewers,\nfalse cups, tumblers, bowls, mazers, mugs, jugs, goblets, talboys, and such\nother Bacchic artillery.\n\nOn the frontispiece of the triumphal arch, under the zoophore, was the\nfollowing couplet:\n\n  You who presume to move this way,\n  Get a good lantern, lest you stray.\n\nWe took special care of that, cried Pantagruel when he had read them; for\nthere is not a better or a more divine lantern than ours in all\nLantern-land.\n\nThis arch ended at a fine large round alley covered over with the interlaid\nbranches of vines, loaded and adorned with clusters of five hundred\ndifferent colours, and of as many various shapes, not natural, but due to\nthe skill of agriculture; some were golden, others bluish, tawny, azure,\nwhite, black, green, purple, streaked with many colours, long, round,\ntriangular, cod-like, hairy, great-headed, and grassy.  That pleasant alley\nended at three old ivy-trees, verdant, and all loaden with rings.  Our\nenlightened lantern directed us to make ourselves hats with some of their\nleaves, and cover our heads wholly with them, which was immediately done.\n\nJupiter's priestess, said Pantagruel, in former days would not like us have\nwalked under this arbour.  There was a mystical reason, answered our most\nperspicuous lantern, that would have hindered her; for had she gone under\nit, the wine, or the grapes of which 'tis made, that's the same thing, had\nbeen over her head, and then she would have seemed overtopped and mastered\nby wine.  Which implies that priests, and all persons who devote themselves\nto the contemplation of divine things, ought to keep their minds sedate and\ncalm, and avoid whatever might disturb and discompose their tranquillity,\nwhich nothing is more apt to do than drunkenness.\n\nYou also, continued our lantern, could not come into the Holy Bottle's\npresence, after you have gone through this arch, did not that noble\npriestess Bacbuc first see your shoes full of vine-leaves; which action is\ndiametrically opposite to the other, and signifies that you despise wine,\nand having mastered it, as it were, tread it under foot.\n\nI am no scholar, quoth Friar John, for which I'm heartily sorry, yet I find\nby my breviary that in the Revelation a woman was seen with the moon under\nher feet, which was a most wonderful sight.  Now, as Bigot explained it to\nme, this was to signify that she was not of the nature of other women; for\nthey have all the moon at their heads, and consequently their brains are\nalways troubled with a lunacy.  This makes me willing to believe what you\nsaid, dear Madam Lantern.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXV.\n\nHow we went underground to come to the Temple of the Holy Bottle, and how\nChinon is the oldest city in the world.\n\nWe went underground through a plastered vault, on which was coarsely\npainted a dance of women and satyrs waiting on old Silenus, who was\ngrinning o' horseback on his ass.  This made me say to Pantagruel, that\nthis entry put me in mind of the painted cellar in the oldest city in the\nworld, where such paintings are to be seen, and in as cool a place.\n\nWhich is the oldest city in the world? asked Pantagruel.  'Tis Chinon, sir,\nor Cainon in Touraine, said I.  I know, returned Pantagruel, where Chinon\nlies, and the painted cellar also, having myself drunk there many a glass\nof cool wine; neither do I doubt but that Chinon is an ancient town\n--witness its blazon.  I own 'tis said twice or thrice:\n\n      Chinon,\n    Little town,\n    Great renown,\n    On old stone\n    Long has stood;\n  There's the Vienne, if you look down;\n  If you look up, there's the wood.\n\nBut how, continued he, can you make it out that 'tis the oldest city in the\nworld?  Where did you find this written?  I have found it in the sacred\nwrit, said I, that Cain was the first that built a town; we may then\nreasonably conjecture that from his name he gave it that of Cainon.  Thus,\nafter his example, most other founders of towns have given them their\nnames:  Athena, that's Minerva in Greek, to Athens; Alexander to\nAlexandria; Constantine to Constantinople; Pompey to Pompeiopolis in\nCilicia; Adrian to Adrianople; Canaan, to the Canaanites; Saba, to the\nSabaeans; Assur, to the Assyrians; and so Ptolemais, Caesarea, Tiberias,\nand Herodium in Judaea got their names.\n\nWhile we were thus talking, there came to us the great flask whom our\nlantern called the philosopher, her holiness the Bottle's governor.  He was\nattended with a troop of the temple-guards, all French bottles in wicker\narmour; and seeing us with our javelins wrapped with ivy, with our\nillustrious lantern, whom he knew, he desired us to come in with all manner\nof safety, and ordered we should be immediately conducted to the Princess\nBacbuc, the Bottle's lady of honour, and priestess of all the mysteries;\nwhich was done.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXVI.\n\nHow we went down the tetradic steps, and of Panurge's fear.\n\nWe went down one marble step under ground, where there was a resting, or,\nas our workmen call it, a landing-place; then, turning to the left, we went\ndown two other steps, where there was another resting-place; after that we\ncame to three other steps, turning about, and met a third; and the like at\nfour steps which we met afterwards.  There quoth Panurge, Is it here?  How\nmany steps have you told? asked our magnificent lantern.  One, two, three,\nfour, answered Pantagruel.  How much is that? asked she.  Ten, returned he.\nMultiply that, said she, according to the same Pythagorical tetrad.  That\nis, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, cried Pantagruel.  How much is the whole?\nsaid she.  One hundred, answered Pantagruel.  Add, continued she, the first\ncube--that's eight.  At the end of that fatal number you'll find the temple\ngate; and pray observe, this is the true psychogony of Plato, so celebrated\nby the Academics, yet so little understood; one moiety of which consists of\nthe unity of the two first numbers full of two square and two cubic\nnumbers.  We then went down those numerical stairs, all under ground, and I\ncan assure you, in the first place, that our legs stood us in good stead;\nfor had it not been for 'em, we had rolled just like so many hogsheads into\na vault.  Secondly, our radiant lantern gave us just so much light as is in\nSt. Patrick's hole in Ireland, or Trophonius's pit in Boeotia; which caused\nPanurge to say to her, after we had got down some seventy-eight steps:\n\nDear madam, with a sorrowful, aching heart, I most humbly beseech your\nlanternship to lead us back.  May I be led to hell if I be not half dead\nwith fear; my heart is sunk down into my hose; I am afraid I shall make\nbuttered eggs in my breeches.  I freely consent never to marry.  You have\ngiven yourself too much trouble on my account.  The Lord shall reward you\nin his great rewarder; neither will I be ungrateful when I come out of this\ncave of Troglodytes.  Let's go back, I pray you.  I'm very much afraid this\nis Taenarus, the low way to hell, and methinks I already hear Cerberus\nbark.  Hark! I hear the cur, or my ears tingle.  I have no manner of\nkindness for the dog, for there never is a greater toothache than when dogs\nbite us by the shins.  And if this be only Trophonius's pit, the lemures,\nhobthrushes, and goblins will certainly swallow us alive, just as they\ndevoured formerly one of Demetrius's halberdiers for want of bridles.  Art\nthou here, Friar John?  Prithee, dear, dear cod, stay by me; I'm almost\ndead with fear.  Hast thou got thy bilbo?  Alas! poor pilgarlic's\ndefenceless.  I'm a naked man, thou knowest; let's go back.  Zoons, fear\nnothing, cried Friar John; I'm by thee, and have thee fast by the collar;\neighteen devils shan't get thee out of my clutches, though I were unarmed.\nNever did a man yet want weapons who had a good arm with as stout a heart.\nHeaven would sooner send down a shower of them; even as in Provence, in the\nfields of La Crau, near Mariannes, there rained stones (they are there to\nthis day) to help Hercules, who otherwise wanted wherewithal to fight\nNeptune's two bastards.  But whither are we bound?  Are we a-going to the\nlittle children's limbo?  By Pluto, they'll bepaw and conskite us all.  Or\nare we going to hell for orders?  By cob's body, I'll hamper, bethwack, and\nbelabour all the devils, now I have some vine-leaves in my shoes.  Thou\nshalt see me lay about me like mad, old boy.  Which way? where the devil\nare they?  I fear nothing but their damned horns; but cuckoldy Panurge's\nbull-feather will altogether secure me from 'em.  Lo! in a prophetic spirit\nI already see him, like another Actaeon, horned, horny, hornified.\nPrithee, quoth Panurge, take heed thyself, dear frater, lest, till monks\nhave leave to marry, thou weddest something thou dostn't like, as some\ncat-o'-nine-tails or the quartan ague; if thou dost, may I never come safe\nand sound out of this hypogeum, this subterranean cave, if I don't tup and\nram that disease merely for the sake of making thee a cornuted, corniferous\nproperty; otherwise I fancy the quartan ague is but an indifferent\nbedfellow.  I remember Gripe-men-all threatened to wed thee to some such\nthing; for which thou calledest him heretic.\n\nHere our splendid lantern interrupted them, letting us know this was the\nplace where we were to have a taste of the creature, and be silent; bidding\nus not despair of having the word of the Bottle before we went back, since\nwe had lined our shoes with vine-leaves.\n\nCome on then, cried Panurge, let's charge through and through all the\ndevils of hell; we can but perish, and that's soon done.  However, I\nthought to have reserved my life for some mighty battle.  Move, move, move\nforwards; I am as stout as Hercules, my breeches are full of courage; my\nheart trembles a little, I own, but that's only an effect of the coldness\nand dampness of this vault; 'tis neither fear nor ague.  Come on, move on,\npiss, pish, push on.  My name's William Dreadnought.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXVII.\n\nHow the temple gates in a wonderful manner opened of themselves.\n\nAfter we were got down the steps, we came to a portal of fine jasper, of\nDoric order, on whose front we read this sentence in the finest gold,\nEN OINO ALETHEIA--that is, In wine truth.  The gates were of\nCorinthian-like brass, massy, wrought with little vine-branches, finely\nembossed and engraven, and were equally joined and closed together in their\nmortise without padlock, key-chain, or tie whatsoever.  Where they joined,\nthere hanged an Indian loadstone as big as an Egyptian bean, set in gold,\nhaving two points, hexagonal, in a right line; and on each side, towards the\nwall, hung a handful of scordium (garlic germander).\n\nThere our noble lantern desired us not to take it amiss that she went no\nfarther with us, leaving us wholly to the conduct of the priestess Bacbuc;\nfor she herself was not allowed to go in, for certain causes rather to be\nconcealed than revealed to mortals.  However, she advised us to be resolute\nand secure, and to trust to her for the return.  She then pulled the\nloadstone that hung at the folding of the gates, and threw it into a silver\nbox fixed for that purpose; which done, from the threshold of each gate she\ndrew a twine of crimson silk about nine feet long, by which the scordium\nhung, and having fastened it to two gold buckles that hung at the sides,\nshe withdrew.\n\nImmediately the gates flew open without being touched; not with a creaking\nor loud harsh noise like that made by heavy brazen gates, but with a soft\npleasing murmur that resounded through the arches of the temple.\n\nPantagruel soon knew the cause of it, having discovered a small cylinder or\nroller that joined the gates over the threshold, and, turning like them\ntowards the wall on a hard well-polished ophites stone, with rubbing and\nrolling caused that harmonious murmur.\n\nI wondered how the gates thus opened of themselves to the right and left,\nand after we were all got in, I cast my eye between the gates and the wall\nto endeavour to know how this happened; for one would have thought our kind\nlantern had put between the gates the herb aethiopis, which they say opens\nsome things that are shut.  But I perceived that the parts of the gates\nthat joined on the inside were covered with steel, and just where the said\ngates touched when they were opened I saw two square Indian loadstones of a\nbluish hue, well polished, and half a span broad, mortised in the temple\nwall.  Now, by the hidden and admirable power of the loadstones, the steel\nplates were put into motion, and consequently the gates were slowly drawn;\nhowever, not always, but when the said loadstone on the outside was\nremoved, after which the steel was freed from its power, the two bunches of\nscordium being at the same time put at some distance, because it deadens\nthe magnes and robs it of its attractive virtue.\n\nOn the loadstone that was placed on the right side the following iambic\nverse was curiously engraven in ancient Roman characters:\n\n  Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.\n\n  Fate leads the willing, and th' unwilling draws.\n\nThe following sentence was neatly cut in the loadstone that was on the\nleft:\n\n    ALL THINGS TEND TO THEIR END.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXVIII.\n\nOf the Temple's admirable pavement.\n\nWhen I had read those inscriptions, I admired the beauty of the temple, and\nparticularly the disposition of its pavement, with which no work that is\nnow, or has been under the cope of heaven, can justly be compared; not that\nof the Temple of Fortune at Praeneste in Sylla's time, or the pavement of\nthe Greeks, called asarotum, laid by Sosistratus at Pergamus.  For this\nhere was wholly in compartments of precious stones, all in their natural\ncolours: one of red jasper, most charmingly spotted; another of ophites; a\nthird of porphyry; a fourth of lycophthalmy, a stone of four different\ncolours, powdered with sparks of gold as small as atoms; a fifth of agate,\nstreaked here and there with small milk-coloured waves; a sixth of costly\nchalcedony or onyx-stone; and another of green jasper, with certain red and\nyellowish veins.  And all these were disposed in a diagonal line.\n\nAt the portico some small stones were inlaid and evenly joined on the\nfloor, all in their native colours, to embellish the design of the figures;\nand they were ordered in such a manner that you would have thought some\nvine-leaves and branches had been carelessly strewed on the pavement; for\nin some places they were thick, and thin in others.  That inlaying was very\nwonderful everywhere.  Here were seen, as it were in the shade, some snails\ncrawling on the grapes; there, little lizards running on the branches.  On\nthis side were grapes that seemed yet greenish; on another, some clusters\nthat seemed full ripe, so like the true that they could as easily have\ndeceived starlings and other birds as those which Zeuxis drew.\n\nNay, we ourselves were deceived; for where the artist seemed to have\nstrewed the vine-branches thickest, we could not forbear walking with great\nstrides lest we should entangle our feet, just as people go over an unequal\nstony place.\n\nI then cast my eyes on the roof and walls of the temple, that were all\npargetted with porphyry and mosaic work, which from the left side at the\ncoming in most admirably represented the battle in which the good Bacchus\noverthrew the Indians; as followeth.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XXXIX.\n\nHow we saw Bacchus's army drawn up in battalia in mosaic work.\n\nAt the beginning, divers towns, hamlets, castles, fortresses, and forests\nwere seen in flames; and several mad and loose women, who furiously ripped\nup and tore live calves, sheep, and lambs limb from limb, and devoured\ntheir flesh.  There we learned how Bacchus, at his coming into India,\ndestroyed all things with fire and sword.\n\nNotwithstanding this, he was so despised by the Indians that they did not\nthink it worth their while to stop his progress, having been certainly\ninformed by their spies that his camp was destitute of warriors, and that\nhe had only with him a crew of drunken females, a low-built, old,\neffeminate, sottish fellow, continually addled, and as drunk as a\nwheelbarrow, with a pack of young clownish doddipolls, stark naked, always\nskipping and frisking up and down, with tails and horns like those of young\nkids.\n\nFor this reason the Indians had resolved to let them go through their\ncountry without the least opposition, esteeming a victory over such enemies\nmore dishonourable than glorious.\n\nIn the meantime Bacchus marched on, burning everything; for, as you know,\nfire and thunder are his paternal arms, Jupiter having saluted his mother\nSemele with his thunder, so that his maternal house was ruined by fire.\nBacchus also caused a great deal of blood to be spilt; which, when he is\nroused and angered, principally in war, is as natural to him as to make\nsome in time of peace.\n\nThus the plains of the island of Samos are called Panema, which signifies\nbloody, because Bacchus there overtook the Amazons, who fled from the\ncountry of Ephesus, and there let 'em blood, so that they all died of\nphlebotomy.  This may give you a better insight into the meaning of an\nancient proverb than Aristotle has done in his problems, viz., Why 'twas\nformerly said, Neither eat nor sow any mint in time of war.  The reason is,\nthat blows are given then without any distinction of parts or persons, and\nif a man that's wounded has that day handled or eaten any mint, 'tis\nimpossible, or at least very hard, to stanch his blood.\n\nAfter this, Bacchus was seen marching in battalia, riding in a stately\nchariot drawn by six young leopards.  He looked as young as a child, to\nshow that all good topers never grow old.  He was as red as a cherry, or a\ncherub, which you please, and had no more hair on his chin than there's in\nthe inside of my hand.  His forehead was graced with pointed horns, above\nwhich he wore a fine crown or garland of vine-leaves and grapes, and a\nmitre of crimson velvet, having also gilt buskins on.\n\nHe had not one man with him that looked like a man; his guards and all his\nforces consisted wholly of Bassarides, Evantes, Euhyades, Edonides,\nTrietherides, Ogygiae, Mimallonides, Maenades, Thyades, and Bacchae,\nfrantic, raving, raging, furious, mad women, begirt with live snakes and\nserpents instead of girdles, dishevelled, their hair flowing about their\nshoulders, with garlands of vine-branches instead of forehead-cloths, clad\nwith stag's or goat's skins, and armed with torches, javelins, spears, and\nhalberds whose ends were like pineapples.  Besides, they had certain small\nlight bucklers that gave a loud sound if you touched 'em never so little,\nand these served them instead of drums.  They were just seventy-nine\nthousand two hundred and twenty-seven.\n\nSilenus, who led the van, was one on whom Bacchus relied very much, having\nformerly had many proofs of his valour and conduct.  He was a diminutive,\nstooping, palsied, plump, gorbellied old fellow, with a swingeing pair of\nstiff-standing lugs of his own, a sharp Roman nose, large rough eyebrows,\nmounted on a well-hung ass.  In his fist he held a staff to lean upon, and\nalso bravely to fight whenever he had occasion to alight; and he was\ndressed in a woman's yellow gown.  His followers were all young, wild,\nclownish people, as hornified as so many kids and as fell as so many\ntigers, naked, and perpetually singing and dancing country-dances.  They\nwere called tityri and satyrs, and were in all eighty-five thousand one\nhundred and thirty-three.\n\nPan, who brought up the rear, was a monstrous sort of a thing; for his\nlower parts were like a goat's, his thighs hairy, and his horns bolt\nupright; a crimson fiery phiz, and a beard that was none of the shortest.\nHe was a bold, stout, daring, desperate fellow, very apt to take pepper in\nthe nose for yea and nay.\n\nIn his left hand he held a pipe, and a crooked stick in his right.  His\nforces consisted also wholly of satyrs, aegipanes, agripanes, sylvans,\nfauns, lemures, lares, elves, and hobgoblins, and their number was\nseventy-eight thousand one hundred and fourteen.  The signal or word\ncommon to all the army was Evohe.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XL.\n\nHow the battle in which the good Bacchus overthrew the Indians was\nrepresented in mosaic work.\n\nIn the next place we saw the representation of the good Bacchus's\nengagement with the Indians.  Silenus, who led the van, was sweating,\npuffing, and blowing, belabouring his ass most grievously.  The ass\ndreadfully opened its wide jaws, drove away the flies that plagued it,\nwinced, flounced, went back, and bestirred itself in a most terrible\nmanner, as if some damned gad-bee had stung it at the breech.\n\nThe satyrs, captains, sergeants, and corporals of companies, sounding the\norgies with cornets, in a furious manner went round the army, skipping,\ncapering, bounding, jerking, farting, flying out at heels, kicking and\nprancing like mad, encouraging their companions to fight bravely; and all\nthe delineated army cried out Evohe!\n\nFirst, the Maenades charged the Indians with dreadful shouts, and a horrid\ndin of their brazen drums and bucklers; the air rung again all around, as\nthe mosaic work well expressed it.  And pray for the future don't so much\nadmire Apelles, Aristides the Theban, and others who drew claps of thunder,\nlightnings, winds, words, manners, and spirits.\n\nWe then saw the Indian army, who had at last taken the field to prevent the\ndevastation of the rest of their country.  In the front were the elephants,\nwith castles well garrisoned on their backs.  But the army and themselves\nwere put into disorder; the dreadful cries of the Bacchae having filled\nthem with consternation, and those huge animals turned tail and trampled on\nthe men of their party.\n\nThere you might have seen gaffer Silenus on his ass, putting on as hard as\nhe could, striking athwart and alongst, and laying about him lustily with\nhis staff after the old fashion of fencing.  His ass was prancing and\nmaking after the elephants, gaping and martially braying, as it were to\nsound a charge, as he did when formerly in the Bacchanalian feasts he waked\nthe nymph Lottis, when Priapus, full of priapism, had a mind to priapize\nwhile the pretty creature was taking a nap.\n\nThere you might have seen Pan frisk it with his goatish shanks about the\nMaenades, and with his rustic pipe excite them to behave themselves like\nMaenades.\n\nA little further you might have blessed your eyes with the sight of a young\nsatyr who led seventeen kings his prisoners; and a Bacchis, who with her\nsnakes hauled along no less than two and forty captains; a little faun, who\ncarried a whole dozen of standards taken from the enemy; and goodman\nBacchus on his chariot, riding to and fro fearless of danger, making much\nof his dear carcass, and cheerfully toping to all his merry friends.\n\nFinally, we saw the representation of his triumph, which was thus:  first,\nhis chariot was wholly lined with ivy gathered on the mountain Meros; this\nfor its scarcity, which you know raises the price of everything, and\nprincipally of those leaves in India.  In this Alexander the Great followed\nhis example at his Indian triumph.  The chariot was drawn by elephants\njoined together, wherein he was imitated by Pompey the Great at Rome in his\nAfrican triumph.  The good Bacchus was seen drinking out of a mighty urn,\nwhich action Marius aped after his victory over the Cimbri near Aix in\nProvence.  All his army were crowned with ivy; their javelins, bucklers,\nand drums were also wholly covered with it; there was not so much as\nSilenus's ass but was betrapped with it.\n\nThe Indian kings were fastened with chains of gold close by the wheels of\nthe chariot.  All the company marched in pomp with unspeakable joy, loaded\nwith an infinite number of trophies, pageants, and spoils, playing and\nsinging merry epiniciums, songs of triumph, and also rural lays and\ndithyrambs.\n\nAt the farthest end was a prospect of the land of Egypt; the Nile with its\ncrocodiles, marmosets, ibides, monkeys, trochiloses, or wrens, ichneumons,\nor Pharoah's mice, hippopotami, or sea-horses, and other creatures, its\nguests and neighbours.  Bacchus was moving towards that country under the\nconduct of a couple of horned beasts, on one of which was written in gold,\nApis, and Osiris on the other; because no ox or cow had been seen in Egypt\ntill Bacchus came thither.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLI.\n\nHow the temple was illuminated with a wonderful lamp.\n\nBefore I proceed to the description of the Bottle, I'll give you that of an\nadmirable lamp that dispensed so large a light over all the temple that,\nthough it lay underground, we could distinguish every object as clearly as\nabove it at noonday.\n\nIn the middle of the roof was fixed a ring of massive gold, as thick as my\nclenched fist.  Three chains somewhat less, most curiously wrought, hung\nabout two feet and a half below it, and in a triangle supported a round\nplate of fine gold whose diameter or breadth did not exceed two cubits and\nhalf a span.  There were four holes in it, in each of which an empty ball\nwas fastened, hollow within, and open o' top, like a little lamp; its\ncircumference about two hands' breadth.  Each ball was of precious stone;\none an amethyst, another an African carbuncle, the third an opal, and the\nfourth an anthracites.  They were full of burning water five times\ndistilled in a serpentine limbec, and inconsumptible, like the oil formerly\nput into Pallas' golden lamp at Acropolis of Athens by Callimachus.  In\neach of them was a flaming wick, partly of asbestine flax, as of old in the\ntemple of Jupiter Ammon, such as those which Cleombrotus, a most studious\nphilosopher, saw, and partly of Carpasian flax (Ozell's correction.\nMotteux reads, 'which Cleombrotus, a most studious philosopher, and\nPandelinus of Carpasium had, which were,' &c.), which were rather renewed\nthan consumed by the fire.\n\nAbout two foot and a half below that gold plate, the three chains were\nfastened to three handles that were fixed to a large round lamp of most\npure crystal, whose diameter was a cubit and a half, and opened about two\nhands' breadths o' top; by which open place a vessel of the same crystal,\nshaped somewhat like the lower part of a gourd-like limbec, or an urinal,\nwas put at the bottom of the great lamp, with such a quantity of the\nafore-mentioned burning water, that the flame of the asbestine wick reached\nthe centre of the great lamp.  This made all its spherical body seem to burn\nand be in a flame, because the fire was just at the centre and middle point,\nso that it was not more easy to fix the eye on it than on the disc of the\nsun, the matter being wonderfully bright and shining, and the work most\ntransparent and dazzling by the reflection of the various colours of the\nprecious stones whereof the four small lamps above the main lamp were made,\nand their lustre was still variously glittering all over the temple. Then\nthis wandering light being darted on the polished marble and agate with\nwhich all the inside of the temple was pargetted, our eyes were entertained\nwith a sight of all the admirable colours which the rainbow can boast when\nthe sun darts his fiery rays on some dropping clouds.\n\nThe design of the lamp was admirable in itself, but, in my opinion, what\nadded much to the beauty of the whole, was that round the body of the\ncrystal lamp there was carved in cataglyphic work a lively and pleasant\nbattle of naked boys, mounted on little hobby-horses, with little whirligig\nlances and shields that seemed made of vine-branches with grapes on them;\ntheir postures generally were very different, and their childish strife and\nmotions were so ingeniously expressed that art equalled nature in every\nproportion and action.  Neither did this seem engraved, but rather hewed\nout and embossed in relief, or at least like grotesque, which, by the\nartist's skill, has the appearance of the roundness of the object it\nrepresents.  This was partly the effect of the various and most charming\nlight, which, flowing out of the lamp, filled the carved places with its\nglorious rays.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLII ('This and the next chapter make really but one, tho' Mr.\nMotteux has made two of them; the first of which contains but eight lines,\naccording to him, and ends at the words fantastic fountain.'--Ozell.).\n\nHow the Priestess Bacbuc showed us a fantastic fountain in the temple, and\nhow the fountain-water had the taste of wine, according to the imagination\nof those who drank of it.\n\nWhile we were admiring this incomparable lamp and the stupendous structure\nof the temple, the venerable priestess Bacbuc and her attendants came to us\nwith jolly smiling looks, and seeing us duly accoutred, without the least\ndifficulty took us into the middle of the temple, where, just under the\naforesaid lamp, was the fine fantastic fountain.  She then ordered some\ncups, goblets, and talboys of gold, silver, and crystal to be brought, and\nkindly invited us to drink of the liquor that sprung there, which we\nreadily did; for, to say the truth, this fantastic fountain was very\ninviting, and its materials and workmanship more precious, rare, and\nadmirable than anything Plato ever dreamt of in limbo.\n\nIts basis or groundwork was of most pure and limpid alabaster, and its\nheight somewhat more than three spans, being a regular heptagon on the\noutside, with its stylobates or footsteps, arulets, cymasults or blunt\ntops, and Doric undulations about it.  It was exactly round within.  On the\nmiddle point of each angle brink stood a pillar orbiculated in form of\nivory or alabaster solid rings.  These were seven in number, according to\nthe number of the angles (This sentence, restored by Ozell, is omitted by\nMotteux.).\n\nEach pillar's length from the basis to the architraves was near seven\nhands, taking an exact dimension of its diameter through the centre of its\ncircumference and inward roundness; and it was so disposed that, casting\nour eyes behind one of them, whatever its cube might be, to view its\nopposite, we found that the pyramidal cone of our visual line ended at the\nsaid centre, and there, by the two opposites, formed an equilateral\ntriangle whose two lines divided the pillar into two equal parts.\n\nThat which we had a mind to measure, going from one side to another, two\npillars over, at the first third part of the distance between them, was met\nby their lowermost and fundamental line, which, in a consult line drawn as\nfar as the universal centre, equally divided, gave, in a just partition,\nthe distance of the seven opposite pillars in a right line, beginning at\nthe obtuse angle on the brink, as you know that an angle is always found\nplaced between two others in all angular figures odd in number.\n\nThis tacitly gave us to understand that seven semidiameters are in\ngeometrical proportion, compass, and distance somewhat less than the\ncircumference of a circle, from the figure of which they are extracted;\nthat is to say, three whole parts, with an eighth and a half, a little\nmore, or a seventh and a half, a little less, according to the instructions\ngiven us of old by Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes, and others.\n\nThe first pillar, I mean that which faced the temple gate, was of azure,\nsky-coloured sapphire.\n\nThe second, of hyacinth, a precious stone exactly of the colour of the\nflower into which Ajax's choleric blood was transformed; the Greek letters\nA I being seen on it in many places.\n\nThe third, an anachite diamond, as bright and glittering as lightning.\n\nThe fourth, a masculine ruby balas (peach-coloured) amethystizing, its\nflame and lustre ending in violet or purple like an amethyst.\n\nThe fifth, an emerald, above five hundred and fifty times more precious\nthan that of Serapis in the labyrinth of the Egyptians, and more verdant\nand shining than those that were fixed, instead of eyes, in the marble\nlion's head near King Hermias's tomb.\n\nThe sixth, of agate, more admirable and various in the distinctions of its\nveins, clouds, and colours than that which Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, so\nmightily esteemed.\n\nThe seventh, of syenites, transparent, of the colour of a beryl and the\nclear hue of Hymetian honey; and within it the moon was seen, such as we\nsee it in the sky, silent, full, new, and in the wane.\n\nThese stones were assigned to the seven heavenly planets by the ancient\nChaldaeans; and that the meanest capacities might be informed of this, just\nat the central perpendicular line, on the chapter of the first pillar,\nwhich was of sapphire, stood the image of Saturn in elutian (Motteux reads\n'Eliacim.') lead, with his scythe in his hand, and at his feet a crane of\ngold, very artfully enamelled, according to the native hue of the saturnine\nbird.\n\nOn the second, which was of hyacinth, towards the left, Jupiter was seen in\njovetian brass, and on his breast an eagle of gold enamelled to the life.\n\nOn the third was Phoebus of the purest gold, and a white cock in his right\nhand.\n\nOn the fourth was Mars in Corinthian brass, and a lion at his feet.\n\nOn the fifth was Venus in copper, the metal of which Aristonides made\nAthamas's statue, that expressed in a blushing whiteness his confusion at\nthe sight of his son Learchus, who died at his feet of a fall.\n\nOn the sixth was Mercury in hydrargyre.  I would have said quicksilver, had\nit not been fixed, malleable, and unmovable.  That nimble deity had a stork\nat his feet.\n\nOn the seventh was the Moon in silver, with a greyhound at her feet.\n\nThe size of these statues was somewhat more than a third part of the\npillars on which they stood, and they were so admirably wrought according\nto mathematical proportion that Polycletus's canon could hardly have stood\nin competition with them.\n\nThe bases of the pillars, the chapters, the architraves, zoophores, and\ncornices were Phrygian work of massive gold, purer and finer than any that\nis found in the rivers Leede near Montpellier, Ganges in India, Po in\nItaly, Hebrus in Thrace, Tagus in Spain, and Pactolus in Lydia.\n\nThe small arches between the pillars were of the same precious stone of\nwhich the pillars next to them were.  Thus, that arch was of sapphire which\nended at the hyacinth pillar, and that was of hyacinth which went towards\nthe diamond, and so on.\n\nAbove the arches and chapters of the pillars, on the inward front, a cupola\nwas raised to cover the fountain.  It was surrounded by the planetary\nstatues, heptagonal at the bottom, and spherical o' top, and of crystal so\npure, transparent, well-polished, whole and uniform in all its parts,\nwithout veins, clouds, flaws, or streaks, that Xenocrates never saw such a\none in his life.\n\nWithin it were seen the twelve signs of the zodiac, the twelve months of\nthe year, with their properties, the two equinoxes, the ecliptic line, with\nsome of the most remarkable fixed stars about the antartic pole and\nelsewhere, so curiously engraven that I fancied them to be the workmanship\nof King Necepsus, or Petosiris, the ancient mathematician.\n\nOn the top of the cupola, just over the centre of the fountain, were three\nnoble long pearls, all of one size, pear fashion, perfectly imitating a\ntear, and so joined together as to represent a flower-de-luce or lily, each\nof the flowers seeming above a hand's breadth.  A carbuncle jetted out of\nits calyx or cup as big as an ostrich's egg, cut seven square (that number\nso beloved of nature), and so prodigiously glorious that the sight of it\nhad like to have made us blind, for the fiery sun or the pointed lightning\nare not more dazzling and unsufferably bright.\n\nNow, were some judicious appraisers to judge of the value of this\nincomparable fountain, and the lamp of which we have spoke, they would\nundoubtedly affirm it exceeds that of all the treasures and curiosities in\nEurope, Asia, and Africa put together.  For that carbuncle alone would have\ndarkened the pantarbe of Iarchus (Motteux reads 'Joachas.') the Indian\nmagician, with as much ease as the sun outshines and dims the stars with\nhis meridian rays.\n\nNor let Cleopatra, that Egyptian queen, boast of her pair of pendants,\nthose two pearls, one of which she caused to be dissolved in vinegar, in\nthe presence of Antony the Triumvir, her gallant.\n\nOr let Pompeia Plautina be proud of her dress covered all over with\nemeralds and pearls curiously intermixed, she who attracted the eyes of all\nRome, and was said to be the pit and magazine of the conquering robbers of\nthe universe.\n\nThe fountain had three tubes or channels of right pearl, seated in three\nequilateral angles already mentioned, extended on the margin, and those\nchannels proceeded in a snail-like line, winding equally on both sides.\n\nWe looked on them a while, and had cast our eyes on another side, when\nBacbuc directed us to watch the water.  We then heard a most harmonious\nsound, yet somewhat stopped by starts, far distant, and subterranean, by\nwhich means it was still more pleasing than if it had been free,\nuninterrupted, and near us, so that our minds were as agreeably entertained\nthrough our ears with that charming melody as they were through the windows\nof our eyes with those delightful objects.\n\nBacbuc then said, Your philosophers will not allow that motion is begot by\nthe power of figures; look here, and see the contrary.  By that single\nsnail-like motion, equally divided as you see, and a fivefold infoliature,\nmovable at every inward meeting, such as is the vena cava where it enters\ninto the right ventricle of the heart; just so is the flowing of this\nfountain, and by it a harmony ascends as high as your world's ocean.\n\nShe then ordered her attendants to make us drink; and, to tell you the\ntruth of the matter as near as possible, we are not, heaven be praised! of\nthe nature of a drove of calf-lollies, who (as your sparrows can't feed\nunless you bob them on the tail) must be rib-roasted with tough crabtree\nand firked into a stomach, or at least into an humour to eat or drink.  No,\nwe know better things, and scorn to scorn any man's civility who civilly\ninvites us to a drinking bout.  Bacbuc asked us then how we liked our tiff.\nWe answered that it seemed to us good harmless sober Adam's liquor, fit to\nkeep a man in the right way, and, in a word, mere element; more cool and\nclear than Argyrontes in Aetolia, Peneus in Thessaly, Axius in Mygdonia, or\nCydnus in Cilicia, a tempting sight of whose cool silver stream caused\nAlexander to prefer the short-lived pleasure of bathing himself in it to\nthe inconveniences which he could not but foresee would attend so\nill-termed an action.\n\nThis, said Bacbuc, comes of not considering with ourselves, or\nunderstanding the motions of the musculous tongue, when the drink glides on\nit in its way to the stomach.  Tell me, noble strangers, are your throats\nlined, paved, or enamelled, as formerly was that of Pithyllus, nicknamed\nTheutes, that you can have missed the taste, relish, and flavour of this\ndivine liquor?  Here, said she, turning towards her gentlewomen, bring my\nscrubbing-brushes, you know which, to scrape, rake, and clear their\npalates.\n\nThey brought immediately some stately, swingeing, jolly hams, fine\nsubstantial neat's tongues, good hung-beef, pure and delicate botargos,\nvenison, sausages, and such other gullet-sweepers.  And, to comply with her\ninvitation, we crammed and twisted till we owned ourselves thoroughly cured\nof thirst, which before did damnably plague us.\n\nWe are told, continued she, that formerly a learned and valiant Hebrew\nchief, leading his people through the deserts, where they were in danger of\nbeing famished, obtained of God some manna, whose taste was to them, by\nimagination, such as that of meat was to them before in reality; thus,\ndrinking of this miraculous liquor, you'll find it taste like any wine that\nyou shall fancy you drink.  Come, then, fancy and drink.  We did so, and\nPanurge had no sooner whipped off his brimmer but he cried, By Noah's open\nshop, 'tis vin de Beaune, better than ever was yet tipped over tongue, or\nmay ninety-six devils swallow me.  Oh! that to keep its taste the longer,\nwe gentlemen topers had but necks some three cubits long or so, as\nPhiloxenus desired to have, or, at least, like a crane's, as Melanthius\nwished his.\n\nOn the faith of true lanterners, quoth Friar John, 'tis gallant, sparkling\nGreek wine.  Now, for God's sake, sweetheart, do but teach me how the devil\nyou make it.  It seems to me Mirevaux wine, said Pantagruel; for before I\ndrank I supposed it to be such.  Nothing can be misliked in it, but that\n'tis cold; colder, I say, than the very ice; colder than the Nonacrian and\nDercean (Motteux reads 'Deraen.') water, or the Conthoporian (Motteux,\n'Conthopian.') spring at Corinth, that froze up the stomach and nutritive\nparts of those that drank of it.\n\nDrink once, twice, or thrice more, said Bacbuc, still changing your\nimagination, and you shall find its taste and flavour to be exactly that on\nwhich you shall have pitched.  Then never presume to say that anything is\nimpossible to God.  We never offered to say such a thing, said I; far from\nit, we maintain he is omnipotent.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLIII.\n\nHow the Priestess Bacbuc equipped Panurge in order to have the word of the\nBottle.\n\nWhen we had thus chatted and tippled, Bacbuc asked, Who of you here would\nhave the word of the Bottle?  I, your most humble little funnel, an't\nplease you, quoth Panurge.  Friend, saith she, I have but one thing to tell\nyou, which is, that when you come to the Oracle, you take care to hearken\nand hear the word only with one ear.  This, cried Friar John, is wine of\none ear, as Frenchmen call it.\n\nShe then wrapped him up in a gaberdine, bound his noddle with a goodly\nclean biggin, clapped over it a felt such as those through which hippocras\nis distilled, at the bottom of which, instead of a cowl, she put three\nobelisks, made him draw on a pair of old-fashioned codpieces instead of\nmittens, girded him about with three bagpipes bound together, bathed his\njobbernowl thrice in the fountain; then threw a handful of meal on his\nphiz, fixed three cock's feathers on the right side of the hippocratical\nfelt, made him take a jaunt nine times round the fountain, caused him to\ntake three little leaps and to bump his a-- seven times against the ground,\nrepeating I don't know what kind of conjurations all the while in the\nTuscan tongue, and ever and anon reading in a ritual or book of ceremonies,\ncarried after her by one of her mystagogues.\n\nFor my part, may I never stir if I don't really believe that neither Numa\nPompilius, the second King of the Romans, nor the Cerites of Tuscia, and\nthe old Hebrew captain ever instituted so many ceremonies as I then saw\nperformed; nor were ever half so many religious forms used by the\nsoothsayers of Memphis in Egypt to Apis, or by the Euboeans, at Rhamnus\n(Motteux gives 'or by the Embrians, or at Rhamnus.'), to Rhamnusia, or to\nJupiter Ammon, or to Feronia.\n\nWhen she had thus accoutred my gentleman, she took him out of our company,\nand led him out of the temple, through a golden gate on the right, into a\nround chapel made of transparent speculary stones, by whose solid clearness\nthe sun's light shined there through the precipice of the rock without any\nwindows or other entrance, and so easily and fully dispersed itself through\nthe greater temple that the light seemed rather to spring out of it than to\nflow into it.\n\nThe workmanship was not less rare than that of the sacred temple at\nRavenna, or that in the island of Chemnis in Egypt.  Nor must I forget to\ntell you that the work of that round chapel was contrived with such a\nsymmetry that its diameter was just the height of the vault.\n\nIn the middle of it was an heptagonal fountain of fine alabaster most\nartfully wrought, full of water, which was so clear that it might have\npassed for element in its purity and singleness.  The sacred Bottle was in\nit to the middle, clad in pure fine crystal of an oval shape, except its\nmuzzle, which was somewhat wider than was consistent with that figure.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLIV.\n\nHow Bacbuc, the high-priestess, brought Panurge before the Holy Bottle.\n\nThere the noble priestess Bacbuc made Panurge stoop and kiss the brink of\nthe fountain; then bade him rise and dance three ithymbi ('Dances in the\nhonour of Bacchus.'--Motteux.).  Which done, she ordered him to sit down\nbetween two stools placed there for that purpose, his arse upon the ground.\nThen she opened her ceremonial book, and, whispering in his left ear, made\nhim sing an epileny, inserted here in the figure of the bottle.\n\n    Bottle, whose Mysterious Deep\n  Do's ten thousand Secrets keep,\n  With attentive Ear I wait;\n  Ease my Mind, and speak my Fate.\n  Soul of Joy!  Like Bacchus, we\n  More than India gain by thee.\n  Truths unborn thy Juice reveals,\n  Which Futurity conceals.\n  Antidote to Frauds and Lies,\n  Wine, that mounts us to the Skies,\n  May thy Father Noah's Brood\n  Like him drown, but in thy Flood.\n  Speak, so may the Liquid Mine\n  Of Rubies, or of Diamonds shine.\n    Bottle, whose Mysterious Deep\n  Do's ten thousand Secrets keep,\n  With attentive Ear I wait;\n  Ease my Mind, and speak my Fate.\n\nWhen Panurge had sung, Bacbuc threw I don't know what into the fountain,\nand straight its water began to boil in good earnest, just for the world as\ndoth the great monastical pot at Bourgueil when 'tis high holiday there.\nFriend Panurge was listening with one ear, and Bacbuc kneeled by him, when\nsuch a kind of humming was heard out of the Bottle as is made by a swarm of\nbees bred in the flesh of a young bull killed and dressed according to\nAristaeus's art, or such as is made when a bolt flies out of a crossbow, or\nwhen a shower falls on a sudden in summer.  Immediately after this was\nheard the word Trinc.  By cob's body, cried Panurge, 'tis broken, or\ncracked at least, not to tell a lie for the matter; for even so do crystal\nbottles speak in our country when they burst near the fire.\n\nBacbuc arose, and gently taking Panurge under the arms, said, Friend, offer\nyour thanks to indulgent heaven, as reason requires.  You have soon had the\nword of the Goddess-Bottle; and the kindest, most favourable, and certain\nword of answer that I ever yet heard her give since I officiated here at\nher most sacred oracle.  Rise, let us go to the chapter, in whose gloss\nthat fine word is explained.  With all my heart, quoth Panurge; by jingo, I\nam just as wise as I was last year.  Light, where's the book?  Turn it\nover, where's the chapter?  Let's see this merry gloss.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLV.\n\nHow Bacbuc explained the word of the Goddess-Bottle.\n\nBacbuc having thrown I don't know what into the fountain, straight the\nwater ceased to boil; and then she took Panurge into the greater temple, in\nthe central place, where there was the enlivening fountain.\n\nThere she took out a hugeous silver book, in the shape of a half-tierce, or\nhogshead, of sentences, and, having filled it at the fountain, said to him,\nThe philosophers, preachers, and doctors of your world feed you up with\nfine words and cant at the ears; now, here we really incorporate our\nprecepts at the mouth.  Therefore I'll not say to you, read this chapter,\nsee this gloss; no, I say to you, taste me this fine chapter, swallow me\nthis rare gloss.  Formerly an ancient prophet of the Jewish nation ate a\nbook and became a clerk even to the very teeth!  Now will I have you drink\none, that you may be a clerk to your very liver.  Here, open your\nmandibules.\n\nPanurge gaping as wide as his jaws would stretch, Bacbuc took the silver\nbook--at least we took it for a real book, for it looked just for the world\nlike a breviary--but in truth it was a breviary, a flask of right Falernian\nwine as it came from the grape, which she made him swallow every drop.\n\nBy Bacchus, quoth Panurge, this was a notable chapter, a most authentic\ngloss, o' my word.  Is this all that the trismegistian Bottle's word means?\nI' troth, I like it extremely; it went down like mother's milk.  Nothing\nmore, returned Bacbuc; for Trinc is a panomphean word, that is, a word\nunderstood, used and celebrated by all nations, and signifies drink.\n\nSome say in your world that sack is a word used in all tongues, and justly\nadmitted in the same sense among all nations; for, as Aesop's fable hath\nit, all men are born with a sack at the neck, naturally needy and begging\nof each other; neither can the most powerful king be without the help of\nother men, or can anyone that's poor subsist without the rich, though he be\nnever so proud and insolent; as, for example, Hippias the philosopher, who\nboasted he could do everything.  Much less can anyone make shift without\ndrink than without a sack.  Therefore here we hold not that laughing, but\nthat drinking is the distinguishing character of man.  I don't say\ndrinking, taking that word singly and absolutely in the strictest sense;\nno, beasts then might put in for a share; I mean drinking cool delicious\nwine.  For you must know, my beloved, that by wine we become divine;\nneither can there be a surer argument or a less deceitful divination.  Your\n('Varro.'--Motteux) academics assert the same when they make the etymology\nof wine, which the Greeks call OINOS, to be from vis, strength, virtue,\nand power; for 'tis in its power to fill the soul with all truth, learning,\nand philosophy.\n\nIf you observe what is written in Ionic letters on the temple gate, you may\nhave understood that truth is in wine.  The Goddess-Bottle therefore\ndirects you to that divine liquor; be yourself the expounder of your\nundertaking.\n\nIt is impossible, said Pantagruel to Panurge, to speak more to the purpose\nthan does this true priestess; you may remember I told you as much when you\nfirst spoke to me about it.\n\nTrinc then:  what says your heart, elevated by Bacchic enthusiasm?\n\nWith this quoth Panurge:\n\n  Trinc, trinc; by Bacchus, let us tope,\n  And tope again; for, now I hope\n  To see some brawny, juicy rump\n  Well tickled with my carnal stump.\n  Ere long, my friends, I shall be wedded,\n  Sure as my trap-stick has a red-head;\n  And my sweet wife shall hold the combat\n  Long as my baws can on her bum beat.\n  O what a battle of a-- fighting\n  Will there be, which I much delight in!\n  What pleasing pains then shall I take\n  To keep myself and spouse awake!\n  All heart and juice, I'll up and ride,\n  And make a duchess of my bride.\n  Sing Io paean! loudly sing\n  To Hymen, who all joys will bring.\n  Well, Friar John, I'll take my oath,\n  This oracle is full of troth;\n  Intelligible truth it bears,\n  More certain than the sieve and shears.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLVI.\n\nHow Panurge and the rest rhymed with poetic fury.\n\nWhat a pox ails the fellow? quoth Friar John.  Stark staring mad, or\nbewitched, o' my word!  Do but hear the chiming dotterel gabble in rhyme.\nWhat o' devil has he swallowed?  His eyes roll in his loggerhead just for\nthe world like a dying goat's.  Will the addle-pated wight have the grace\nto sheer off?  Will he rid us of his damned company, to go shite out his\nnasty rhyming balderdash in some bog-house?  Will nobody be so kind as to\ncram some dog's-bur down the poor cur's gullet? or will he, monk-like, run\nhis fist up to the elbow into his throat to his very maw, to scour and\nclear his flanks?  Will he take a hair of the same dog?\n\nPantagruel chid Friar John, and said:\n\n  Bold monk, forbear! this, I'll assure ye,\n  Proceeds all from poetic fury;\n  Warmed by the god, inspired with wine,\n  His human soul is made divine.\n    For without jest,\n    His hallowed breast,\n    With wine possessed,\n    Could have no rest\n    Till he'd expressed\n    Some thoughts at least\n    Of his great guest.\n    Then straight he flies\n    Above the skies,\n    And mortifies,\n    With prophecies,\n    Our miseries.\n  And since divinely he's inspired,\n  Adore the soul by wine acquired,\n  And let the tosspot be admired.\n\nHow, quoth the friar, the fit rhyming is upon you too?  Is't come to that?\nThen we are all peppered, or the devil pepper me.  What would I not give to\nhave Gargantua see us while we are in this maggotty crambo-vein!  Now may I\nbe cursed with living on that damned empty food, if I can tell whether I\nshall scape the catching distemper.  The devil a bit do I understand which\nway to go about it; however, the spirit of fustian possesses us all, I\nfind.  Well, by St. John, I'll poetize, since everybody does; I find it\ncoming.  Stay, and pray pardon me if I don't rhyme in crimson; 'tis my\nfirst essay.\n\n  Thou, who canst water turn to wine,\n  Transform my bum, by power divine,\n  Into a lantern, that may light\n  My neighbour in the darkest night.\n\nPanurge then proceeds in his rapture, and says:\n\n  From Pythian Tripos ne'er were heard\n  More truths, nor more to be revered.\n  I think from Delphos to this spring\n  Some wizard brought that conjuring thing.\n  Had honest Plutarch here been toping,\n  He then so long had ne'er been groping\n  To find, according to his wishes,\n  Why oracles are mute as fishes\n  At Delphos.  Now the reason's clear;\n  No more at Delphos they're, but here.\n  Here is the tripos, out of which\n  Is spoke the doom of poor and rich.\n  For Athenaeus does relate\n  This Bottle is the Womb of Fate;\n  Prolific of mysterious wine,\n  And big with prescience divine,\n  It brings the truth with pleasure forth;\n  Besides you ha't a pennyworth.\n  So, Friar John, I must exhort you\n  To wait a word that may import you,\n  And to inquire, while here we tarry,\n  If it shall be your luck to marry.\n\nFriar John answers him in a rage, and says:\n\n  How, marry!  By St. Bennet's boot,\n  And his gambadoes, I'll never do't.\n  No man that knows me e'er shall judge\n  I mean to make myself a drudge;\n  Or that pilgarlic e'er will dote\n  Upon a paltry petticoat.\n  I'll ne'er my liberty betray\n  All for a little leapfrog play;\n  And ever after wear a clog\n  Like monkey or like mastiff-dog.\n  No, I'd not have, upon my life,\n  Great Alexander for my wife,\n  Nor Pompey, nor his dad-in-law,\n  Who did each other clapperclaw.\n  Not the best he that wears a head\n  Shall win me to his truckle-bed.\n\nPanurge, pulling off his gaberdine and mystical accoutrements, replied:\n\n  Wherefore thou shalt, thou filthy beast,\n  Be damned twelve fathoms deep at least;\n  While I shall reign in Paradise,\n  Whence on thy loggerhead I'll piss.\n  Now when that dreadful hour is come,\n  That thou in hell receiv'st thy doom,\n  E'en there, I know, thou'lt play some trick,\n  And Proserpine shan't scape a prick\n  Of the long pin within thy breeches.\n  But when thou'rt using these capriches,\n  And caterwauling in her cavern,\n  Send Pluto to the farthest tavern\n  For the best wine that's to be had,\n  Lest he should see, and run horn-mad.\n  She's kind, and ever did admire\n  A well-fed monk or well-hung friar.\n\nGo to, quoth Friar John, thou old noddy, thou doddipolled ninny, go to the\ndevil thou'rt prating of.  I've done with rhyming; the rheum gripes me at\nthe gullet.  Let's talk of paying and going; come.\n\n\n\nChapter 5.XLVII.\n\nHow we took our leave of Bacbuc, and left the Oracle of the Holy Bottle.\n\nDo not trouble yourself about anything here, said the priestess to the\nfriar; if you be but satisfied, we are.  Here below, in these circumcentral\nregions, we place the sovereign good, not in taking and receiving, but in\nbestowing and giving; so that we esteem ourselves happy, not if we take and\nreceive much of others, as perhaps the sects of teachers do in your world,\nbut rather if we impart and give much.  All I have to beg of you is that\nyou leave us here your names in writing, in this ritual.  She then opened a\nfine large book, and as we gave our names one of her mystagogues with a\ngold pin drew some lines on it, as if she had been writing; but we could\nnot see any characters.\n\nThis done, she filled three glasses with fantastic water, and giving them\ninto our hands, said, Now, my friends, you may depart, and may that\nintellectual sphere whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere,\nwhom we call GOD, keep you in his almighty protection.  When you come into\nyour world, do not fail to affirm and witness that the greatest treasures\nand most admirable things are hidden underground, and not without reason.\n\nCeres was worshipped because she taught mankind the art of husbandry, and\nby the use of corn, which she invented, abolished that beastly way of\nfeeding on acorns; and she grievously lamented her daughter's banishment\ninto our subterranean regions, certainly foreseeing that Proserpine would\nmeet with more excellent things, more desirable enjoyments, below, than she\nher mother could be blessed with above.\n\nWhat do you think is become of the art of forcing the thunder and celestial\nfire down, which the wise Prometheus had formerly invented?  'Tis most\ncertain you have lost it; 'tis no more on your hemisphere; but here below\nwe have it.  And without a cause you sometimes wonder to see whole towns\nburned and destroyed by lightning and ethereal fire, and are at a loss\nabout knowing from whom, by whom, and to what end those dreadful mischiefs\nwere sent.  Now, they are familiar and useful to us; and your philosophers\nwho complain that the ancients have left them nothing to write of or to\ninvent, are very much mistaken.  Those phenomena which you see in the sky,\nwhatever the surface of the earth affords you, and the sea, and every river\ncontain, is not to be compared with what is hid within the bowels of the\nearth.\n\nFor this reason the subterranean ruler has justly gained in almost every\nlanguage the epithet of rich.  Now when your sages shall wholly apply their\nminds to a diligent and studious search after truth, humbly begging the\nassistance of the sovereign God, whom formerly the Egyptians in their\nlanguage called The Hidden and the Concealed, and invoking him by that\nname, beseech him to reveal and make himself known to them, that Almighty\nBeing will, out of his infinite goodness, not only make his creatures, but\neven himself known to them.\n\nThus will they be guided by good lanterns.  For all the ancient\nphilosophers and sages have held two things necessary safely and pleasantly\nto arrive at the knowledge of God and true wisdom; first, God's gracious\nguidance, then man's assistance.\n\nSo, among the philosophers, Zoroaster took Arimaspes for the companion of\nhis travels; Aesculapius, Mercury; Orpheus, Musaeus; Pythagoras,\nAglaophemus; and, among princes and warriors, Hercules in his most\ndifficult achievements had his singular friend Theseus; Ulysses, Diomedes;\nAeneas, Achates.  You followed their examples, and came under the conduct\nof an illustrious lantern.
