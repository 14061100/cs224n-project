{"summary": "Burton defined his subject as follows:\n\nMelancholy, the subject of our present discourse, is either in disposition or in habit. In disposition, is that transitory Melancholy which goes and comes upon every small occasion of sorrow, need, sickness, trouble, fear, grief, passion, or perturbation of the mind, any manner of care, discontent, or thought, which causes anguish, dulness, heaviness and vexation of spirit, any ways opposite to pleasure, mirth, joy, delight, causing forwardness in us, or a dislike. In which equivocal and improper sense, we call him melancholy, that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill-disposed, solitary, any way moved, or displeased. And from these melancholy dispositions no man living is free, no Stoick, none so wise, none so happy, none so patient, so generous, so godly, so divine, that can vindicate himself; so well-composed, but more or less, some time or other, he feels the smart of it. Melancholy in this sense is the character of Mortality... This Melancholy of which we are to treat, is a habit, a serious ailment, a settled humour, as Aurelianus and others call it, not errant, but fixed: and as it was long increasing, so, now being (pleasant or painful) grown to a habit, it will hardly be removed.\n\nIn attacking his stated subject, Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including psychology and physiology, but also astronomy, meteorology, and theology, and even astrology and demonology.\nMuch of the book consists of quotations from various ancient and medieval medical authorities, beginning with Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen. Hence the Anatomy is filled with more or less pertinent references to the works of others. A competent Latinist, Burton also included a great deal of Latin poetry in the Anatomy, and many of his inclusions from ancient sources are left untranslated in the text.\nThe Anatomy of Melancholy is an especially lengthy book, the first edition being a single quarto volume nearly 900 pages long; subsequent editions were even longer. The text is divided into three major sections plus an introduction, the whole written in Burton's sprawling style. Characteristically, the introduction includes not only an author's note (titled \"Democritus Junior to the Reader\"), but also a Latin poem (\"Democritus Junior to His Book\"), a warning to \"The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill\", an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the frontispiece. The following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion: the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of \"common\" melancholies, while the second section deals with cures for melancholy, and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies, including the melancholy of lovers and all varieties of religious melancholies. The Anatomy concludes with an extensive index (which, many years later, The New York Times Book Review called \"a readerly pleasure in itself\"). Most modern editions include many explanatory notes, and translate most of the Latin.\n\n", "full_text": "Introduction to the Project Gutenberg Edition.\n\nThis edition of _The Anatomy of Melancholy_ is based on a\nnineteenth-century edition that modernized Burton's spelling and\ntypographic conventions. In preparing this electronic version, it became\nevident that the editor had made a variety of mistakes in this\nmodernization: some words were left in their original spelling (unusual\nwords were a particular problem), portions of book titles were mistaken for\nproper names, proper names were mistaken for book titles or Latin words,\netc. A certain number of misprints were also introduced into the Latin. As\na result, I have re-edited the text, checking it against images of the 1638\nedition, and correcting all errors not present in the earlier edition. I\nhave continued to follow the general editorial practice of the base text\nfor quotation marks, italics, etc. Rare words have been normalized\naccording to their primary spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. When\nBurton spells a person's name in several ways, I have normalized the names\nto the most common spelling, or to modern practice if well-known. In a few\ncases, mistakes present in both the 1638 edition and the base text have\nbeen corrected. These are always minor reference errors (e.g., an incorrect\nor missing section number in the synopses, or misnumbered footnotes).\nIncorrect citations to other texts (Burton seems to quote by memory and\nsometimes gets it wrong) have not been changed if they are wrong in both\neditions.

At\nthe time of its original publication it obtained a great celebrity, which\ncontinued more than half a century. During that period few books were more\nread, or more deservedly applauded. It was the delight of the learned, the\nsolace of the indolent, and the refuge of the uninformed. It passed through\nat least eight editions, by which the bookseller, as WOOD records, got an\nestate; and, notwithstanding the objection sometimes opposed against it, of\na quaint style, and too great an accumulation of authorities, the\nfascination of its wit, fancy, and sterling sense, have borne down all\ncensures, and extorted praise from the first Writers in the English\nlanguage. The grave JOHNSON has praised it in the warmest terms, and the\nludicrous STERNE has interwoven many parts of it into his own popular\nperformance. MILTON did not disdain to build two of his finest poems on it;\nand a host of inferior writers have embellished their works with beauties\nnot their own, culled from a performance which they had not the justice\neven to mention. Change of times, and the frivolity of fashion, suspended,\nin some degree, that fame which had lasted near a century; and the\nsucceeding generation affected indifference towards an author, who at\nlength was only looked into by the plunderers of literature, the poachers\nin obscure volumes. The plagiarisms of _Tristram Shandy_, so successfully\nbrought to light by DR. FERRIAR, at length drew the attention of the public\ntowards a writer, who, though then little known, might, without impeachment\nof modesty, lay claim to every mark of respect; and inquiry proved, beyond\na doubt, that the calls of justice had been little attended to by others,\nas well as the facetious YORICK. WOOD observed, more than a century ago,\nthat several authors had unmercifully stolen matter from BURTON without any\nacknowledgment. The time, however, at length arrived, when the merits of\nthe _Anatomy of Melancholy_ were to receive their due praise. The book was\nagain sought for and read, and again it became an applauded performance.\nIts excellencies once more stood confessed, in the increased price which\nevery copy offered for sale produced; and the increased demand pointed out\nthe necessity of a new edition. This is now presented to the public in a\nmanner not disgraceful to the memory of the author; and the publisher\nrelies with confidence, that so valuable a repository of amusement and\ninformation will continue to hold the rank to which it has been restored,\nfirmly supported by its own merit, and safe from the influence and blight\nof any future caprices of fashion. To open its valuable mysteries to those\nwho have not had the advantage of a classical education, translations of\nthe countless quotations from ancient writers which occur in the work, are\nnow for the first time given, and obsolete orthography is in all instances\nmodernized.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR.\n\nRobert Burton was the son of Ralph Burton, of an ancient and genteel family\nat Lindley, in Leicestershire, and was born there on the 8th of February\n1576. [1]He received the first rudiments of learning at the free school of\nSutton Coldfield, in Warwickshire [2]from whence he was, at the age of\nseventeen, in the long vacation, 1593, sent to Brazen Nose College, in the\ncondition of a commoner, where he made considerable progress in logic and\nphilosophy. In 1599 he was elected student of Christ Church, and, for\nform's sake, was put under the tuition of Dr. John Bancroft, afterwards\nBishop of Oxford. In 1614 he was admitted to the reading of the Sentences,\nand on the 29th of November, 1616, had the vicarage of St. Thomas, in the\nwest suburb of Oxford, conferred on him by the dean and canons of Christ\nChurch, which, with the rectory of Segrave, in Leicestershire, given to him\nin the year 1636, by George, Lord Berkeley, he kept, to use the words of\nthe Oxford antiquary, with much ado to his dying day. He seems to have been\nfirst beneficed at Walsby, in Lincolnshire, through the munificence of his\nnoble patroness, Frances, Countess Dowager of Exeter, but resigned the\nsame, as he tells us, for some special reasons. At his vicarage he is\nremarked to have always given the sacrament in wafers. Wood's character of\nhim is, that \"he was an exact mathematician, a curious calculator of\nnativities, a general read scholar, a thorough-paced philologist, and one\nthat understood the surveying of lands well. As he was by many accounted a\nsevere student, a devourer of authors, a melancholy and humorous person; so\nby others, who knew him well, a person of great honesty, plain dealing and\ncharity. I have heard some of the ancients of Christ Church often say, that\nhis company was very merry, facete, and juvenile; and no man in his time\ndid surpass him for his ready and dexterous interlarding his common\ndiscourses among them with verses from the poets, or sentences from classic\nauthors; which being then all the fashion in the University, made his\ncompany the more acceptable.\" He appears to have been a universal reader of\nall kinds of books, and availed himself of his multifarious studies in a\nvery extraordinary manner. From the information of Hearne, we learn that\nJohn Rouse, the Bodleian librarian, furnished him with choice books for the\nprosecution of his work. The subject of his labour and amusement, seems to\nhave been adopted from the infirmities of his own habit and constitution.\nMr. Granger says, \"He composed this book with a view of relieving his own\nmelancholy, but increased it to such a degree, that nothing could make him\nlaugh, but going to the bridge-foot and hearing the ribaldry of the\nbargemen, which rarely failed to throw him into a violent fit of laughter.\nBefore he was overcome with this horrid disorder, he, in the intervals of\nhis vapours, was esteemed one of the most facetious companions in the\nUniversity.\"\n\nHis residence was chiefly at Oxford; where, in his chamber in Christ Church\nCollege, he departed this life, at or very near the time which he had some\nyears before foretold, from the calculation of his own nativity, and which,\nsays Wood, \"being exact, several of the students did not forbear to whisper\namong themselves, that rather than there should be a mistake in the\ncalculation, he sent up his soul to heaven through a slip about his neck.\"\nWhether this suggestion is founded in truth, we have no other evidence than\nan obscure hint in the epitaph hereafter inserted, which was written by the\nauthor himself, a short time before his death. His body, with due\nsolemnity, was buried near that of Dr. Robert Weston, in the north aisle\nwhich joins next to the choir of the cathedral of Christ Church, on the\n27th of January 1639-40. Over his grave was soon after erected a comely\nmonument, on the upper pillar of the said aisle, with his bust, painted to\nthe life. On the right hand is the following calculation of his nativity:\n\n[Illustration: R. natus B.\n1576, 8 Feb.\nhor. 3, scrup. 16.\nlong. 22 deg. 0'\npolus 51 deg. 30\"]\n\nand under the bust, this inscription of his own composition:--\n\nPaucis notus, paucioribus ignotus,\nHic jacet _Democritus_ junior\nCui vitam dedit et mortem\n        Melancholia\nOb. 8 Id.

Dr. Ferriar says, it was\noriginally published in the year 1617; but this is evidently a mistake;\n[5]the first edition was that printed in 4to, 1621, a copy of which is at\npresent in the collection of John Nichols, Esq., the indefatigable\nillustrator of the _History of Leicestershire_; to whom, and to Isaac Reed,\nEsq., of Staple Inn, this account is greatly indebted for its accuracy. The\nother impressions of it were in 1624, 1628, 1632, 1638, 1651-2, 1660, and\n1676, which last, in the titlepage, is called the eighth edition.\n\nThe copy from which the present is reprinted, is that of 1651-2; at the\nconclusion of which is the following address:\n\n\"TO THE READER.\n\n\"Be pleased to know (Courteous Reader) that since the last Impression\nof this Book, the ingenuous Author of it is deceased, leaving a Copy\nof it exactly corrected, with several considerable Additions by his\nown hand; this Copy he committed to my care and custody, with\ndirections to have those Additions inserted in the next Edition; which\nin order to his command, and the Publicke Good, is faithfully\nperformed in this last Impression.\"\n\nH. C. (_i.e. HEN. CRIPPS._)\n\nThe following testimonies of various authors will serve to show the\nestimation in which this work has been held:--\n\n\"The ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, wherein the author hath piled up variety of\nmuch excellent learning. Scarce any book of philology in our land hath, in\nso short a time, passed so many editions.\"--_Fuller's Worthies_, fol. 16.\n\n\"'Tis a book so full of variety of reading, that gentlemen who have lost\ntheir time, and are put to a push for invention, may furnish themselves\nwith matter for common or scholastical discourse and writing.\"--_Wood's\nAthenae Oxoniensis_, vol. i. p. 628. 2d edit.\n\n\"If you never saw BURTON UPON MELANCHOLY, printed 1676, I pray look into\nit, and read the ninth page of his Preface, 'Democritus to the Reader.'\nThere is something there which touches the point we are upon; but I mention\nthe author to you, as the pleasantest, the most learned, and the most full\nof sterling sense. The wits of Queen Anne's reign, and the beginning of\nGeorge the First, were not a little beholden to him.\"--_Archbishop\nHerring's Letters_, 12mo. 1777. p. 149.\n\n\"BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, he (Dr. Johnson) said, was the only book\nthat ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to\nrise.\"--_Boswell's Life of Johnson_, vol. i. p. 580. 8vo. edit.\n\n\"BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a valuable book,\" said Dr. Johnson. \"It\nis, perhaps, overloaded with quotation. But there is great spirit and great\npower in what Burton says when he writes from his own mind.\"--_Ibid_, vol.\nii. p. 325.\n\n\"It will be no detraction from the powers of Milton's original genius and\ninvention, to remark, that he seems to have borrowed the subject of _L'\nAllegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, together with some particular thoughts,\nexpressions, and rhymes, more especially the idea of a contrast between\nthese two dispositions, from a forgotten poem prefixed to the first edition\nof BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, entitled, 'The Author's Abstract of\nMelancholy; or, A Dialogue between Pleasure and Pain.' Here pain is\nmelancholy. It was written, as I conjecture, about the year 1600. I will\nmake no apology for abstracting and citing as much of this poem as will be\nsufficient to prove, to a discerning reader, how far it had taken\npossession of Milton's mind. The measure will appear to be the same; and\nthat our author was at least an attentive reader of Burton's book, may be\nalready concluded from the traces of resemblance which I have incidentally\nnoticed in passing through the _L' Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_.\"--After\nextracting the lines, Mr. Warton adds, \"as to the very elaborate work to\nwhich these visionary verses are no unsuitable introduction, the writer's\nvariety of learning, his quotations from scarce and curious books, his\npedantry sparkling with rude wit and shapeless elegance, miscellaneous\nmatter, intermixture of agreeable tales and illustrations, and, perhaps,\nabove all, the singularities of his feelings, clothed in an uncommon\nquaintness of style, have contributed to render it, even to modern readers,\na valuable repository of amusement and information.\"--_Warton's Milton_, 2d\nedit. p. 94.\n\n\"THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a book which has been universally read and\nadmired. This work is, for the most part, what the author himself styles\nit, 'a cento;' but it is a very ingenious one. His quotations, which abound\nin every page, are pertinent; but if he had made more use of his invention\nand less of his commonplace-book, his work would perhaps have been more\nvaluable than it is. He is generally free from the affected language and\nridiculous metaphors which disgrace most of the books of his\ntime.\"--_Granger's Biographical History_.\n\n\"BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, a book once the favourite of the learned\nand the witty, and a source of surreptitious learning, though written on a\nregular plan, consists chiefly of quotations: the author has honestly\ntermed it a cento. He collects, under every division, the opinions of a\nmultitude of writers, without regard to chronological order, and has too\noften the modesty to decline the interposition of his own sentiments.\nIndeed the bulk of his materials generally overwhelms him. In the course of\nhis folio he has contrived to treat a great variety of topics, that seem\nvery loosely connected with the general subject; and, like Bayle, when he\nstarts a favourite train of quotations, he does not scruple to let the\ndigression outrun the principal question. Thus, from the doctrines of\nreligion to military discipline, from inland navigation to the morality of\ndancing-schools, every thing is discussed and determined.\"--_Ferriar's\nIllustrations of Sterne_, p. 58.\n\n\"The archness which BURTON displays occasionally, and his indulgence of\nplayful digressions from the most serious discussions, often give his style\nan air of familiar conversation, notwithstanding the laborious collections\nwhich supply his text. He was capable of writing excellent poetry, but he\nseems to have cultivated this talent too little. The English verses\nprefixed to his book, which possess beautiful imagery, and great sweetness\nof versification, have been frequently published. His Latin elegiac verses\naddressed to his book, shew a very agreeable turn for raillery.\"--_Ibid_.\np. 58.\n\n\"When the force of the subject opens his own vein of prose, we discover\nvaluable sense and brilliant expression. Such is his account of the first\nfeelings of melancholy persons, written, probably, from his own\nexperience.\" [See p. 154, of the present edition.]--_Ibid._ p. 60.\n\n\"During a pedantic age, like that in which BURTON'S production appeared, it\nmust have been eminently serviceable to writers of many descriptions. Hence\nthe unlearned might furnish themselves with appropriate scraps of Greek and\nLatin, whilst men of letters would find their enquiries shortened, by\nknowing where they might look for what both ancients and moderns had\nadvanced on the subject of human passions. I confess my inability to point\nout any other English author who has so largely dealt in apt and original\nquotation.\"--_Manuscript note of the late George Steevens, Esq., in his\ncopy of_ THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY.\n\nDEMOCRITUS JUNIOR AD LIBRUM SUUM.\n\n        Vade liber, qualis, non ausum dicere, felix,\n          Te nisi felicem fecerit Alma dies.\n        Vade tamen quocunque lubet, quascunque per oras,\n          Et Genium Domini fac imitere tui.\n        I blandas inter Charites, mystamque saluta\n          Musarum quemvis, si tibi lector erit.\n        Rura colas, urbem, subeasve palatia regum,\n          Submisse, placide, te sine dente geras.\n        Nobilis, aut si quis te forte inspexerit heros,\n          Da te morigerum, perlegat usque lubet.\n        Est quod nobilitas, est quod desideret heros,\n          Gratior haec forsan charta placere potest.\n        Si quis morosus Cato, tetricusque Senator,\n          Hunc etiam librum forte videre velit,\n        Sive magistratus, tum te reverenter habeto;\n          Sed nullus; muscas non capiunt Aquilae.\n        Non vacat his tempus fugitivum impendere nugis,\n          Nec tales cupio; par mihi lector erit.\n        Si matrona gravis casu diverterit istuc,\n          Illustris domina, aut te Comitissa legat:\n        Est quod displiceat, placeat quod forsitan illis,\n          Ingerere his noli te modo, pande tamen.\n        At si virgo tuas dignabitur inclyta chartas\n          Tangere, sive schedis haereat illa tuis:\n        Da modo te facilem, et quaedam folia esse memento\n          Conveniant oculis quae magis apta suis.\n        Si generosa ancilla tuos aut alma puella\n          Visura est ludos, annue, pande lubens.\n        Dic utinam nunc ipse meus [6](nam diligit istas)\n          In praesens esset conspiciendus herus.\n        Ignotus notusve mihi de gente togata\n          Sive aget in ludis, pulpita sive colet,\n        Sive in Lycaeo, et nugas evolverit istas,\n          Si quasdam mendas viderit inspiciens,\n        Da veniam Authori, dices; nam plurima vellet\n          Expungi, quae jam displicuisse sciat.\n        Sive Melancholicus quisquam, seu blandus Amator,\n          Aulicus aut Civis, seu bene comptus eques\n        Huc appellat, age et tuto te crede legenti,\n          Multa istic forsan non male nata leget.\n        Quod fugiat, caveat, quodque amplexabitur, ista\n          Pagina fortassis promere multa potest.\n        At si quis Medicus coram te sistet, amice\n          Fac circumspecte, et te sine labe geras:\n        Inveniet namque ipse meis quoque plurima scriptis,\n          Non leve subsidium quae sibi forsan erunt.\n        Si quis Causidicus chartas impingat in istas,\n          Nil mihi vobiscum, pessima turba vale;\n        Sit nisi vir bonus, et juris sine fraude peritus,\n          Tum legat, et forsan doctior inde siet.\n        Si quis cordatus, facilis, lectorque benignus\n          Huc oculos vertat, quae velit ipse legat;\n        Candidus ignoscet, metuas nil, pande libenter,\n          Offensus mendis non erit ille tuis,\n        Laudabit nonnulla.

whence he is,\nwhy he doth it, and what he hath to say; although, as [7]he said, _Primum\nsi noluero, non respondebo, quis coacturus est_? I am a free man born, and\nmay choose whether I will tell; who can compel me? If I be urged, I will as\nreadily reply as that Egyptian in [8]Plutarch, when a curious fellow would\nneeds know what he had in his basket, _Quum vides velatam, quid inquiris in\nrem absconditam_? It was therefore covered, because he should not know what\nwas in it. Seek not after that which is hid; if the contents please thee,\n[9]\"and be for thy use, suppose the Man in the Moon, or whom thou wilt to\nbe the author;\" I would not willingly be known. Yet in some sort to give\nthee satisfaction, which is more than I need, I will show a reason, both of\nthis usurped name, title, and subject. And first of the name of Democritus;\nlest any man, by reason of it, should be deceived, expecting a pasquil, a\nsatire, some ridiculous treatise (as I myself should have done), some\nprodigious tenet, or paradox of the earth's motion, of infinite worlds, _in\ninfinito vacuo, ex fortuita atomorum collisione_, in an infinite waste, so\ncaused by an accidental collision of motes in the sun, all which Democritus\nheld, Epicurus and their master Lucippus of old maintained, and are lately\nrevived by Copernicus, Brunus, and some others. Besides, it hath been\nalways an ordinary custom, as [10]Gellius observes, \"for later writers and\nimpostors, to broach many absurd and insolent fictions, under the name of\nso noble a philosopher as Democritus, to get themselves credit, and by that\nmeans the more to be respected,\" as artificers usually do, _Novo qui\nmarmori ascribunt Praxatilem suo_. 'Tis not so with me.\n\n[11]   \"Non hic Centaurus, non Gorgonas, Harpyasque\n        Invenies, hominem pagina nostra sapit.\"\n\n       \"No Centaurs here, or Gorgons look to find,\n        My subject is of man and human kind.\"\n\nThou thyself art the subject of my discourse.\n\n[12]   \"Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,\n        Gaudia, discursus, nostri farrago libelli.\"\n\n       \"Whate'er men do, vows, fears, in ire, in sport,\n        Joys, wand'rings, are the sum of my report.\"\n\nMy intent is no otherwise to use his name, than Mercurius Gallobelgicus,\nMercurius Britannicus, use the name of Mercury, [13]Democritus Christianus,\n&c.; although there be some other circumstances for which I have masked\nmyself under this vizard, and some peculiar respect which I cannot so well\nexpress, until I have set down a brief character of this our Democritus,\nwhat he was, with an epitome of his life.\n\nDemocritus, as he is described by [14]Hippocrates and [15]Laertius, was a\nlittle wearish old man, very melancholy by nature, averse from company in\nhis latter days, [16]and much given to solitariness, a famous philosopher\nin his age, [17]_coaevus_ with Socrates, wholly addicted to his studies at\nthe last, and to a private life: wrote many excellent works, a great\ndivine, according to the divinity of those times, an expert physician, a\npolitician, an excellent mathematician, as [18]Diacosmus and the rest of\nhis works do witness. He was much delighted with the studies of husbandry,\nsaith [19]Columella, and often I find him cited by [20]Constantinus and\nothers treating of that subject. He knew the natures, differences of all\nbeasts, plants, fishes, birds; and, as some say, could [21]understand the\ntunes and voices of them. In a word, he was _omnifariam doctus_, a general\nscholar, a great student; and to the intent he might better contemplate,\n[22]I find it related by some, that he put out his eyes, and was in his old\nage voluntarily blind, yet saw more than all Greece besides, and [23] writ\nof every subject, _Nihil in toto opificio naturae, de quo non scripsit_.\n[24]A man of an excellent wit, profound conceit; and to attain knowledge\nthe better in his younger years, he travelled to Egypt and [25] Athens, to\nconfer with learned men, [26]\"admired of some, despised of others.\" After a\nwandering life, he settled at Abdera, a town in Thrace, and was sent for\nthither to be their lawmaker, recorder, or town-clerk, as some will; or as\nothers, he was there bred and born. Howsoever it was, there he lived at\nlast in a garden in the suburbs, wholly betaking himself to his studies and\na private life, [27]\"saving that sometimes he would walk down to the\nhaven,\" [28]\"and laugh heartily at such variety of ridiculous objects,\nwhich there he saw.\" Such a one was Democritus.\n\nBut in the mean time, how doth this concern me, or upon what reference do I\nusurp his habit? I confess, indeed, that to compare myself unto him for\naught I have yet said, were both impudency and arrogancy. I do not presume\nto make any parallel, _Antistat mihi millibus trecentis_, [29]_parvus sum,\nnullus sum, altum nec spiro, nec spero_. Yet thus much I will say of\nmyself, and that I hope without all suspicion of pride, or self-conceit, I\nhave lived a silent, sedentary, solitary, private life, _mihi et musis_ in\nthe University, as long almost as Xenocrates in Athens, _ad senectam fere_\nto learn wisdom as he did, penned up most part in my study. For I have been\nbrought up a student in the most flourishing college of Europe,\n[30]_augustissimo collegio_, and can brag with [31]Jovius, almost, _in ea\nluce domicilii Vacicani, totius orbis celeberrimi, per 37 annos multa\nopportunaque didici_; for thirty years I have continued (having the use of\nas good [32]libraries as ever he had) a scholar, and would be therefore\nloath, either by living as a drone, to be an unprofitable or unworthy\nmember of so learned and noble a society, or to write that which should be\nany way dishonourable to such a royal and ample foundation. Something I\nhave done, though by my profession a divine, yet _turbine raptus ingenii_,\nas [33]he said, out of a running wit, an unconstant, unsettled mind, I had\na great desire (not able to attain to a superficial skill in any) to have\nsome smattering in all, to be _aliquis in omnibus, nullus in singulis_,\n[34] which [35]Plato commends, out of him [36]Lipsius approves and\nfurthers, \"as fit to be imprinted in all curious wits, not to be a slave of\none science, or dwell altogether in one subject, as most do, but to rove\nabroad, _centum puer artium_, to have an oar in every man's boat, to\n[37]taste of every dish, and sip of every cup,\" which, saith [38]Montaigne,\nwas well performed by Aristotle, and his learned countryman Adrian\nTurnebus. This roving humour (though not with like success) I have ever\nhad, and like a ranging spaniel, that barks at every bird he sees, leaving\nhis game, I have followed all, saving that which I should, and may justly\ncomplain, and truly, _qui ubique est, nusquam est_,[39] which [40]Gesner\ndid in modesty, that I have read many books, but to little purpose, for\nwant of good method; I have confusedly tumbled over divers authors in our\nlibraries, with small profit, for want of art, order, memory, judgment. I\nnever travelled but in map or card, in which mine unconfined thoughts have\nfreely expatiated, as having ever been especially delighted with the study\nof Cosmography. [41]Saturn was lord of my geniture, culminating, &c., and\nMars principal significator of manners, in partile conjunction with my\nascendant; both fortunate in their houses, &c. I am not poor, I am not\nrich; _nihil est, nihil deest_, I have little, I want nothing: all my\ntreasure is in Minerva's tower. Greater preferment as I could never get, so\nam I not in debt for it, I have a competence (_laus Deo_) from my noble and\nmunificent patrons, though I live still a collegiate student, as Democritus\nin his garden, and lead a monastic life, _ipse mihi theatrum_, sequestered\nfrom those tumults and troubles of the world, _Et tanquam in specula\npositus_, ([42]as he said) in some high place above you all, like Stoicus\nSapiens, _omnia saecula, praeterita presentiaque videns, uno velut\nintuitu_, I hear and see what is done abroad, how others [43]run, ride,\nturmoil, and macerate themselves in court and country, far from those\nwrangling lawsuits, _aulia vanitatem, fori ambitionem, ridere mecum soleo_:\nI laugh at all, [44]only secure, lest my suit go amiss, my ships perish,\ncorn and cattle miscarry, trade decay, I have no wife nor children good or\nbad to provide for. A mere spectator of other men's fortunes and\nadventures, and how they act their parts, which methinks are diversely\npresented unto me, as from a common theatre or scene. I hear new news every\nday, and those ordinary rumours of war, plagues, fires, inundations,\nthefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets, spectrums, prodigies,\napparitions, of towns taken, cities besieged in France, Germany, Turkey,\nPersia, Poland, &c., daily musters and preparations, and such like, which\nthese tempestuous times afford, battles fought, so many men slain,\nmonomachies, shipwrecks, piracies and sea-fights; peace, leagues,\nstratagems, and fresh alarms. A vast confusion of vows, wishes, actions,\nedicts, petitions, lawsuits, pleas, laws, proclamations, complaints,\ngrievances are daily brought to our ears. New books every day, pamphlets,\ncorantoes, stories, whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts, new\nparadoxes, opinions, schisms, heresies, controversies in philosophy,\nreligion, &c. Now come tidings of weddings, maskings, mummeries,\nentertainments, jubilees, embassies, tilts and tournaments, trophies,\ntriumphs, revels, sports, plays: then again, as in a new shifted scene,\ntreasons, cheating tricks, robberies, enormous villainies in all kinds,\nfunerals, burials, deaths of princes, new discoveries, expeditions, now\ncomical, then tragical matters. Today we hear of new lords and officers\ncreated, tomorrow of some great men deposed, and then again of fresh\nhonours conferred; one is let loose, another imprisoned; one purchaseth,\nanother breaketh: he thrives, his neighbour turns bankrupt; now plenty,\nthen again dearth and famine; one runs, another rides, wrangles, laughs,\nweeps, &c. This I daily hear, and such like, both private and public news,\namidst the gallantry and misery of the world; jollity, pride, perplexities\nand cares, simplicity and villainy; subtlety, knavery, candour and\nintegrity, mutually mixed and offering themselves; I rub on _privus\nprivatus_; as I have still lived, so I now continue, _statu quo prius_,\nleft to a solitary life, and mine own domestic discontents: saving that\nsometimes, _ne quid mentiar_, as Diogenes went into the city, and\nDemocritus to the haven to see fashions, I did for my recreation now and\nthen walk abroad, look into the world, and could not choose but make some\nlittle observation, _non tam sagax observator ac simplex recitator_, [45]\nnot as they did, to scoff or laugh at all, but with a mixed passion.\n\n[46]   \"Bilem saepe, jocum vestri movere tumultus.\"\n\n       \"Ye wretched mimics, whose fond heats have been,\n        How oft! the objects of my mirth and spleen.\"\n\nI did sometime laugh and scoff with Lucian, and satirically tax with\nMenippus, lament with Heraclitus, sometimes again I was [47]_petulanti\nsplene chachinno_, and then again, [48]_urere bilis jecur_, I was much\nmoved to see that abuse which I could not mend. In which passion howsoever\nI may sympathise with him or them, 'tis for no such respect I shroud myself\nunder his name; but either in an unknown habit to assume a little more\nliberty and freedom of speech, or if you will needs know, for that reason\nand only respect which Hippocrates relates at large in his Epistle to\nDamegetus, wherein he doth express, how coming to visit him one day, he\nfound Democritus in his garden at Abdera, in the suburbs, [49]under a shady\nbower, [50]with a book on his knees, busy at his study, sometimes writing,\nsometimes walking. The subject of his book was melancholy and madness;\nabout him lay the carcases of many several beasts, newly by him cut up and\nanatomised; not that he did contemn God's creatures, as he told\nHippocrates, but to find out the seat of this _atra bilis_, or melancholy,\nwhence it proceeds, and how it was engendered in men's bodies, to the\nintent he might better cure it in himself, and by his writings and\nobservation [51]teach others how to prevent and avoid it. Which good intent\nof his, Hippocrates highly commended: Democritus Junior is therefore bold\nto imitate, and because he left it imperfect, and it is now lost, _quasi\nsuccenturiator Democriti_, to revive again, prosecute, and finish in this\ntreatise.\n\nYou have had a reason of the name. If the title and inscription offend your\ngravity, were it a sufficient justification to accuse others, I could\nproduce many sober treatises, even sermons themselves, which in their\nfronts carry more fantastical names. Howsoever, it is a kind of policy in\nthese days, to prefix a fantastical title to a book which is to be sold;\nfor, as larks come down to a day-net, many vain readers will tarry and\nstand gazing like silly passengers at an antic picture in a painter's shop,\nthat will not look at a judicious piece. And, indeed, as [52]Scaliger\nobserves, \"nothing more invites a reader than an argument unlooked for,\nunthought of, and sells better than a scurrile pamphlet,\" _tum maxime cum\nnovitas excitat [53]palatum_. \"Many men,\" saith Gellius, \"are very\nconceited in their inscriptions,\" \"and able\" (as [54]Pliny quotes out of\nSeneca) \"to make him loiter by the way that went in haste to fetch a\nmidwife for his daughter, now ready to lie down.\" For my part, I have\nhonourable [55]precedents for this which I have done: I will cite one for\nall, Anthony Zara, Pap. Epis., his Anatomy of Wit, in four sections,\nmembers, subsections, &c., to be read in our libraries.\n\nIf any man except against the matter or manner of treating of this my\nsubject, and will demand a reason of it, I can allege more than one; I\nwrite of melancholy, by being busy to avoid melancholy. There is no greater\ncause of melancholy than idleness, \"no better cure than business,\" as\n[56]Rhasis holds: and howbeit, _stultus labor est ineptiarum_, to be busy\nin toys is to small purpose, yet hear that divine Seneca, _aliud agere quam\nnihil_, better do to no end, than nothing. I wrote therefore, and busied\nmyself in this playing labour, _oliosaque diligentia ut vitarem torporum\nferiandi_ with Vectius in Macrobius, _atque otium in utile verterem\nnegatium_.\n\n[57]   \"Simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vita,\n        Lectorem delectando simul atque monendo.\"\n\n       \"Poets would profit or delight mankind,\n        And with the pleasing have th' instructive joined.\n        Profit and pleasure, then, to mix with art,\n        T' inform the judgment, nor offend the heart,\n        Shall gain all votes.\"\n\nTo this end I write, like them, saith Lucian, that \"recite to trees, and\ndeclaim to pillars for want of auditors:\" as [58]Paulus Aegineta\ningenuously confesseth, \"not that anything was unknown or omitted, but to\nexercise myself,\" which course if some took, I think it would be good for\ntheir bodies, and much better for their souls; or peradventure as others\ndo, for fame, to show myself (_Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc\nsciat alter_). I might be of Thucydides' opinion, [59]\"to know a thing and\nnot to express it, is all one as if he knew it not.\" When I first took this\ntask in hand, _et quod ait [60]ille, impellents genio negotium suscepi_,\nthis I aimed at; [61]_vel ut lenirem animum scribendo_, to ease my mind by\nwriting; for I had _gravidum cor, foetum caput_, a kind of imposthume in my\nhead, which I was very desirous to be unladen of, and could imagine no\nfitter evacuation than this. Besides, I might not well refrain, for _ubi\ndolor, ibi digitus_, one must needs scratch where it itches. I was not a\nlittle offended with this malady, shall I say my mistress Melancholy, my\nAegeria, or my _malus genius_? and for that cause, as he that is stung with\na scorpion, I would expel _clavum clavo_, [62]comfort one sorrow with\nanother, idleness with idleness, _ut ex vipera Theriacum_, make an antidote\nout of that which was the prime cause of my disease. Or as he did, of whom\n[63]Felix Plater speaks, that thought he had some of Aristophanes' frogs in\nhis belly, still crying _Breec, okex, coax, coax, oop, oop_, and for that\ncause studied physic seven years, and travelled over most part of Europe to\nease himself. To do myself good I turned over such physicians as our\nlibraries would afford, or my [64]private friends impart, and have taken\nthis pains. And why not? Cardan professeth he wrote his book, _De\nConsolatione_ after his son's death, to comfort himself; so did Tully write\nof the same subject with like intent after his daughter's departure, if it\nbe his at least, or some impostor's put out in his name, which Lipsius\nprobably suspects. Concerning myself, I can peradventure affirm with Marius\nin Sallust, [65]\"that which others hear or read of, I felt and practised\nmyself; they get their knowledge by books, I mine by melancholising.\"\n_Experto crede Roberto_. Something I can speak out of experience,\n_aerumnabilis experientia me docuit_; and with her in the poet, [66]_Haud\nignara mali miseris succurrere disco_; I would help others out of a\nfellow-feeling; and, as that virtuous lady did of old, [67]\"being a leper\nherself, bestow all her portion to build an hospital for lepers,\" I will\nspend my time and knowledge, which are my greatest fortunes, for the common\ngood of all.\n\nYea, but you will infer that this is [68]_actum agere_, an unnecessary\nwork, _cramben bis coctam apponnere_, the same again and again in other\nwords. To what purpose? [69]\"Nothing is omitted that may well be said,\" so\nthought Lucian in the like theme. How many excellent physicians have\nwritten just volumes and elaborate tracts of this subject? No news here;\nthat which I have is stolen, from others, [70]_Dicitque mihi mea pagina fur\nes_. If that severe doom of [71]Synesius be true, \"it is a greater offence\nto steal dead men's labours, than their clothes,\" what shall become of most\nwriters? I hold up my hand at the bar among others, and am guilty of felony\nin this kind, _habes confitentem reum_, I am content to be pressed with the\nrest. 'Tis most true, _tenet insanabile multos scribendi cacoethes_, and\n[72]\"there is no end of writing of books,\" as the wiseman found of old, in\nthis [73]scribbling age, especially wherein [74]\"the number of books is\nwithout number,\" (as a worthy man saith,) \"presses be oppressed,\" and out\nof an itching humour that every man hath to show himself, [75]desirous of\nfame and honour (_scribimus indocti doctique_----) he will write no matter\nwhat, and scrape together it boots not whence. [76]\"Bewitched with this\ndesire of fame,\" _etiam mediis in morbis_, to the disparagement of their\nhealth, and scarce able to hold a pen, they must say something, [77]\"and\nget themselves a name,\" saith Scaliger, \"though it be to the downfall and\nruin of many others.\" To be counted writers, _scriptores ut salutentur_, to\nbe thought and held polymaths and polyhistors, _apud imperitum vulgus ob\nventosae nomen artis_, to get a paper-kingdom: _nulla spe quaestus sed\nampla famae_, in this precipitate, ambitious age, _nunc ut est saeculum,\ninter immaturam eruditionem, ambitiosum et praeceps_ ('tis [78]Scaliger's\ncensure); and they that are scarce auditors, _vix auditores_, must be\nmasters and teachers, before they be capable and fit hearers. They will\nrush into all learning, _togatam armatam_, divine, human authors, rake over\nall indexes and pamphlets for notes, as our merchants do strange havens for\ntraffic, write great tomes, _Cum non sint re vera doctiores, sed\nloquaciores_, whereas they are not thereby better scholars, but greater\npraters. They commonly pretend public good, but as [79]Gesner observes,\n'tis pride and vanity that eggs them on; no news or aught worthy of note,\nbut the same in other terms. _Ne feriarentur fortasse typographi vel ideo\nscribendum est aliquid ut se vixisse testentur_. As apothecaries we make\nnew mixtures everyday, pour out of one vessel into another; and as those\nold Romans robbed all the cities of the world, to set out their bad-sited\nRome, we skim off the cream of other men's wits, pick the choice flowers of\ntheir tilled gardens to set out our own sterile plots. _Castrant alios ut\nlibros suos per se graciles alieno adipe suffarciant_ (so [80]Jovius\ninveighs.) They lard their lean books with the fat of others' works.\n_Ineruditi fures_, &c. A fault that every writer finds, as I do now, and\nyet faulty themselves, [81]_Trium literarum homines_, all thieves; they\npilfer out of old writers to stuff up their new comments, scrape Ennius'\ndunghills, and out of [82]Democritus' pit, as I have done. By which means\nit comes to pass, [83]\"that not only libraries and shops are full of our\nputrid papers, but every close-stool and jakes,\" _Scribunt carmina quae\nlegunt cacantes_; they serve to put under pies, to [84]lap spice in, and\nkeep roast meat from burning. \"With us in France,\" saith [85]Scaliger,\n\"every man hath liberty to write, but few ability.\" [86]\"Heretofore\nlearning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are\nvilified by base and illiterate scribblers,\" that either write for\nvainglory, need, to get money, or as Parasites to flatter and collogue with\nsome great men, they put cut [87]_burras, quisquiliasque ineptiasque_.\n[88]Amongst so many thousand authors you shall scarce find one, by reading\nof whom you shall be any whit better, but rather much worse, _quibus\ninficitur potius, quam perficitur_, by which he is rather infected than any\nway perfected.\n\n[89]    ------\"Qui talia legit,\n        Quid didicit tandem, quid scit nisi somnia, nugas?\"\n\nSo that oftentimes it falls out (which Callimachus taxed of old) a great\nbook is a great mischief. [90]Cardan finds fault with Frenchmen and\nGermans, for their scribbling to no purpose, _non inquit ab edendo\ndeterreo, modo novum aliquid inveniant_, he doth not bar them to write, so\nthat it be some new invention of their own; but we weave the same web\nstill, twist the same rope again and again; or if it be a new invention,\n'tis but some bauble or toy which idle fellows write, for as idle fellows\nto read, and who so cannot invent? [91]\"He must have a barren wit, that in\nthis scribbling age can forge nothing. [92]Princes show their armies, rich\nmen vaunt their buildings, soldiers their manhood, and scholars vent their\ntoys;\" they must read, they must hear whether they will or no.\n\n[93]   \"Et quodcunque semel chartis illeverit, omnes\n        Gestiet a furno redeuntes scire lacuque,\n        Et pueros et anus\"------\n\n       \"What once is said and writ, all men must know,\n        Old wives and children as they come and go.\"\n\n\"What a company of poets hath this year brought out,\" as Pliny complains to\nSossius Sinesius. [94]\"This April every day some or other have recited.\"\nWhat a catalogue of new books all this year, all this age (I say), have our\nFrankfort Marts, our domestic Marts brought out? Twice a year, [95]\n_Proferunt se nova ingenia et ostentant_, we stretch our wits out, and set\nthem to sale, _magno conatu nihil agimus_. So that which [96]Gesner much\ndesires, if a speedy reformation be not had, by some prince's edicts and\ngrave supervisors, to restrain this liberty, it will run on _in infinitum_.\n_Quis tam avidus librorum helluo_, who can read them? As already, we shall\nhave a vast chaos and confusion of books, we are [97]oppressed with them,\n[98]our eyes ache with reading, our fingers with turning. For my part I am\none of the number, _nos numerus sumus_, (we are mere ciphers): I do not\ndeny it, I have only this of Macrobius to say for myself, _Omne meum, nihil\nmeum_, 'tis all mine, and none mine. As a good housewife out of divers\nfleeces weaves one piece of cloth, a bee gathers wax and honey out of many\nflowers, and makes a new bundle of all, _Floriferis ut apes in saltibus\nomnia libant_, I have laboriously [99]collected this cento out of divers\nwriters, and that _sine injuria_, I have wronged no authors, but given\nevery man his own; which [100]Hierom so much commends in Nepotian; he stole\nnot whole verses, pages, tracts, as some do nowadays, concealing their\nauthors' names, but still said this was Cyprian's, that Lactantius, that\nHilarius, so said Minutius Felix, so Victorinus, thus far Arnobius: I cite\nand quote mine authors (which, howsoever some illiterate scribblers account\npedantical, as a cloak of ignorance, and opposite to their affected fine\nstyle, I must and will use) _sumpsi, non suripui_; and what Varro, _lib. 6.\nde re rust._ speaks of bees, _minime maleficae nullius opus vellicantes\nfaciunt delerius_, I can say of myself, Whom have I injured? The matter is\ntheirs most part, and yet mine, _apparet unde sumptum sit_ (which Seneca\napproves), _aliud tamen quam unde sumptum sit apparet_, which nature doth\nwith the aliment of our bodies incorporate, digest, assimilate, I do\n_concoquere quod hausi_, dispose of what I take. I make them pay tribute,\nto set out this my Maceronicon, the method only is mine own, I must usurp\nthat of [101]Wecker _e Ter. nihil dictum quod non dictum prius, methodus\nsola artificem ostendit_, we can say nothing but what hath been said, the\ncomposition and method is ours only, and shows a scholar. Oribasius,\nAesius, Avicenna, have all out of Galen, but to their own method, _diverso\nstilo, non diversa fide_. Our poets steal from Homer; he spews, saith\nAelian, they lick it up. Divines use Austin's words verbatim still, and our\nstory-dressers do as much; he that comes last is commonly best,\n\n        ------\"donec quid grandius aetas\n        Postera sorsque ferat melior.\"------[102]\n\nThough there were many giants of old in physic and philosophy, yet I say\nwith [103]Didacus Stella, \"A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may\nsee farther than a giant himself;\" I may likely add, alter, and see farther\nthan my predecessors; and it is no greater prejudice for me to indite after\nothers, than for Aelianus Montaltus, that famous physician, to write _de\nmorbis capitis_ after Jason Pratensis, Heurnius, Hildesheim, &c., many\nhorses to run in a race, one logician, one rhetorician, after another.\nOppose then what thou wilt,\n\n       \"Allatres licet usque nos et usque\n        Et gannitibus improbis lacessas.\"\n\nI solve it thus. And for those other faults of barbarism, [104]Doric\ndialect, extemporanean style, tautologies, apish imitation, a rhapsody of\nrags gathered together from several dunghills, excrements of authors, toys\nand fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgment,\nwit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, fantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet,\nill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess\nall ('tis partly affected), thou canst not think worse of me than I do of\nmyself. 'Tis not worth the reading, I yield it, I desire thee not to lose\ntime in perusing so vain a subject, I should be peradventure loath myself\nto read him or thee so writing; 'tis not _operae, pretium_. All I say is\nthis, that I have [105]precedents for it, which Isocrates calls _perfugium\niis qui peccant_, others as absurd, vain, idle, illiterate, &c. _Nonnulli\nalii idem fecerunt_; others have done as much, it may be more, and perhaps\nthou thyself, _Novimus et qui te_, &c. We have all our faults; _scimus, et\nhanc, veniaim_, &c.; [106]thou censurest me, so have I done others, and may\ndo thee, _Cedimus inque vicem_, &c., 'tis _lex talionis, quid pro quo_. Go\nnow, censure, criticise, scoff, and rail.\n\n[107]  \"Nasutus cis usque licet, sis denique nasus:\n        Non potes in nugas dicere plura meas,\n        Ipse ego quam dixi, &c.\"\n\n       \"Wert thou all scoffs and flouts, a very Momus,\n        Than we ourselves, thou canst not say worse of us.\"\n\nThus, as when women scold, have I cried whore first, and in some men's\ncensures I am afraid I have overshot myself, _Laudare se vani, vituperare\nstulti_, as I do not arrogate, I will not derogate. _Primus vestrum non\nsum, nec imus_, I am none of the best, I am none of the meanest of you. As\nI am an inch, or so many feet, so many parasangs, after him or him, I may\nbe peradventure an ace before thee. Be it therefore as it is, well or ill,\nI have essayed, put myself upon the stage; I must abide the censure, I may\nnot escape it. It is most true, _stylus virum arguit_, our style bewrays\nus, and as [108]hunters find their game by the trace, so is a man's genius\ndescried by his works, _Multo melius ex sermone quam lineamentis, de\nmoribus hominum judicamus_; it was old Cato's rule. I have laid myself open\n(I know it) in this treatise, turned mine inside outward: I shall be\ncensured, I doubt not; for, to say truth with Erasmus, _nihil morosius\nhominum judiciis_, there is nought so peevish as men's judgments; yet this\nis some comfort, _ut palata, sic judicia_, our censures are as various as\nour palates.\n\n[109]  \"Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,\n        Poscentes vario multum diversa palato,\" &c.\n\n       \"Three guests I have, dissenting at my feast,\n        Requiring each to gratify his taste\n        With different food.\"\n\nOur writings are as so many dishes, our readers guests, our books like\nbeauty, that which one admires another rejects; so are we approved as men's\nfancies are inclined. _Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli._. That\nwhich is most pleasing to one is _amaracum sui_, most harsh to another.\n_Quot homines, tot sententiae_, so many men, so many minds: that which thou\ncondemnest he commends. [110]_Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque\nduobus_. He respects matter, thou art wholly for words; he loves a loose\nand free style, thou art all for neat composition, strong lines,\nhyperboles, allegories; he desires a fine frontispiece, enticing pictures,\nsuch as [111]Hieron. Natali the Jesuit hath cut to the Dominicals, to draw\non the reader's attention, which thou rejectest; that which one admires,\nanother explodes as most absurd and ridiculous. If it be not point blank to\nhis humour, his method, his conceit, [112]_si quid, forsan omissum, quod is\nanimo conceperit, si quae dictio_, &c. If aught be omitted, or added, which\nhe likes, or dislikes, thou art _mancipium paucae lectionis_, an idiot, an\nass, _nullus es_, or _plagiarius_, a trifler, a trivant, thou art an idle\nfellow; or else it is a thing of mere industry, a collection without wit or\ninvention, a very toy. [113]_Facilia sic putant omnes quae jam facta, nec\nde salebris cogitant, ubi via strata_; so men are valued, their labours\nvilified by fellows of no worth themselves, as things of nought, who could\nnot have done as much. _Unusquisque abundat sensu suo_, every man abounds\nin his own sense; and whilst each particular party is so affected, how\nshould one please all?\n\n[114]  \"Quid dem? quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet ille.\"\n\n        ------\"What courses must I choose?\n        What not? What both would order you refuse.\"\n\nHow shall I hope to express myself to each man's humour and [115]conceit,\nor to give satisfaction to all? Some understand too little, some too much,\n_qui similiter in legendos libros, atque in salutandos homines irruunt, non\ncogitantes quales, sed quibus vestibus induti sint_, as [116]Austin\nobserves, not regarding what, but who write, [117]_orexin habet auctores\ncelebritas_, not valuing the metal, but stamp that is upon it, _Cantharum\naspiciunt, non quid in eo_. If he be not rich, in great place, polite and\nbrave, a great doctor, or full fraught with grand titles, though never so\nwell qualified, he is a dunce; but, as [118]Baronius hath it of Cardinal\nCaraffa's works, he is a mere hog that rejects any man for his poverty.\nSome are too partial, as friends to overween, others come with a prejudice\nto carp, vilify, detract, and scoff; (_qui de me forsan, quicquid est, omni\ncontemptu contemptius judicant_) some as bees for honey, some as spiders to\ngather poison. What shall I do in this case? As a Dutch host, if you come\nto an inn in. Germany, and dislike your fare, diet, lodging, &c., replies\nin a surly tone, [119]_aliud tibi quaeras diversorium_, if you like not\nthis, get you to another inn: I resolve, if you like not my writing, go\nread something else. I do not much esteem thy censure, take thy course, it\nis not as thou wilt, nor as I will, but when we have both done, that of\n[120]Plinius Secundus to Trajan will prove true, \"Every man's witty labour\ntakes not, except the matter, subject, occasion, and some commending\nfavourite happen to it.\" If I be taxed, exploded by thee and some such, I\nshall haply be approved and commended by others, and so have been\n(_Expertus loquor_), and may truly say with [121]Jovius in like case,\n_(absit verbo jactantia) heroum quorundam, pontificum, et virorum nobilium\nfamiliaritatem et amicitiam, gratasque gratias, et multorum [122] bene\nlaudatorum laudes sum inde promeritus_, as I have been honoured by some\nworthy men, so have I been vilified by others, and shall be. At the first\npublishing of this book, (which [123]Probus of Persius satires), _editum\nlibrum continuo mirari homines, atque avide deripere caeperunt_, I may in\nsome sort apply to this my work. The first, second, and third edition were\nsuddenly gone, eagerly read, and, as I have said, not so much approved by\nsome, as scornfully rejected by others. But it was Democritus his fortune,\n_Idem admirationi et [124]irrisioni habitus_. 'Twas Seneca's fate, that\nsuperintendent of wit, learning, judgment, [125]_ad stuporem doctus_, the\nbest of Greek and Latin writers, in Plutarch's opinion; that \"renowned\ncorrector of vice,\" as, [126]Fabius terms him, \"and painful omniscious\nphilosopher, that writ so excellently and admirably well,\" could not please\nall parties, or escape censure. How is he vilified by [127] Caligula,\nAgellius, Fabius, and Lipsius himself, his chief propugner? _In eo pleraque\npernitiosa_, saith the same Fabius, many childish tracts and sentences he\nhath, _sermo illaboratus_, too negligent often and remiss, as Agellius\nobserves, _oratio vulgaris et protrita, dicaces et ineptae, sententiae,\neruditio plebeia_, an homely shallow writer as he is. _In partibus spinas\net fastidia habet_, saith [128]Lipsius; and, as in all his other works, so\nespecially in his epistles, _aliae in argutiis et ineptiis occupantur,\nintricatus alicubi, et parum compositus, sine copia rerum hoc fecit_, he\njumbles up many things together immethodically, after the Stoics' fashion,\n_parum ordinavit, multa accumulavit_, &c. If Seneca be thus lashed, and\nmany famous men that I could name, what shall I expect? How shall I that am\n_vix umbra tanti philosophi_ hope to please? \"No man so absolute\"\n([129]Erasmus holds) \"to satisfy all, except antiquity, prescription, &c.,\nset a bar.\" But as I have proved in Seneca, this will not always take\nplace, how shall I evade? 'Tis the common doom of all writers, I must (I\nsay) abide it; I seek not applause; [130]_Non ego ventosa venor suffragia\nplebis_; again, _non sum adeo informis_, I would not be [131]vilified:\n\n[132]   ------\"laudatus abunde,\n        Non fastiditus si tibi, lector, ero.\"\n\nI fear good men's censures, and to their favourable acceptance I submit my\nlabours,\n\n[133]   ------\"et linguas mancipiorum\n        Contemno.\"------\n\nAs the barking of a dog, I securely contemn those malicious and scurrile\nobloquies, flouts, calumnies of railers and detractors; I scorn the rest.\nWhat therefore I have said, _pro tenuitate mea_, I have said.\n\nOne or two things yet I was desirous to have amended if I could, concerning\nthe manner of handling this my subject, for which I must apologise,\n_deprecari_, and upon better advice give the friendly reader notice: it was\nnot mine intent to prostitute my muse in English, or to divulge _secreta\nMinervae_, but to have exposed this more contract in Latin, if I could have\ngot it printed. Any scurrile pamphlet is welcome to our mercenary\nstationers in English; they print all\n\n        ------\"cuduntque libellos\n        In quorum foliis vix simia nuda cacaret;\"\n\nBut in Latin they will not deal; which is one of the reasons [134]Nicholas\nCar, in his oration of the paucity of English writers, gives, that so many\nflourishing wits are smothered in oblivion, lie dead and buried in this our\nnation. Another main fault is, that I have not revised the copy, and\namended the style, which now flows remissly, as it was first conceived; but\nmy leisure would not permit; _Feci nec quod potui, nec quod volui_, I\nconfess it is neither as I would, nor as it should be.\n\n[135]  \"Cum relego scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno\n        Me quoque quae fuerant judice digna lini.\"\n\n       \"When I peruse this tract which I have writ,\n        I am abash'd, and much I hold unfit.\"\n\n_Et quod gravissimum_, in the matter itself, many things I disallow at this\npresent, which when I writ, [136]_Non eadem est aetas, non mens_; I would\nwillingly retract much, &c., but 'tis too late, I can only crave pardon now\nfor what is amiss.\n\nI might indeed, (had I wisely done) observed that precept of the poet,\n------_nonumque prematur in annum_, and have taken more care: or, as\nAlexander the physician would have done by lapis lazuli, fifty times washed\nbefore it be used, I should have revised, corrected and amended this tract;\nbut I had not (as I said) that happy leisure, no amanuenses or assistants.\nPancrates in [137]Lucian, wanting a servant as he went from Memphis to\nCoptus in Egypt, took a door bar, and after some superstitious words\npronounced (Eucrates the relator was then present) made it stand up like a\nserving-man, fetch him water, turn the spit, serve in supper, and what work\nhe would besides; and when he had done that service he desired, turned his\nman to a stick again. I have no such skill to make new men at my pleasure,\nor means to hire them; no whistle to call like the master of a ship, and\nbid them run, &c. I have no such authority, no such benefactors, as that\nnoble [138]Ambrosius was to Origen, allowing him six or seven amanuenses to\nwrite out his dictates; I must for that cause do my business myself, and\nwas therefore enforced, as a bear doth her whelps, to bring forth this\nconfused lump; I had not time to lick it into form, as she doth her young\nones, but even so to publish it, as it was first written _quicquid in\nbuccam venit_, in an extemporean style, as [139]I do commonly all other\nexercises, _effudi quicquid dictavit genius meus_, out of a confused\ncompany of notes, and writ with as small deliberation as I do ordinarily\nspeak, without all affectation of big words, fustian phrases, jingling\nterms, tropes, strong lines, that like [140]Acesta's arrows caught fire as\nthey flew, strains of wit, brave heats, elegies, hyperbolical exornations,\nelegancies, &c., which many so much affect. I am [141]_aquae potor_, drink\nno wine at all, which so much improves our modern wits, a loose, plain,\nrude writer, _ficum, voco ficum et ligonem ligonem_ and as free, as loose,\n_idem calamo quod in mente_, [142]I call a spade a spade, _animis haec\nscribo, non auribus_, I respect matter not words; remembering that of\nCardan, _verba propter res, non res propter verba_: and seeking with\nSeneca, _quid scribam, non quemadmodum_, rather _what_ than _how_ to write:\nfor as Philo thinks, [143]\"He that is conversant about matter, neglects\nwords, and those that excel in this art of speaking, have no profound\nlearning,\"\n\n[144]  \"Verba nitent phaleris, at nullus verba medullas\n        Intus habent\"------\n\nBesides, it was the observation of that wise Seneca, [145]\"when you see a\nfellow careful about his words, and neat in his speech, know this for a\ncertainty, that man's mind is busied about toys, there's no solidity in\nhim.\" _Non est ornamentum virile concinnitas_: as he said of a nightingale,\n------_vox es, praeterea nihil_, &c. I am therefore in this point a\nprofessed disciple of [146]Apollonius a scholar of Socrates, I neglect\nphrases, and labour wholly to inform my reader's understanding, not to\nplease his ear; 'tis not my study or intent to compose neatly, which an\norator requires, but to express myself readily and plainly as it happens.\nSo that as a river runs sometimes precipitate and swift, then dull and\nslow; now direct, then _per ambages_, now deep, then shallow; now muddy,\nthen clear; now broad, then narrow; doth my style flow: now serious, then\nlight; now comical, then satirical; now more elaborate, then remiss, as the\npresent subject required, or as at that time I was affected. And if thou\nvouchsafe to read this treatise, it shall seem no otherwise to thee, than\nthe way to an ordinary traveller, sometimes fair, sometimes foul; here\nchampaign, there enclosed; barren, in one place, better soil in another: by\nwoods, groves, hills, dales, plains, &c. I shall lead thee _per ardua\nmontium, et lubrica valllum, et roscida cespitum, et [147]glebosa\ncamporum_, through variety of objects, that which thou shalt like and\nsurely dislike.\n\nFor the matter itself or method, if it be faulty, consider I pray you that\nof _Columella, Nihil perfectum, aut a singulari consummatum industria_, no\nman can observe all, much is defective no doubt, may be justly taxed,\naltered, and avoided in Galen, Aristotle, those great masters. _Boni\nvenatoris_ ([148]one holds) _plures feras capere, non omnes_; he is a good\nhuntsman can catch some, not all: I have done my endeavour. Besides, I\ndwell not in this study, _Non hic sulcos ducimus, non hoc pulvere\ndesudamus_, I am but a smatterer, I confess, a stranger, [149]here and\nthere I pull a flower; I do easily grant, if a rigid censurer should\ncriticise on this which I have writ, he should not find three sole faults,\nas Scaliger in Terence, but three hundred. So many as he hath done in\nCardan's subtleties, as many notable errors as [150]Gul Laurembergius, a\nlate professor of Rostock, discovers in that anatomy of Laurentius, or\nBarocius the Venetian in _Sacro boscus_. And although this be a sixth\nedition, in which I should have been more accurate, corrected all those\nformer escapes, yet it was _magni laboris opus_, so difficult and tedious,\nthat as carpenters do find out of experience, 'tis much better build a new\nsometimes, than repair an old house; I could as soon write as much more, as\nalter that which is written. If aught therefore be amiss (as I grant there\nis), I require a friendly admonition, no bitter invective, [151]_Sint musis\nsocii Charites, Furia omnis abesto_, otherwise, as in ordinary\ncontroversies, _funem contentionis nectamus, sed cui bono_? We may contend,\nand likely misuse each other, but to what purpose? We are both scholars,\nsay,\n\n[152]   ------\"Arcades ambo\n        Et Cantare pares, et respondere parati.\"\n\n       \"Both young Arcadians, both alike inspir'd\n        To sing and answer as the song requir'd.\"\n\nIf we do wrangle, what shall we get by it? Trouble and wrong ourselves,\nmake sport to others. If I be convict of an error, I will yield, I will\namend. _Si quid bonis moribus, si quid veritati dissentaneum, in sacris vel\nhumanis literis a me dictum sit, id nec dictum esto_. In the mean time I\nrequire a favourable censure of all faults omitted, harsh compositions,\npleonasms of words, tautological repetitions (though Seneca bear me out,\n_nunquam nimis dicitur, quod nunquam satis dicitur_) perturbations of\ntenses, numbers, printers' faults, &c. My translations are sometimes rather\nparaphrases than interpretations, _non ad verbum_, but as an author, I use\nmore liberty, and that's only taken which was to my purpose. Quotations are\noften inserted in the text, which makes the style more harsh, or in the\nmargin, as it happened. Greek authors, Plato, Plutarch, Athenaeus, &c., I\nhave cited out of their interpreters, because the original was not so\nready. I have mingled _sacra prophanis_, but I hope not profaned, and in\nrepetition of authors' names, ranked them _per accidens_, not according to\nchronology; sometimes neoterics before ancients, as my memory suggested.\nSome things are here altered, expunged in this sixth edition, others\namended, much added, because many good [153]authors in all kinds are come\nto my hands since, and 'tis no prejudice, no such indecorum, or oversight.\n\n[154]  \"Nunquam ita quicquam bene subducta ratione ad vitam fuit,\n        Quin res, aetas, usus, semper aliquid apportent novi,\n        Aliquid moneant, ut illa quae scire te credas, nescias,\n        Et quae tibi putaris prima, in exercendo ut repudias.\"\n\n       \"Ne'er was ought yet at first contriv'd so fit,\n        But use, age, or something would alter it;\n        Advise thee better, and, upon peruse,\n        Make thee not say, and what thou tak'st refuse.\"\n\nBut I am now resolved never to put this treatise out again, _Ne quid\nnimis_, I will not hereafter add, alter, or retract; I have done. The last\nand greatest exception is, that I, being a divine, have meddled with\nphysic,\n\n[155]  \"Tantumne est ab re tua otii tibi,\n        Aliena ut cures, eaque nihil quae ad te attinent.\"\n\nWhich Menedemus objected to Chremes; have I so much leisure, or little\nbusiness of mine own, as to look after other men's matters which concern me\nnot? What have I to do with physic? _Quod medicorum est promittant medici_.\nThe [156]Lacedaemonians were once in counsel about state matters, a\ndebauched fellow spake excellent well, and to the purpose, his speech was\ngenerally approved: a grave senator steps up, and by all means would have\nit repealed, though good, because _dehonestabatur pessimo auctore_, it had\nno better an author; let some good man relate the same, and then it should\npass. This counsel was embraced, _factum est_, and it was registered\nforthwith, _Et sic bona sententia mansit, malus auctor mutatus est_. Thou\nsayest as much of me, stomachosus as thou art, and grantest, peradventure,\nthis which I have written in physic, not to be amiss, had another done it,\na professed physician, or so, but why should I meddle with this tract? Hear\nme speak. There be many other subjects, I do easily grant, both in humanity\nand divinity, fit to be treated of, of which had I written _ad\nostentationem_ only, to show myself, I should have rather chosen, and in\nwhich I have been more conversant, I could have more willingly luxuriated,\nand better satisfied myself and others; but that at this time I was fatally\ndriven upon this rock of melancholy, and carried away by this by-stream,\nwhich, as a rillet, is deducted from the main channel of my studies, in\nwhich I have pleased and busied myself at idle hours, as a subject most\nnecessary and commodious. Not that I prefer it before divinity, which I do\nacknowledge to be the queen of professions, and to which all the rest are\nas handmaids, but that in divinity I saw no such great need. For had I\nwritten positively, there be so many books in that kind, so many\ncommentators, treatises, pamphlets, expositions, sermons, that whole teams\nof oxen cannot draw them; and had I been as forward and ambitious as some\nothers, I might have haply printed a sermon at Paul's Cross, a sermon in\nSt. Marie's Oxon, a sermon in Christ Church, or a sermon before the right\nhonourable, right reverend, a sermon before the right worshipful, a sermon\nin Latin, in English, a sermon with a name, a sermon without, a sermon, a\nsermon, &c. But I have been ever as desirous to suppress my labours in this\nkind, as others have been to press and publish theirs. To have written in\ncontroversy had been to cut off an hydra's head, [157]_Lis litem generat_,\none begets another, so many duplications, triplications, and swarms of\nquestions. _In sacro bello hoc quod stili mucrone agitur_, that having once\nbegun, I should never make an end. One had much better, as [158]Alexander,\nthe sixth pope, long since observed, provoke a great prince than a begging\nfriar, a Jesuit, or a seminary priest, I will add, for _inexpugnabile genus\nhoc hominum_, they are an irrefragable society, they must and will have the\nlast word; and that with such eagerness, impudence, abominable lying,\nfalsifying, and bitterness in their questions they proceed, that as he\n[159]said, _furorne caecus, an rapit vis acrior, an culpa, responsum date_?\nBlind fury, or error, or rashness, or what it is that eggs them, I know\nnot, I am sure many times, which [160]Austin perceived long since,\n_tempestate contentionis, serenitas charitatis obnubilatur_, with this\ntempest of contention, the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be\ntoo many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more\nthan we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a\nracket, that as [161]Fabius said, \"It had been much better for some of them\nto have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to\ntheir own destruction.\"\n\n       \"At melius fuerat non scribere, namque tacere\n        Tutum semper erit,\"------[162]\n\n'Tis a general fault, so Severinus the Dane complains [163]in physic,\n\"unhappy men as we are, we spend our days in unprofitable questions and\ndisputations,\" intricate subtleties, _de lana caprina_ about moonshine in\nthe water, \"leaving in the mean time those chiefest treasures of nature\nuntouched, wherein the best medicines for all manner of diseases are to be\nfound, and do not only neglect them ourselves, but hinder, condemn, forbid,\nand scoff at others, that are willing to inquire after them.\" These motives\nat this present have induced me to make choice of this medicinal subject.\n\nIf any physician in the mean time shall infer, _Ne sutor ultra crepidam_,\nand find himself grieved that I have intruded into his profession, I will\ntell him in brief, I do not otherwise by them, than they do by us. If it be\nfor their advantage, I know many of their sect which have taken orders, in\nhope of a benefice, 'tis a common transition, and why may not a melancholy\ndivine, that can get nothing but by simony, profess physic? Drusianus an\nItalian (Crusianus, but corruptly, Trithemius calls him) [164]\"because he\nwas not fortunate in his practice, forsook his profession, and writ\nafterwards in divinity.\" Marcilius Ficinus was _semel et simul_; a priest\nand a physician at once, and [165]T. Linacer in his old age took orders.\nThe Jesuits profess both at this time, divers of them _permissu\nsuperiorum_, chirurgeons, panders, bawds, and midwives, &c. Many poor\ncountry-vicars, for want of other means, are driven to their shifts; to\nturn mountebanks, quacksalvers, empirics, and if our greedy patrons hold us\nto such hard conditions, as commonly they do, they will make most of us\nwork at some trade, as Paul did, at last turn taskers, maltsters,\ncostermongers, graziers, sell ale as some have done, or worse. Howsoever in\nundertaking this task, I hope I shall commit no great error or _indecorum_,\nif all be considered aright, I can vindicate myself with Georgius Braunus,\nand Hieronymus Hemingius, those two learned divines; who (to borrow a line\nor two of mine [166]elder brother) drawn by a \"natural love, the one of\npictures and maps, prospectives and chorographical delights, writ that\nample theatre of cities; the other to the study of genealogies, penned\n_theatrum genealogicum_.\" Or else I can excuse my studies with [167]Lessius\nthe Jesuit in like case. It is a disease of the soul on which I am to\ntreat, and as much appertaining to a divine as to a physician, and who\nknows not what an agreement there is betwixt these two professions? A good\ndivine either is or ought to be a good physician, a spiritual physician at\nleast, as our Saviour calls himself, and was indeed, Mat. iv. 23; Luke, v.\n18; Luke, vii. 8. They differ but in object, the one of the body, the other\nof the soul, and use divers medicines to cure; one amends _animam per\ncorpus_, the other _corpus per animam_ as [168]our Regius Professor of\nphysic well informed us in a learned lecture of his not long since. One\nhelps the vices and passions of the soul, anger, lust, desperation, pride,\npresumption, &c. by applying that spiritual physic; as the other uses\nproper remedies in bodily diseases. Now this being a common infirmity of\nbody and soul, and such a one that hath as much need of spiritual as a\ncorporal cure, I could not find a fitter task to busy myself about, a more\napposite theme, so necessary, so commodious, and generally concerning all\nsorts of men, that should so equally participate of both, and require a\nwhole physician. A divine in this compound mixed malady can do little\nalone, a physician in some kinds of melancholy much less, both make an\nabsolute cure.\n\n[169]  \"Alterius sic altera poscit opem.\"\n\n        ------\"when in friendship joined\n        A mutual succour in each other find.\"\n\nAnd 'tis proper to them both, and I hope not unbeseeming me, who am by my\nprofession a divine, and by mine inclination a physician. I had Jupiter in\nmy sixth house; I say with [170]Beroaldus, _non sum medicus, nec medicinae\nprorsus expers_, in the theory of physic I have taken some pains, not with\nan intent to practice, but to satisfy myself, which was a cause likewise of\nthe first undertaking of this subject.\n\nIf these reasons do not satisfy thee, good reader, as Alexander Munificus\nthat bountiful prelate, sometimes bishop of Lincoln, when he had built six\ncastles, _ad invidiam operis eluendam_, saith [171]Mr. Camden, to take away\nthe envy of his work (which very words Nubrigensis hath of Roger the rich\nbishop of Salisbury, who in king Stephen's time built Shirburn castle, and\nthat of Devises), to divert the scandal or imputation, which might be\nthence inferred, built so many religious houses. If this my discourse be\nover-medicinal, or savour too much of humanity, I promise thee that I will\nhereafter make thee amends in some treatise of divinity. But this I hope\nshall suffice, when you have more fully considered of the matter of this my\nsubject, _rem substratam_, melancholy, madness, and of the reasons\nfollowing, which were my chief motives: the generality of the disease, the\nnecessity of the cure, and the commodity or common good that will arise to\nall men by the knowledge of it, as shall at large appear in the ensuing\npreface. And I doubt not but that in the end you will say with me, that to\nanatomise this humour aright, through all the members of this our\nMicrocosmus, is as great a task, as to reconcile those chronological errors\nin the Assyrian monarchy, find out the quadrature of a circle, the creeks\nand sounds of the north-east, or north-west passages, and all out as good a\ndiscovery as that hungry [172]Spaniard's of Terra Australis Incognita, as\ngreat trouble as to perfect the motion of Mars and Mercury, which so\ncrucifies our astronomers, or to rectify the Gregorian Calendar. I am so\naffected for my part, and hope as [173]Theophrastus did by his characters,\n\"That our posterity, O friend Policles, shall be the better for this which\nwe have written, by correcting and rectifying what is amiss in themselves\nby our examples, and applying our precepts and cautions to their own use.\"\nAnd as that great captain Zisca would have a drum made of his skin when he\nwas dead, because he thought the very noise of it would put his enemies to\nflight, I doubt not but that these following lines, when they shall be\nrecited, or hereafter read, will drive away melancholy (though I be gone)\nas much as Zisca's drum could terrify his foes. Yet one caution let me give\nby the way to my present, or my future reader, who is actually melancholy,\nthat he read not the [174]symptoms or prognostics in this following tract,\nlest by applying that which he reads to himself, aggravating, appropriating\nthings generally spoken, to his own person (as melancholy men for the most\npart do) he trouble or hurt himself, and get in conclusion more harm than\ngood. I advise them therefore warily to peruse that tract, _Lapides\nloquitur_ (so said [175]Agrippa _de occ. Phil._) _et caveant lectores ne\ncerebrum iis excutiat_. The rest I doubt not they may securely read, and to\ntheir benefit. But I am over-tedious, I proceed.\n\nOf the necessity and generality of this which I have said, if any man\ndoubt, I shall desire him to make a brief survey of the world, as [176]\nCyprian adviseth Donat, \"supposing himself to be transported to the top of\nsome high mountain, and thence to behold the tumults and chances of this\nwavering world, he cannot choose but either laugh at, or pity it.\" S.\nHierom out of a strong imagination, being in the wilderness, conceived with\nhimself, that he then saw them dancing in Rome; and if thou shalt either\nconceive, or climb to see, thou shalt soon perceive that all the world is\nmad, that it is melancholy, dotes; that it is (which Epichthonius\nCosmopolites expressed not many years since in a map) made like a fool's\nhead (with that motto, _Caput helleboro dignum_) a crazed head, _cavea\nstultorum_, a fool's paradise, or as Apollonius, a common prison of gulls,\ncheaters, flatterers, &c. and needs to be reformed. Strabo in the ninth\nbook of his geography, compares Greece to the picture of a man, which\ncomparison of his, Nic. Gerbelius in his exposition of Sophianus' map,\napproves; the breast lies open from those Acroceraunian hills in Epirus, to\nthe Sunian promontory in Attica; Pagae and Magaera are the two shoulders;\nthat Isthmus of Corinth the neck; and Peloponnesus the head. If this\nallusion hold, 'tis sure a mad head; Morea may be Moria; and to speak what\nI think, the inhabitants of modern Greece swerve as much from reason and\ntrue religion at this day, as that Morea doth from the picture of a man.\nExamine the rest in like sort, and you shall find that kingdoms and\nprovinces are melancholy, cities and families, all creatures, vegetal,\nsensible, and rational, that all sorts, sects, ages, conditions, are out of\ntune, as in Cebes' table, _omnes errorem bibunt_, before they come into the\nworld, they are intoxicated by error's cup, from the highest to the lowest\nhave need of physic, and those particular actions in [177]Seneca, where\nfather and son prove one another mad, may be general; Porcius Latro shall\nplead against us all. For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?--[178]\n_Qui nil molitur inepte_, who is not brain-sick? Folly, melancholy,\nmadness, are but one disease, _Delirium_ is a common name to all.\nAlexander, Gordonius, Jason Pratensis, Savanarola, Guianerius, Montaltus,\nconfound them as differing _secundum magis et minus_; so doth David, Psal.\nxxxvii. 5. \"I said unto the fools, deal not so madly,\" and 'twas an old\nStoical paradox, _omnes stultos insanire_, [179]all fools are mad, though\nsome madder than others. And who is not a fool, who is free from\nmelancholy? Who is not touched more or less in habit or disposition? If in\ndisposition, \"ill dispositions beget habits, if they persevere,\" saith\n[180]Plutarch, habits either are, or turn to diseases. 'Tis the same which\nTully maintains in the second of his Tusculans, _omnium insipientum animi\nin morbo sunt, et perturbatorum_, fools are sick, and all that are troubled\nin mind: for what is sickness, but as [181]Gregory Tholosanus defines it,\n\"A dissolution or perturbation of the bodily league, which health\ncombines:\" and who is not sick, or ill-disposed? in whom doth not passion,\nanger, envy, discontent, fear and sorrow reign? Who labours not of this\ndisease? Give me but a little leave, and you shall see by what testimonies,\nconfessions, arguments, I will evince it, that most men are mad, that they\nhad as much need to go a pilgrimage to the Anticyrae (as in [182]Strabo's\ntime they did) as in our days they run to Compostella, our Lady of Sichem,\nor Lauretta, to seek for help; that it is like to be as prosperous a voyage\nas that of Guiana, and that there is much more need of hellebore than of\ntobacco.\n\nThat men are so misaffected, melancholy, mad, giddy-headed, hear the\ntestimony of Solomon, Eccl. ii. 12. \"And I turned to behold wisdom, madness\nand folly,\" &c. And ver. 23: \"All his days are sorrow, his travel grief,\nand his heart taketh no rest in the night.\" So that take melancholy in what\nsense you will, properly or improperly, in disposition or habit, for\npleasure or for pain, dotage, discontent, fear, sorrow, madness, for part,\nor all, truly, or metaphorically, 'tis all one. Laughter itself is madness\naccording to Solomon, and as St. Paul hath it, \"Worldly sorrow brings\ndeath.\" \"The hearts of the sons of men are evil, and madness is in their\nhearts while they live,\" Eccl. ix. 3. \"Wise men themselves are no better.\"\nEccl. i. 18. \"In the multitude of wisdom is much grief, and he that\nincreaseth wisdom, increaseth sorrow,\" chap. ii. 17. He hated life itself,\nnothing pleased him: he hated his labour, all, as [183]he concludes, is\n\"sorrow, grief, vanity, vexation of spirit.\" And though he were the wisest\nman in the world, _sanctuarium sapientiae_, and had wisdom in abundance, he\nwill not vindicate himself, or justify his own actions. \"Surely I am more\nfoolish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man in me,\" Prov.\nxxx. 2. Be they Solomon's words, or the words of Agur, the son of Jakeh,\nthey are canonical. David, a man after God's own heart, confesseth as much\nof himself, Psal. xxxvii. 21, 22. \"So foolish was I and ignorant, I was\neven as a beast before thee.\" And condemns all for fools, Psal. xciii.;\nxxxii. 9; xlix. 20. He compares them to \"beasts, horses, and mules, in\nwhich there is no understanding.\" The apostle Paul accuseth himself in like\nsort, 2 Cor. ix. 21. \"I would you would suffer a little my foolishness, I\nspeak foolishly.\" \"The whole head is sick,\" saith Esay, \"and the heart is\nheavy,\" cap. i. 5. And makes lighter of them than of oxen and asses, \"the\nox knows his owner,\" &c.: read Deut. xxxii. 6; Jer. iv.; Amos, iii. 1;\nEphes. v. 6. \"Be not mad, be not deceived, foolish Galatians, who hath\nbewitched you?\" How often are they branded with this epithet of madness and\nfolly? No word so frequent amongst the fathers of the Church and divines;\nyou may see what an opinion they had of the world, and how they valued\nmen's actions.\n\nI know that we think far otherwise, and hold them most part wise men that\nare in authority, princes, magistrates, [184]rich men, they are wise men\nborn, all politicians and statesmen must needs be so, for who dare speak\nagainst them? And on the other, so corrupt is our judgment, we esteem wise\nand honest men fools. Which Democritus well signified in an epistle of his\nto Hippocrates: [185]the \"Abderites account virtue madness,\" and so do most\nmen living. Shall I tell you the reason of it? [186]Fortune and Virtue,\nWisdom and Folly, their seconds, upon a time contended in the Olympics;\nevery man thought that Fortune and Folly would have the worst, and pitied\ntheir cases; but it fell out otherwise. Fortune was blind and cared not\nwhere she stroke, nor whom, without laws, _Audabatarum instar_, &c. Folly,\nrash and inconsiderate, esteemed as little what she said or did. Virtue and\nWisdom gave [187]place, were hissed out, and exploded by the common people;\nFolly and Fortune admired, and so are all their followers ever since:\nknaves and fools commonly fare and deserve best in worldlings' eyes and\nopinions. Many good men have no better fate in their ages: Achish, 1 Sam.\nxxi. 14, held David for a madman. [188]Elisha and the rest were no\notherwise esteemed. David was derided of the common people, Ps. ix. 7, \"I\nam become a monster to many.\" And generally we are accounted fools for\nChrist, 1 Cor. xiv. \"We fools thought his life madness, and his end without\nhonour,\" Wisd. v. 4. Christ and his Apostles were censured in like sort,\nJohn x.; Mark iii.; Acts xxvi. And so were all Christians in [189]Pliny's\ntime, _fuerunt et alii, similis dementiae_, &c. And called not long after,\n[190]_Vesaniae sectatores, eversores hominum, polluti novatores, fanatici,\ncanes, malefici, venefici, Galilaei homunciones_, &c. 'Tis an ordinary\nthing with us, to account honest, devout, orthodox, divine, religious,\nplain-dealing men, idiots, asses, that cannot, or will not lie and\ndissemble, shift, flatter, _accommodare se ad eum locum ubi nati sunt_,\nmake good bargains, supplant, thrive, _patronis inservire; solennes\nascendendi modos apprehendere, leges, mores, consuetudines recte observare,\ncandide laudare, fortiter defendere, sententias amplecti, dubitare de\nnullus, credere omnia, accipere omnia, nihil reprehendere, caeteraque quae\npromotionem ferunt et securitatem, quae sine ambage felicem, reddunt\nhominem, et vere sapientem apud nos_; that cannot temporise as other men\ndo, [191]hand and take bribes, &c. but fear God, and make a conscience of\ntheir doings. But the Holy Ghost that knows better how to judge, he calls\nthem fools. \"The fool hath said in his heart,\" Psal. liii. 1. \"And their\nways utter their folly,\" Psal. xlix. 14. [192]\"For what can be more mad,\nthan for a little worldly pleasure to procure unto themselves eternal\npunishment?\" As Gregory and others inculcate unto us.\n\nYea even all those great philosophers the world hath ever had in\nadmiration, whose works we do so much esteem, that gave precepts of wisdom\nto others, inventors of Arts and Sciences, Socrates the wisest man of his\ntime by the Oracle of Apollo, whom his two scholars, [193]Plato and [194]\nXenophon, so much extol and magnify with those honourable titles, \"best and\nwisest of all mortal men, the happiest, and most just;\" and as [195]\nAlcibiades incomparably commends him; Achilles was a worthy man, but\nBracides and others were as worthy as himself; Antenor and Nestor were as\ngood as Pericles, and so of the rest; but none present, before, or after\nSocrates, _nemo veterum neque eorum qui nunc sunt_, were ever such, will\nmatch, or come near him. Those seven wise men of Greece, those Britain\nDruids, Indian Brachmanni, Ethiopian Gymnosophist, Magi of the Persians,\nApollonius, of whom Philostratus, _Non doctus, sed natus sapiens_, wise\nfrom his cradle, Epicurus so much admired by his scholar Lucretius:\n\n       \"Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes\n        Perstrinxit stellas exortus ut aetherius sol.\"\n\n       \"Whose wit excell'd the wits of men as far,\n        As the sun rising doth obscure a star,\"\n\nOr that so much renowned Empedocles,\n\n[196]  \"Ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.\"\n\nAll those of whom we read such [197]hyperbolical eulogiums, as of\nAristotle, that he was wisdom itself in the abstract, [198]a miracle of\nnature, breathing libraries, as Eunapius of Longinus, lights of nature,\ngiants for wit, quintessence of wit, divine spirits, eagles in the clouds,\nfallen from heaven, gods, spirits, lamps of the world, dictators, _Nulla\nferant talem saecla futura virum_: monarchs, miracles, superintendents of\nwit and learning, _oceanus, phoenix, atlas, monstrum, portentum hominis,\norbis universi musaeum, ultimus humana naturae donatus, naturae maritus_,\n\n        ------\"merito cui doctior orbis\n        Submissis defert fascibus imperium.\"\n\nAs Aelian writ of Protagoras and Gorgias, we may say of them all, _tantum a\nsapientibus abfuerunt, quantum a viris pueri_, they were children in\nrespect, infants, not eagles, but kites; novices, illiterate, _Eunuchi\nsapientiae_. And although they were the wisest, and most admired in their\nage, as he censured Alexander, I do them, there were 10,000 in his army as\nworthy captains (had they been in place of command) as valiant as himself;\nthere were myriads of men wiser in those days, and yet all short of what\nthey ought to be. [199]Lactantius, in his book of wisdom, proves them to be\ndizzards, fools, asses, madmen, so full of absurd and ridiculous tenets,\nand brain-sick positions, that to his thinking never any old woman or sick\nperson doted worse. [200]Democritus took all from Leucippus, and left,\nsaith he, \"the inheritance of his folly to Epicurus,\" [201]_insanienti dum\nsapientiae_, &c. The like he holds of Plato, Aristippus, and the rest,\nmaking no difference [202]\"betwixt them and beasts, saving that they could\nspeak.\" [203]Theodoret in his tract, _De cur. grec. affect._ manifestly\nevinces as much of Socrates, whom though that Oracle of Apollo confirmed to\nbe the wisest man then living, and saved him from plague, whom 2000 years\nhave admired, of whom some will as soon speak evil as of Christ, yet _re\nvera_, he was an illiterate idiot, as [204]Aristophanes calls him,\n_irriscor et ambitiosus_, as his master Aristotle terms him, _scurra\nAtticus_, as Zeno, an [205]enemy to all arts and sciences, as Athaeneus, to\nphilosophers and travellers, an opiniative ass, a caviller, a kind of\npedant; for his manners, as Theod. Cyrensis describes him, a [206]\nsodomite, an atheist, (so convict by Anytus) _iracundus et ebrius, dicax_,\n&c. a pot-companion, by [207]Plato's own confession, a sturdy drinker; and\nthat of all others he was most sottish, a very madman in his actions and\nopinions. Pythagoras was part philosopher, part magician, or part witch. If\nyou desire to hear more of Apollonius, a great wise man, sometime\nparalleled by Julian the apostate to Christ, I refer you to that learned\ntract of Eusebius against Hierocles, and for them all to Lucian's\n_Piscator, Icaromenippus, Necyomantia_: their actions, opinions in general\nwere so prodigious, absurd, ridiculous, which they broached and maintained,\ntheir books and elaborate treatises were full of dotage, which Tully _ad\nAtticum_ long since observed, _delirant plerumque scriptores in libris\nsuis_, their lives being opposite to their words, they commended poverty to\nothers, and were most covetous themselves, extolled love and peace, and yet\npersecuted one another with virulent hate and malice. They could give\nprecepts for verse and prose, but not a man of them (as [208]Seneca tells\nthem home) could moderate his affections. Their music did show us _flebiles\nmodos_, &c. how to rise and fall, but they could not so contain themselves\nas in adversity not to make a lamentable tone. They will measure ground by\ngeometry, set down limits, divide and subdivide, but cannot yet prescribe\n_quantum homini satis_, or keep within compass of reason and discretion.\nThey can square circles, but understand not the state of their own souls,\ndescribe right lines and crooked, &c. but know not what is right in this\nlife, _quid in vita rectum sit, ignorant_; so that as he said, _Nescio an\nAnticyram ratio illis destinet omnem._ I think all the Anticyrae will not\nrestore them to their wits, [209]if these men now, that held [210]\nXenodotus' heart, Crates' liver, Epictetus' lantern, were so sottish, and\nhad no more brains than so many beetles, what shall we think of the\ncommonalty? what of the rest?\n\nYea, but you will infer, that is true of heathens, if they be conferred\nwith Christians, 1 Cor. iii. 19. \"The wisdom of this world is foolishness\nwith God, earthly and devilish,\" as James calls it, iii. 15. \"They were\nvain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was full of darkness,\"\nRom. i. 21, 22. \"When they professed themselves wise, became fools.\" Their\nwitty works are admired here on earth, whilst their souls are tormented in\nhell fire. In some sense, _Christiani Crassiani_, Christians are Crassians,\nand if compared to that wisdom, no better than fools. _Quis est sapiens?\nSolus Deus_, [211]Pythagoras replies, \"God is only wise,\" Rom. xvi. Paul\ndetermines \"only good,\" as Austin well contends, \"and no man living can be\njustified in his sight.\" \"God looked down from heaven upon the children of\nmen, to see if any did understand,\" Psalm liii. 2, 3, but all are corrupt,\nerr. Rom. iii. 12, \"None doeth good, no, not one.\" Job aggravates this, iv.\n18, \"Behold he found no steadfastness in his servants, and laid folly upon\nhis angels;\" 19. \"How much more on them that dwell in houses of clay?\" In\nthis sense we are all fools, and the [212]Scripture alone is _arx\nMinervae_, we and our writings are shallow and imperfect. But I do not so\nmean; even in our ordinary dealings we are no better than fools. \"All our\nactions,\" as [213]Pliny told Trajan, \"upbraid us of folly,\" our whole\ncourse of life is but matter of laughter: we are not soberly wise; and the\nworld itself, which ought at least to be wise by reason of his antiquity,\nas [214]Hugo de Prato Florido will have it, \"_semper stultizat_, is every\nday more foolish than other; the more it is whipped, the worse it is, and\nas a child will still be crowned with roses and flowers.\" We are apish in\nit, _asini bipedes_, and every place is full _inversorum Apuleiorum_ of\nmetamorphosed and two-legged asses, _inversorum Silenorum_, childish,\n_pueri instar bimuli, tremula patris dormientis in ulna_. Jovianus\nPontanus, Antonio Dial, brings in some laughing at an old man, that by\nreason of his age was a little fond, but as he admonisheth there, _Ne\nmireris mi hospes de hoc sene_, marvel not at him only, for _tota haec\ncivitas delirium_, all our town dotes in like sort, [215]we are a company\nof fools. Ask not with him in the poet, [216]_Larvae hunc intemperiae\ninsaniaeque agitant senem_? What madness ghosts this old man, but what\nmadness ghosts us all? For we are _ad unum omnes_, all mad, _semel\ninsanivimus omnes_ not once, but alway so, _et semel, et simul, et semper_,\never and altogether as bad as he; and not _senex bis puer, delira anus_,\nbut say it of us all, _semper pueri_, young and old, all dote, as\nLactantius proves out of Seneca; and no difference betwixt us and children,\nsaving that, _majora ludimus, et grandioribus pupis_, they play with babies\nof clouts and such toys, we sport with greater baubles. We cannot accuse or\ncondemn one another, being faulty ourselves, _deliramenta loqueris_, you\ntalk idly, or as [217]Mitio upbraided Demea, _insanis, auferte_, for we are\nas mad our own selves, and it is hard to say which is the worst. Nay, 'tis\nuniversally so, [218]_Vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia_.\n\nWhen [219]Socrates had taken great pains to find out a wise man, and to\nthat purpose had consulted with philosophers, poets, artificers, he\nconcludes all men were fools; and though it procured him both anger and\nmuch envy, yet in all companies he would openly profess it. When [220]\nSupputius in Pontanus had travelled all over Europe to confer with a wise\nman, he returned at last without his errand, and could find none. [221]\nCardan concurs with him, \"Few there are (for aught I can perceive) well in\ntheir wits.\" So doth [222]Tully, \"I see everything to be done foolishly and\nunadvisedly.\"\n\n       \"Ille sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum, unus utrique\n        Error, sed variis illudit partibus omnes.\"\n\n       \"One reels to this, another to that wall,\n        'Tis the same error that deludes them all.\"\n\n[223]They dote all, but not alike, [Greek: Mania gar pasin homoia], not in\nthe same kind, \"One is covetous, a second lascivious, a third ambitious, a\nfourth envious,\" &c. as Damasippus the Stoic hath well illustrated in the\npoet,\n\n[224]  \"Desipiunt omnes aeque ac tu.\"\n\n       \"And they who call you fool, with equal claim\n        May plead an ample title to the name.\"\n\n'Tis an inbred malady in every one of us, there is _seminarium stultitiae_,\na seminary of folly, \"which if it be stirred up, or get ahead, will run _in\ninfinitum_, and infinitely varies, as we ourselves are severally addicted,\"\nsaith [225]Balthazar Castilio: and cannot so easily be rooted out, it takes\nsuch fast hold, as Tully holds, _altae radices stultitiae_, [226]so we are\nbred, and so we continue. Some say there be two main defects of wit, error\nand ignorance, to which all others are reduced; by ignorance we know not\nthings necessary, by error we know them falsely. Ignorance is a privation,\nerror a positive act. From ignorance comes vice, from error heresy, &c. But\nmake how many kinds you will, divide and subdivide, few men are free, or\nthat do not impinge on some one kind or other. [227]_Sic plerumque agitat\nstultos inscitia_, as he that examines his own and other men's actions\nshall find.\n\n[228]Charon in Lucian, as he wittily feigns, was conducted by Mercury to\nsuch a place, where he might see all the world at once; after he had\nsufficiently viewed, and looked about, Mercury would needs know of him what\nhe had observed: He told him that he saw a vast multitude and a\npromiscuous, their habitations like molehills, the men as emmets, \"he could\ndiscern cities like so many hives of bees, wherein every bee had a sting,\nand they did nought else but sting one another, some domineering like\nhornets bigger than the rest, some like filching wasps, others as drones.\"\nOver their heads were hovering a confused company of perturbations, hope,\nfear, anger, avarice, ignorance, &c., and a multitude of diseases hanging,\nwhich they still pulled on their pates. Some were brawling, some fighting,\nriding, running, _sollicite ambientes, callide litigantes_ for toys and\ntrifles, and such momentary things, Their towns and provinces mere\nfactions, rich against poor, poor against rich, nobles against artificers,\nthey against nobles, and so the rest. In conclusion, he condemned them all\nfor madmen, fools, idiots, asses, _O stulti, quaenam haec est amentia_? O\nfools, O madmen, he exclaims, _insana studia, insani labores_, &c. Mad\nendeavours, mad actions, mad, mad, mad, [229]_O saeclum insipiens et\ninfacetum_, a giddy-headed age. Heraclitus the philosopher, out of a\nserious meditation of men's lives, fell a weeping, and with continual tears\nbewailed their misery, madness, and folly. Democritus on the other side,\nburst out a laughing, their whole life seemed to him so ridiculous, and he\nwas so far carried with this ironical passion, that the citizens of Abdera\ntook him to be mad, and sent therefore ambassadors to Hippocrates, the\nphysician, that he would exercise his skill upon him. But the story is set\ndown at large by Hippocrates, in his epistle to Damogetus, which because it\nis not impertinent to this discourse, I will insert verbatim almost as it\nis delivered by Hippocrates himself, with all the circumstances belonging\nunto it.\n\nWhen Hippocrates was now come to Abdera, the people of the city came\nflocking about him, some weeping, some intreating of him, that he would do\nhis best. After some little repast, he went to see Democritus, the people\nfollowing him, whom he found (as before) in his garden in the suburbs all\nalone, [230]\"sitting upon a stone under a plane tree, without hose or\nshoes, with a book on his knees, cutting up several beasts, and busy at his\nstudy.\" The multitude stood gazing round about to see the congress.\nHippocrates, after a little pause, saluted him by his name, whom he\nresaluted, ashamed almost that he could not call him likewise by his, or\nthat he had forgot it. Hippocrates demanded of him what he was doing: he\ntold him that he was [231]\"busy in cutting up several beasts, to find out\nthe cause of madness and melancholy.\" Hippocrates commended his work,\nadmiring his happiness and leisure. And why, quoth Democritus, have not you\nthat leisure? Because, replied Hippocrates, domestic affairs hinder,\nnecessary to be done for ourselves, neighbours, friends; expenses,\ndiseases, frailties and mortalities which happen; wife, children, servants,\nand such business which deprive us of our time. At this speech Democritus\nprofusely laughed (his friends and the people standing by, weeping in the\nmean time, and lamenting his madness). Hippocrates asked the reason why he\nlaughed. He told him, at the vanities and the fopperies of the time, to see\nmen so empty of all virtuous actions, to hunt so far after gold, having no\nend of ambition; to take such infinite pains for a little glory, and to be\nfavoured of men; to make such deep mines into the earth for gold, and many\ntimes to find nothing, with loss of their lives and fortunes. Some to love\ndogs, others horses, some to desire to be obeyed in many provinces,[232]\nand yet themselves will know no obedience. [233]Some to love their wives\ndearly at first, and after a while to forsake and hate them; begetting\nchildren, with much care and cost for their education, yet when they grow\nto man's estate, [234]to despise, neglect, and leave them naked to the\nworld's mercy. [235]Do not these behaviours express their intolerable\nfolly? When men live in peace, they covet war, detesting quietness, [236]\ndeposing kings, and advancing others in their stead, murdering some men to\nbeget children of their wives. How many strange humours are in men! When\nthey are poor and needy, they seek riches, and when they have them, they do\nnot enjoy them, but hide them under ground, or else wastefully spend them.\nO wise Hippocrates, I laugh at such things being done, but much more when\nno good comes of them, and when they are done to so ill purpose. There is\nno truth or justice found amongst them, for they daily plead one against\nanother, [237]the son against the father and the mother, brother against\nbrother, kindred and friends of the same quality; and all this for riches,\nwhereof after death they cannot be possessors. And yet notwithstanding they\nwill defame and kill one another, commit all unlawful actions, contemning\nGod and men, friends and country. They make great account of many senseless\nthings, esteeming them as a great part of their treasure, statues,\npictures, and such like movables, dear bought, and so cunningly wrought, as\nnothing but speech wanteth in them, [238]and yet they hate living persons\nspeaking to them. [239]Others affect difficult things; if they dwell on\nfirm land they will remove to an island, and thence to land again, being no\nway constant to their desires. They commend courage and strength in wars,\nand let themselves be conquered by lust and avarice; they are, in brief, as\ndisordered in their minds, as Thersites was in his body. And now, methinks,\nO most worthy Hippocrates, you should not reprehend my laughing, perceiving\nso many fooleries in men; [240]for no man will mock his own folly, but that\nwhich he seeth in a second, and so they justly mock one another. The\ndrunkard calls him a glutton whom he knows to be sober. Many men love the\nsea, others husbandry; briefly, they cannot agree in their own trades and\nprofessions, much less in their lives and actions.\n\nWhen Hippocrates heard these words so readily uttered, without\npremeditation, to declare the world's vanity, full of ridiculous\ncontrariety, he made answer, that necessity compelled men to many such\nactions, and divers wills ensuing from divine permission, that we might not\nbe idle, being nothing is so odious to them as sloth and negligence.\nBesides, men cannot foresee future events, in this uncertainty of human\naffairs; they would not so marry, if they could foretell the causes of\ntheir dislike and separation; or parents, if they knew the hour of their\nchildren's death, so tenderly provide for them; or an husbandman sow, if he\nthought there would be no increase; or a merchant adventure to sea, if he\nforesaw shipwreck; or be a magistrate, if presently to be deposed. Alas,\nworthy Democritus, every man hopes the best, and to that end he doth it,\nand therefore no such cause, or ridiculous occasion of laughter.\n\nDemocritus hearing this poor excuse, laughed again aloud, perceiving he\nwholly mistook him, and did not well understand what he had said concerning\nperturbations and tranquillity of the mind. Insomuch, that if men would\ngovern their actions by discretion and providence, they would not declare\nthemselves fools as now they do, and he should have no cause of laughter;\nbut (quoth he) they swell in this life as if they were immortal, and\ndemigods, for want of understanding. It were enough to make them wise, if\nthey would but consider the mutability of this world, and how it wheels\nabout, nothing being firm and sure. He that is now above, tomorrow is\nbeneath; he that sate on this side today, tomorrow is hurled on the other:\nand not considering these matters, they fall into many inconveniences and\ntroubles, coveting things of no profit, and thirsting after them, tumbling\nheadlong into many calamities. So that if men would attempt no more than\nwhat they can bear, they should lead contented lives, and learning to know\nthemselves, would limit their ambition, [241]they would perceive then that\nnature hath enough without seeking such superfluities, and unprofitable\nthings, which bring nothing with them but grief and molestation. As a fat\nbody is more subject to diseases, so are rich men to absurdities and\nfooleries, to many casualties and cross inconveniences. There are many that\ntake no heed what happeneth to others by bad conversation, and therefore\noverthrow themselves in the same manner through their own fault, not\nforeseeing dangers manifest. These are things (O more than mad, quoth he)\nthat give me matter of laughter, by suffering the pains of your impieties,\nas your avarice, envy, malice, enormous villainies, mutinies, unsatiable\ndesires, conspiracies, and other incurable vices; besides your\n[242]dissimulation and hypocrisy, bearing deadly hatred one to the other,\nand yet shadowing it with a good face, flying out into all filthy lusts,\nand transgressions of all laws, both of nature and civility. Many things\nwhich they have left off, after a while they fall to again, husbandry,\nnavigation; and leave again, fickle and inconstant as they are. When they\nare young, they would be old, and old, young. [243] Princes commend a\nprivate life; private men itch after honour: a magistrate commends a quiet\nlife; a quiet man would be in his office, and obeyed as he is: and what is\nthe cause of all this, but that they know not themselves? Some delight to\ndestroy, [244]one to build, another to spoil one country to enrich another\nand himself. [245]In all these things they are like children, in whom is no\njudgment or counsel and resemble beasts, saving that beasts are better than\nthey, as being contented with nature. [246] When shall you see a lion hide\ngold in the ground, or a bull contend for better pasture? When a boar is\nthirsty, he drinks what will serve him, and no more; and when his belly is\nfull, ceaseth to eat: but men are immoderate in both, as in lust--they\ncovet carnal copulation at set times; men always, ruinating thereby the\nhealth of their bodies. And doth it not deserve laughter to see an amorous\nfool torment himself for a wench; weep, howl for a misshapen slut, a dowdy\nsometimes, that might have his choice of the finest beauties? Is there any\nremedy for this in physic? I do anatomise and cut up these poor beasts,\n[247]to see these distempers, vanities, and follies, yet such proof were\nbetter made on man's body, if my kind nature would endure it: [248]who from\nthe hour of his birth is most miserable; weak, and sickly; when he sucks he\nis guided by others, when he is grown great practiseth unhappiness [249]and\nis sturdy, and when old, a child again, and repenteth him of his life past.\nAnd here being interrupted by one that brought books, he fell to it again,\nthat all were mad, careless, stupid. To prove my former speeches, look into\ncourts, or private houses. [250]Judges give judgment according to their own\nadvantage, doing manifest wrong to poor innocents to please others.\nNotaries alter sentences, and for money lose their deeds. Some make false\nmonies; others counterfeit false weights. Some abuse their parents, yea\ncorrupt their own sisters; others make long libels and pasquils, defaming\nmen of good life, and extol such as are lewd and vicious. Some rob one,\nsome another: [251]magistrates make laws against thieves, and are the\nveriest thieves themselves. Some kill themselves, others despair, not\nobtaining their desires. Some dance, sing, laugh, feast and banquet, whilst\nothers sigh, languish, mourn and lament, having neither meat, drink, nor\nclothes. [252]Some prank up their bodies, and have their minds full of\nexecrable vices. Some trot about [253]to bear false witness, and say\nanything for money; and though judges know of it, yet for a bribe they wink\nat it, and suffer false contracts to prevail against equity. Women are all\nday a dressing, to pleasure other men abroad, and go like sluts at home,\nnot caring to please their own husbands whom they should. Seeing men are so\nfickle, so sottish, so intemperate, why should not I laugh at those to whom\n[254]folly seems wisdom, will not be cured, and perceive it not?\n\nIt grew late: Hippocrates left him; and no sooner was he come away, but all\nthe citizens came about flocking, to know how he liked him. He told them in\nbrief, that notwithstanding those small neglects of his attire, body, diet,\n[255]the world had not a wiser, a more learned, a more honest man, and they\nwere much deceived to say that he was mad.\n\nThus Democritus esteemed of the world in his time, and this was the cause\nof his laughter: and good cause he had.\n\n[256]  \"Olim jure quidem, nunc plus Democrite ride;\n          Quin rides? vita haec nunc mage ridicula est.\"\n\n       \"Democritus did well to laugh of old,\n          Good cause he had, but now much more;\n        This life of ours is more ridiculous\n          Than that of his, or long before.\"\n\nNever so much cause of laughter as now, never so many fools and madmen.\n'Tis not one [257]Democritus will serve turn to laugh in these days; we\nhave now need of a \"Democritus to laugh at Democritus;\" one jester to flout\nat another, one fool to fleer at another: a great stentorian Democritus, as\nbig as that Rhodian Colossus, For now, as [258]Salisburiensis said in his\ntime, _totus mundus histrionem agit_, the whole world plays the fool; we\nhave a new theatre, a new scene, a new comedy of errors, a new company of\npersonate actors, _volupiae sacra_ (as Calcagninus willingly feigns in his\nApologues) are celebrated all the world over, [259]where all the actors\nwere madmen and fools, and every hour changed habits, or took that which\ncame next. He that was a mariner today, is an apothecary tomorrow; a smith\none while, a philosopher another, _in his volupiae ludis_; a king now with\nhis crown, robes, sceptre, attendants, by and by drove a loaded ass before\nhim like a carter, &c. If Democritus were alive now, he should see strange\nalterations, a new company of counterfeit vizards, whifflers, Cumane asses,\nmaskers, mummers, painted puppets, outsides, fantastic shadows, gulls,\nmonsters, giddy-heads, butterflies. And so many of them are indeed ([260]if\nall be true that I have read). For when Jupiter and Juno's wedding was\nsolemnised of old, the gods were all invited to the feast, and many noble\nmen besides: Amongst the rest came Crysalus, a Persian prince, bravely\nattended, rich in golden attires, in gay robes, with a majestical presence,\nbut otherwise an ass. The gods seeing him come in such pomp and state, rose\nup to give him place, _ex habitu hominem metientes_; [261]but Jupiter\nperceiving what he was, a light, fantastic, idle fellow, turned him and his\nproud followers into butterflies: and so they continue still (for aught I\nknow to the contrary) roving about in pied coats, and are called\nchrysalides by the wiser sort of men: that is, golden outsides, drones, and\nflies, and things of no worth. Multitudes of such, &c.\n\n[262]   ------\"ubique invenies\n        Stultos avaros, sycopliantas prodigos.\"\n\nMany additions, much increase of madness, folly, vanity, should Democritus\nobserve, were he now to travel, or could get leave of Pluto to come see\nfashions, as Charon did in Lucian to visit our cities of Moronia Pia, and\nMoronia Felix: sure I think he would break the rim of his belly with\nlaughing. [263]_Si foret in terris rideret Democritus, seu_, &c.\n\nA satirical Roman in his time, thought all vice, folly, and madness were\nall at full sea, [264]_Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit._\n\n[265]Josephus the historian taxeth his countrymen Jews for bragging of\ntheir vices, publishing their follies, and that they did contend amongst\nthemselves who should be most notorious in villainies; but we flow higher\nin madness, far beyond them,\n\n[266]  \"Mox daturi progeniem vitiosorem,\"\n\n       \"And yet with crimes to us unknown,\n        Our sons shall mark the coming age their own,\"\n\nand the latter end (you know whose oracle it is) is like to be worse. 'Tis\nnot to be denied, the world alters every day, _Ruunt urbes, regna\ntransferuntur, &c. variantur habitus, leges innovantur_, as [267]Petrarch\nobserves, we change language, habits, laws, customs, manners, but not\nvices, not diseases, not the symptoms of folly and madness, they are still\nthe same. And as a river, we see, keeps the like name and place, but not\nwater, and yet ever runs, [268]_Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis\naevum_; our times and persons alter, vices are the same, and ever will be;\nlook how nightingales sang of old, cocks crowed, kine lowed, sheep bleated,\nsparrows chirped, dogs barked, so they do still: we keep our madness still,\nplay the fools still, _nec dum finitus Orestes_; we are of the same humours\nand inclinations as our predecessors were; you shall find us all alike,\nmuch at one, we and our sons, _Et nati natorum, et qui nascuntur ab illis_.\nAnd so shall our posterity continue to the last. But to speak of times\npresent.\n\nIf Democritus were alive now, and should but see the superstition of our\nage, our [269]religious madness, as [270]Meteran calls it, _Religiosam\ninsaniam_, so many professed Christians, yet so few imitators of Christ; so\nmuch talk of religion, so much science, so little conscience; so much\nknowledge, so many preachers, so little practice; such variety of sects,\nsuch have and hold of all sides, [271]--_obvia signis Signa_, &c., such\nabsurd and ridiculous traditions and ceremonies: If he should meet a [272]\nCapuchin, a Franciscan, a Pharisaical Jesuit, a man-serpent, a\nshave-crowned Monk in his robes, a begging Friar, or, see their\nthree-crowned Sovereign Lord the Pope, poor Peter's successor, _servus\nservorum Dei_, to depose kings with his foot, to tread on emperors' necks,\nmake them stand barefoot and barelegged at his gates, hold his bridle and\nstirrup, &c. (O that Peter and Paul were alive to see this!) If he should\nobserve a [273]prince creep so devoutly to kiss his toe, and those red-cap\ncardinals, poor parish priests of old, now princes' companions; what would\nhe say? _Coelum ipsum petitur stultitia_. Had he met some of our devout\npilgrims going barefoot to Jerusalem, our lady of Lauretto, Rome, S. Iago,\nS. Thomas' Shrine, to creep to those counterfeit and maggot-eaten relics;\nhad he been present at a mass, and seen such kissing of paxes, crucifixes,\ncringes, duckings, their several attires and ceremonies, pictures of\nsaints, [274]indulgences, pardons, vigils, fasting, feasts, crossing,\nknocking, kneeling at Ave-Marias, bells, with many such; _--jucunda rudi\nspectacula plebi_,[275] praying in gibberish, and mumbling of beads. Had he\nheard an old woman say her prayers in Latin, their sprinkling of holy\nwater, and going a procession,\n\n[276]   ------\"incedunt monachorum agmina mille;\n        Quid momerem vexilla, cruces, idolaque culta,\" &c.\n\nTheir breviaries, bulls, hallowed beans, exorcisms, pictures, curious\ncrosses, fables, and baubles. Had he read the Golden Legend, the Turks'\nAlcoran, or Jews' Talmud, the Rabbins' Comments, what would he have\nthought? How dost thou think he might have been affected? Had he more\nparticularly examined a Jesuit's life amongst the rest, he should have seen\nan hypocrite profess poverty, [277]and yet possess more goods and lands\nthan many princes, to have infinite treasures and revenues; teach others to\nfast, and play the gluttons themselves; like watermen that row one way and\nlook another. [278]Vow virginity, talk of holiness, and yet indeed a\nnotorious bawd, and famous fornicator, _lascivum pecus_, a very goat. Monks\nby profession, [279]such as give over the world, and the vanities of it,\nand yet a Machiavellian rout [280]interested in all manner of state: holy\nmen, peace-makers, and yet composed of envy, lust, ambition, hatred, and\nmalice; firebrands, _adulta patriae pestis_, traitors, assassinats, _hac\nitur ad astra_, and this is to supererogate, and merit heaven for\nthemselves and others. Had he seen on the adverse side, some of our nice\nand curious schismatics in another extreme, abhor all ceremonies, and\nrather lose their lives and livings, than do or admit anything Papists have\nformerly used, though in things indifferent (they alone are the true\nChurch, _sal terrae, cum sint omnium insulsissimi_). Formalists, out of\nfear and base flattery, like so many weather-cocks turn round, a rout of\ntemporisers, ready to embrace and maintain all that is or shall be proposed\nin hope of preferment: another Epicurean company, lying at lurch as so many\nvultures, watching for a prey of Church goods, and ready to rise by the\ndownfall of any: as [281]Lucian said in like case, what dost thou think\nDemocritus would have done, had he been spectator of these things?\n\nOr had he but observed the common people follow like so many sheep one of\ntheir fellows drawn by the horns over a gap, some for zeal, some for fear,\n_quo se cunque rapit tempestas_, to credit all, examine nothing, and yet\nready to die before they will adjure any of those ceremonies to which they\nhave been accustomed; others out of hypocrisy frequent sermons, knock their\nbreasts, turn up their eyes, pretend zeal, desire reformation, and yet\nprofessed usurers, gripers, monsters of men, harpies, devils in their\nlives, to express nothing less.\n\nWhat would he have said to see, hear, and read so many bloody battles, so\nmany thousands slain at once, such streams of blood able to turn mills:\n_unius ob noxam furiasque_, or to make sport for princes, without any just\ncause, [282]\"for vain titles\" (saith Austin), \"precedency, some wench, or\nsuch like toy, or out of desire of domineering, vainglory, malice, revenge,\nfolly, madness,\" (goodly causes all, _ob quas universus orbis bellis et\ncaedibus misceatur_,) whilst statesmen themselves in the mean time are\nsecure at home, pampered with all delights and pleasures, take their ease,\nand follow their lusts, not considering what intolerable misery poor\nsoldiers endure, their often wounds, hunger, thirst, &c., the lamentable\ncares, torments, calamities, and oppressions that accompany such\nproceedings, they feel not, take no notice of it. \"So wars are begun, by\nthe persuasion of a few debauched, hair-brain, poor, dissolute, hungry\ncaptains, parasitical fawners, unquiet hotspurs, restless innovators, green\nheads, to satisfy one man's private spleen, lust, ambition, avarice,\" &c.;\n_tales rapiunt scelerata in praelia causae. Flos hominum_, proper men, well\nproportioned, carefully brought up, able both in body and mind, sound, led\nlike so many [283]beasts to the slaughter in the flower of their years,\npride, and full strength, without all remorse and pity, sacrificed to\nPluto, killed up as so many sheep, for devils' food, 40,000 at once. At\nonce, said I, that were tolerable, but these wars last always, and for many\nages; nothing so familiar as this hacking and hewing, massacres, murders,\ndesolations--_ignoto coelum clangore remugit_, they care not what mischief\nthey procure, so that they may enrich themselves for the present; they will\nso long blow the coals of contention, till all the world be consumed with\nfire. The [284]siege of Troy lasted ten years, eight months, there died\n870,000 Grecians, 670,000 Trojans, at the taking of the city, and after\nwere slain 276,000 men, women, and children of all sorts. Caesar killed a\nmillion, [285]Mahomet the second Turk, 300,000 persons; Sicinius Dentatus\nfought in a hundred battles, eight times in single combat he overcame, had\nforty wounds before, was rewarded with 140 crowns, triumphed nine times for\nhis good service. M. Sergius had 32 wounds; Scaeva, the Centurion, I know\nnot how many; every nation had their Hectors, Scipios, Caesars, and\nAlexanders! Our [286]Edward the Fourth was in 26 battles afoot: and as they\ndo all, he glories in it, 'tis related to his honour. At the siege of\nHierusalem, 1,100,000 died with sword and famine. At the battle of Cannas,\n70,000 men were slain, as [287]Polybius records, and as many at Battle\nAbbey with us; and 'tis no news to fight from sun to sun, as they did, as\nConstantine and Licinius, &c. At the siege of Ostend (the devil's academy)\na poor town in respect, a small fort, but a great grave, 120,000 men lost\ntheir lives, besides whole towns, dorps, and hospitals, full of maimed\nsoldiers; there were engines, fireworks, and whatsoever the devil could\ninvent to do mischief with 2,500,000 iron bullets shot of 40 pounds weight,\nthree or four millions of gold consumed. [288]\"Who\" (saith mine author)\n\"can be sufficiently amazed at their flinty hearts, obstinacy, fury,\nblindness, who without any likelihood of good success, hazard poor\nsoldiers, and lead them without pity to the slaughter, which may justly be\ncalled the rage of furious beasts, that run without reason upon their own\ndeaths:\" [289]_quis malus genius, quae furia quae pestis_, &c.; what\nplague, what fury brought so devilish, so brutish a thing as war first into\nmen's minds? Who made so soft and peaceable a creature, born to love,\nmercy, meekness, so to rave, rage like beasts, and run on to their own\ndestruction? how may Nature expostulate with mankind, _Ego te divinum\nanimal finxi_, &c.? I made thee an harmless, quiet, a divine creature: how\nmay God expostulate, and all good men? yet, _horum facta_ (as [290]one\ncondoles) _tantum admirantur, et heroum numero habent_: these are the brave\nspirits, the gallants of the world, these admired alone, triumph alone,\nhave statues, crowns, pyramids, obelisks to their eternal fame, that\nimmortal genius attends on them, _hac itur ad astra_. When Rhodes was\nbesieged, [291]_fossae urbis cadaveribus repletae sunt_, the ditches were\nfull of dead carcases: and as when the said Suleiman, great Turk,\nbeleaguered Vienna, they lay level with the top of the walls. This they\nmake a sport of, and will do it to their friends and confederates, against\noaths, vows, promises, by treachery or otherwise; [292]--_dolus an virtus?\nquis in hoste requirat_? leagues and laws of arms, ([293]_silent leges\ninter arma_,) for their advantage, _omnia jura, divina, humana, proculcata\nplerumque sunt_; God's and men's laws are trampled under foot, the sword\nalone determines all; to satisfy their lust and spleen, they care not what\nthey attempt, say, or do, [294]_Rara fides, probitasque viris qui castra\nsequuntur._ Nothing so common as to have [295] \"father fight against the\nson, brother against brother, kinsman against kinsman, kingdom against\nkingdom, province against province, Christians against Christians:\" _a\nquibus nec unquam cogitatione fuerunt laesi_, of whom they never had\noffence in thought, word, or deed. Infinite treasures consumed, towns\nburned, flourishing cities sacked and ruinated, _quodque animus meminisse\nhorret_, goodly countries depopulated and left desolate, old inhabitants\nexpelled, trade and traffic decayed, maids deflowered, _Virgines nondum\nthalamis jugatae, et comis nondum positis ephaebi_; chaste matrons cry out\nwith Andromache, [296]_Concubitum mox cogar pati ejus, qui interemit\nHectorem_, they shall be compelled peradventure to lie with them that erst\nkilled their husbands: to see rich, poor, sick, sound, lords, servants,\n_eodem omnes incommodo macti_, consumed all or maimed, &c. _Et quicquid\ngaudens scelere animus audet, et perversa mens_, saith Cyprian, and\nwhatsoever torment, misery, mischief, hell itself, the devil, [297] fury\nand rage can invent to their own ruin and destruction; so abominable a\nthing is [298]war, as Gerbelius concludes, _adeo foeda et abominanda res\nest bellum, ex quo hominum caedes, vastationes_, &c., the scourge of God,\ncause, effect, fruit and punishment of sin, and not _tonsura humani\ngeneris_ as Tertullian calls it, but _ruina_. Had Democritus been present\nat the late civil wars in France, those abominable wars--_bellaque matribus\ndetestata_, [299]\"where in less than ten years, ten thousand men were\nconsumed,\" saith Collignius, twenty thousand churches overthrown; nay, the\nwhole kingdom subverted (as [300]Richard Dinoth adds). So many myriads of\nthe commons were butchered up, with sword, famine, war, _tanto odio\nutrinque ut barbari ad abhorrendam lanienam obstupescerent_, with such\nferal hatred, the world was amazed at it: or at our late Pharsalian fields\nin the time of Henry the Sixth, betwixt the houses of Lancaster and York, a\nhundred thousand men slain, [301]one writes; [302]another, ten thousand\nfamilies were rooted out, \"that no man can but marvel,\" saith Comineus, \"at\nthat barbarous immanity, feral madness, committed betwixt men of the same\nnation, language, and religion.\" [303]_Quis furor, O cives_? \"Why do the\nGentiles so furiously rage,\" saith the Prophet David, Psal. ii. 1. But we\nmay ask, why do the Christians so furiously rage? [304]_Arma volunt, quare\nposcunt, rapiuntque juventus_? Unfit for Gentiles, much less for us so to\ntyrannise, as the Spaniard in the West Indies, that killed up in 42 years\n(if we may believe [305]Bartholomeus a Casa, their own bishop) 12 millions\nof men, with stupend and exquisite torments; neither should I lie (said he)\nif I said 50 millions. I omit those French massacres, Sicilian evensongs,\n[306]the Duke of Alva's tyrannies, our gunpowder machinations, and that\nfourth fury, as [307]one calls it, the Spanish inquisition, which quite\nobscures those ten persecutions, [308]------_saevit toto Mars impius orbe._\nIs not this [309]_mundus furiosus_, a mad world, as he terms it, _insanum\nbellum_? are not these mad men, as [310]Scaliger concludes, _qui in praelio\nacerba morte, insaniae, suae memoriam pro perpetuo teste relinquunt\nposteritati_; which leave so frequent battles, as perpetual memorials of\ntheir madness to all succeeding ages? Would this, think you, have enforced\nour Democritus to laughter, or rather made him turn his tune, alter his\ntone, and weep with [311]Heraclitus, or rather howl, [312]roar, and tear\nhis hair in commiseration, stand amazed; or as the poets feign, that Niobe\nwas for grief quite stupefied, and turned to a stone? I have not yet said\nthe worst, that which is more absurd and [313]mad, in their tumults,\nseditions, civil and unjust wars, [314]_quod stulte sucipitur, impie\ngeritur, misere finitur_. Such wars I mean; for all are not to be\ncondemned, as those fantastical Anabaptists vainly conceive. Our Christian\ntactics are all out as necessary as the Roman acies, or Grecian phalanx, to\nbe a soldier is a most noble and honourable profession (as the world is),\nnot to be spared, they are our best walls and bulwarks, and I do therefore\nacknowledge that of [315]Tully to be most true, \"All our civil affairs, all\nour studies, all our pleading, industry, and commendation lies under the\nprotection of warlike virtues, and whensoever there is any suspicion of\ntumult, all our arts cease;\" wars are most behoveful, _et bellatores\nagricolis civitati sunt utiliores_, as [316]Tyrius defends: and valour is\nmuch to be commended in a wise man; but they mistake most part, _auferre,\ntrucidare, rapere, falsis nominibus virtutem vocant_, &c. ('Twas Galgacus'\nobservation in Tacitus) they term theft, murder, and rapine, virtue, by a\nwrong name, rapes, slaughters, massacres, &c. _jocus et ludus_, are pretty\npastimes, as Ludovicus Vives notes. [317]\"They commonly call the most\nhair-brain bloodsuckers, strongest thieves, the most desperate villains,\ntreacherous rogues, inhuman murderers, rash, cruel and dissolute caitiffs,\ncourageous and generous spirits, heroical and worthy captains, [318]brave\nmen at arms, valiant and renowned soldiers, possessed with a brute\npersuasion of false honour,\" as Pontus Huter in his Burgundian history\ncomplains. By means of which it comes to pass that daily so many\nvoluntaries offer themselves, leaving their sweet wives, children, friends,\nfor sixpence (if they can get it) a day, prostitute their lives and limbs,\ndesire to enter upon breaches, lie sentinel, perdu, give the first onset,\nstand in the fore front of the battle, marching bravely on, with a cheerful\nnoise of drums and trumpets, such vigour and alacrity, so many banners\nstreaming in the air, glittering armours, motions of plumes, woods of\npikes, and swords, variety of colours, cost and magnificence, as if they\nwent in triumph, now victors to the Capitol, and with such pomp, as when\nDarius' army marched to meet Alexander at Issus. Void of all fear they run\ninto imminent dangers, cannon's mouth, &c., _ut vulneribus suis ferrum\nhostium hebetent_, saith [319]Barletius, to get a name of valour, humour\nand applause, which lasts not either, for it is but a mere flash this fame,\nand like a rose, _intra diem unum extinguitur_, 'tis gone in an instant. Of\n15,000 proletaries slain in a battle, scarce fifteen are recorded in\nhistory, or one alone, the General perhaps, and after a while his and their\nnames are likewise blotted out, the whole battle itself is forgotten. Those\nGrecian orators, _summa vi ingenii et eloquentiae_, set out the renowned\noverthrows at Thermopylae, Salamis, Marathon, Micale, Mantinea, Cheronaea,\nPlataea. The Romans record their battle at Cannas, and Pharsalian fields,\nbut they do but record, and we scarce hear of them. And yet this supposed\nhonour, popular applause, desire of immortality by this means, pride and\nvainglory spur them on many times rashly and unadvisedly, to make away\nthemselves and multitudes of others. Alexander was sorry, because there\nwere no more worlds for him to conquer, he is admired by some for it,\n_animosa vox videtur, et regia_, 'twas spoken like a Prince; but as wise\n[320]Seneca censures him, 'twas _vox inquissima et stultissima_, 'twas\nspoken like a Bedlam fool; and that sentence which the same [321]Seneca\nappropriates to his father Philip and him, I apply to them all, _Non\nminores fuere pestes mortalium quam inundatio, quam conflagratio, quibus_,\n&c. they did as much mischief to mortal men as fire and water, those\nmerciless elements when they rage. [322]Which is yet more to be lamented,\nthey persuade them this hellish course of life is holy, they promise heaven\nto such as venture their lives _bello sacro_, and that by these bloody\nwars, as Persians, Greeks, and Romans of old, as modern Turks do now their\ncommons, to encourage them to fight, _ut cadant infeliciter_. \"If they die\nin the field, they go directly to heaven, and shall be canonised for\nsaints.\" (O diabolical invention!) put in the Chronicles, _in perpetuam rei\nmemoriam_, to their eternal memory: when as in truth, as [323]some hold, it\nwere much better (since wars are the scourge of God for sin, by which he\npunisheth mortal men's peevishness and folly) such brutish stories were\nsuppressed, because _ad morum institutionem nihil habent_, they conduce not\nat all to manners, or good life. But they will have it thus nevertheless,\nand so they put note of [324]\"divinity upon the most cruel and pernicious\nplague of human kind,\" adore such men with grand titles, degrees, statues,\nimages, [325]honour, applaud, and highly reward them for their good\nservice, no greater glory than to die in the field. So Africanus is\nextolled by Ennius: Mars, and [326]Hercules, and I know not how many\nbesides of old, were deified; went this way to heaven, that were indeed\nbloody butchers, wicked destroyers, and troublers of the world, prodigious\nmonsters, hell-hounds, feral plagues, devourers, common executioners of\nhuman kind, as Lactantius truly proves, and Cyprian to Donat, such as were\ndesperate in wars, and precipitately made away themselves, (like those\nCelts in Damascen, with ridiculous valour, _ut dedecorosum putarent muro\nruenti se subducere_, a disgrace to run away for a rotten wall, now ready\nto fall on their heads,) such as will not rush on a sword's point, or seek\nto shun a cannon's shot, are base cowards, and no valiant men. By which\nmeans, _Madet orbis mutuo sanguine_, the earth wallows in her own blood,\n\n[327]_Savit amor ferri et scelerati insania belli_; and for that, which if\nit be done in private, a man shall be rigorously executed, [328]\"and which\nis no less than murder itself; if the same fact be done in public in wars,\nit is called manhood, and the party is honoured for it.\"\n\n[329]   ------\"Prosperum et felix scelus,\n        Virtus vocatur.\"------\n\nWe measure all as Turks do, by the event, and most part, as Cyprian notes,\nin all ages, countries, places, _saevitiae magnitudo impunitatem sceleris\nacquirit_; the foulness of the fact vindicates the offender. [330]One is\ncrowned for that which another is tormented: _Ille crucem sceleris precium\ntulit, hic diadema_; made a knight, a lord, an earl, a great duke, (as\n[331]Agrippa notes) for that which another should have hung in gibbets, as\na terror to the rest,\n\n[332]   ------\"et tamen alter,\n        Si fecisset idem, caderet sub judice morum.\"\n\nA poor sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing of victuals, compelled\nperadventure by necessity of that intolerable cold, hunger, and thirst, to\nsave himself from starving: but a [333]great man in office may securely rob\nwhole provinces, undo thousands, pill and poll, oppress _ad libitum_, flea,\ngrind, tyrannise, enrich himself by spoils of the commons, be\nuncontrollable in his actions, and after all, be recompensed with turgent\ntitles, honoured for his good service, and no man dare find fault, or [334]\nmutter at it.\n\nHow would our Democritus have been affected to see a wicked caitiff or\n[335]\"fool, a very idiot, a funge, a golden ass, a monster of men, to have\nmany good men, wise, men, learned men to attend upon him with all\nsubmission, as an appendix to his riches, for that respect alone, because\nhe hath more wealth and money,\" [336]\"to honour him with divine titles, and\nbombast epithets,\" to smother him with fumes and eulogies, whom they know\nto be a dizzard, a fool, a covetous wretch, a beast, &c. \"because he is\nrich?\" To see _sub exuviis leonis onagrum_, a filthy loathsome carcass, a\nGorgon's head puffed up by parasites, assume this unto himself, glorious\ntitles, in worth an infant, a Cuman ass, a painted sepulchre, an Egyptian\ntemple? To see a withered face, a diseased, deformed, cankered complexion,\na rotten carcass, a viperous mind, and Epicurean soul set out with orient\npearls, jewels, diadems, perfumes, curious elaborate works, as proud of his\nclothes as a child of his new coats; and a goodly person, of an angel-like\ndivine countenance, a saint, an humble mind, a meet spirit clothed in rags,\nbeg, and now ready to be starved? To see a silly contemptible sloven in\napparel, ragged in his coat, polite in speech, of a divine spirit, wise?\nanother neat in clothes, spruce, full of courtesy, empty of grace, wit,\ntalk nonsense?\n\nTo see so many lawyers, advocates, so many tribunals, so little justice; so\nmany magistrates, so little care of common good; so many laws, yet never\nmore disorders; _Tribunal litium segetem_, the Tribunal a labyrinth, so\nmany thousand suits in one court sometimes, so violently followed? To see\n_injustissimum saepe juri praesidentem, impium religioni, imperitissimum\neruditioni, otiosissimum labori, monstrosum humanitati_? to see a lamb\n[337]executed, a wolf pronounce sentence, _latro_ arraigned, and _fur_ sit\non the bench, the judge severely punish others, and do worse himself, [338]\n_cundem furtum facere et punire_, [339]_rapinam plectere, quum sit ipse\nraptor_? Laws altered, misconstrued, interpreted pro and con, as the\n[340]judge is made by friends, bribed, or otherwise affected as a nose of\nwax, good today, none tomorrow; or firm in his opinion, cast in his?\nSentence prolonged, changed, _ad arbitrium judicis_, still the same case,\n[341]\"one thrust out of his inheritance, another falsely put in by favour,\nfalse forged deeds or wills.\" _Incisae leges negliguntur_, laws are made\nand not kept; or if put in execution, [342]they be some silly ones that are\npunished. As, put case it be fornication, the father will disinherit or\nabdicate his child, quite cashier him (out, villain, be gone, come no more\nin my sight); a poor man is miserably tormented with loss of his estate\nperhaps, goods, fortunes, good name, for ever disgraced, forsaken, and must\ndo penance to the utmost; a mortal sin, and yet make the worst of it,\n_nunquid aliud fecit_, saith Tranio in the [343]poet, _nisi quod faciunt\nsummis nati generibus_? he hath done no more than what gentlemen usually\ndo. [344]_Neque novum, neque mirum, neque secus quam alii solent_. For in a\ngreat person, right worshipful Sir, a right honourable grandee, 'tis not a\nvenial sin, no, not a peccadillo, 'tis no offence at all, a common and\nordinary thing, no man takes notice of it; he justifies it in public, and\nperadventure brags of it,\n\n[345]  \"Nam quod turpe bonis, Titio, Seioque, decebat Crispinum\"------\n\n       \"For what would be base in good men, Titius, and Seius, became\n        Crispinus.\"\n\n[346]Many poor men, younger brothers, &c. by reason of bad policy and idle\neducation (for they are likely brought up in no calling), are compelled to\nbeg or steal, and then hanged for theft; than which, what can be more\nignominious, _non minus enim turpe principi multa supplicia, quam medico\nmulta funera_, 'tis the governor's fault. _Libentius verberant quam\ndocent_, as schoolmasters do rather correct their pupils, than teach them\nwhen they do amiss. [347]\"They had more need provide there should be no\nmore thieves and beggars, as they ought with good policy, and take away the\noccasions, than let them run on, as they do to their own destruction: root\nout likewise those causes of wrangling, a multitude of lawyers, and compose\ncontroversies, _lites lustrales et seculares_, by some more compendious\nmeans.\" Whereas now for every toy and trifle they go to law, [348]_Mugit\nlitibus insanum forum, et saevit invicem discordantium rabies_, they are\nready to pull out one another's throats; and for commodity [349]\"to squeeze\nblood,\" saith Hierom, \"out of their brother's heart,\" defame, lie,\ndisgrace, backbite, rail, bear false witness, swear, forswear, fight and\nwrangle, spend their goods, lives, fortunes, friends, undo one another, to\nenrich an harpy advocate, that preys upon them both, and cries _Eia\nSocrates, Eia Xantippe_; or some corrupt judge, that like the [350]kite in\nAesop, while the mouse and frog fought, carried both away. Generally they\nprey one upon another as so many ravenous birds, brute beasts, devouring\nfishes, no medium, [351]_omnes hic aut captantur aut captant; aut cadavera\nquae lacerantur, aut corvi qui lacerant_, either deceive or be deceived;\ntear others or be torn in pieces themselves; like so many buckets in a\nwell, as one riseth another falleth, one's empty, another's full; his ruin\nis a ladder to the third; such are our ordinary proceedings. What's the\nmarket? A place, according to [352]Anacharsis, wherein they cozen one\nanother, a trap; nay, what's the world itself? [353]A vast chaos, a\nconfusion of manners, as fickle as the air, _domicilium insanorum_, a\nturbulent troop full of impurities, a mart of walking spirits, goblins, the\ntheatre of hypocrisy, a shop of knavery, flattery, a nursery of villainy,\nthe scene of babbling, the school of giddiness, the academy of vice; a\nwarfare, _ubi velis nolis pugnandum, aut vincas aut succumbas_, in which\nkill or be killed; wherein every man is for himself, his private ends, and\nstands upon his own guard. No charity, [354]love, friendship, fear of God,\nalliance, affinity, consanguinity, Christianity, can contain them, but if\nthey be any ways offended, or that string of commodity be touched, they\nfall foul. Old friends become bitter enemies on a sudden for toys and small\noffences, and they that erst were willing to do all mutual offices of love\nand kindness, now revile and persecute one another to death, with more than\nVatinian hatred, and will not be reconciled. So long as they are behoveful,\nthey love, or may bestead each other, but when there is no more good to be\nexpected, as they do by an old dog, hang him up or cashier him: which [355]\nCato counts a great indecorum, to use men like old shoes or broken glasses,\nwhich are flung to the dunghill; he could not find in his heart to sell an\nold ox, much less to turn away an old servant: but they instead of\nrecompense, revile him, and when they have made him an instrument of their\nvillainy, as [356]Bajazet the second Emperor of the Turks did by Acomethes\nBassa, make him away, or instead of [357]reward, hate him to death, as\nSilius was served by Tiberius. In a word, every man for his own ends. Our\n_summum bonum_ is commodity, and the goddess we adore _Dea moneta_, Queen\nmoney, to whom we daily offer sacrifice, which steers our hearts, hands,\n[358]affections, all: that most powerful goddess, by whom we are reared,\ndepressed, elevated, [359]esteemed the sole commandress of our actions, for\nwhich we pray, run, ride, go, come, labour, and contend as fishes do for a\ncrumb that falleth into the water. It's not worth, virtue, (that's _bonum\ntheatrale_,) wisdom, valour, learning, honesty, religion, or any\nsufficiency for which we are respected, but [360]money, greatness, office,\nhonour, authority; honesty is accounted folly; knavery, policy; [361]men\nadmired out of opinion, not as they are, but as they seem to be: such\nshifting, lying, cogging, plotting, counterplotting, temporizing,\nnattering, cozening, dissembling, [362]\"that of necessity one must highly\noffend God if he be conformable to the world, _Cretizare cum Crete_, or\nelse live in contempt, disgrace and misery.\" One takes upon him temperance,\nholiness, another austerity, a third an affected kind of simplicity, when\nas indeed, he, and he, and he, and the rest are [363]\"hypocrites,\nambidexters,\" outsides, so many turning pictures, a lion on the one side,\na lamb on the other. [364]How would Democritus have been affected to see\nthese things!\n\nTo see a man turn himself into all shapes like a chameleon, or as Proteus,\n_omnia transformans sese in miracula rerum_, to act twenty parts and\npersons at once, for his advantage, to temporise and vary like Mercury the\nplanet, good with good; bad with bad; having a several face, garb, and\ncharacter for every one he meets; of all religions, humours, inclinations;\nto fawn like a spaniel, _mentitis et mimicis obsequis_; rage like a lion,\nbark like a cur, fight like a dragon, sting like a serpent, as meek as a\nlamb, and yet again grin like a tiger, weep like a crocodile, insult over\nsome, and yet others domineer over him, here command, there crouch,\ntyrannise in one place, be baffled in another, a wise man at home, a fool\nabroad to make others merry.\n\nTo see so much difference betwixt words and deeds, so many parasangs\nbetwixt tongue and heart, men like stage-players act variety of parts,\n[365]give good precepts to others, soar aloft, whilst they themselves\ngrovel on the ground.\n\nTo see a man protest friendship, kiss his hand, [366]_quem mallet truncatum\nvidere_, [367]smile with an intent to do mischief, or cozen him whom he\nsalutes, [368]magnify his friend unworthy with hyperbolical eulogiums; his\nenemy albeit a good man, to vilify and disgrace him, yea all his actions,\nwith the utmost that livor and malice can invent.\n\nTo see a [369]servant able to buy out his master, him that carries the mace\nmore worth than the magistrate, which Plato, _lib. 11, de leg._, absolutely\nforbids, Epictetus abhors. A horse that tills the [370]land fed with chaff,\nan idle jade have provender in abundance; him that makes shoes go barefoot\nhimself, him that sells meat almost pined; a toiling drudge starve, a drone\nflourish.\n\nTo see men buy smoke for wares, castles built with fools' heads, men like\napes follow the fashions in tires, gestures, actions: if the king laugh,\nall laugh;\n\n[371]  \"Rides? majore chachiano\n        Concutitur, flet si lachrymas conspexit amici.\"\n\n[372]Alexander stooped, so did his courtiers; Alphonsus turned his head,\nand so did his parasites. [373]Sabina Poppea, Nero's wife, wore\namber-coloured hair, so did all the Roman ladies in an instant, her fashion\nwas theirs.\n\nTo see men wholly led by affection, admired and censured out of opinion\nwithout judgment: an inconsiderate multitude, like so many dogs in a\nvillage, if one bark all bark without a cause: as fortune's fan turns, if a\nman be in favour, or commanded by some great one, all the world applauds\nhim; [374]if in disgrace, in an instant all hate him, and as at the sun\nwhen he is eclipsed, that erst took no notice, now gaze and stare upon him.\n\nTo see a man [375]wear his brains in his belly, his guts in his head, an\nhundred oaks on his back, to devour a hundred oxen at a meal, nay more, to\ndevour houses and towns, or as those Anthropophagi, [376]to eat one\nanother.\n\nTo see a man roll himself up like a snowball, from base beggary to right\nworshipful and right honourable titles, unjustly to screw himself into\nhonours and offices; another to starve his genius, damn his soul to gather\nwealth, which he shall not enjoy, which his prodigal son melts and consumes\nin an instant. [377]\n\nTo see the [Greek: kakozaelian] of our times, a man bend all his forces,\nmeans, time, fortunes, to be a favorite's favorite's favorite, &c., a\nparasite's parasite's parasite, that may scorn the servile world as having\nenough already.\n\nTo see an hirsute beggar's brat, that lately fed on scraps, crept and\nwhined, crying to all, and for an old jerkin ran of errands, now ruffle in\nsilk and satin, bravely mounted, jovial and polite, now scorn his old\nfriends and familiars, neglect his kindred, insult over his betters,\ndomineer over all.\n\nTo see a scholar crouch and creep to an illiterate peasant for a meal's\nmeat; a scrivener better paid for an obligation; a falconer receive greater\nwages than a student; a lawyer get more in a day than a philosopher in a\nyear, better reward for an hour, than a scholar for a twelvemonth's study;\nhim that can [378]paint Thais, play on a fiddle, curl hair, &c., sooner get\npreferment than a philologer or a poet.\n\nTo see a fond mother, like Aesop's ape, hug her child to death, a [379]\nwittol wink at his wife's honesty, and too perspicuous in all other\naffairs; one stumble at a straw, and leap over a block; rob Peter, and pay\nPaul; scrape unjust sums with one hand, purchase great manors by\ncorruption, fraud and cozenage, and liberally to distribute to the poor\nwith the other, give a remnant to pious uses, &c. Penny wise, pound\nfoolish; blind men judge of colours; wise men silent, fools talk; [380]\nfind fault with others, and do worse themselves; [381]denounce that in\npublic which he doth in secret; and which Aurelius Victor gives out of\nAugustus, severely censure that in a third, of which he is most guilty\nhimself.\n\nTo see a poor fellow, or an hired servant venture his life for his new\nmaster that will scarce give him his wages at year's end; A country colon\ntoil and moil, till and drudge for a prodigal idle drone, that devours all\nthe gain, or lasciviously consumes with fantastical expenses; A noble man\nin a bravado to encounter death, and for a small flash of honour to cast\naway himself; A worldling tremble at an executor, and yet not fear\nhell-fire; To wish and hope for immortality, desire to be happy, and yet by\nall means avoid death, a necessary passage to bring him to it.\n\nTo see a foolhardy fellow like those old Danes, _qui decollari malunt quam\nverberari_, die rather than be punished, in a sottish humour embrace death\nwith alacrity, yet [382]scorn to lament his own sins and miseries, or his\nclearest friends' departures.\n\nTo see wise men degraded, fools preferred, one govern towns and cities, and\nyet a silly woman overrules him at home; [383]Command a province, and yet\nhis own servants or children prescribe laws to him, as Themistocles' son\ndid in Greece; [384]\"What I will\" (said he) \"my mother will, and what my\nmother will, my father doth.\" To see horses ride in a coach, men draw it;\ndogs devour their masters; towers build masons; children rule; old men go\nto school; women wear the breeches; [385]sheep demolish towns, devour men,\n&c. And in a word, the world turned upside downward. _O viveret\nDemocritus_.\n\n[386]To insist in every particular were one of Hercules' labours, there's\nso many ridiculous instances, as motes in the sun. _Quantum est in rebus\ninane_? (How much vanity there is in things!) And who can speak of all?\n_Crimine ab uno disce omnes_, take this for a taste.\n\nBut these are obvious to sense, trivial and well known, easy to be\ndiscerned. How would Democritus have been moved, had he seen [387]the\nsecrets of their hearts? If every man had a window in his breast, which\nMomus would have had in Vulcan's man, or that which Tully so much wished it\nwere written in every man's forehead, _Quid quisque de republica sentiret_,\nwhat he thought; or that it could be effected in an instant, which Mercury\ndid by Charon in Lucian, by touching of his eyes, to make him discern\n_semel et simul rumores et susurros_.\n\n       \"Spes hominum caecas, morbos, votumque labores,\n        Et passim toto volitantes aethere curas.\"\n\n       \"Blind hopes and wishes, their thoughts and affairs,\n        Whispers and rumours, and those flying cares.\"\n\nThat he could _cubiculorum obductas foras recludere et secreta cordium\npenetrare_, which [388]Cyprian desired, open doors and locks, shoot bolts,\nas Lucian's Gallus did with a feather of his tail: or Gyges' invisible\nring, or some rare perspective glass, or _Otacousticon_, which would so\nmultiply species, that a man might hear and see all at once (as [389]\nMartianus Capella's Jupiter did in a spear which he held in his hand, which\ndid present unto him all that was daily done upon the face of the earth),\nobserve cuckolds' horns, forgeries of alchemists, the philosopher's stone,\nnew projectors, &c., and all those works of darkness, foolish vows, hopes,\nfears and wishes, what a deal of laughter would it have afforded? He should\nhave seen windmills in one man's head, an hornet's nest in another. Or had\nhe been present with Icaromenippus in Lucian at Jupiter's whispering place,\n[390]and heard one pray for rain, another for fair weather; one for his\nwife's, another for his father's death, &c.; \"to ask that at God's hand\nwhich they are abashed any man should hear:\" How would he have been\nconfounded? Would he, think you, or any man else, say that these men were\nwell in their wits? _Haec sani esse hominis quis sanus juret Orestes_? Can\nall the hellebore in the Anticyrae cure these men? No, sure, [391]\"an acre\nof hellebore will not do it.\"\n\nThat which is more to be lamented, they are mad like Seneca's blind woman,\nand will not acknowledge, or [392]seek for any cure of it, for _pauci\nvident morbum suum, omnes amant_. If our leg or arm offend us, we covet by\nall means possible to redress it; [393]and if we labour of a bodily\ndisease, we send for a physician; but for the diseases of the mind we take\nno notice of them: [394]Lust harrows us on the one side; envy, anger,\nambition on the other. We are torn in pieces by our passions, as so many\nwild horses, one in disposition, another in habit; one is melancholy,\nanother mad; [395]and which of us all seeks for help, doth acknowledge his\nerror, or knows he is sick? As that stupid fellow put out the candle\nbecause the biting fleas should not find him; he shrouds himself in an\nunknown habit, borrowed titles, because nobody should discern him. Every\nman thinks with himself, _Egomet videor mihi sanus_, I am well, I am wise,\nand laughs at others. And 'tis a general fault amongst them all, that [396]\nwhich our forefathers have approved, diet, apparel, opinions, humours,\ncustoms, manners, we deride and reject in our time as absurd. Old men\naccount juniors all fools, when they are mere dizzards; and as to sailors,\n------_terraeque urbesque recedunt_------ they move, the land stands still,\nthe world hath much more wit, they dote themselves. Turks deride us, we\nthem; Italians Frenchmen, accounting them light headed fellows, the French\nscoff again at Italians, and at their several customs; Greeks have\ncondemned all the world but themselves of barbarism, the world as much\nvilifies them now; we account Germans heavy, dull fellows, explode many of\ntheir fashions; they as contemptibly think of us; Spaniards laugh at all,\nand all again at them. So are we fools and ridiculous, absurd in our\nactions, carriages, diet, apparel, customs, and consultations; we [397]\nscoff and point one at another, when as in conclusion all are fools, [398]\n\"and they the veriest asses that hide their ears most.\" A private man if he\nbe resolved with himself, or set on an opinion, accounts all idiots and\nasses that are not affected as he is, [399]------_nil rectum, nisi quod\nplacuit sibi, ducit_, that are not so minded, [400](_quodque volunt homines\nse bene velle putant_,) all fools that think not as he doth: he will not\nsay with Atticus, _Suam quisque sponsam, mihi meam_, let every man enjoy\nhis own spouse; but his alone is fair, _suus amor_, &c. and scorns all in\nrespect of himself [401]will imitate none, hear none [402]but himself, as\nPliny said, a law and example to himself. And that which Hippocrates, in\nhis epistle to Dionysius, reprehended of old, is verified in our times,\n_Quisque in alio superfluum esse censet, ipse quod non habet nec curat_,\nthat which he hath not himself or doth not esteem, he accounts superfluity,\nan idle quality, a mere foppery in another: like Aesop's fox, when he had\nlost his tail, would have all his fellow foxes cut off theirs. The Chinese\nsay, that we Europeans have one eye, they themselves two, all the world\nelse is blind: (though [403]Scaliger accounts them brutes too, _merum\npecus_,) so thou and thy sectaries are only wise, others indifferent, the\nrest beside themselves, mere idiots and asses. Thus not acknowledging our\nown errors and imperfections, we securely deride others, as if we alone\nwere free, and spectators of the rest, accounting it an excellent thing, as\nindeed it is, _Aliena optimum frui insania_, to make ourselves merry with\nother men's obliquities, when as he himself is more faulty than the rest,\n_mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur_, he may take himself by the nose for\na fool; and which one calls _maximum stultitiae specimen_, to be ridiculous\nto others, and not to perceive or take notice of it, as Marsyas was when he\ncontended with Apollo, _non intelligens se deridiculo haberi_, saith [404]\nApuleius; 'tis his own cause, he is a convicted madman, as [405]Austin well\ninfers \"in the eyes of wise men and angels he seems like one, that to our\nthinking walks with his heels upwards.\" So thou laughest at me, and I at\nthee, both at a third; and he returns that of the poet upon us again,\n[406]_Hei mihi, insanire me aiunt, quum ipsi ultro insaniant_. We accuse\nothers of madness, of folly, and are the veriest dizzards ourselves. For it\nis a great sign and property of a fool (which Eccl. x. 3, points at) out of\npride and self-conceit to insult, vilify, condemn, censure, and call other\nmen fools (_Non videmus manticae quod a tergo est_) to tax that in others\nof which we are most faulty; teach that which we follow not ourselves: For\nan inconstant man to write of constancy, a profane liver prescribe rules of\nsanctity and piety, a dizzard himself make a treatise of wisdom, or with\nSallust to rail downright at spoilers of countries, and yet in [407]office\nto be a most grievous poller himself. This argues weakness, and is an\nevident sign of such parties' indiscretion. [408]_Peccat uter nostrum cruce\ndignius_? \"Who is the fool now?\" Or else peradventure in some places we are\nall mad for company, and so 'tis not seen, _Satietas erroris et dementiae,\npariter absurditatem et admirationem tollit_. 'Tis with us, as it was of\nold (in [409]Tully's censure at least) with C. Pimbria in Rome, a bold,\nhair-brain, mad fellow, and so esteemed of all, such only excepted, that\nwere as mad as himself: now in such a case there is [410]no notice taken of\nit.\n\n       \"Nimirum insanus paucis videatur; eo quod\n        Maxima pars hominum morbo jactatur eodem.\"\n\n       \"When all are mad, where all are like opprest\n        Who can discern one mad man from the rest?\"\n\nBut put case they do perceive it, and some one be manifestly convicted of\nmadness, [411]he now takes notice of his folly, be it in action, gesture,\nspeech, a vain humour he hath in building, bragging, jangling, spending,\ngaming, courting, scribbling, prating, for which he is ridiculous to\nothers, [412]on which he dotes, he doth acknowledge as much: yet with all\nthe rhetoric thou hast, thou canst not so recall him, but to the contrary\nnotwithstanding, he will persevere in his dotage. 'Tis _amabilis insania,\net mentis gratissimus error_, so pleasing, so delicious, that he [413]\ncannot leave it. He knows his error, but will not seek to decline it, tell\nhim what the event will be, beggary, sorrow, sickness, disgrace, shame,\nloss, madness, yet [414]\"an angry man will prefer vengeance, a lascivious\nhis whore, a thief his booty, a glutton his belly, before his welfare.\"\nTell an epicure, a covetous man, an ambitious man of his irregular course,\nwean him from it a little, _pol me occidistis amici_, he cries anon, you\nhave undone him, and as [415]a \"dog to his vomit,\" he returns to it again;\nno persuasion will take place, no counsel, say what thou canst,\n\n       \"Clames licet et mare coelo\n        ------Confundas, surdo narras,\"[416]\n\ndemonstrate as Ulysses did to [417]Elpenor and Gryllus, and the rest of his\ncompanions \"those swinish men,\" he is irrefragable in his humour, he will\nbe a hog still; bray him in a mortar, he will be the same. If he be in an\nheresy, or some perverse opinion, settled as some of our ignorant Papists\nare, convince his understanding, show him the several follies and absurd\nfopperies of that sect, force him to say, _veris vincor_, make it as clear\nas the sun, [418]he will err still, peevish and obstinate as he is; and as\nhe said [419]_si in hoc erro, libenter erro, nec hunc errorem auferri mihi\nvolo_; I will do as I have done, as my predecessors have done, [420]and as\nmy friends now do: I will dote for company. Say now, are these men [421]mad\nor no, [422]_Heus age responde_? are they ridiculous? _cedo quemvis\narbitrum_, are they _sanae mentis_, sober, wise, and discreet? have they\ncommon sense? ------[423]_uter est insanior horum_? I am of Democritus'\nopinion for my part, I hold them worthy to be laughed at; a company of\nbrain-sick dizzards, as mad as [424]Orestes and Athamas, that they may go\n\"ride the ass,\" and all sail along to the Anticyrae, in the \"ship of fools\"\nfor company together. I need not much labour to prove this which I say\notherwise than thus, make any solemn protestation, or swear, I think you\nwill believe me without an oath; say at a word, are they fools? I refer it\nto you, though you be likewise fools and madmen yourselves, and I as mad to\nask the question; for what said our comical Mercury?\n\n[425]  \"Justum ab injustis petere insipientia est.\"\n\n       \"I'll stand to your censure yet, what think you?\"\n\nBut forasmuch as I undertook at first, that kingdoms, provinces, families,\nwere melancholy as well as private men, I will examine them in particular,\nand that which I have hitherto dilated at random, in more general terms, I\nwill particularly insist in, prove with more special and evident arguments,\ntestimonies, illustrations, and that in brief. [426]_Nunc accipe quare\ndesipiant omnes aeque ac tu._ My first argument is borrowed from Solomon,\nan arrow drawn out of his sententious quiver, Pro. iii. 7, \"Be not wise in\nthine own eyes.\" And xxvi. 12, \"Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?\nmore hope is of a fool than of him.\" Isaiah pronounceth a woe against such\nmen, cap. v. 21, \"that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own\nsight.\" For hence we may gather, that it is a great offence, and men are\nmuch deceived that think too well of themselves, an especial argument to\nconvince them of folly. Many men (saith [427]Seneca) \"had been without\nquestion wise, had they not had an opinion that they had attained to\nperfection of knowledge already, even before they had gone half way,\" too\nforward, too ripe, _praeproperi_, too quick and ready, [428]_cito\nprudentes, cito pii, cito mariti, cito patres, cito sacerdotes, cito omnis\nofficii capaces et curiosi_, they had too good a conceit of themselves, and\nthat marred all; of their worth, valour, skill, art, learning, judgment,\neloquence, their good parts; all their geese are swans, and that manifestly\nproves them to be no better than fools. In former times they had but seven\nwise men, now you can scarce find so many fools. Thales sent the golden\ntripos, which the fishermen found, and the oracle commanded to be [429]\n\"given to the wisest, to Bias, Bias to Solon,\" &c. If such a thing were now\nfound, we should all fight for it, as the three goddesses did for the\ngolden apple, we are so wise: we have women politicians, children\nmetaphysicians; every silly fellow can square a circle, make perpetual\nmotions, find the philosopher's stone, interpret Apocalypses, make new\nTheories, a new system of the world, new Logic, new Philosophy, &c. _Nostra\nutique regio_, saith [430]Petronius, \"our country is so full of deified\nspirits, divine souls, that you may sooner find a God than a man amongst\nus,\" we think so well of ourselves, and that is an ample testimony of much\nfolly.\n\nMy second argument is grounded upon the like place of Scripture, which\nthough before mentioned in effect, yet for some reasons is to be repeated\n(and by Plato's good leave, I may do it, [431][Greek: dis to kalon raethen\nouden blaptei]) \"Fools\" (saith David) \"by reason of their transgressions.\"\n&c. Psal. cvii. 17. Hence Musculus infers all transgressors must needs be\nfools. So we read Rom. ii., \"Tribulation and anguish on the soul of every\nman that doeth evil;\" but all do evil. And Isaiah, lxv. 14, \"My servant\nshall sing for joy, and [432]ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and vexation\nof mind.\" 'Tis ratified by the common consent of all philosophers.\n\"Dishonesty\" (saith Cardan) \"is nothing else but folly and madness.\" [433]\n_Probus quis nobiscum vivit_? Show me an honest man, _Nemo malus qui non\nstultus_, 'tis Fabius' aphorism to the same end. If none honest, none wise,\nthen all fools. And well may they be so accounted: for who will account him\notherwise, _Qui iter adornat in occidentem, quum properaret in orientem_?\nthat goes backward all his life, westward, when he is bound to the east? or\nhold him a wise man (saith [434]Musculus) \"that prefers momentary pleasures\nto eternity, that spends his master's goods in his absence, forthwith to be\ncondemned for it?\" _Nequicquam sapit qui sibi non sapit_, who will say that\na sick man is wise, that eats and drinks to overthrow the temperature of\nhis body? Can you account him wise or discreet that would willingly have\nhis health, and yet will do nothing that should procure or continue it?\n[435]Theodoret, out of Plotinus the Platonist, \"holds it a ridiculous thing\nfor a man to live after his own laws, to do that which is offensive to God,\nand yet to hope that he should save him: and when he voluntarily neglects\nhis own safety, and contemns the means, to think to be delivered by\nanother:\" who will say these men are wise?\n\nA third argument may be derived from the precedent, [436]all men are\ncarried away with passion, discontent, lust, pleasures, &c., they generally\nhate those virtues they should love, and love such vices they should hate.\nTherefore more than melancholy, quite mad, brute beasts, and void of\nreason, so Chrysostom contends; \"or rather dead and buried alive,\" as [437]\nPhilo Judeus concludes it for a certainty, \"of all such that are carried\naway with passions, or labour of any disease of the mind. Where is fear and\nsorrow,\" there [438]Lactantius stiffly maintains, \"wisdom cannot dwell,\"\n\n        ------\"qui cupiet, metuet quoque porro,\n        Qui metuens vivit, liber mihi non erit unquam.\"[439]\n\nSeneca and the rest of the stoics are of opinion, that where is any the\nleast perturbation, wisdom may not be found. \"What more ridiculous,\" as\n[440]Lactantius urges, than to hear how Xerxes whipped the Hellespont,\nthreatened the Mountain Athos, and the like. To speak _ad rem_, who is free\nfrom passion? [441]_Mortalis nemo est quem non attingat dolor, morbusve_,\nas [442]Tully determines out of an old poem, no mortal men can avoid sorrow\nand sickness, and sorrow is an inseparable companion from melancholy.\n[443]Chrysostom pleads farther yet, that they are more than mad, very\nbeasts, stupefied and void of common sense: \"For how\" (saith he) \"shall I\nknow thee to be a man, when thou kickest like an ass, neighest like a horse\nafter women, ravest in lust like a bull, ravenest like a bear, stingest\nlike a scorpion, rakest like a wolf, as subtle as a fox, as impudent as a\ndog? Shall I say thou art a man, that hast all the symptoms of a beast? How\nshall I know thee to be a man? by thy shape? That affrights me more, when I\nsee a beast in likeness of a man.\"\n\n[444]Seneca calls that of Epicurus, _magnificam vocem_, an heroical speech,\n\"A fool still begins to live,\" and accounts it a filthy lightness in men,\nevery day to lay new foundations of their life, but who doth otherwise? One\ntravels, another builds; one for this, another for that business, and old\nfolks are as far out as the rest; _O dementem senectutem_, Tully exclaims.\nTherefore young, old, middle age, are all stupid, and dote.\n\n[445]Aeneas Sylvius, amongst many other, sets down three special ways to\nfind a fool by. He is a fool that seeks that he cannot find: he is a fool\nthat seeks that, which being found will do him more harm than good: he is a\nfool, that having variety of ways to bring him to his journey's end, takes\nthat which is worst. If so, methinks most men are fools; examine their\ncourses, and you shall soon perceive what dizzards and mad men the major\npart are.\n\nBeroaldus will have drunkards, afternoon men, and such as more than\nordinarily delight in drink, to be mad. The first pot quencheth thirst, so\nPanyasis the poet determines in _Athenaeus, secunda gratiis, horis et\nDyonisio_: the second makes merry, the third for pleasure, _quarta, ad\ninsaniam_, the fourth makes them mad. If this position be true, what a\ncatalogue of mad men shall we have? what shall they be that drink four\ntimes four? _Nonne supra omnem furorem, supra omnem insanian reddunt\ninsanissimos_? I am of his opinion, they are more than mad, much worse than\nmad.\n\nThe [446]Abderites condemned Democritus for a mad man, because he was\nsometimes sad, and sometimes again profusely merry. _Hac Patria_ (saith\nHippocrates) _ob risum furere et insanire dicunt_, his countrymen hold him\nmad because he laughs; [447]and therefore \"he desires him to advise all his\nfriends at Rhodes, that they do not laugh too much, or be over sad.\" Had\nthose Abderites been conversant with us, and but seen what [448] fleering\nand grinning there is in this age, they would certainly have concluded, we\nhad been all out of our wits.\n\nAristotle in his Ethics holds _felix idemque sapiens_, to be wise and\nhappy, are reciprocal terms, _bonus idemque sapiens honestus_. 'Tis [449]\nTully's paradox, \"wise men are free, but fools are slaves,\" liberty is a\npower to live according to his own laws, as we will ourselves: who hath\nthis liberty? who is free?\n\n[450]   ------\"sapiens sibique imperiosus,\n        Quem neque pauperis, neque mors, neque vincula terrent,\n        Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores\n        Fortis, et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus.\"\n\n       \"He is wise that can command his own will,\n        Valiant and constant to himself still,\n        Whom poverty nor death, nor bands can fright,\n        Checks his desires, scorns honours, just and right.\"\n\nBut where shall such a man be found? If no where, then _e diametro_, we are\nall slaves, senseless, or worse. _Nemo malus felix_. But no man is happy\nin this life, none good, therefore no man wise. [451]_Rari quippe\nboni_------ For one virtue you shall find ten vices in the same party;\n_pauci Promethei, multi Epimethei_. We may peradventure usurp the name, or\nattribute it to others for favour, as Carolus Sapiens, Philippus Bonus,\nLodovicus Pius, &c., and describe the properties of a wise man, as Tully\ndoth an orator, Xenophon Cyrus, Castilio a courtier, Galen temperament, an\naristocracy is described by politicians. But where shall such a man be\nfound?\n\n       \"Vir bonus et sapiens, qualem vix repperit unum\n        Millibus e multis hominum consultus Apollo.\"\n\n       \"A wise, a good man in a million,\n        Apollo consulted could scarce find one.\"\n\nA man is a miracle of himself, but Trismegistus adds, _Maximum miraculum\nhomo sapiens_, a wise man is a wonder: _multi Thirsigeri, pauci Bacchi_.\n\nAlexander when he was presented with that rich and costly casket of king\nDarius, and every man advised him what to put in it, he reserved it to keep\nHomer's works, as the most precious jewel of human wit, and yet [452]\nScaliger upbraids Homer's muse, _Nutricem insanae sapientiae_, a nursery of\nmadness, [453]impudent as a court lady, that blushes at nothing. Jacobus\nMycillus, Gilbertus Cognatus, Erasmus, and almost all posterity admire\nLucian's luxuriant wit, yet Scaliger rejects him in his censure, and calls\nhim the Cerberus of the muses. Socrates, whom all the world so much\nmagnified, is by Lactantius and Theodoret condemned for a fool. Plutarch\nextols Seneca's wit beyond all the Greeks, _nulli secundus_, yet [454]\nSeneca saith of himself, \"when I would solace myself with a fool, I reflect\nupon myself, and there I have him.\" Cardan, in his Sixteenth Book of\nSubtleties, reckons up twelve supereminent, acute philosophers, for worth,\nsubtlety, and wisdom: Archimedes, Galen, Vitruvius, Architas Tarentinus,\nEuclid, Geber, that first inventor of Algebra, Alkindus the Mathematician,\nboth Arabians, with others. But his _triumviri terrarum_ far beyond the\nrest, are Ptolomaeus, Plotinus, Hippocrates. Scaliger _exercitat. 224_,\nscoffs at this censure of his, calls some of them carpenters and\nmechanicians, he makes Galen _fimbriam Hippocratis_, a skirt of\nHippocrates: and the said [455]Cardan himself elsewhere condemns both Galen\nand Hippocrates for tediousness, obscurity, confusion. Paracelsus will have\nthem both mere idiots, infants in physic and philosophy. Scaliger and\nCardan admire Suisset the Calculator, _qui pene modum excessit humani\ningenii_, and yet [456]Lod. Vives calls them _nugas Suisseticas_: and\nCardan, opposite to himself in another place, contemns those ancients in\nrespect of times present, [457]_Majoresque nostros ad presentes collatos\njuste pueros appellari_. In conclusion, the said [458]Cardan and Saint\nBernard will admit none into this catalogue of wise men, [459]but only\nprophets and apostles; how they esteem themselves, you have heard before.\nWe are worldly-wise, admire ourselves, and seek for applause: but hear\nSaint [460]Bernard, _quanto magis foras es sapiens, tanto magis intus\nstultus efficeris_, &c. _in omnibus es prudens, circa teipsum insipiens_:\nthe more wise thou art to others, the more fool to thyself. I may not deny\nbut that there is some folly approved, a divine fury, a holy madness, even\na spiritual drunkenness in the saints of God themselves; _sanctum insanium_\nBernard calls it (though not as blaspheming [461]Vorstius, would infer it\nas a passion incident to God himself, but) familiar to good men, as that of\nPaul, 2 Cor. \"he was a fool,\" &c. and Rom. ix. he wisheth himself to be\nanathematised for them. Such is that drunkenness which Ficinus speaks of,\nwhen the soul is elevated and ravished with a divine taste of that heavenly\nnectar, which poets deciphered by the sacrifice of Dionysius, and in this\nsense with the poet, [462]_insanire lubet_, as Austin exhorts us, _ad\nebrietatem se quisque paret_, let's all be mad and [463]drunk. But we\ncommonly mistake, and go beyond our commission, we reel to the opposite\npart, [464]we are not capable of it, [465]and as he said of the Greeks,\n_Vos Graeci semper pueri, vos Britanni, Galli, Germani, Itali_, &c. you are\na company of fools.\n\nProceed now _a partibus ad totum_, or from the whole to parts, and you\nshall find no other issue, the parts shall be sufficiently dilated in this\nfollowing Preface. The whole must needs follow by a sorites or induction.\nEvery multitude is mad, [466]_bellua multorum capitum_, (a many-headed\nbeast), precipitate and rash without judgment, _stultum animal_, a roaring\nrout. [467]Roger Bacon proves it out of Aristotle, _Vulgus dividi in\noppositum contra sapientes, quod vulgo videtur verum, falsum est_; that\nwhich the commonalty accounts true, is most part false, they are still\nopposite to wise men, but all the world is of this humour (_vulgus_), and\nthou thyself art _de vulgo_, one of the commonalty; and he, and he, and so\nare all the rest; and therefore, as Phocion concludes, to be approved in\nnought you say or do, mere idiots and asses. Begin then where you will, go\nbackward or forward, choose out of the whole pack, wink and choose, you\nshall find them all alike, \"never a barrel better herring.\"\n\nCopernicus, Atlas his successor, is of opinion, the earth is a planet,\nmoves and shines to others, as the moon doth to us. Digges, Gilbert,\nKeplerus, Origanus, and others, defend this hypothesis of his in sober\nsadness, and that the moon is inhabited: if it be so that the earth is a\nmoon, then are we also giddy, vertiginous and lunatic within this sublunary\nmaze.\n\nI could produce such arguments till dark night: if you should hear the\nrest,\n\n       \"Ante diem clauso component vesper Olimpo:\"\n\n       \"Through such a train of words if I should run,\n        The day would sooner than the tale be done:\"\n\nbut according to my promise, I will descend to particulars. This melancholy\nextends itself not to men only, but even to vegetals and sensibles. I speak\nnot of those creatures which are saturnine, melancholy by nature, as lead,\nand such like minerals, or those plants, rue, cypress, &c. and hellebore\nitself, of which [468]Agrippa treats, fishes, birds, and beasts, hares,\nconies, dormice, &c., owls, bats, nightbirds, but that artificial, which is\nperceived in them all. Remove a plant, it will pine away, which is\nespecially perceived in date trees, as you may read at large in\nConstantine's husbandry, that antipathy betwixt the vine and the cabbage,\nvine and oil. Put a bird in a cage, he will die for sullenness, or a beast\nin a pen, or take his young ones or companions from him, and see what\neffect it will cause. But who perceives not these common passions of\nsensible creatures, fear, sorrow, &c. Of all other, dogs are most subject\nto this malady, insomuch some hold they dream as men do, and through\nviolence of melancholy run mad; I could relate many stories of dogs that\nhave died for grief, and pined away for loss of their masters, but they are\ncommon in every [469]author.\n\nKingdoms, provinces, and politic bodies are likewise sensible and subject\nto this disease, as [470]Boterus in his politics hath proved at large. \"As\nin human bodies\" (saith he) \"there be divers alterations proceeding from\nhumours, so be there many diseases in a commonwealth, which do as diversely\nhappen from several distempers,\" as you may easily perceive by their\nparticular symptoms. For where you shall see the people civil, obedient to\nGod and princes, judicious, peaceable and quiet, rich, fortunate, [471]and\nflourish, to live in peace, in unity and concord, a country well tilled,\nmany fair built and populous cities, _ubi incolae nitent_ as old [472]Cato\nsaid, the people are neat, polite and terse, _ubi bene, beateque vivunt_,\nwhich our politicians make the chief end of a commonwealth; and which [473]\nAristotle, _Polit. lib. 3, cap. 4_, calls _Commune bonum_, Polybius _lib.\n6_, _optabilem et selectum statum_, that country is free from melancholy;\nas it was in Italy in the time of Augustus, now in China, now in many other\nflourishing kingdoms of Europe. But whereas you shall see many discontents,\ncommon grievances, complaints, poverty, barbarism, beggary, plagues, wars,\nrebellions, seditions, mutinies, contentions, idleness, riot, epicurism,\nthe land lie untilled, waste, full of bogs, fens, deserts, &c., cities\ndecayed, base and poor towns, villages depopulated, the people squalid,\nugly, uncivil; that kingdom, that country, must needs be discontent,\nmelancholy, hath a sick body, and had need to be reformed.\n\nNow that cannot well be effected, till the causes of these maladies be\nfirst removed, which commonly proceed from their own default, or some\naccidental inconvenience: as to be situated in a bad clime, too far north,\nsterile, in a barren place, as the desert of Libya, deserts of Arabia,\nplaces void of waters, as those of Lop and Belgian in Asia, or in a bad\nair, as at Alexandretta, Bantam, Pisa, Durrazzo, S. John de Ulloa, &c., or\nin danger of the sea's continual inundations, as in many places of the Low\nCountries and elsewhere, or near some bad neighbours, as Hungarians to\nTurks, Podolians to Tartars, or almost any bordering countries, they live\nin fear still, and by reason of hostile incursions are oftentimes left\ndesolate. So are cities by reason [474]of wars, fires, plagues,\ninundations, [475]wild beasts, decay of trades, barred havens, the sea's\nviolence, as Antwerp may witness of late, Syracuse of old, Brundusium in\nItaly, Rye and Dover with us, and many that at this day suspect the sea's\nfury and rage, and labour against it as the Venetians to their inestimable\ncharge. But the most frequent maladies are such as proceed from themselves,\nas first when religion and God's service is neglected, innovated or\naltered, where they do not fear God, obey their prince, where atheism,\nepicurism, sacrilege, simony, &c., and all such impieties are freely\ncommitted, that country cannot prosper. When Abraham came to Gerar, and saw\na bad land, he said, sure the fear of God was not in that place. [476]\nCyprian Echovius, a Spanish chorographer, above all other cities of Spain,\ncommends Borcino, \"in which there was no beggar, no man poor, &c., but all\nrich, and in good estate, and he gives the reason, because they were more\nreligious than, their neighbours:\" why was Israel so often spoiled by their\nenemies, led into captivity, &c., but for their idolatry, neglect of God's\nword, for sacrilege, even for one Achan's fault? And what shall we except\nthat have such multitudes of Achans, church robbers, simoniacal patrons,\n&c., how can they hope to flourish, that neglect divine duties, that live\nmost part like Epicures?\n\nOther common grievances are generally noxious to a body politic; alteration\nof laws and customs, breaking privileges, general oppressions, seditions,\n&c., observed by [477]Aristotle, Bodin, Boterus, Junius, Arniscus, &c. I\nwill only point at some of chiefest. [478]_Impotentia gubernandi, ataxia_,\nconfusion, ill government, which proceeds from unskilful, slothful,\ngriping, covetous, unjust, rash, or tyrannizing magistrates, when they are\nfools, idiots, children, proud, wilful, partial, indiscreet, oppressors,\ngiddy heads, tyrants, not able or unfit to manage such offices: [479]many\nnoble cities and flourishing kingdoms by that means are desolate, the whole\nbody groans under such heads, and all the members must needs be\ndisaffected, as at this day those goodly provinces in Asia Minor, &c. groan\nunder the burthen of a Turkish government; and those vast kingdoms of\nMuscovia, Russia, [480]under a tyrannizing duke. Who ever heard of more\ncivil and rich populous countries than those of \"Greece, Asia Minor,\nabounding with all [481]wealth, multitudes of inhabitants, force, power,\nsplendour and magnificence?\" and that miracle of countries, [482]the Holy\nLand, that in so small a compass of ground could maintain so many towns,\ncities, produce so many fighting men? Egypt another paradise, now barbarous\nand desert, and almost waste, by the despotical government of an imperious\nTurk, _intolerabili servitutis jugo premitur_ ([483]one saith) not only\nfire and water, goods or lands, _sed ipse spiritus ab insolentissimi\nvictoris pendet nutu_, such is their slavery, their lives and souls depend\nupon his insolent will and command. A tyrant that spoils all wheresoever he\ncomes, insomuch that an [484]historian complains, \"if an old inhabitant\nshould now see them, he would not know them, if a traveller, or stranger,\nit would grieve his heart to behold them.\" Whereas [485]Aristotle notes,\n_Novae exactiones, nova onera imposita_, new burdens and exactions daily\ncome upon them, like those of which Zosimus, _lib. 2_, so grievous, _ut\nviri uxores, patres filios prostituerent ut exactoribus e questu_, &c.,\nthey must needs be discontent, _hinc civitatum gemitus et ploratus_, as\n[486] Tully holds, hence come those complaints and tears of cities, \"poor,\nmiserable, rebellious, and desperate subjects,\" as [487]Hippolitus adds;\nand [488]as a judicious countryman of ours observed not long since, in a\nsurvey of that great Duchy of Tuscany, the people lived much grieved and\ndiscontent, as appeared by their manifold and manifest complainings in that\nkind. \"That the state was like a sick body which had lately taken physic,\nwhose humours are not yet well settled, and weakened so much by purging,\nthat nothing was left but melancholy.\"\n\nWhereas the princes and potentates are immoderate in lust, hypocrites,\nepicures, of no religion, but in show: _Quid hypocrisi fragilius_? what so\nbrittle and unsure? what sooner subverts their estates than wandering and\nraging lusts, on their subjects' wives, daughters? to say no worse. That\nthey should _facem praeferre_, lead the way to all virtuous actions, are\nthe ringleaders oftentimes of all mischief and dissolute courses, and by\nthat means their countries are plagued, [489]\"and they themselves often\nruined, banished, or murdered by conspiracy of their subjects, as\nSardanapalus was, Dionysius Junior, Heliogabalus, Periander, Pisistratus,\nTarquinius, Timocrates, Childericus, Appius Claudius, Andronicus, Galeacius\nSforza, Alexander Medices,\" &c.\n\nWhereas the princes or great men are malicious, envious, factious,\nambitious, emulators, they tear a commonwealth asunder, as so many Guelfs\nand Gibelines disturb the quietness of it, [490]and with mutual murders let\nit bleed to death; our histories are too full of such barbarous\ninhumanities, and the miseries that issue from them.\n\nWhereas they be like so many horseleeches, hungry, griping, corrupt, [491]\ncovetous, _avaritice mancipia_, ravenous as wolves, for as Tully writes:\n_qui praeest prodest, et qui pecudibus praeest, debet eorum utilitati\ninservire_: or such as prefer their private before the public good. For as\n[492]he said long since, _res privatae publicis semper officere_. Or\nwhereas they be illiterate, ignorant, empirics in policy, _ubi deest\nfacultas_, [493]_virtus_ (Aristot. _pol. 5, cap. 8._) _et scientia_, wise\nonly by inheritance, and in authority by birthright, favour, or for their\nwealth and titles; there must needs be a fault, [494]a great defect:\nbecause as an [495]old philosopher affirms, such men are not always fit.\n\"Of an infinite number, few alone are senators, and of those few, fewer\ngood, and of that small number of honest, good, and noble men, few that are\nlearned, wise, discreet and sufficient, able to discharge such places, it\nmust needs turn to the confusion of a state.\"\n\nFor as the [496]Princes are, so are the people; _Qualis Rex, talis grex_:\nand which [497]Antigonus right well said of old, _qui Macedonia regem\nerudit, omnes etiam subditos erudit_, he that teacheth the king of Macedon,\nteacheth all his subjects, is a true saying still.\n\n       \"For Princes are the glass, the school, the book,\n        Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.\"\n\n        ------\"Velocius et citius nos\n        Corrumpunt vitiorum exempla domestica, magnis\n        Cum subeant animos auctoribus.\"------[498]\n\nTheir examples are soonest followed, vices entertained, if they be profane,\nirreligious, lascivious, riotous, epicures, factious, covetous, ambitious,\nilliterate, so will the commons most part be, idle, unthrifts, prone to\nlust, drunkards, and therefore poor and needy ([Greek: hae penia stasin\nempoiei kai kakourgian], for poverty begets sedition and villainy) upon all\noccasions ready to mutiny and rebel, discontent still, complaining,\nmurmuring, grudging, apt to all outrages, thefts, treasons, murders,\ninnovations, in debt, shifters, cozeners, outlaws, _Profligatae famae ac\nvitae_. It was an old [499]politician's aphorism, \"They that are poor and\nbad envy rich, hate good men, abhor the present government, wish for a new,\nand would have all turned topsy-turvy.\" When Catiline rebelled in Rome, he\ngot a company of such debauched rogues together, they were his familiars\nand coadjutors, and such have been your rebels most part in all ages, Jack\nCade, Tom Straw, Kette, and his companions.\n\nWhere they be generally riotous and contentious, where there be many\ndiscords, many laws, many lawsuits, many lawyers and many physicians, it is\na manifest sign of a distempered, melancholy state, as [500]Plato long\nsince maintained: for where such kind of men swarm, they will make more\nwork for themselves, and that body politic diseased, which was otherwise\nsound. A general mischief in these our times, an insensible plague, and\nnever so many of them: \"which are now multiplied\" (saith Mat. Geraldus,\n[501]a lawyer himself,) \"as so many locusts, not the parents, but the\nplagues of the country, and for the most part a supercilious, bad,\ncovetous, litigious generation of men.\" [502]_Crumenimulga natio_ &c. A\npurse-milking nation, a clamorous company, gowned vultures, [503]_qui ex\ninjuria vivent et sanguine civium_, thieves and seminaries of discord;\nworse than any pollers by the highway side, _auri accipitres, auri\nexterebronides, pecuniarum hamiolae, quadruplatores, curiae harpagones,\nfori tintinabula, monstra hominum, mangones_, &c. that take upon them to\nmake peace, but are indeed the very disturbers of our peace, a company of\nirreligious harpies, scraping, griping catchpoles, (I mean our common\nhungry pettifoggers, [504]_rabulas forenses_, love and honour in the\nmeantime all good laws, and worthy lawyers, that are so many [505]oracles\nand pilots of a well-governed commonwealth). Without art, without judgment,\nthat do more harm, as [506]Livy said, _quam bella externa, fames, morbive_,\nthan sickness, wars, hunger, diseases; \"and cause a most incredible\ndestruction of a commonwealth,\" saith [507]Sesellius, a famous civilian\nsometimes in Paris, as ivy doth by an oak, embrace it so long, until it\nhath got the heart out of it, so do they by such places they inhabit; no\ncounsel at all, no justice, no speech to be had, _nisi eum premulseris_, he\nmust be fed still, or else he is as mute as a fish, better open an oyster\nwithout a knife. _Experto crede_ (saith [508] Salisburiensis) _in manus\neorum millies incidi, et Charon immitis qui nulli pepercit unquam, his\nlonge clementior est_; \"I speak out of experience, I have been a thousand\ntimes amongst them, and Charon himself is more gentle than they; [509]he is\ncontented with his single pay, but they multiply still, they are never\nsatisfied,\" besides they have _damnificas linguas_, as he terms it, _nisi\nfunibus argenteis vincias_, they must be fed to say nothing, and [510]get\nmore to hold their peace than we can to say our best. They will speak their\nclients fair, and invite them to their tables, but as he follows it,\n[511]\"of all injustice there is none so pernicious as that of theirs, which\nwhen they deceive most, will seem to be honest men.\" They take upon them to\nbe peacemakers, _et fovere causas humilium_, to help them to their right,\n_patrocinantur afflictis_, [512]but all is for their own good, _ut loculos\npleniorom exhauriant_, they plead for poor men gratis, but they are but as\na stale to catch others. If there be no jar, [513]they can make a jar, out\nof the law itself find still some quirk or other, to set them at odds, and\ncontinue causes so long, _lustra aliquot_, I know not how many years before\nthe cause is heard, and when 'tis judged and determined by reason of some\ntricks and errors, it is as fresh to begin, after twice seven years\nsometimes, as it was at first; and so they prolong time, delay suits till\nthey have enriched themselves, and beggared their clients. And, as\n[514]Cato inveighed against Isocrates' scholars, we may justly tax our\nwrangling lawyers, they do _consenescere in litibus_, are so litigious and\nbusy here on earth, that I think they will plead their client's causes\nhereafter, some of them in hell. [515] Simlerus complains amongst the\nSwissers of the advocates in his time, that when they should make an end,\nthey began controversies, and \"protract their causes many years, persuading\nthem their title is good, till their patrimonies be consumed, and that they\nhave spent more in seeking than the thing is worth, or they shall get by\nthe recovery.\" So that he that goes to law, as the proverb is, [516]holds a\nwolf by the ears, or as a sheep in a storm runs for shelter to a brier, if\nhe prosecute his cause he is consumed, if he surcease his suit he loseth\nall; [517]what difference? They had wont heretofore, saith Austin, to end\nmatters, _per communes arbitros_; and so in Switzerland (we are informed by\n[518]Simlerus), \"they had some common arbitrators or daysmen in every town,\nthat made a friendly composition betwixt man and man, and he much wonders\nat their honest simplicity, that could keep peace so well, and end such\ngreat causes by that means.\" At [519]Fez in Africa, they have neither\nlawyers nor advocates; but if there be any controversies amongst them, both\nparties plaintiff and defendant come to their Alfakins or chief judge, \"and\nat once without any farther appeals or pitiful delays, the cause is heard\nand ended.\" Our forefathers, as [520]a worthy chorographer of ours\nobserves, had wont _pauculis cruculis aureis_, with a few golden crosses,\nand lines in verse, make all conveyances, assurances. And such was the\ncandour and integrity of succeeding ages, that a deed (as I have oft seen)\nto convey a whole manor, was _implicite_ contained in some twenty lines or\nthereabouts; like that scede or _Sytala Laconica_, so much renowned of old\nin all contracts, which [521]Tully so earnestly commends to Atticus,\nPlutarch in his Lysander, Aristotle _polit._: Thucydides, _lib. 1_,\n[522]Diodorus and Suidus approve and magnify, for that laconic brevity in\nthis kind; and well they might, for, according to [523]Tertullian, _certa\nsunt paucis_, there is much more certainty in fewer words. And so was it of\nold throughout: but now many skins of parchment will scarce serve turn; he\nthat buys and sells a house, must have a house full of writings, there be\nso many circumstances, so many words, such tautological repetitions of all\nparticulars (to avoid cavillation they say); but we find by our woeful\nexperience, that to subtle wits it is a cause of much more contention and\nvariance, and scarce any conveyance so accurately penned by one, which\nanother will not find a crack in, or cavil at; if any one word be\nmisplaced, any little error, all is disannulled. That which is a law today,\nis none tomorrow; that which is sound in one man's opinion, is most faulty\nto another; that in conclusion, here is nothing amongst us but contention\nand confusion, we bandy one against another. And that which long since\n[524]Plutarch complained of them in Asia, may be verified in our times.\n\"These men here assembled, come not to sacrifice to their gods, to offer\nJupiter their first-fruits, or merriments to Bacchus; but an yearly disease\nexasperating Asia hath brought them hither, to make an end of their\ncontroversies and lawsuits.\" 'Tis _multitudo perdentium et pereuntium_, a\ndestructive rout that seek one another's ruin. Such most part are our\nordinary suitors, termers, clients, new stirs every day, mistakes, errors,\ncavils, and at this present, as I have heard in some one court, I know not\nhow many thousand causes: no person free, no title almost good, with such\nbitterness in following, so many slights, procrastinations, delays,\nforgery, such cost (for infinite sums are inconsiderately spent), violence\nand malice, I know not by whose fault, lawyers, clients, laws, both or all:\nbut as Paul reprehended the [525]Corinthians long since, I may more\npositively infer now: \"There is a fault amongst you, and I speak it to your\nshame, Is there not a [526]wise man amongst you, to judge between his\nbrethren? but that a brother goes to law with a brother.\" And [527]Christ's\ncounsel concerning lawsuits, was never so fit to be inculcated as in this\nage: [528]\"Agree with thine adversary quickly,\" &c. Matth. v. 25.\n\nI could repeat many such particular grievances, which must disturb a body\npolitic. To shut up all in brief, where good government is, prudent and\nwise princes, there all things thrive and prosper, peace and happiness is\nin that land: where it is otherwise, all things are ugly to behold, incult,\nbarbarous, uncivil, a paradise is turned to a wilderness. This island\namongst the rest, our next neighbours the French and Germans, may be a\nsufficient witness, that in a short time by that prudent policy of the\nRomans, was brought from barbarism; see but what Caesar reports of us, and\nTacitus of those old Germans, they were once as uncivil as they in\nVirginia, yet by planting of colonies and good laws, they became from\nbarbarous outlaws, [529]to be full of rich and populous cities, as now they\nare, and most flourishing kingdoms. Even so might Virginia, and those wild\nIrish have been civilised long since, if that order had been heretofore\ntaken, which now begins, of planting colonies, &c. I have read a\n[530]discourse, printed _anno_ 1612. \"Discovering the true causes why\nIreland was never entirely subdued, or brought under obedience to the crown\nof England, until the beginning of his Majesty's happy reign.\" Yet if his\nreasons were thoroughly scanned by a judicious politician, I am afraid he\nwould not altogether be approved, but that it would turn to the dishonour\nof our nation, to suffer it to lie so long waste. Yea, and if some\ntravellers should see (to come nearer home) those rich, united provinces of\nHolland, Zealand, &c., over against us; those neat cities and populous\ntowns, full of most industrious artificers, [531]so much land recovered\nfrom the sea, and so painfully preserved by those artificial inventions, so\nwonderfully approved, as that of Bemster in Holland, _ut nihil huic par aut\nsimile invenias in toto orbe_, saith Bertius the geographer, all the world\ncannot match it, [532]so many navigable channels from place to place, made\nby men's hands, &c. and on the other side so many thousand acres of our\nfens lie drowned, our cities thin, and those vile, poor, and ugly to behold\nin respect of theirs, our trades decayed, our still running rivers stopped,\nand that beneficial use of transportation, wholly neglected, so many havens\nvoid of ships and towns, so many parks and forests for pleasure, barren\nheaths, so many villages depopulated, &c. I think sure he would find some\nfault.\n\nI may not deny but that this nation of ours, doth _bene audire apud\nexteros_, is a most noble, a most flourishing kingdom, by common consent of\nall [533]geographers, historians, politicians, 'tis _unica velut arx_,\n[534]and which Quintius in Livy said of the inhabitants of Peloponnesus,\nmay be well applied to us, we are _testudines testa sua inclusi_, like so\nmany tortoises in our shells, safely defended by an angry sea, as a wall on\nall sides. Our island hath many such honourable eulogiums; and as a learned\ncountryman of ours right well hath it, [535]\"Ever since the Normans first\ncoming into England, this country both for military matters, and all other\nof civility, hath been paralleled with the most flourishing kingdoms of\nEurope and our Christian world,\" a blessed, a rich country, and one of the\nfortunate isles: and for some things [536]preferred before other countries,\nfor expert seamen, our laborious discoveries, art of navigation, true\nmerchants, they carry the bell away from all other nations, even the\nPortugals and Hollanders themselves; [537]\"without all fear,\" saith\nBoterus, \"furrowing the ocean winter and summer, and two of their captains,\nwith no less valour than fortune, have sailed round about the world.\" [538]\nWe have besides many particular blessings, which our neighbours want, the\nGospel truly preached, church discipline established, long peace and\nquietness free from exactions, foreign fears, invasions, domestical\nseditions, well manured, [539]fortified by art, and nature, and now most\nhappy in that fortunate union of England and Scotland, which our\nforefathers have laboured to effect, and desired to see. But in which we\nexcel all others, a wise, learned, religious king, another Numa, a second\nAugustus, a true Josiah; most worthy senators, a learned clergy, an\nobedient commonalty, &c. Yet amongst many roses, some thistles grow, some\nbad weeds and enormities, which much disturb the peace of this body\npolitic, eclipse the honour and glory of it, fit to be rooted out, and with\nall speed to be reformed.\n\nThe first is idleness, by reason of which we have many swarms of rogues,\nand beggars, thieves, drunkards, and discontented persons (whom Lycurgus in\nPlutarch calls _morbos reipublicae_, the boils of the commonwealth), many\npoor people in all our towns. _Civitates ignobiles_, as [540]Polydore calls\nthem, base-built cities, inglorious, poor, small, rare in sight, ruinous,\nand thin of inhabitants. Our land is fertile we may not deny, full of all\ngood things, and why doth it not then abound with cities, as well as Italy,\nFrance, Germany, the Low Countries? because their policy hath been\notherwise, and we are not so thrifty, circumspect, industrious. Idleness is\nthe _malus genius_ of our nation. For as [541]Boterus justly argues,\nfertility of a country is not enough, except art and industry be joined\nunto it, according to Aristotle, riches are either natural or artificial;\nnatural are good land, fair mines, &c. artificial, are manufactures, coins,\n&c. Many kingdoms are fertile, but thin of inhabitants, as that Duchy of\nPiedmont in Italy, which Leander Albertus so much magnifies for corn, wine,\nfruits, &c., yet nothing near so populous as those which are more barren.\n[542]\"England,\" saith he, \"London only excepted, hath never a populous\ncity, and yet a fruitful country.\" I find 46 cities and walled towns in\nAlsatia, a small province in Germany, 50 castles, an infinite number of\nvillages, no ground idle, no not rocky places, or tops of hills are\nuntilled, as [543]Munster informeth us. In [544]Greichgea, a small\nterritory on the Necker, 24 Italian miles over, I read of 20 walled towns,\ninnumerable villages, each one containing 150 houses most part, besides\ncastles and noblemen's palaces. I observe in [545]Turinge in Dutchland\n(twelve miles over by their scale) 12 counties, and in them 144 cities,\n2000 villages, 144 towns, 250 castles. In [546]Bavaria 34 cities, 46 towns,\n&c. [547]_Portugallia interamnis_, a small plot of ground, hath 1460\nparishes, 130 monasteries, 200 bridges. Malta, a barren island, yields\n20,000 inhabitants. But of all the rest, I admire Lues Guicciardine's\nrelations of the Low Countries. Holland hath 26 cities, 400 great villages.\nZealand 10 cities, 102 parishes. Brabant 26 cities, 102 parishes. Flanders\n28 cities, 90 towns, 1154 villages, besides abbeys, castles, &c. The Low\nCountries generally have three cities at least for one of ours, and those\nfar more populous and rich: and what is the cause, but their industry and\nexcellency in all manner of trades? Their commerce, which is maintained by\na multitude of tradesmen, so many excellent channels made by art and\nopportune havens, to which they build their cities; all which we have in\nlike measure, or at least may have. But their chiefest loadstone which\ndraws all manner of commerce and merchandise, which maintains their present\nestate, is not fertility of soil, but industry that enricheth them, the\ngold mines of Peru, or Nova Hispania may not compare with them. They have\nneither gold nor silver of their own, wine nor oil, or scarce any corn\ngrowing in those united provinces, little or no wood, tin, lead, iron,\nsilk, wool, any stuff almost, or metal; and yet Hungary, Transylvania, that\nbrag of their mines, fertile England cannot compare with them. I dare\nboldly say, that neither France, Tarentum, Apulia, Lombardy, or any part of\nItaly, Valentia in Spain, or that pleasant Andalusia, with their excellent\nfruits, wine and oil, two harvests, no not any part of Europe is so\nflourishing, so rich, so populous, so full of good ships, of well-built\ncities, so abounding with all things necessary for the use of man. 'Tis our\nIndies, an epitome of China, and all by reason of their industry, good\npolicy, and commerce. Industry is a loadstone to draw all good things; that\nalone makes countries flourish, cities populous, [548]and will enforce by\nreason of much manure, which necessarily follows, a barren soil to be\nfertile and good, as sheep, saith [549]Dion, mend a bad pasture.\n\nTell me politicians, why is that fruitful Palestina, noble Greece, Egypt,\nAsia Minor, so much decayed, and (mere carcases now) fallen from that they\nwere? The ground is the same, but the government is altered, the people are\ngrown slothful, idle, their good husbandry, policy, and industry is\ndecayed. _Non fatigata aut effaeta, humus_, as [550]Columella well informs\nSylvinus, _sed nostra fit inertia_, &c. May a man believe that which\nAristotle in his politics, Pausanias, Stephanus, Sophianus, Gerbelius\nrelate of old Greece? I find heretofore 70 cities in Epirus overthrown by\nPaulus Aemilius, a goodly province in times past, [551]now left desolate of\ngood towns and almost inhabitants. Sixty-two cities in Macedonia in\nStrabo's time. I find 30 in Laconia, but now scarce so many villages, saith\nGerbelius. If any man from Mount Taygetus should view the country round\nabout, and see _tot delicias, tot urbes per Peloponesum dispersas_, so many\ndelicate and brave built cities with such cost and exquisite cunning, so\nneatly set out in Peloponnesus, [552]he should perceive them now ruinous\nand overthrown, burnt, waste, desolate, and laid level with the ground.\n_Incredibile dictu_, &c. And as he laments, _Quis talia fando Temperet a\nlachrymis? Quis tam durus aut ferreus_, (so he prosecutes it). [553]Who is\nhe that can sufficiently condole and commiserate these ruins? Where are\nthose 4000 cities of Egypt, those 100 cities in Crete? Are they now come to\ntwo? What saith Pliny and Aelian of old Italy? There were in former ages\n1166 cities: Blondus and Machiavel, both grant them now nothing near so\npopulous, and full of good towns as in the time of Augustus (for now\nLeander Albertus can find but 300 at most), and if we may give credit to\n[554]Livy, not then so strong and puissant as of old: \"They mustered 70\nLegions in former times, which now the known world will scarce yield.\"\nAlexander built 70 cities in a short space for his part, our sultans and\nTurks demolish twice as many, and leave all desolate. Many will not believe\nbut that our island of Great Britain is now more populous than ever it was;\nyet let them read Bede, Leland and others, they shall find it most\nflourished in the Saxon Heptarchy, and in the Conqueror's time was far\nbetter inhabited, than at this present. See that Doomsday Book, and show me\nthose thousands of parishes, which are now decayed, cities ruined, villages\ndepopulated, &c. The lesser the territory is, commonly, the richer it is.\n_Parvus sed bene cultus ager_. As those Athenian, Lacedaemonian, Arcadian,\nAelian, Sycionian, Messenian, &c. commonwealths of Greece make ample proof,\nas those imperial cities and free states of Germany may witness, those\nCantons of Switzers, Rheti, Grisons, Walloons, Territories of Tuscany, Luke\nand Senes of old, Piedmont, Mantua, Venice in Italy, Ragusa, &c.\n\nThat prince therefore as, [555]Boterus adviseth, that will have a rich\ncountry, and fair cities, let him get good trades, privileges, painful\ninhabitants, artificers, and suffer no rude matter unwrought, as tin, iron,\nwool, lead, &c., to be transported out of his country,--[556]a thing in\npart seriously attempted amongst us, but not effected. And because industry\nof men, and multitude of trade so much avails to the ornament and enriching\nof a kingdom; those ancient [557]Massilians would admit no man into their\ncity that had not some trade. Selym the first Turkish emperor procured a\nthousand good artificers to be brought from Tauris to Constantinople. The\nPolanders indented with Henry Duke of Anjou, their new chosen king, to\nbring with him an hundred families of artificers into Poland. James the\nfirst in Scotland (as [558]Buchanan writes) sent for the best artificers he\ncould get in Europe, and gave them great rewards to teach his subjects\ntheir several trades. Edward the Third, our most renowned king, to his\neternal memory, brought clothing first into this island, transporting some\nfamilies of artificers from Gaunt hither. How many goodly cities could I\nreckon up, that thrive wholly by trade, where thousands of inhabitants live\nsingular well by their fingers' ends: As Florence in Italy by making cloth\nof gold; great Milan by silk, and all curious works; Arras in Artois by\nthose fair hangings; many cities in Spain, many in France, Germany, have\nnone other maintenance, especially those within the land. [559]Mecca, in\nArabia Petraea, stands in a most unfruitful country, that wants water,\namongst the rocks (as Vertomannus describes it), and yet it is a most\nelegant and pleasant city, by reason of the traffic of the east and west.\nOrmus in Persia is a most famous mart-town, hath nought else but the\nopportunity of the haven to make it flourish. Corinth, a noble city (Lumen\nGreciae, Tully calls it) the Eye of Greece, by reason of Cenchreas and\nLecheus, those excellent ports, drew all that traffic of the Ionian and\nAegean seas to it; and yet the country about it was _curva et\nsuperciliosa_, as [560]Strabo terms it, rugged and harsh. We may say the\nsame of Athens, Actium, Thebes, Sparta, and most of those towns in Greece.\nNuremberg in Germany is sited in a most barren soil, yet a noble imperial\ncity, by the sole industry of artificers, and cunning trades, they draw the\nriches of most countries to them, so expert in manufactures, that as\nSallust long since gave out of the like, _Sedem animae in extremis digitis\nhabent_, their soul, or _intellectus agens_, was placed in their fingers'\nend; and so we may say of Basil, Spire, Cambray, Frankfurt, &c. It is\nalmost incredible to speak what some write of Mexico and the cities\nadjoining to it, no place in the world at their first discovery more\npopulous, [561]Mat. Riccius, the Jesuit, and some others, relate of the\nindustry of the Chinese most populous countries, not a beggar or an idle\nperson to be seen, and how by that means they prosper and flourish. We have\nthe same means, able bodies, pliant wits, matter of all sorts, wool, flax,\niron, tin, lead, wood, &c., many excellent subjects to work upon, only\nindustry is wanting. We send our best commodities beyond the seas, which\nthey make good use of to their necessities, set themselves a work about,\nand severally improve, sending the same to us back at dear rates, or else\nmake toys and baubles of the tails of them, which they sell to us again, at\nas great a reckoning as the whole. In most of our cities, some few\nexcepted, like [562]Spanish loiterers, we live wholly by tippling-inns and\nalehouses. Malting are their best ploughs, their greatest traffic to sell\nale. [563]Meteran and some others object to us, that we are no whit so\nindustrious as the Hollanders: \"Manual trades\" (saith he) \"which are more\ncurious or troublesome, are wholly exercised by strangers: they dwell in a\nsea full of fish, but they are so idle, they will not catch so much as\nshall serve their own turns, but buy it of their neighbours.\" Tush\n[564]_Mare liberum_, they fish under our noses, and sell it to us when they\nhave done, at their own prices.\n\n        ------\"Pudet haec opprobria nobis\n        Et dici potuisse, et non potuisse refelli.\"\n\nI am ashamed to hear this objected by strangers, and know not how to answer\nit.\n\nAmongst our towns, there is only [565]London that bears the face of a city,\n[566]_Epitome Britanniae_, a famous emporium, second to none beyond seas, a\nnoble mart: but _sola crescit, decrescentibus aliis_; and yet, in my\nslender judgment, defective in many things. The rest ([567]some few\nexcepted) are in mean estate, ruinous most part, poor, and full of beggars,\nby reason of their decayed trades, neglected or bad policy, idleness of\ntheir inhabitants, riot, which had rather beg or loiter, and be ready to\nstarve, than work.\n\nI cannot deny but that something may be said in defence of our cities,\n[568]that they are not so fair built, (for the sole magnificence of this\nkingdom (concerning buildings) hath been of old in those Norman castles and\nreligious houses,) so rich, thick sited, populous, as in some other\ncountries; besides the reasons Cardan gives, _Subtil. Lib. 11._ we want\nwine and oil, their two harvests, we dwell in a colder air, and for that\ncause must a little more liberally [569]feed of flesh, as all northern\ncountries do: our provisions will not therefore extend to the maintenance\nof so many; yet notwithstanding we have matter of all sorts, an open sea\nfor traffic, as well as the rest, goodly havens. And how can we excuse our\nnegligence, our riot, drunkenness, &c., and such enormities that follow it?\nWe have excellent laws enacted, you will say, severe statutes, houses of\ncorrection, &c., to small purpose it seems; it is not houses will serve,\nbut cities of correction; [570]our trades generally ought to be reformed,\nwants supplied. In other countries they have the same grievances, I\nconfess, but that doth not excuse us, [571]wants, defects, enormities, idle\ndrones, tumults, discords, contention, lawsuits, many laws made against\nthem to repress those innumerable brawls and lawsuits, excess in apparel,\ndiet, decay of tillage, depopulations, [572]especially against rogues,\nbeggars, Egyptian vagabonds (so termed at least) which have [573] swarmed\nall over Germany, France, Italy, Poland, as you may read in [574] Munster,\nCranzius, and Aventinus; as those Tartars and Arabians at this day do in\nthe eastern countries: yet such has been the iniquity of all ages, as it\nseems to small purpose. _Nemo in nostra civitate mendicus esto_, [575]\nsaith Plato: he will have them purged from a [576]commonwealth, [577]\"as a\nbad humour from the body,\" that are like so many ulcers and boils, and must\nbe cured before the melancholy body can be eased.\n\nWhat Carolus Magnus, the Chinese, the Spaniards, the duke of Saxony and\nmany other states have decreed in this case, read Arniseus, _cap. 19_;\nBoterus, _libro 8, cap. 2_; Osorius _de Rubus gest. Eman. lib. 11._ When a\ncountry is overstocked with people, as a pasture is oft overlaid with\ncattle, they had wont in former times to disburden themselves, by sending\nout colonies, or by wars, as those old Romans; or by employing them at home\nabout some public buildings, as bridges, roadways, for which those Romans\nwere famous in this island; as Augustus Caesar did in Rome, the Spaniards\nin their Indian mines, as at Potosi in Peru, where some 30,000 men are\nstill at work, 6000 furnaces ever boiling, &c. [578]aqueducts, bridges,\nhavens, those stupend works of Trajan, Claudius, at [579]Ostium,\nDioclesiani Therma, Fucinus Lacus, that Piraeum in Athens, made by\nThemistocles, ampitheatrums of curious marble, as at Verona, Civitas\nPhilippi, and Heraclea in Thrace, those Appian and Flaminian ways,\nprodigious works all may witness; and rather than they should be [580]idle,\nas those [581] Egyptian Pharaohs, Maris, and Sesostris did, to task their\nsubjects to build unnecessary pyramids, obelisks, labyrinths, channels,\nlakes, gigantic works all, to divert them from rebellion, riot,\ndrunkenness, [582]_Quo scilicet alantur et ne vagando laborare desuescant_.\n\nAnother eyesore is that want of conduct and navigable rivers, a great\nblemish as [583]Boterus, [584]Hippolitus a Collibus, and other politicians\nhold, if it be neglected in a commonwealth. Admirable cost and charge is\nbestowed in the Low Countries on this behalf, in the duchy of Milan,\nterritory of Padua, in [585]France, Italy, China, and so likewise about\ncorrivations of water to moisten and refresh barren grounds, to drain fens,\nbogs, and moors. Massinissa made many inward parts of Barbary and Numidia\nin Africa, before his time incult and horrid, fruitful and bartable by this\nmeans. Great industry is generally used all over the eastern countries in\nthis kind, especially in Egypt, about Babylon and Damascus, as Vertomannus\nand [586]Gotardus Arthus relate; about Barcelona, Segovia, Murcia, and many\nother places of Spain, Milan in Italy; by reason of which, their soil is\nmuch impoverished, and infinite commodities arise to the inhabitants.\n\nThe Turks of late attempted to cut that Isthmus betwixt Africa and Asia,\nwhich [587]Sesostris and Darius, and some Pharaohs of Egypt had formerly\nundertaken, but with ill success, as [588]Diodorus Siculus records, and\nPliny, for that Red Sea being three [589]cubits higher than Egypt, would\nhave drowned all the country, _caepto destiterant_, they left off; yet as\nthe same [590]Diodorus writes, Ptolemy renewed the work many years after,\nand absolved in it a more opportune place.\n\nThat Isthmus of Corinth was likewise undertaken to be made navigable by\nDemetrius, by Julius Caesar, Nero, Domitian, Herodes Atticus, to make a\nspeedy [591]passage, and less dangerous, from the Ionian and Aegean seas;\nbut because it could not be so well effected, the Peloponnesians built a\nwall like our Picts' wall about Schaenute, where Neptune's temple stood,\nand in the shortest cut over the Isthmus, of which Diodorus, _lib. 11._\nHerodotus, _lib. 8. Uran._ Our latter writers call it Hexamilium, which\nAmurath the Turk demolished, the Venetians, _anno_ 1453, repaired in 15\ndays with 30,000 men. Some, saith Acosta, would have a passage cut from\nPanama to Nombre de Dios in America; but Thuanus and Serres the French\nhistorians speak of a famous aqueduct in France, intended in Henry the\nFourth's time, from the Loire to the Seine, and from Rhodanus to the Loire.\nThe like to which was formerly assayed by Domitian the emperor, [592]from\nArar to Moselle, which Cornelius Tacitus speaks of in the 13 of his annals,\nafter by Charles the Great and others. Much cost hath in former times been\nbestowed in either new making or mending channels of rivers, and their\npassages, (as Aurelianus did by Tiber to make it navigable to Rome, to\nconvey corn from Egypt to the city, _vadum alvei tumentis effodit_ saith\nVopiscus, _et Tiberis ripas extruxit_ he cut fords, made banks, &c.)\ndecayed havens, which Claudius the emperor with infinite pains and charges\nattempted at Ostia, as I have said, the Venetians at this day to preserve\ntheir city; many excellent means to enrich their territories, have been\nfostered, invented in most provinces of Europe, as planting some Indian\nplants amongst us, silkworms, [593]the very mulberry leaves in the plains\nof Granada yield 30,000 crowns per annum to the king of Spain's coffers,\nbesides those many trades and artificers that are busied about them in the\nkingdom of Granada, Murcia, and all over Spain. In France a great benefit\nis raised by salt, &c., whether these things might not be as happily\nattempted with us, and with like success, it may be controverted, silkworms\n(I mean) vines, fir trees, &c. Cardan exhorts Edward the Sixth to plant\nolives, and is fully persuaded they would prosper in this island. With us,\nnavigable rivers are most part neglected; our streams are not great, I\nconfess, by reason of the narrowness of the island, yet they run smoothly\nand even, not headlong, swift, or amongst rocks and shelves, as foaming\nRhodanus and Loire in France, Tigris in Mesopotamia, violent Durius in\nSpain, with cataracts and whirlpools, as the Rhine, and Danubius, about\nShaffausen, Lausenburgh, Linz, and Cremmes, to endanger navigators; or\nbroad shallow, as Neckar in the Palatinate, Tibris in Italy; but calm and\nfair as Arar in France, Hebrus in Macedonia, Eurotas in Laconia, they\ngently glide along, and might as well be repaired many of them (I mean Wye,\nTrent, Ouse, Thamisis at Oxford, the defect of which we feel in the mean\ntime) as the river of Lee from Ware to London. B. Atwater of old, or as\nsome will Henry I. [594]made a channel from Trent to Lincoln, navigable;\nwhich now, saith Mr. Camden, is decayed, and much mention is made of\nanchors, and such like monuments found about old [595]Verulamium, good\nships have formerly come to Exeter, and many such places, whose channels,\nhavens, ports are now barred and rejected. We contemn this benefit of\ncarriage by waters, and are therefore compelled in the inner parts of this\nisland, because portage is so dear, to eat up our commodities ourselves,\nand live like so many boars in a sty, for want of vent and utterance.\n\nWe have many excellent havens, royal havens, Falmouth, Portsmouth, Milford,\n&c. equivalent if not to be preferred to that Indian Havana, old Brundusium\nin Italy, Aulis in Greece, Ambracia in Acarnia, Suda in Crete, which have\nfew ships in them, little or no traffic or trade, which have scarce a\nvillage on them, able to bear great cities, _sed viderint politici_. I\ncould here justly tax many other neglects, abuses, errors, defects among\nus, and in other countries, depopulations, riot, drunkenness, &c. and many\nsuch, _quae nunc in aurem susurrare, non libet_. But I must take heed, _ne\nquid gravius dicam_, that I do not overshoot myself, _Sus Minervam_, I am\nforth of my element, as you peradventure suppose; and sometimes _veritas\nodium parit_, as he said, \"verjuice and oatmeal is good for a parrot.\" For\nas Lucian said of an historian, I say of a politician. He that will freely\nspeak and write, must be for ever no subject, under no prince or law, but\nlay out the matter truly as it is, not caring what any can, will, like or\ndislike.\n\nWe have good laws, I deny not, to rectify such enormities, and so in all\nother countries, but it seems not always to good purpose. We had need of\nsome general visitor in our age, that should reform what is amiss; a just\narmy of Rosy-cross men, for they will amend all matters (they say)\nreligion, policy, manners, with arts, sciences, &c. Another Attila,\nTamerlane, Hercules, to strive with Achelous, _Augeae stabulum purgare_, to\nsubdue tyrants, as [596]he did Diomedes and Busiris: to expel thieves, as\nhe did Cacus and Lacinius: to vindicate poor captives, as he did Hesione:\nto pass the torrid zone, the deserts of Libya, and purge the world of\nmonsters and Centaurs: or another Theban Crates to reform our manners, to\ncompose quarrels and controversies, as in his time he did, and was\ntherefore adored for a god in Athens. \"As Hercules [597]purged the world of\nmonsters, and subdued them, so did he fight against envy, lust, anger,\navarice, &c. and all those feral vices and monsters of the mind.\" It were\nto be wished we had some such visitor, or if wishing would serve, one had\nsuch a ring or rings, as Timolaus desired in [598]Lucian, by virtue of\nwhich he should be as strong as 10,000 men, or an army of giants, go\ninvisible, open gates and castle doors, have what treasure he would,\ntransport himself in an instant to what place he desired, alter affections,\ncure all manner of diseases, that he might range over the world, and reform\nall distressed states and persons, as he would himself. He might reduce\nthose wandering Tartars in order, that infest China on the one side,\nMuscovy, Poland, on the other; and tame the vagabond Arabians that rob and\nspoil those eastern countries, that they should never use more caravans, or\njanissaries to conduct them. He might root out barbarism out of America,\nand fully discover _Terra Australis Incognita_, find out the north-east and\nnorth-west passages, drain those mighty Maeotian fens, cut down those vast\nHircinian woods, irrigate those barren Arabian deserts, &c. cure us of our\nepidemical diseases, _scorbutum, plica, morbus Neapolitanus_, &c. end all\nour idle controversies, cut off our tumultuous desires, inordinate lusts,\nroot out atheism, impiety, heresy, schism and superstition, which now so\ncrucify the world, catechise gross ignorance, purge Italy of luxury and\nriot, Spain of superstition and jealousy, Germany of drunkenness, all our\nnorthern country of gluttony and intemperance, castigate our hard-hearted\nparents, masters, tutors; lash disobedient children, negligent servants,\ncorrect these spendthrifts and prodigal sons, enforce idle persons to work,\ndrive drunkards off the alehouse, repress thieves, visit corrupt and\ntyrannizing magistrates, &c. But as L. Licinius taxed Timolaus, you may us.\nThese are vain, absurd and ridiculous wishes not to be hoped: all must be\nas it is, [599]Bocchalinus may cite commonwealths to come before Apollo,\nand seek to reform the world itself by commissioners, but there is no\nremedy, it may not be redressed, _desinent homines tum demum stultescere\nquando esse desinent_, so long as they can wag their beards, they will play\nthe knaves and fools.\n\nBecause, therefore, it is a thing so difficult, impossible, and far beyond\nHercules labours to be performed; let them be rude, stupid, ignorant,\nincult, _lapis super lapidem sedeat_, and as the [600]apologist will,\n_resp. tussi, et graveolentia laboret, mundus vitio_, let them be barbarous\nas they are, let them [601]tyrannise, epicurise, oppress, luxuriate,\nconsume themselves with factions, superstitions, lawsuits, wars and\ncontentions, live in riot, poverty, want, misery; rebel, wallow as so many\nswine in their own dung, with Ulysses' companions, _stultos jubeo esse\nlibenter_. I will yet, to satisfy and please myself, make an Utopia of mine\nown, a new Atlantis, a poetical commonwealth of mine own, in which I will\nfreely domineer, build cities, make laws, statutes, as I list myself. And\nwhy may I not?--[602]_Pictoribus atque poetis_, &c. You know what liberty\npoets ever had, and besides, my predecessor Democritus was a politician, a\nrecorder of Abdera, a law maker as some say; and why may not I presume so\nmuch as he did? Howsoever I will adventure. For the site, if you will needs\nurge me to it, I am not fully resolved, it may be in _Terra Australi\nIncognita_, there is room enough (for of my knowledge neither that hungry\nSpaniard, [603]nor Mercurius Britannicus, have yet discovered half of it)\nor else one of these floating islands in Mare del Zur, which like the\nCyanian isles in the Euxine sea, alter their place, and are accessible only\nat set times, and to some few persons; or one of the fortunate isles, for\nwho knows yet where, or which they are? there is room enough in the inner\nparts of America, and northern coasts of Asia. But I will choose a site,\nwhose latitude shall be 45 degrees (I respect not minutes) in the midst of\nthe temperate zone, or perhaps under the equator, that [604]paradise of the\nworld, _ubi semper virens laurus_, &c. where is a perpetual spring: the\nlongitude for some reasons I will conceal. Yet \"be it known to all men by\nthese presents,\" that if any honest gentleman will send in so much money,\nas Cardan allows an astrologer for casting a nativity, he shall be a\nsharer, I will acquaint him with my project, or if any worthy man will\nstand for any temporal or spiritual office or dignity, (for as he said of\nhis archbishopric of Utopia, 'tis _sanctus ambitus_, and not amiss to be\nsought after,) it shall be freely given without all intercessions, bribes,\nletters, &c. his own worth shall be the best spokesman; and because we\nshall admit of no deputies or advowsons, if he be sufficiently qualified,\nand as able as willing to execute the place himself, be shall have present\npossession. It shall be divided into 12 or 13 provinces, and those by\nhills, rivers, roadways, or some more eminent limits exactly bounded. Each\nprovince shall have a metropolis, which shall be so placed as a centre\nalmost in a circumference, and the rest at equal distances, some 12 Italian\nmiles asunder, or thereabout, and in them shall be sold all things\nnecessary for the use of man; _statis horis et diebus_, no market towns,\nmarkets or fairs, for they do but beggar cities (no village shall stand\nabove 6, 7, or 8 miles from a city) except those emporiums which are by the\nsea side, general staples, marts, as Antwerp, Venice, Bergen of old,\nLondon, &c. cities most part shall be situated upon navigable rivers or\nlakes, creeks, havens; and for their form, regular, round, square, or long\nsquare, [605]with fair, broad, and straight [606]streets, houses uniform,\nbuilt of brick and stone, like Bruges, Brussels, Rhegium Lepidi, Berne in\nSwitzerland, Milan, Mantua, Crema, Cambalu in Tartary, described by M.\nPolus, or that Venetian Palma. I will admit very few or no suburbs, and\nthose of baser building, walls only to keep out man and horse, except it be\nin some frontier towns, or by the sea side, and those to be fortified [607]\nafter the latest manner of fortification, and situated upon convenient\nhavens, or opportune places. In every so built city, I will have convenient\nchurches, and separate places to bury the dead in, not in churchyards; a\n_citadella_ (in some, not all) to command it, prisons for offenders,\nopportune market places of all sorts, for corn, meat, cattle, fuel, fish,\ncommodious courts of justice, public halls for all societies, bourses,\nmeeting places, armouries, [608]in which shall be kept engines for\nquenching of fire, artillery gardens, public walks, theatres, and spacious\nfields allotted for all gymnastic sports, and honest recreations, hospitals\nof all kinds, for children, orphans, old folks, sick men, mad men,\nsoldiers, pest-houses, &c. not built _precario_, or by gouty benefactors,\nwho, when by fraud and rapine they have extorted all their lives, oppressed\nwhole provinces, societies, &c. give something to pious uses, build a\nsatisfactory alms-house, school or bridge, &c. at their last end, or before\nperhaps, which is no otherwise than to steal a goose, and stick down a\nfeather, rob a thousand to relieve ten; and those hospitals so built and\nmaintained, not by collections, benevolences, donaries, for a set number,\n(as in ours,) just so many and no more at such a rate, but for all those\nwho stand in need, be they more or less, and that _ex publico aerario_, and\nso still maintained, _non nobis solum nati sumus_, &c. I will have conduits\nof sweet and good water, aptly disposed in each town, common [609]\ngranaries, as at Dresden in Misnia, Stetein in Pomerland, Noremberg, &c.\nColleges of mathematicians, musicians, and actors, as of old at Labedum in\nIonia, [610]alchemists, physicians, artists, and philosophers: that all\narts and sciences may sooner be perfected and better learned; and public\nhistoriographers, as amongst those ancient [611]Persians, _qui in\ncommentarios referebant quae memoratu digna gerebantur_, informed and\nappointed by the state to register all famous acts, and not by each\ninsufficient scribbler, partial or parasitical pedant, as in our times. I\nwill provide public schools of all kinds, singing, dancing, fencing, &c.\nespecially of grammar and languages, not to be taught by those tedious\nprecepts ordinarily used, but by use, example, conversation, [612]as\ntravellers learn abroad, and nurses teach their children: as I will have\nall such places, so will I ordain [613]public governors, fit officers to\neach place, treasurers, aediles, quaestors, overseers of pupils, widows'\ngoods, and all public houses, &c. and those once a year to make strict\naccounts of all receipts, expenses, to avoid confusion, _et sic fiet ut non\nabsumant_ (as Pliny to Trajan,) _quad pudeat dicere_. They shall be\nsubordinate to those higher officers and governors of each city, which\nshall not be poor tradesmen, and mean artificers, but noblemen and\ngentlemen, which shall be tied to residence in those towns they dwell next,\nat such set times and seasons: for I see no reason (which [614]Hippolitus\ncomplains of) \"that it should be more dishonourable for noblemen to govern\nthe city than the country, or unseemly to dwell there now, than of old.\"\n[615]I will have no bogs, fens, marshes, vast woods, deserts, heaths,\ncommons, but all enclosed; (yet not depopulated, and therefore take heed\nyou mistake me not) for that which is common, and every man's, is no man's;\nthe richest countries are still enclosed, as Essex, Kent, with us, &c.\nSpain, Italy; and where enclosures are least in quantity, they are best\n[616]husbanded, as about Florence in Italy, Damascus in Syria, &c. which\nare liker gardens than fields. I will not have a barren acre in all my\nterritories, not so much as the tops of mountains: where nature fails, it\nshall be supplied by art: [617]lakes and rivers shall not be left desolate.\nAll common highways, bridges, banks, corrivations of waters, aqueducts,\nchannels, public works, buildings, &c. out of a [618]common stock,\ncuriously maintained and kept in repair; no depopulations, engrossings,\nalterations of wood, arable, but by the consent of some supervisors that\nshall be appointed for that purpose, to see what reformation ought to be\nhad in all places, what is amiss, how to help it, _et quid quaeque ferat\nregio, et quid quaeque recuset_, what ground is aptest for wood, what for\ncorn, what for cattle, gardens, orchards, fishponds, &c. with a charitable\ndivision in every village, (not one domineering house greedily to swallow\nup all, which is too common with us) what for lords, [619]what for tenants;\nand because they shall be better encouraged to improve such lands they\nhold, manure, plant trees, drain, fence, &c. they shall have long leases, a\nknown rent, and known fine to free them from those intolerable exactions of\ntyrannizing landlords. These supervisors shall likewise appoint what\nquantity of land in each manor is fit for the lord's demesnes, [620]what\nfor holding of tenants, how it ought to be husbanded, _ut [621]magnetis\nequis, Minyae gens cognita remis_, how to be manured, tilled, rectified,\n[622]_hic segetes veniunt, illic felicius uvae, arborei foetus alibi, atque\ninjussa virescunt Gramina_, and what proportion is fit for all callings,\nbecause private professors are many times idiots, ill husbands, oppressors,\ncovetous, and know not how to improve their own, or else wholly respect\ntheir own, and not public good.\n\nUtopian parity is a kind of government, to be wished for, [623]rather than\neffected, _Respub. Christianopolitana_, Campanella's city of the Sun, and\nthat new Atlantis, witty fictions, but mere chimeras; and Plato's community\nin many things is impious, absurd and ridiculous, it takes away all\nsplendour and magnificence. I will have several orders, degrees of\nnobility, and those hereditary, not rejecting younger brothers in the mean\ntime, for they shall be sufficiently provided for by pensions, or so\nqualified, brought up in some honest calling, they shall be able to live of\nthemselves. I will have such a proportion of ground belonging to every\nbarony, he that buys the land shall buy the barony, he that by riot\nconsumes his patrimony, and ancient demesnes, shall forfeit his honours.\n[624]As some dignities shall be hereditary, so some again by election, or\nby gift (besides free officers, pensions, annuities,) like our bishoprics,\nprebends, the Bassa's palaces in Turkey, the [625]procurator's houses and\noffices in Venice, which, like the golden apple, shall be given to the\nworthiest, and best deserving both in war and peace, as a reward of their\nworth and good service, as so many goals for all to aim at, (_honos alit\nartes_) and encouragements to others. For I hate these severe, unnatural,\nharsh, German, French, and Venetian decrees, which exclude plebeians from\nhonours, be they never so wise, rich, virtuous, valiant, and well\nqualified, they must not be patricians, but keep their own rank, this is\n_naturae bellum inferre_, odious to God and men, I abhor it. My form of\ngovernment shall be monarchical.\n\n[626]  \"nunquam libertas gratior extat,\n        Quam sub Rege pio,\" &c.\n\nfew laws, but those severely kept, plainly put down, and in the mother\ntongue, that every man may understand. Every city shall have a peculiar\ntrade or privilege, by which it shall be chiefly maintained: [627]and\nparents shall teach their children one of three at least, bring up and\ninstruct them in the mysteries of their own trade. In each town these\nseveral tradesmen shall be so aptly disposed, as they shall free the rest\nfrom danger or offence: fire-trades, as smiths, forge-men, brewers, bakers,\nmetal-men, &c., shall dwell apart by themselves: dyers, tanners,\nfellmongers, and such as use water in convenient places by themselves:\nnoisome or fulsome for bad smells, as butchers' slaughterhouses, chandlers,\ncurriers, in remote places, and some back lanes. Fraternities and\ncompanies, I approve of, as merchants' bourses, colleges of druggists,\nphysicians, musicians, &c., but all trades to be rated in the sale of\nwares, as our clerks of the market do bakers and brewers; corn itself, what\nscarcity soever shall come, not to extend such a price. Of such wares as\nare transported or brought in, [628]if they be necessary, commodious, and\nsuch as nearly concern man's life, as corn, wood, coal, &c., and such\nprovision we cannot want, I will have little or no custom paid, no taxes;\nbut for such things as are for pleasure, delight, or ornament, as wine,\nspice, tobacco, silk, velvet, cloth of gold, lace, jewels, &c., a greater\nimpost. I will have certain ships sent out for new discoveries every year,\n[629]and some discreet men appointed to travel into all neighbouring\nkingdoms by land, which shall observe what artificial inventions and good\nlaws are in other countries, customs, alterations, or aught else,\nconcerning war or peace, which may tend to the common good. Ecclesiastical\ndiscipline, _penes Episcopos_, subordinate as the other. No impropriations,\nno lay patrons of church livings, or one private man, but common societies,\ncorporations, &c., and those rectors of benefices to be chosen out of the\nUniversities, examined and approved, as the literati in China. No parish to\ncontain above a thousand auditors. If it were possible, I would have such\npriest as should imitate Christ, charitable lawyers should love their\nneighbours as themselves, temperate and modest physicians, politicians\ncontemn the world, philosophers should know themselves, noblemen live\nhonestly, tradesmen leave lying and cozening, magistrates corruption, &c.,\nbut this is impossible, I must get such as I may. I will therefore have\n[630]of lawyers, judges, advocates, physicians, chirurgeons, &c., a set\nnumber, [631]and every man, if it be possible, to plead his own cause, to\ntell that tale to the judge which he doth to his advocate, as at Fez in\nAfrica, Bantam, Aleppo, Ragusa, _suam quisque causam dicere tenetur_. Those\nadvocates, chirurgeons, and [632]physicians, which are allowed to be\nmaintained out of the [633]common treasury, no fees to be given or taken\nupon pain of losing their places; or if they do, very small fees, and when\nthe [634]cause is fully ended. [635]He that sues any man shall put in a\npledge, which if it be proved he hath wrongfully sued his adversary, rashly\nor maliciously, he shall forfeit, and lose. Or else before any suit begin,\nthe plaintiff shall have his complaint approved by a set delegacy to that\npurpose; if it be of moment he shall be suffered as before, to proceed, if\notherwise they shall determine it. All causes shall be pleaded _suppresso\nnomine_, the parties' names concealed, if some circumstances do not\notherwise require. Judges and other officers shall be aptly disposed in\neach province, villages, cities, as common arbitrators to hear causes, and\nend all controversies, and those not single, but three at least on the\nbench at once, to determine or give sentence, and those again to sit by\nturns or lots, and not to continue still in the same office. No controversy\nto depend above a year, but without all delays and further appeals to be\nspeedily despatched, and finally concluded in that time allotted. These and\nall other inferior magistrates to be chosen [636]as the literati in China,\nor by those exact suffrages of the [637]Venetians, and such again not to be\neligible, or capable of magistracies, honours, offices, except they be\nsufficiently [638]qualified for learning, manners, and that by the strict\napprobation of deputed examiners: [639]first scholars to take place, then\nsoldiers; for I am of Vigetius his opinion, a scholar deserves better than\na soldier, because _Unius aetatis sunt quae fortiter fiunt, quae vero pro\nutilitate Reipub. scribuntur, aeterna_: a soldier's work lasts for an age,\na scholar's for ever. If they [640]misbehave themselves, they shall be\ndeposed, and accordingly punished, and whether their offices be annual\n[641]or otherwise, once a year they shall be called in question, and give\nan account; for men are partial and passionate, merciless, covetous,\ncorrupt, subject to love, hate, fear, favour, &c., _omne sub regno graviore\nregnum_: like Solon's Areopagites, or those Roman Censors, some shall visit\nothers, and [642]be visited _invicem_ themselves, [643] they shall oversee\nthat no prowling officer, under colour of authority, shall insult over his\ninferiors, as so many wild beasts, oppress, domineer, flea, grind, or\ntrample on, be partial or corrupt, but that there be _aequabile jus_,\njustice equally done, live as friends and brethren together; and which\n[644]Sesellius would have and so much desires in his kingdom of France, \"a\ndiapason and sweet harmony of kings, princes, nobles, and plebeians so\nmutually tied and involved in love, as well as laws and authority, as that\nthey never disagree, insult, or encroach one upon another.\" If any man\ndeserve well in his office he shall be rewarded.\n\n        ------\"quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam,\n        Proemia si tollas?\"------[645]\n\nHe that invents anything for public good in any art or science, writes a\ntreatise, [646]or performs any noble exploit, at home or abroad, [647]\nshall be accordingly enriched, [648]honoured, and preferred. I say with\nHannibal in Ennius, _Hostem qui feriet erit mihi Carthaginensis_, let him\nbe of what condition he will, in all offices, actions, he that deserves\nbest shall have best.\n\nTilianus in Philonius, out of a charitable mind no doubt, wished all his\nbooks were gold and silver, jewels and precious stones, [649]to redeem\ncaptives, set free prisoners, and relieve all poor distressed souls that\nwanted means; religiously done. I deny not, but to what purpose? Suppose\nthis were so well done, within a little after, though a man had Croesus'\nwealth to bestow, there would be as many more. Wherefore I will suffer no\n[650]beggars, rogues, vagabonds, or idle persons at all, that cannot give\nan account of their lives how they [651]maintain themselves. If they be\nimpotent, lame, blind, and single, they shall be sufficiently maintained in\nseveral hospitals, built for that purpose; if married and infirm, past\nwork, or by inevitable loss, or some such like misfortune cast behind, by\ndistribution of [652]corn, house-rent free, annual pensions or money, they\nshall be relieved, and highly rewarded for their good service they have\nformerly done; if able, they shall be enforced to work. [653]\"For I see no\nreason\" (as [654]he said) \"why an epicure or idle drone, a rich glutton, a\nusurer, should live at ease, and do nothing, live in honour, in all manner\nof pleasures, and oppress others, when as in the meantime a poor labourer,\na smith, a carpenter, an husbandman that hath spent his time in continual\nlabour, as an ass to carry burdens, to do the commonwealth good, and\nwithout whom we cannot live, shall be left in his old age to beg or starve,\nand lead a miserable life worse than a jument.\" As [655]all conditions\nshall be tied to their task, so none shall be overtired, but have their set\ntimes of recreations and holidays, _indulgere genio_, feasts and merry\nmeetings, even to the meanest artificer, or basest servant, once a week to\nsing or dance, (though not all at once) or do whatsoever he shall please;\nlike [656]that _Saccarum festum_ amongst the Persians, those Saturnals in\nRome, as well as his master. [657]If any be drunk, he shall drink no more\nwine or strong drink in a twelvemonth after. A bankrupt shall be [658]\n_Catademiatus in Amphitheatro_, publicly shamed, and he that cannot pay his\ndebts, if by riot or negligence he have been impoverished, shall be for a\ntwelvemonth imprisoned, if in that space his creditors be not satisfied,\n[659]he shall be hanged. He [660]that commits sacrilege shall lose his\nhands; he that bears false witness, or is of perjury convicted, shall have\nhis tongue cut out, except he redeem it with his head. Murder, [661]\nadultery, shall be punished by death, [662]but not theft, except it be some\nmore grievous offence, or notorious offenders: otherwise they shall be\ncondemned to the galleys, mines, be his slaves whom they have offended,\nduring their lives. I hate all hereditary slaves, and that _duram Persarum\nlegem_ as [663]Brisonius calls it; or as [664]Ammianus, _impendio\nformidatas et abominandas leges, per quas ob noxam unius, omnis\npropinquitas perit_ hard law that wife and children, friends and allies,\nshould suffer for the father's offence.\n\nNo man shall marry until he [665]be 25, no woman till she be 20, [666]\n_nisi alitur dispensatum fuerit_. If one [667]die, the other party shall\nnot marry till six months after; and because many families are compelled to\nlive niggardly, exhaust and undone by great dowers, [668]none shall be\ngiven at all, or very little, and that by supervisors rated, they that are\nfoul shall have a greater portion; if fair, none at all, or very little:\n[669]howsoever not to exceed such a rate as those supervisors shall think\nfit. And when once they come to those years, poverty shall hinder no man\nfrom marriage, or any other respect, [670]but all shall be rather enforced\nthan hindered, [671]except they be [672]dismembered, or grievously\ndeformed, infirm, or visited with some enormous hereditary disease, in body\nor mind; in such cases upon a great pain, or mulct, [673]man or woman shall\nnot marry, other order shall be taken for them to their content. If people\noverabound, they shall be eased by [674]colonies.\n\n[675]No man shall wear weapons in any city. The same attire shall be kept,\nand that proper to several callings, by which they shall be distinguished.\n[676]_Luxus funerum_ shall be taken away, that intempestive expense\nmoderated, and many others. Brokers, takers of pawns, biting usurers, I\nwill not admit; yet because _hic cum hominibus non cum diis agitur_, we\nconverse here with men, not with gods, and for the hardness of men's hearts\nI will tolerate some kind of usury. [677]If we were honest, I confess, _si\nprobi essemus_, we should have no use of it, but being as it is, we must\nnecessarily admit it. Howsoever most divines contradict it, _dicimus\ninficias, sed vox ea sola reperta est_, it must be winked at by\npoliticians. And yet some great doctors approve of it, Calvin, Bucer,\nZanchius, P. Martyr, because by so many grand lawyers, decrees of emperors,\nprinces' statutes, customs of commonwealths, churches' approbations it is\npermitted, &c. I will therefore allow it. But to no private persons, nor to\nevery man that will, to orphans only, maids, widows, or such as by reason\nof their age, sex, education, ignorance of trading, know not otherwise how\nto employ it; and those so approved, not to let it out apart, but to bring\ntheir money to a [678]common bank which shall be allowed in every city, as\nin Genoa, Geneva, Nuremberg, Venice, at [679]5, 6, 7, not above 8 per\ncentum, as the supervisors, or _aerarii praefecti_ shall think fit.\n[680]And as it shall not be lawful for each man to be an usurer that will,\nso shall it not be lawful for all to take up money at use, not to prodigals\nand spendthrifts, but to merchants, young tradesmen, such as stand in need,\nor know honestly how to employ it, whose necessity, cause and condition the\nsaid supervisors shall approve of.\n\nI will have no private monopolies, to enrich one man, and beggar a\nmultitude, [681]multiplicity of offices, of supplying by deputies, weights\nand measures, the same throughout, and those rectified by the _Primum\nmobile_ and sun's motion, threescore miles to a degree according to\nobservation, 1000 geometrical paces to a mile, five foot to a pace, twelve\ninches to a foot, &c. and from measures known it is an easy matter to\nrectify weights, &c. to cast up all, and resolve bodies by algebra,\nstereometry. I hate wars if they be not _ad populi salutem_ upon urgent\noccasion, [682]_odimus accipitrim, quia semper vivit in armis_ [683]\noffensive wars, except the cause be very just, I will not allow of. For I\ndo highly magnify that saying of Hannibal to Scipio, in [684]Livy, \"It had\nbeen a blessed thing for you and us, if God had given that mind to our\npredecessors, that you had been content with Italy, we with Africa. For\nneither Sicily nor Sardinia are worth such cost and pains, so many fleets\nand armies, or so many famous Captains' lives.\" _Omnia prius tentanda_,\nfair means shall first be tried. [685]_Peragit tranquilla potestas, Quod\nviolenta nequit_. I will have them proceed with all moderation: but hear\nyou, Fabius my general, not Minutius, _nam [686]qui Consilio nititur plus\nhostibus nocet, quam qui sini animi ratione, viribus_: And in such wars to\nabstain as much as is possible from [687]depopulations, burning of towns,\nmassacring of infants, &c. For defensive wars, I will have forces still\nready at a small warning, by land and sea, a prepared navy, soldiers _in\nprocinctu, et quam [688]Bonfinius apud Hungaros suos vult, virgam ferream_,\nand money, which is _nerves belli_, still in a readiness, and a sufficient\nrevenue, a third part as in old [689]Rome and Egypt, reserved for the\ncommonwealth; to avoid those heavy taxes and impositions, as well to defray\nthis charge of wars, as also all other public defalcations, expenses, fees,\npensions, reparations, chaste sports, feasts, donaries, rewards, and\nentertainments. All things in this nature especially I will have maturely\ndone, and with great [690]deliberation: _ne quid [691] temere, ne quid\nremisse ac timide fiat; Sid quo feror hospes_? To prosecute the rest would\nrequire a volume. _Manum de tabella_, I have been over tedious in this\nsubject; I could have here willingly ranged, but these straits wherein I am\nincluded will not permit.\n\nFrom commonwealths and cities, I will descend to families, which have as\nmany corsives and molestations, as frequent discontents as the rest. Great\naffinity there is betwixt a political and economical body; they differ only\nin magnitude and proportion of business (so Scaliger [692]writes) as they\nhave both likely the same period, as [693]Bodin and [694]Peucer hold, out\nof Plato, six or seven hundred years, so many times they have the same\nmeans of their vexation and overthrows; as namely, riot, a common ruin of\nboth, riot in building, riot in profuse spending, riot in apparel, &c. be\nit in what kind soever, it produceth the same effects. A [695]chorographer\nof ours speaking _obiter_ of ancient families, why they are so frequent in\nthe north, continue so long, are so soon extinguished in the south, and so\nfew, gives no other reason but this, _luxus omnia dissipavit_, riot hath\nconsumed all, fine clothes and curious buildings came into this island, as\nhe notes in his annals, not so many years since; _non sine dispendio\nhospitalitatis_ to the decay of hospitality. Howbeit many times that word\nis mistaken, and under the name of bounty and hospitality, is shrouded riot\nand prodigality, and that which is commendable in itself well used, hath\nbeen mistaken heretofore, is become by his abuse, the bane and utter ruin\nof many a noble family. For some men live like the rich glutton, consuming\nthemselves and their substance by continual feasting and invitations, with\n[696]Axilon in Homer, keep open house for all comers, giving entertainment\nto such as visit them, [697]keeping a table beyond their means, and a\ncompany of idle servants (though not so frequent as of old) are blown up on\na sudden; and as Actaeon was by his hounds, devoured by their kinsmen,\nfriends, and multitude of followers. [698]It is a wonder that Paulus Jovius\nrelates of our northern countries, what an infinite deal of meat we consume\non our tables; that I may truly say, 'tis not bounty, not hospitality, as\nit is often abused, but riot and excess, gluttony and prodigality; a mere\nvice; it brings in debt, want, and beggary, hereditary diseases, consumes\ntheir fortunes, and overthrows the good temperature of their bodies. To\nthis I might here well add their inordinate expense in building, those\nfantastical houses, turrets, walks, parks, &c. gaming, excess of pleasure,\nand that prodigious riot in apparel, by which means they are compelled to\nbreak up house, and creep into holes. Sesellius in his commonwealth of\n[699]France, gives three reasons why the French nobility were so frequently\nbankrupts: \"First, because they had so many lawsuits and contentions one\nupon another, which were tedious and costly; by which means it came to\npass, that commonly lawyers bought them out of their possessions. A second\ncause was their riot, they lived beyond their means, and were therefore\nswallowed up by merchants.\" (La Nove, a French writer, yields five reasons\nof his countrymen's poverty, to the same effect almost, and thinks verily\nif the gentry of France were divided into ten parts, eight of them would be\nfound much impaired, by sales, mortgages, and debts, or wholly sunk in\ntheir estates.) \"The last was immoderate excess in apparel, which consumed\ntheir revenues.\" How this concerns and agrees with our present state, look\nyou. But of this elsewhere. As it is in a man's body, if either head,\nheart, stomach, liver, spleen, or any one part be misaffected, all the rest\nsuffer with it: so is it with this economical body. If the head be naught,\na spendthrift, a drunkard, a whoremaster, a gamester, how shall the family\nlive at ease? [700]_Ipsa si cupiat solus servare, prorsus, non potest hanc\nfamiliam_, as Demea said in the comedy, Safety herself cannot save it. A\ngood, honest, painful man many times hath a shrew to his wife, a sickly,\ndishonest, slothful, foolish, careless woman to his mate, a proud, peevish\nflirt, a liquorish, prodigal quean, and by that means all goes to ruin: or\nif they differ in nature, he is thrifty, she spends all, he wise, she\nsottish and soft; what agreement can there be? what friendship? Like that\nof the thrush and swallow in Aesop, instead of mutual love, kind\ncompellations, whore and thief is heard, they fling stools at one another's\nheads. [701]_Quae intemperies vexat hanc familiam_? All enforced marriages\ncommonly produce such effects, or if on their behalves it be well, as to\nlive and agree lovingly together, they may have disobedient and unruly\nchildren, that take ill courses to disquiet them, [702]\"their son is a\nthief, a spendthrift, their daughter a whore;\" a step [703]mother, or a\ndaughter-in-law distempers all; [704]or else for want of means, many\ntorturers arise, debts, dues, fees, dowries, jointures, legacies to be\npaid, annuities issuing out, by means of which, they have not wherewithal\nto maintain themselves in that pomp as their predecessors have done, bring\nup or bestow their children to their callings, to their birth and quality,\n[705]and will not descend to their present fortunes. Oftentimes, too, to\naggravate the rest, concur many other inconveniences, unthankful friends,\ndecayed friends, bad neighbours, negligent servants [706]_servi furaces,\nVersipelles, callidi, occlusa sibi mille clavibus reserant, furtimque;\nraptant, consumunt, liguriunt_; casualties, taxes, mulcts, chargeable\noffices, vain expenses, entertainments, loss of stock, enmities,\nemulations, frequent invitations, losses, suretyship, sickness, death of\nfriends, and that which is the gulf of all, improvidence, ill husbandry,\ndisorder and confusion, by which means they are drenched on a sudden in\ntheir estates, and at unawares precipitated insensibly into an inextricable\nlabyrinth of debts, cares, woes, want, grief, discontent and melancholy\nitself.\n\nI have done with families, and will now briefly run over some few sorts and\nconditions of men. The most secure, happy, jovial, and merry in the world's\nesteem are princes and great men, free from melancholy: but for their\ncares, miseries, suspicions, jealousies, discontents, folly and madness, I\nrefer you to Xenophon's Tyrannus, where king Hieron discourseth at large\nwith Simonides the poet, of this subject. Of all others they are most\ntroubled with perpetual fears, anxieties, insomuch, that as he said in\n[707]Valerius, if thou knewest with what cares and miseries this robe were\nstuffed, thou wouldst not stoop to take it up. Or put case they be secure\nand free from fears and discontents, yet they are void [708]of reason too\noft, and precipitate in their actions, read all our histories, _quos de\nstultis prodidere stulti_, Iliades, Aeneides, Annales, and what is the\nsubject?\n\n       \"Stultorum regum, et populorum continet aestus.\"\n\n       \"The giddy tumults and the foolish rage\n        Of kings and people.\"\n\nHow mad they are, how furious, and upon small occasions, rash and\ninconsiderate in their proceedings, how they dote, every page almost will\nwitness,\n\n        ------\"delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.\"\n\n       \"When doting monarchs urge\n        Unsound resolves, their subjects feel the scourge.\"\n\nNext in place, next in miseries and discontents, in all manner of\nhair-brain actions, are great men, _procul a Jove, procul a fulmine_, the\nnearer the worse. If they live in court, they are up and down, ebb and flow\nwith their princes' favours, _Ingenium vultu statque caditque suo_, now\naloft, tomorrow down, as [709]Polybius describes them, \"like so many\ncasting counters, now of gold, tomorrow of silver, that vary in worth as\nthe computant will; now they stand for units, tomorrow for thousands; now\nbefore all, and anon behind.\" Beside, they torment one another with mutual\nfactions, emulations: one is ambitious, another enamoured, a third in debt,\na prodigal, overruns his fortunes, a fourth solicitous with cares, gets\nnothing, &c. But for these men's discontents, anxieties, I refer you to\nLucian's Tract, _de mercede conductis_, [710]Aeneas Sylvius (_libidinis et\nstultitiae servos_, he calls them), Agrippa, and many others.\n\nOf philosophers and scholars _priscae sapientiae dictatores_, I have\nalready spoken in general terms, those superintendents of wit and learning,\nmen above men, those refined men, minions of the muses,\n\n[711]   ------\"mentemque habere queis bonam\n        Et esse [712]corculis datum est.\"------\n\n[713]These acute and subtle sophisters, so much honoured, have as much need\nof hellebore as others.--[714]_O medici mediam pertundite venam._ Read\nLucian's Piscator, and tell how he esteemed them; Agrippa's Tract of the\nvanity of Sciences; nay read their own works, their absurd tenets,\nprodigious paradoxes, _et risum teneatis amici_? You shall find that of\nAristotle true, _nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae_, they have\na worm as well as others; you shall find a fantastical strain, a fustian, a\nbombast, a vainglorious humour, an affected style, &c., like a prominent\nthread in an uneven woven cloth, run parallel throughout their works. And\nthey that teach wisdom, patience, meekness, are the veriest dizzards,\nharebrains, and most discontent. [715]\"In the multitude of wisdom is grief,\nand he that increaseth wisdom, increaseth sorrow.\" I need not quote mine\nauthor; they that laugh and contemn others, condemn the world of folly,\ndeserve to be mocked, are as giddy-headed, and lie as open as any other.\n[716]Democritus, that common flouter of folly, was ridiculous himself,\nbarking Menippus, scoffing Lucian, satirical Lucilius, Petronius, Varro,\nPersius, &c., may be censured with the rest, _Loripedem rectus derideat,\nAethiopem albus._ Bale, Erasmus, Hospinian, Vives, Kemnisius, explode as a\nvast ocean of obs and sols, school divinity. [717]A labyrinth of intricable\nquestions, unprofitable contentions, _incredibilem delirationem_, one calls\nit. If school divinity be so censured, _subtilis [718]Scotus lima\nveritatis, Occam irrefragabilis, cujus ingenium vetera omnia ingenia\nsubvertit_, &c. Baconthrope, Dr. Resolutus, and _Corculum Theolgiae_,\nThomas himself, Doctor [719]Seraphicus, _cui dictavit Angelus_, &c. What\nshall become of humanity? _Ars stulta_, what can she plead? what can her\nfollowers say for themselves? Much learning, [720] _cere-diminuit-brum_,\nhath cracked their sconce, and taken such root, that _tribus Anticyris\ncaput insanabile_, hellebore itself can do no good, nor that renowned\n[721]lantern of Epictetus, by which if any man studied, he should be as\nwise as he was. But all will not serve; rhetoricians, _in ostentationem\nloquacitatis multa agitant_, out of their volubility of tongue, will talk\nmuch to no purpose, orators can persuade other men what they will, _quo\nvolunt, unde volunt_, move, pacify, &c., but cannot settle their own\nbrains, what saith Tully? _Malo indisertam prudentiam, quam loquacem,\nstultitiam_; and as [722]Seneca seconds him, a wise man's oration should\nnot be polite or solicitous. [723]Fabius esteems no better of most of them,\neither in speech, action, gesture, than as men beside themselves, _insanos\ndeclamatores_; so doth Gregory, _Non mihi sapit qui sermone, sed qui factis\nsapit._ Make the best of him, a good orator is a turncoat, an evil man,\n_bonus orator pessimus vir_, his tongue is set to sale, he is a mere voice,\nas [724]he said of a nightingale, _dat sine mente sonum_, an hyperbolical\nliar, a flatterer, a parasite, and as [725] Ammianus Marcellinus will, a\ncorrupting cozener, one that doth more mischief by his fair speeches, than\nhe that bribes by money; for a man may with more facility avoid him that\ncircumvents by money, than him that deceives with glozing terms; which made\n[726]Socrates so much abhor and explode them. [727]Fracastorius, a famous\npoet, freely grants all poets to be mad; so doth [728]Scaliger; and who\ndoth not? _Aut insanit homo, aut versus facit_ (He's mad or making verses),\nHor. _Sat. vii. l. 2._ _Insanire lubet, i. versus componere._ Virg. _3\nEcl._; so Servius interprets it, all poets are mad, a company of bitter\nsatirists, detractors, or else parasitical applauders: and what is poetry\nitself, but as Austin holds, _Vinum erroris ab ebriis doctoribus\npropinatum_? You may give that censure of them in general, which Sir Thomas\nMore once did of Germanus Brixius' poems in particular.\n\n        ------\"vehuntur\n        In rate stultitiae sylvam habitant Furiae.\"[729]\n\nBudaeus, in an epistle of his to Lupsetus, will have civil law to be the\ntower of wisdom; another honours physic, the quintessence of nature; a\nthird tumbles them both down, and sets up the flag of his own peculiar\nscience. Your supercilious critics, grammatical triflers, note-makers,\ncurious antiquaries, find out all the ruins of wit, _ineptiarum delicias_,\namongst the rubbish of old writers; [730]_Pro stultis habent nisi aliquid\nsufficiant invenire, quod in aliorum scriptis vertant vitio_, all fools\nwith them that cannot find fault; they correct others, and are hot in a\ncold cause, puzzle themselves to find out how many streets in Rome, houses,\ngates, towers, Homer's country, Aeneas's mother, Niobe's daughters, _an\nSappho publica fuerit? ovum [731]prius extiterit an gallina! &c. et alia\nquae dediscenda essent scire, si scires_, as [732]Seneca holds. What\nclothes the senators did wear in Rome, what shoes, how they sat, where they\nwent to the close-stool, how many dishes in a mess, what sauce, which for\nthe present for an historian to relate, [733]according to Lodovic. Vives,\nis very ridiculous, is to them most precious elaborate stuff, they admired\nfor it, and as proud, as triumphant in the meantime for this discovery, as\nif they had won a city, or conquered a province; as rich as if they had\nfound a mine of gold ore. _Quosvis auctores absurdis commentis suis\npercacant et stercorant_, one saith, they bewray and daub a company of\nbooks and good authors, with their absurd comments, _correctorum\nsterquilinia_ [734]Scaliger calls them, and show their wit in censuring\nothers, a company of foolish note-makers, humble-bees, dors, or beetles,\n_inter stercora ut plurimum versantur_, they rake over all those rubbish\nand dunghills, and prefer a manuscript many times before the Gospel itself,\n[735]_thesaurum criticum_, before any treasure, and with their deleaturs,\n_alii legunt sic, meus codex sic habet_, with their _postremae editiones_,\nannotations, castigations, &c. make books dear, themselves ridiculous, and\ndo nobody good, yet if any man dare oppose or contradict, they are mad, up\nin arms on a sudden, how many sheets are written in defence, how bitter\ninvectives, what apologies? [736]_Epiphilledes hae sunt ut merae, nugae_.\nBut I dare say no more of, for, with, or against them, because I am liable\nto their lash as well as others. Of these and the rest of our artists and\nphilosophers, I will generally conclude they are a kind of madmen, as [737]\nSeneca esteems of them, to make doubts and scruples, how to read them\ntruly, to mend old authors, but will not mend their own lives, or teach us\n_ingevia sanare, memoriam officiorum ingerere, ac fidem in rebus humanis\nretinere_, to keep our wits in order, or rectify our manners. _Numquid tibi\ndemens videtur, si istis operam impenderit_? Is not he mad that draws lines\nwith Archimedes, whilst his house is ransacked, and his city besieged, when\nthe whole world is in combustion, or we whilst our souls are in danger,\n(_mors sequitur, vita fugit_) to spend our time in toys, idle questions,\nand things of no worth?\n\nThat [738]lovers are mad, I think no man will deny, _Amare simul et sapere,\nipsi Jovi non datur_, Jupiter himself cannot intend both at once.\n\n[739]  \"Non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur\n        Majestas et amor.\"\n\nTully, when he was invited to a second marriage, replied, he could not\n_simul amare et sapere_ be wise and love both together. [740]_Est orcus\nille, vis est immedicabilis, est rabies insana_, love is madness, a hell,\nan incurable disease; _inpotentem et insanam libidinem_ [741]Seneca calls\nit, an impotent and raging lust. I shall dilate this subject apart; in the\nmeantime let lovers sigh out the rest.\n\n[742]Nevisanus the lawyer holds it for an axiom, \"most women are fools,\"\n[743]_consilium foeminis invalidum_; Seneca, men, be they young or old; who\ndoubts it, youth is mad as Elius in Tully, _Stulti adolescentuli_, old age\nlittle better, _deleri senes_, &c. Theophrastes, in the 107th year of his\nage, [744]said he then began to be to wise, _tum sapere coepit_, and\ntherefore lamented his departure. If wisdom come so late, where shall we\nfind a wise man? Our old ones dote at threescore-and-ten. I would cite more\nproofs, and a better author, but for the present, let one fool point at\nanother. [745]Nevisanus hath as hard an opinion of [746]rich men, \"wealth\nand wisdom cannot dwell together,\" _stultitiam patiuntur opes_, [747]and\nthey do commonly [748]_infatuare cor hominis_, besot men; and as we see it,\n\"fools have fortune:\" [749]_Sapientia non invenitur in terra suaviter\nviventium_. For beside a natural contempt of learning, which accompanies\nsuch kind of men, innate idleness (for they will take no pains), and which\n[750]Aristotle observes, _ubi mens plurima, ibi minima fortuna, ubi plurima\nfortuna, ibi mens perexigua_, great wealth and little wit go commonly\ntogether: they have as much brains some of them in their heads as in their\nheels; besides this inbred neglect of liberal sciences, and all arts, which\nshould _excolere mentem_, polish the mind, they have most part some gullish\nhumour or other, by which they are led; one is an Epicure, an Atheist, a\nsecond a gamester, a third a whoremaster (fit subjects all for a satirist\nto work upon);\n\n[751]  \"Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hic puerorum.\"\n\n       \"One burns to madness for the wedded dame;\n        Unnatural lusts another's heart inflame.\"\n\n[752]one is mad of hawking, hunting, cocking; another of carousing,\nhorse-riding, spending; a fourth of building, fighting, &c., _Insanit\nveteres statuas Damasippus emendo_, Damasippus hath an humour of his own,\nto be talked of: [753]Heliodorus the Carthaginian another. In a word, as\nScaliger concludes of them all, they are _Statuae erectae stultitiae_, the\nvery statutes or pillars of folly. Choose out of all stories him that hath\nbeen most admired, you shall still find, _multa ad laudem, multa ad\nvituperationem magnifica_, as [754]Berosus of Semiramis; _omnes mortales\nmilitia triumphis, divitiis_, &c., _tum et luxu, caede, caeterisque vitiis\nantecessit_, as she had some good, so had she many bad parts.\n\nAlexander, a worthy man, but furious in his anger, overtaken in drink:\nCaesar and Scipio valiant and wise, but vainglorious, ambitious: Vespasian\na worthy prince, but covetous: [755]Hannibal, as he had mighty virtues, so\nhad he many vices; _unam virtutem mille vitia comitantur_, as Machiavel of\nCosmo de Medici, he had two distinct persons in him. I will determine of\nthem all, they are like these double or turning pictures; stand before\nwhich you see a fair maid, on the one side an ape, on the other an owl;\nlook upon them at the first sight, all is well, but farther examine, you\nshall find them wise on the one side, and fools on the other; in some few\nthings praiseworthy, in the rest incomparably faulty. I will say nothing of\ntheir diseases, emulations, discontents, wants, and such miseries: let\npoverty plead the rest in Aristophanes' Plutus.\n\nCovetous men, amongst others, are most mad, [756]they have all the symptoms\nof melancholy, fear, sadness, suspicion, &c., as shall be proved in its\nproper place,\n\n       \"Danda est Hellebori multo pars maxima avaris.\"\n\n       \"Misers make Anticyra their own;\n        Its hellebore reserved for them alone.\"\n\nAnd yet methinks prodigals are much madder than they, be of what condition\nthey will, that bear a public or private purse; as a [757]Dutch writer\ncensured Richard the rich duke of Cornwall, suing to be emperor, for his\nprofuse spending, _qui effudit pecuniam, ante pedes principium Electorum\nsicut aquam_, that scattered money like water; I do censure them, _Stulta\nAnglia_ (saith he) _quae, tot denariis sponte est privata, stulti principes\nAlemaniae, qui nobile jus suum pro pecunia vendiderunt_; spendthrifts,\nbribers, and bribe-takers are fools, and so are [758]all they that cannot\nkeep, disburse, or spend their moneys well.\n\nI might say the like of angry, peevish, envious, ambitious; [759]\n_Anticyras melior sorbere meracas_; Epicures, Atheists, Schismatics,\nHeretics; _hi omnes habent imaginationem laesam_ (saith Nymannus) \"and\ntheir madness shall be evident,\" 2 Tim. iii. 9. [760]Fabatus, an Italian,\nholds seafaring men all mad; \"the ship is mad, for it never stands still;\nthe mariners are mad, to expose themselves to such imminent dangers: the\nwaters are raging mad, in perpetual motion: the winds are as mad as the\nrest, they know not whence they come, whither they would go: and those men\nare maddest of all that go to sea; for one fool at home, they find forty\nabroad.\" He was a madman that said it, and thou peradventure as mad to read\nit. [761] Felix Platerus is of opinion all alchemists are mad, out of their\nwits; [762]Atheneus saith as much of fiddlers, _et musarum luscinias_,\n[763] Musicians, _omnes tibicines insaniunt, ubi semel efflant, avolat\nillico mens_, in comes music at one ear, out goes wit at another. Proud and\nvainglorious persons are certainly mad; and so are [764]lascivious; I can\nfeel their pulses beat hither; horn-mad some of them, to let others lie\nwith their wives, and wink at it.\n\nTo insist [765]in all particulars, were an Herculean task, to [766]reckon\nup [767]_insanas substructiones, insanos labores, insanum luxum_, mad\nlabours, mad books, endeavours, carriages, gross ignorance, ridiculous\nactions, absurd gestures; _insanam gulam, insaniam villarum, insana\njurgia_, as Tully terms them, madness of villages, stupend structures; as\nthose Egyptian Pyramids, Labyrinths and Sphinxes, which a company of\ncrowned asses, _ad ostentationem opum_, vainly built, when neither the\narchitect nor king that made them, or to what use and purpose, are yet\nknown: to insist in their hypocrisy, inconstancy, blindness, rashness,\n_dementem temeritatem_, fraud, cozenage, malice, anger, impudence,\ningratitude, ambition, gross superstition, [768]_tempora infecta et\nadulatione sordida_, as in Tiberius' times, such base flattery, stupend,\nparasitical fawning and colloguing, &c. brawls, conflicts, desires,\ncontentions, it would ask an expert Vesalius to anatomise every member.\nShall I say? Jupiter himself, Apollo, Mars, &c. doted; and\nmonster-conquering Hercules that subdued the world, and helped others,\ncould not relieve himself in this, but mad he was at last. And where shall\na man walk, converse with whom, in what province, city, and not meet with\nSignior Deliro, or Hercules Furens, Maenads, and Corybantes? Their speeches\nsay no less. [769]_E fungis nati homines_, or else they fetched their\npedigree from those that were struck by Samson with the jaw-bone of an ass.\nOr from Deucalion and Pyrrha's stones, for _durum genus sumus_, [770]\n_marmorei sumus_, we are stony-hearted, and savour too much of the stock,\nas if they had all heard that enchanted horn of Astolpho, that English duke\nin Ariosto, which never sounded but all his auditors were mad, and for fear\nready to make away with themselves; [771]or landed in the mad haven in the\nEuxine sea of _Daphnis insana_, which had a secret quality to dementate;\nthey are a company of giddy-heads, afternoon men, it is Midsummer moon\nstill, and the dog-days last all the year long, they are all mad. Whom\nshall I then except? Ulricus Huttenus [772]_nemo, nam, nemo omnibus horis\nsapit, Nemo nascitur sine vitiis, Crimine Nemo caret, Nemo sorte sua vivit\ncontentus, Nemo in amore sapit, Nemo bonus, Nemo sapiens, Nemo, est ex omni\nparti beatus_, &c. [773]and therefore Nicholas Nemo, or Monsieur Nobody\nshall go free, _Quid valeat nemo, Nemo referre potest_? But whom shall I\nexcept in the second place? such as are silent, _vir sapit qui pauca\nloquitur_; [774]no better way to avoid folly and madness, than by\ntaciturnity. Whom in a third? all senators, magistrates; for all fortunate\nmen are wise, and conquerors valiant, and so are all great men, _non est\nbonum ludere cum diis_, they are wise by authority, good by their office\nand place, _his licet impune pessimos esse_, (some say) we must not speak\nof them, neither is it fit; _per me sint omnia protinus alba_, I will not\nthink amiss of them. Whom next? Stoics? _Sapiens Stoicus_, and he alone is\nsubject to no perturbations, as [775]Plutarch scoffs at him, \"he is not\nvexed with torments, or burnt with fire, foiled by his adversary, sold of\nhis enemy: though he be wrinkled, sand-blind, toothless, and deformed; yet\nhe is most beautiful, and like a god, a king in conceit, though not worth a\ngroat. He never dotes, never mad, never sad, drunk, because virtue cannot\nbe taken away,\" as [776]Zeno holds, \"by reason of strong apprehension,\" but\nhe was mad to say so. [777]_Anticyrae caelo huic est opus aut dolabra_, he\nhad need to be bored, and so had all his fellows, as wise as they would\nseem to be. Chrysippus himself liberally grants them to be fools as well as\nothers, at certain times, upon some occasions, _amitti virtutem ait per\nebrietatem, aut atribilarium morbum_, it may be lost by drunkenness or\nmelancholy, he may be sometimes crazed as well as the rest: [778]_ad summum\nsapiens nisi quum pituita molesta_. I should here except some Cynics,\nMenippus, Diogenes, that Theban Crates; or to descend to these times, that\nomniscious, only wise fraternity [779]of the Rosicrucians, those great\ntheologues, politicians, philosophers, physicians, philologers, artists,\n&c. of whom S. Bridget, Albas Joacchimus, Leicenbergius, and such divine\nspirits have prophesied, and made promise to the world, if at least there\nbe any such (Hen. [780]Neuhusius makes a doubt of it, [781] Valentinus\nAndreas and others) or an Elias artifex their Theophrastian master; whom\nthough Libavius and many deride and carp at, yet some will have to be \"the\n[782]renewer of all arts and sciences,\" reformer of the world, and now\nliving, for so Johannes Montanus Strigoniensis, that great patron of\nParacelsus, contends, and certainly avers [783]\"a most divine man,\" and the\nquintessence of wisdom wheresoever he is; for he, his fraternity, friends,\n&c. are all [784]\"betrothed to wisdom,\" if we may believe their disciples\nand followers. I must needs except Lipsius and the Pope, and expunge their\nname out of the catalogue of fools. For besides that parasitical testimony\nof Dousa,\n\n       \"A Sole exoriente Maeotidas usque paludes,\n        Nemo est qui justo se aequiparare queat.\"[785]\n\nLipsius saith of himself, that he was [786]_humani generis quidem\npaedagogus voce et stylo_, a grand signior, a master, a tutor of us all,\nand for thirteen years he brags how he sowed wisdom in the Low Countries,\nas Ammonius the philosopher sometimes did in Alexandria, [787]_cum\nhumanitate literas et sapientiam cum prudentia: antistes sapientiae_, he\nshall be _Sapientum Octavus_. The Pope is more than a man, as [788]his\nparrots often make him, a demigod, and besides his holiness cannot err, _in\nCathedra_ belike: and yet some of them have been magicians, Heretics,\nAtheists, children, and as Platina saith of John 22, _Et si vir literatus,\nmulta stoliditatem et laevitatem prae se ferentia egit, stolidi et socordis\nvir ingenii_, a scholar sufficient, yet many things he did foolishly,\nlightly. I can say no more than in particular, but in general terms to the\nrest, they are all mad, their wits are evaporated, and, as Ariosto feigns,\n_l. 34_, kept in jars above the moon.\n\n       \"Some lose their wits with love, some with ambition,\n        Some following [789]Lords and men of high condition.\n        Some in fair jewels rich and costly set,\n        Others in Poetry their wits forget.\n        Another thinks to be an Alchemist,\n        Till all be spent, and that his number's mist.\"\n\nConvicted fools they are, madmen upon record; and I am afraid past cure\nmany of them, [790]_crepunt inguina_, the symptoms are manifest, they are\nall of Gotam parish:\n\n[791]  \"Quum furor haud dubius, quum sit manifesta phrenesis,\"\n\n       \"Since madness is indisputable, since frenzy is obvious.\"\n\nwhat remains then [792]but to send for Lorarios, those officers to carry\nthem all together for company to Bedlam, and set Rabelais to be their\nphysician.\n\nIf any man shall ask in the meantime, who I am that so boldly censure\nothers, _tu nullane habes vitia_? have I no faults? [793]Yes, more than\nthou hast, whatsoever thou art. _Nos numerus sumus_, I confess it again, I\nam as foolish, as mad as any one.\n\n[794]  \"Insanus vobis videor, non deprecor ipse,\n        Quo minus insanus,\"------\n\nI do not deny it, _demens de populo dematur_. My comfort is, I have more\nfellows, and those of excellent note. And though I be not so right or so\ndiscreet as I should be, yet not so mad, so bad neither, as thou perhaps\ntakest me to be.\n\nTo conclude, this being granted, that all the world is melancholy, or mad,\ndotes, and every member of it, I have ended my task, and sufficiently\nillustrated that which I took upon me to demonstrate at first. At this\npresent I have no more to say; _His sanam mentem Democritus_, I can but\nwish myself and them a good physician, and all of us a better mind.\n\nAnd although for the above-named reasons, I had a just cause to undertake\nthis subject, to point at these particular species of dotage, that so men\nmight acknowledge their imperfections, and seek to reform what is amiss;\nyet I have a more serious intent at this time; and to omit all impertinent\ndigressions, to say no more of such as are improperly melancholy, or\nmetaphorically mad, lightly mad, or in disposition, as stupid, angry,\ndrunken, silly, sottish, sullen, proud, vainglorious, ridiculous, beastly,\npeevish, obstinate, impudent, extravagant, dry, doting, dull, desperate,\nharebrain, &c. mad, frantic, foolish, heteroclites, which no new [795]\nhospital can hold, no physic help; my purpose and endeavour is, in the\nfollowing discourse to anatomise this humour of melancholy, through all its\nparts and species, as it is an habit, or an ordinary disease, and that\nphilosophically, medicinally, to show the causes, symptoms, and several\ncures of it, that it may be the better avoided. Moved thereunto for the\ngenerality of it, and to do good, it being a disease so frequent, as [796]\nMercurialis observes, \"in these our days; so often happening,\" saith [797]\nLaurentius, \"in our miserable times,\" as few there are that feel not the\nsmart of it. Of the same mind is Aelian Montaltus, [798]Melancthon, and\nothers; [799]Julius Caesar Claudinus calls it the \"fountain of all other\ndiseases, and so common in this crazed age of ours, that scarce one of a\nthousand is free from it;\" and that splenetic hypochondriacal wind\nespecially, which proceeds from the spleen and short ribs. Being then a\ndisease so grievous, so common, I know not wherein to do a more general\nservice, and spend my time better, than to prescribe means how to prevent\nand cure so universal a malady, an epidemical disease, that so often, so\nmuch crucifies the body and mind.\n\nIf I have overshot myself in this which hath been hitherto said, or that it\nis, which I am sure some will object, too fantastical, \"too light and\ncomical for a Divine, too satirical for one of my profession,\" I will\npresume to answer with [800]Erasmus, in like case, 'tis not I, but\nDemocritus, Democritus _dixit_: you must consider what it is to speak in\none's own or another's person, an assumed habit and name; a difference\nbetwixt him that affects or acts a prince's, a philosopher's, a\nmagistrate's, a fool's part, and him that is so indeed; and what liberty\nthose old satirists have had; it is a cento collected from others; not I,\nbut they that say it.\n\n[801]  \"Dixero si quid forte jocosius, hoc mihi juris\n        Cum venia, dabis\"------\n\n       \"Yet some indulgence I may justly claim,\n        If too familiar with another's fame.\"\n\nTake heed you mistake me not. If I do a little forget myself, I hope you\nwill pardon it. And to say truth, why should any man be offended, or take\nexceptions at it?\n\n       \"Licuit, semperque licebit,\n        Parcere personis, dicere de vitiis.\"\n\n       \"It lawful was of old, and still will be,\n        To speak of vice, but let the name go free.\"\n\nI hate their vices, not their persons. If any be displeased, or take aught\nunto himself, let him not expostulate or cavil with him that said it (so\ndid [802]Erasmus excuse himself to Dorpius, _si parva licet componere\nmagnis_) and so do I; \"but let him be angry with himself, that so betrayed\nand opened his own faults in applying it to himself:\" [803]\"if he be guilty\nand deserve it, let him amend, whoever he is, and not be angry.\" \"He that\nhateth correction is a fool,\" Prov. xii. 1. If he be not guilty, it\nconcerns him not; it is not my freeness of speech, but a guilty conscience,\na galled back of his own that makes him wince.\n\n       \"Suspicione si quis errabit sua,\n        Et rapiet ad se, quod erit commune omnium,\n        Stulte nudabit animi conscientiam.\"[804]\n\nI deny not this which I have said savours a little of Democritus; [805]\n_Quamvis ridentem dicere verum quid velat_; one may speak in jest, and yet\nspeak truth. It is somewhat tart, I grant it; _acriora orexim excitant\nembammata_, as he said, sharp sauces increase appetite, [806]_nec cibus\nipse juvat morsu fraudatus aceti_. Object then and cavil what thou wilt, I\nward all with [807]Democritus's buckler, his medicine shall salve it;\nstrike where thou wilt, and when: _Democritus dixit_, Democritus will\nanswer it. It was written by an idle fellow, at idle times, about our\nSaturnalian or Dionysian feasts, when as he said, _nullum libertati\npericulum est_, servants in old Rome had liberty to say and do what them\nlist. When our countrymen sacrificed to their goddess [808]Vacuna, and sat\ntippling by their Vacunal fires. I writ this, and published this [Greek:\nhoutis helegen], it is _neminis nihil_. The time, place, persons, and all\ncircumstances apologise for me, and why may not I then be idle with others?\nspeak my mind freely? If you deny me this liberty, upon these presumptions\nI will take it: I say again, I will take it.\n\n[809]  \"Si quis est qui dictum in se inclementius\n        Existimavit esse, sic existimet.\"\n\nIf any man take exceptions, let him turn the buckle of his girdle, I care\nnot. I owe thee nothing (Reader), I look for no favour at thy hands, I am\nindependent, I fear not.\n\nNo, I recant, I will not, I care, I fear, I confess my fault, acknowledge a\ngreat offence,\n\n        ------\"motos praestat componere fluctus.\"\n\n        ------\"let's first assuage the troubled waves\"\n\nI have overshot myself, I have spoken foolishly, rashly, unadvisedly,\nabsurdly, I have anatomised mine own folly. And now methinks upon a sudden\nI am awaked as it were out of a dream; I have had a raving fit, a\nfantastical fit, ranged up and down, in and out, I have insulted over the\nmost kind of men, abused some, offended others, wronged myself; and now\nbeing recovered, and perceiving mine error, cry with [810]Orlando, _Solvite\nme_, pardon (_o boni_) that which is past, and I will make you amends in\nthat which is to come; I promise you a more sober discourse in my following\ntreatise.\n\nIf through weakness, folly, passion, [811]discontent, ignorance, I have\nsaid amiss, let it be forgotten and forgiven. I acknowledge that of [812]\nTacitus to be true, _Asperae facetiae, ubi nimis ex vero traxere, acrem sui\nmemoriam relinquunt_, a bitter jest leaves a sting behind it: and as an\nhonourable man observes, [813]\"They fear a satirist's wit, he their\nmemories.\" I may justly suspect the worst; and though I hope I have wronged\nno man, yet in Medea's words I will crave pardon,\n\n        ------\"Illud jam voce extrema peto,\n        Ne si qua noster dubius effudit dolor,\n        Maneant in animo verba, sed melior tibi\n        Memoria nostri subeat, haec irae data\n        Obliterentur\"------\n\n       \"And in my last words this I do desire,\n        That what in passion I have said, or ire,\n        May be forgotten, and a better mind,\n        Be had of us, hereafter as you find.\"\n\nI earnestly request every private man, as Scaliger did Cardan, not to take\noffence. I will conclude in his lines, _Si me cognitum haberes, non solum\ndonares nobis has facetias nostras, sed etiam indignum duceres, tam humanum\naninum, lene ingenium, vel minimam suspicionem deprecari oportere_. If thou\nknewest my [814]modesty and simplicity, thou wouldst easily pardon and\nforgive what is here amiss, or by thee misconceived. If hereafter\nanatomizing this surly humour, my hand slip, as an unskilful 'prentice I\nlance too deep, and cut through skin and all at unawares, make it smart, or\ncut awry, [815]pardon a rude hand, an unskilful knife, 'tis a most\ndifficult thing to keep an even tone, a perpetual tenor, and not sometimes\nto lash out; _difficile est Satyram non scribere_, there be so many objects\nto divert, inward perturbations to molest, and the very best may sometimes\nerr; _aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus_ (some times that excellent Homer\ntakes a nap), it is impossible not in so much to overshoot;--_opere in\nlongo fas est obrepere, summum_. But what needs all this? I hope there will\nno such cause of offence be given; if there be, [816]_Nemo aliquid\nrecognoscat, nos mentimur omnia_. I'll deny all (my last refuge), recant\nall, renounce all I have said, if any man except, and with as much facility\nexcuse, as he can accuse; but I presume of thy good favour, and gracious\nacceptance (gentle reader). Out of an assured hope and confidence thereof,\nI will begin.\n\n\n\nLECTORI MALE FERIATO.\n\nTu vero cavesis edico quisquis es, ne temere sugilles Auctorem hujusce\noperis, aut cavillator irrideas. Imo ne vel ex aliorum censura tacite\nobloquaris (vis dicam verbo) nequid nasutulus inepte improbes, aut falso\nfingas.

Nay, do not silently reproach\nhim in consequence of others' censure, nor employ your wit in foolish\ndisapproval, or false accusation.

How much altered\nfrom that he was; before blessed and happy, now miserable and accursed;\n[830]\"He must eat his meat in sorrow,\" subject to death and all manner of\ninfirmities, all kind of calamities.\n\n_A Description of Melancholy_.] [831]\"Great travail is created for all men,\nand an heavy yoke on the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of\ntheir mother's womb, unto that day they return to the mother of all things.\nNamely, their thoughts, and fear of their hearts, and their imagination of\nthings they wait for, and the day of death. From him that sitteth in the\nglorious throne, to him that sitteth beneath in the earth and ashes; from\nhim that is clothed in blue silk and weareth a crown, to him that is\nclothed in simple linen. Wrath, envy, trouble, and unquietness, and fear of\ndeath, and rigour, and strife, and such things come to both man and beast,\nbut sevenfold to the ungodly.\" All this befalls him in this life, and\nperadventure eternal misery in the life to come.\n\n_Impulsive Cause of Man's Misery and Infirmities_.] The impulsive cause of\nthese miseries in man, this privation or destruction of God's image, the\ncause of death and diseases, of all temporal and eternal punishments, was\nthe sin of our first parent Adam, [832]in eating of the forbidden fruit, by\nthe devil's instigation and allurement. His disobedience, pride, ambition,\nintemperance, incredulity, curiosity; from whence proceeded original sin,\nand that general corruption of mankind, as from a fountain, flowed all bad\ninclinations and actual transgressions which cause our several calamities\ninflicted upon us for our sins. And this belike is that which our fabulous\npoets have shadowed unto us in the tale of [833] Pandora's box, which being\nopened through her curiosity, filled the world full of all manner of\ndiseases. It is not curiosity alone, but those other crying sins of ours,\nwhich pull these several plagues and miseries upon our heads. For _Ubi\npeccatum, ibi procella_, as [834]Chrysostom well observes. [835]\"Fools by\nreason of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are\nafflicted.\" [836]\"Fear cometh like sudden desolation, and destruction like\na whirlwind, affliction and anguish,\" because they did not fear God.\n[837]\"Are you shaken with wars?\" as Cyprian well urgeth to Demetrius, \"are\nyou molested with dearth and famine? is your health crushed with raging\ndiseases? is mankind generally tormented with epidemical maladies? 'tis all\nfor your sins,\" Hag. i. 9, 10; Amos i.; Jer. vii. God is angry, punisheth\nand threateneth, because of their obstinacy and stubbornness, they will not\nturn unto him. [838]\"If the earth be barren then for want of rain, if dry\nand squalid, it yield no fruit, if your fountains be dried up, your wine,\ncorn, and oil blasted, if the air be corrupted, and men troubled with\ndiseases, 'tis by reason of their sins:\" which like the blood of Abel cry\nloud to heaven for vengeance, Lam. v. 15. \"That we have sinned, therefore\nour hearts are heavy,\" Isa. lix. 11, 12. \"We roar like bears, and mourn\nlike doves, and want health, &c. for our sins and trespasses.\" But this we\ncannot endure to hear or to take notice of, Jer. ii. 30. \"We are smitten in\nvain and receive no correction;\" and cap. v. 3. \"Thou hast stricken them,\nbut they have not sorrowed; they have refused to receive correction; they\nhave not returned. Pestilence he hath sent, but they have not turned to\nhim,\" Amos iv. [839]Herod could not abide John Baptist, nor [840]Domitian\nendure Apollonius to tell the causes of the plague at Ephesus, his\ninjustice, incest, adultery, and the like.\n\nTo punish therefore this blindness and obstinacy of ours as a concomitant\ncause and principal agent, is God's just judgment in bringing these\ncalamities upon us, to chastise us, I say, for our sins, and to satisfy\nGod's wrath. For the law requires obedience or punishment, as you may read\nat large, Deut. xxviii. 15. \"If they will not obey the Lord, and keep his\ncommandments and ordinances, then all these curses shall come upon them.\"\n[841]\"Cursed in the town and in the field,\" &c. [842]\"Cursed in the fruit\nof the body,\" &c. [843]\"The Lord shall send thee trouble and shame, because\nof thy wickedness.\" And a little after, [844]\"The Lord shall smite thee\nwith the botch of Egypt, and with emerods, and scab, and itch, and thou\ncanst not be healed; [845]with madness, blindness, and astonishing of\nheart.\" This Paul seconds, Rom. ii. 9. \"Tribulation and anguish on the soul\nof every man that doeth evil.\" Or else these chastisements are inflicted\nupon us for our humiliation, to exercise and try our patience here in this\nlife to bring us home, to make us to know God ourselves, to inform and\nteach us wisdom. [846]\"Therefore is my people gone into captivity, because\nthey had no knowledge; therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against\nhis people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them.\" He is desirous\nof our salvation. [847]_Nostrae salutis avidus_, saith Lemnius, and for\nthat cause pulls us by the ear many times, to put us in mind of our duties:\n\"That they which erred might have understanding, (as Isaiah speaks xxix.\n24) and so to be reformed.\" [848]\"I am afflicted, and at the point of\ndeath,\" so David confesseth of himself, Psal. lxxxviii. v. 15, v. 9. \"Mine\neyes are sorrowful through mine affliction:\" and that made him turn unto\nGod. Great Alexander in the midst of all his prosperity, by a company of\nparasites deified, and now made a god, when he saw one of his wounds bleed,\nremembered that he was but a man, and remitted of his pride. _In morbo\nrecolligit se animus_,[849] as [850]Pliny well perceived; \"In sickness the\nmind reflects upon itself, with judgment surveys itself, and abhors its\nformer courses;\" insomuch that he concludes to his friend Marius,[851]\n\"that it were the period of all philosophy, if we could so continue sound,\nor perform but a part of that which we promised to do, being sick. Whoso is\nwise then, will consider these things,\" as David did (Psal. cxliv., verse\nlast); and whatsoever fortune befall him, make use of it. If he be in\nsorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity, seriously to recount with\nhimself, why this or that malady, misery, this or that incurable disease is\ninflicted upon him; it may be for his good, [852]_sic expedit_ as Peter\nsaid of his daughter's ague. Bodily sickness is for his soul's health,\n_periisset nisi periisset_, had he not been visited, he had utterly\nperished; for [853]\"the Lord correcteth him whom he loveth, even as a\nfather doth his child in whom he delighteth.\" If he be safe and sound on\nthe other side, and free from all manner of infirmity; [854]_et cui_\n\n       \"Gratia, forma, valetudo contingat abunde\n        Et mundus victus, non deficiente crumena.\"\n\n       \"And that he have grace, beauty, favour, health,\n        A cleanly diet, and abound in wealth.\"\n\nYet in the midst of his prosperity, let him remember that caveat of Moses,\n[855]\"Beware that he do not forget the Lord his God;\" that he be not puffed\nup, but acknowledge them to be his good gifts and benefits, and [856]\"the\nmore he hath, to be more thankful,\" (as Agapetianus adviseth) and use them\naright.\n\n_Instrumental Causes of our Infirmities_.] Now the instrumental causes of\nthese our infirmities, are as diverse as the infirmities themselves; stars,\nheavens, elements, &c. And all those creatures which God hath made, are\narmed against sinners. They were indeed once good in themselves, and that\nthey are now many of them pernicious unto us, is not in their nature, but\nour corruption, which hath caused it. For from the fall of our first parent\nAdam, they have been changed, the earth accursed, the influence of stars,\naltered, the four elements, beasts, birds, plants, are now ready to offend\nus. \"The principal things for the use of man, are water, fire, iron, salt,\nmeal, wheat, honey, milk, oil, wine, clothing, good to the godly, to the\nsinners turned to evil,\" Ecclus. xxxix. 26. \"Fire, and hail, and famine,\nand dearth, all these are created for vengeance,\" Ecclus. xxxix. 29. The\nheavens threaten us with their comets, stars, planets, with their great\nconjunctions, eclipses, oppositions, quartiles, and such unfriendly\naspects. The air with his meteors, thunder and lightning, intemperate heat\nand cold, mighty winds, tempests, unseasonable weather; from which proceed\ndearth, famine, plague, and all sorts of epidemical diseases, consuming\ninfinite myriads of men. At Cairo in Egypt, every third year, (as it is\nrelated by [857]Boterus, and others) 300,000 die of the plague; and\n200,000, in Constantinople, every fifth or seventh at the utmost. How doth\nthe earth terrify and oppress us with terrible earthquakes, which are most\nfrequent in [858]China, Japan, and those eastern climes, swallowing up\nsometimes six cities at once? How doth the water rage with his inundations,\nirruptions, flinging down towns, cities, villages, bridges, &c. besides\nshipwrecks; whole islands are sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with all their\ninhabitants in [859]Zealand, Holland, and many parts of the continent\ndrowned, as the [860]lake Erne in Ireland? [861]_Nihilque praeter arcium\ncadavera patenti cernimus freto._ In the fens of Friesland 1230, by reason\nof tempests, [862]the sea drowned _multa hominum millia, et jumenta sine\nnumero_, all the country almost, men and cattle in it. How doth the fire\nrage, that merciless element, consuming in an instant whole cities? What\ntown of any antiquity or note hath not been once, again and again, by the\nfury of this merciless element, defaced, ruinated, and left desolate? In a\nword,\n\n[863]  \"Ignis pepercit, unda mergit, aeris\n        Vis pestilentis aequori ereptum necat,\n        Bello superstes, tabidus morbo perit.\"\n\n       \"Whom fire spares, sea doth drown; whom sea,\n        Pestilent air doth send to clay;\n        Whom war 'scapes, sickness takes away.\"\n\nTo descend to more particulars, how many creatures are at deadly feud with\nmen? Lions, wolves, bears, &c. Some with hoofs, horns, tusks, teeth, nails:\nHow many noxious serpents and venomous creatures, ready to offend us with\nstings, breath, sight, or quite kill us? How many pernicious fishes,\nplants, gums, fruits, seeds, flowers, &c. could I reckon up on a sudden,\nwhich by their very smell many of them, touch, taste, cause some grievous\nmalady, if not death itself? Some make mention of a thousand several\npoisons: but these are but trifles in respect. The greatest enemy to man,\nis man, who by the devil's instigation is still ready to do mischief, his\nown executioner, a wolf, a devil to himself, and others. [864]We are all\nbrethren in Christ, or at least should be, members of one body, servants of\none lord, and yet no fiend can so torment, insult over, tyrannise, vex, as\none man doth another. Let me not fall therefore (saith David, when wars,\nplague, famine were offered) into the hands of men, merciless and wicked\nmen:\n\n[865]   ------\"Vix sunt homines hoc nomine digni,\n        Quamque lupi, saevae plus feritatis habent.\"\n\nWe can most part foresee these epidemical diseases, and likely avoid them;\nDearths, tempests, plagues, our astrologers foretell us; Earthquakes,\ninundations, ruins of houses, consuming fires, come by little and little,\nor make some noise beforehand; but the knaveries, impostures, injuries and\nvillainies of men no art can avoid. We can keep our professed enemies from\nour cities, by gates, walls and towers, defend ourselves from thieves and\nrobbers by watchfulness and weapons; but this malice of men, and their\npernicious endeavours, no caution can divert, no vigilancy foresee, we have\nso many secret plots and devices to mischief one another.\n\nSometimes by the devil's help as magicians, [866]witches: sometimes by\nimpostures, mixtures, poisons, stratagems, single combats, wars, we hack\nand hew, as if we were _ad internecionem nati_, like Cadmus' soldiers born\nto consume one another. 'Tis an ordinary thing to read of a hundred and two\nhundred thousand men slain in a battle. Besides all manner of tortures,\nbrazen bulls, racks, wheels, strappadoes, guns, engines, &c. [867]_Ad unum\ncorpus humanum supplicia plura, quam membra_: We have invented more\ntorturing instruments, than there be several members in a man's body, as\nCyprian well observes. To come nearer yet, our own parents by their\noffences, indiscretion and intemperance, are our mortal enemies. [868]\"The\nfathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.\"\nThey cause our grief many times, and put upon us hereditary diseases,\ninevitable infirmities: they torment us, and we are ready to injure our\nposterity;\n\n[869]   ------\"mox daturi progeniem vitiosiorem.\"\n\n       \"And yet with crimes to us unknown,\n        Our sons shall mark the coming age their own;\"\n\nand the latter end of the world, as [870]Paul foretold, is still like to be\nthe worst. We are thus bad by nature, bad by kind, but far worse by art,\nevery man the greatest enemy unto himself. We study many times to undo\nourselves, abusing those good gifts which God hath bestowed upon us,\nhealth, wealth, strength, wit, learning, art, memory to our own\ndestruction, [871]_Perditio tua ex te_. As [872]Judas Maccabeus killed\nApollonius with his own weapons, we arm ourselves to our own overthrows;\nand use reason, art, judgment, all that should help us, as so many\ninstruments to undo us. Hector gave Ajax a sword, which so long as he\nfought against enemies, served for his help and defence; but after he began\nto hurt harmless creatures with it, turned to his own hurtless bowels.\nThose excellent means God hath bestowed on us, well employed, cannot but\nmuch avail us; but if otherwise perverted, they ruin and confound us: and\nso by reason of our indiscretion and weakness they commonly do, we have too\nmany instances. This St. Austin acknowledgeth of himself in his humble\nconfessions, \"promptness of wit, memory, eloquence, they were God's good\ngifts, but he did not use them to his glory.\" If you will particularly know\nhow, and by what means, consult physicians, and they will tell you, that it\nis in offending in some of those six non-natural things, of which I shall\n[873]dilate more at large; they are the causes of our infirmities, our\nsurfeiting, and drunkenness, our immoderate insatiable lust, and prodigious\nriot. _Plures crapula, quam gladius_, is a true saying, the board consumes\nmore than the sword. Our intemperance it is, that pulls so many several\nincurable diseases upon our heads, that hastens [874]old age, perverts our\ntemperature, and brings upon us sudden death. And last of all, that which\ncrucifies us most, is our own folly, madness (_quos Jupiter perdit,\ndementat_; by subtraction of his assisting grace God permits it) weakness,\nwant of government, our facility and proneness in yielding to several\nlusts, in giving way to every passion and perturbation of the mind: by\nwhich means we metamorphose ourselves and degenerate into beasts. All which\nthat prince of [875]poets observed of Agamemnon, that when he was well\npleased, and could moderate his passion, he was--_os oculosque Jovi par_:\nlike Jupiter in feature, Mars in valour, Pallas in wisdom, another god; but\nwhen he became angry, he was a lion, a tiger, a dog, &c., there appeared no\nsign or likeness of Jupiter in him; so we, as long as we are ruled by\nreason, correct our inordinate appetite, and conform ourselves to God's\nword, are as so many saints: but if we give reins to lust, anger, ambition,\npride, and follow our own ways, we degenerate into beasts, transform\nourselves, overthrow our constitutions, [876]provoke God to anger, and heap\nupon us this of melancholy, and all kinds of incurable diseases, as a just\nand deserved punishment of our sins.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_The Definition, Number, Division of Diseases_.\n\nWhat a disease is, almost every physician defines. [877]Fernelius calleth\nit an \"affection of the body contrary to nature.\" [878]Fuschius and Crato,\n\"an hindrance, hurt, or alteration of any action of the body, or part of\nit.\" [879]Tholosanus, \"a dissolution of that league which is between body\nand soul, and a perturbation of it; as health the perfection, and makes to\nthe preservation of it.\" [880]Labeo in Agellius, \"an ill habit of the body,\nopposite to nature, hindering the use of it.\" Others otherwise, all to this\neffect.\n\n_Number of Diseases_.] How many diseases there are, is a question not yet\ndetermined; [881]Pliny reckons up 300 from the crown of the head to the\nsole of the foot: elsewhere he saith, _morborum infinita multitudo_, their\nnumber is infinite. Howsoever it was in those times, it boots not; in our\ndays I am sure the number is much augmented:\n\n[882]   ------\"macies, et nova febrium\n        Terris incubit cohors.\"\n\nFor besides many epidemical diseases unheard of, and altogether unknown to\nGalen and Hippocrates, as scorbutum, small-pox, plica, sweating sickness,\nmorbus Gallicus, &c., we have many proper and peculiar almost to every\npart.\n\n_No man free from some Disease or other_.] No man amongst us so sound, of\nso good a constitution, that hath not some impediment of body or mind.\n_Quisque suos patimur manes_, we have all our infirmities, first or last,\nmore or less. There will be peradventure in an age, or one of a thousand,\nlike Zenophilus the musician in [883]Pliny, that may happily live 105 years\nwithout any manner of impediment; a Pollio Romulus, that can preserve\nhimself [884]\"with wine and oil;\" a man as fortunate as Q. Metellus, of\nwhom Valerius so much brags; a man as healthy as Otto Herwardus, a senator\nof Augsburg in Germany, whom [885]Leovitius the astrologer brings in for an\nexample and instance of certainty in his art; who because he had the\nsignificators in his geniture fortunate, and free from the hostile aspects\nof Saturn and Mars, being a very cold man, [886]\"could not remember that\never he was sick.\" [887]Paracelsus may brag that he could make a man live\n400 years or more, if he might bring him up from his infancy, and diet him\nas he list; and some physicians hold, that there is no certain period of\nman's life; but it may still by temperance and physic be prolonged. We find\nin the meantime, by common experience, that no man can escape, but that of\n[888]Hesiod is true:\n\n       \"[Greek: pleiae men gar gaia kakon, pleiae de thalassa,\n        nousoid' anthropoi ein eph' haemerae, aed' epi nukti\n        Hautomatoi phoitosi.]\"------\n\n       \"Th' earth's full of maladies, and full the sea,\n        Which set upon us both by night and day.\"\n\n_Division of Diseases_.] If you require a more exact division of these\nordinary diseases which are incident to men, I refer you to physicians;\n[889]they will tell you of acute and chronic, first and secondary, lethals,\nsalutares, errant, fixed, simple, compound, connexed, or consequent,\nbelonging to parts or the whole, in habit, or in disposition, &c. My\ndivision at this time (as most befitting my purpose) shall be into those of\nthe body and mind. For them of the body, a brief catalogue of which\nFuschius hath made, _Institut. lib. 3, sect. 1, cap. 11._ I refer you to\nthe voluminous tomes of Galen, Areteus, Rhasis, Avicenna, Alexander, Paulus\nAetius, Gordonerius: and those exact Neoterics, Savanarola, Capivaccius,\nDonatus Altomarus, Hercules de Saxonia, Mercurialis, Victorius Faventinus,\nWecker, Piso, &c., that have methodically and elaborately written of them\nall. Those of the mind and head I will briefly handle, and apart.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Division of the Diseases of the Head_.\n\nThese diseases of the mind, forasmuch as they have their chief seat and\norgans in the head, which are commonly repeated amongst the diseases of the\nhead which are divers, and vary much according to their site. For in the\nhead, as there be several parts, so there be divers grievances, which\naccording to that division of [890]Heurnius, (which he takes out of\nArculanus,) are inward or outward (to omit all others which pertain to eyes\nand ears, nostrils, gums, teeth, mouth, palate, tongue, weezle, chops,\nface, &c.) belonging properly to the brain, as baldness, falling of hair,\nfurfur, lice, &c. [891]Inward belonging to the skins next to the brain,\ncalled _dura_ and _pia mater_, as all headaches, &c., or to the ventricles,\ncaules, kells, tunicles, creeks, and parts of it, and their passions, as\ncaro, vertigo, incubus, apoplexy, falling sickness. The diseases of the\nnerves, cramps, stupor, convulsion, tremor, palsy: or belonging to the\nexcrements of the brain, catarrhs, sneezing, rheums, distillations: or else\nthose that pertain to the substance of the brain itself, in which are\nconceived frenzy, lethargy, melancholy, madness, weak memory, sopor, or\n_Coma Vigilia et vigil Coma_. Out of these again I will single such as\nproperly belong to the phantasy, or imagination, or reason itself, which\n[892]Laurentius calls the disease of the mind; and Hildesheim, _morbos\nimaginationis, aut rationis laesae_, (diseases of the imagination, or of\ninjured reason,) which are three or four in number, frenzy, madness,\nmelancholy, dotage, and their kinds: as hydrophobia, lycanthropia, _Chorus\nsancti viti, morbi daemoniaci_, (St. Vitus's dance, possession of devils,)\nwhich I will briefly touch and point at, insisting especially in this of\nmelancholy, as more eminent than the rest, and that through all his kinds,\ncauses, symptoms, prognostics, cures: as Lonicerus hath done _de\napoplexia_, and many other of such particular diseases. Not that I find\nfault with those which have written of this subject before, as Jason\nPratensis, Laurentius, Montaltus, T. Bright, &c., they have done very well\nin their several kinds and methods; yet that which one omits, another may\nhaply see; that which one contracts, another may enlarge. To conclude with\n[893]Scribanius, \"that which they had neglected, or perfunctorily handled,\nwe may more thoroughly examine; that which is obscurely delivered in them,\nmay be perspicuously dilated and amplified by us:\" and so made more\nfamiliar and easy for every man's capacity, and the common good, which is\nthe chief end of my discourse.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Dotage, Frenzy, Madness, Hydrophobia, Lycanthropia, Chorus\nsancti Viti, Extasis_.\n\n_Delirium, Dotage_.] Dotage, fatuity, or folly, is a common name to all the\nfollowing species, as some will have it. [894]Laurentius and [895]\nAltomarus comprehended madness, melancholy, and the rest under this name,\nand call it the _summum genus_ of them all. If it be distinguished from\nthem, it is natural or ingenite, which comes by some defect of the organs,\nand overmuch brain, as we see in our common fools; and is for the most part\nintended or remitted in particular men, and thereupon some are wiser than\nothers: or else it is acquisite, an appendix or symptom of some other\ndisease, which comes or goes; or if it continue, a sign of melancholy\nitself.\n\n_Frenzy_.] _Phrenitis_, which the Greeks derive from the word [Greek:\nphraen], is a disease of the mind, with a continual madness or dotage,\nwhich hath an acute fever annexed, or else an inflammation of the brain, or\nthe membranes or kells of it, with an acute fever, which causeth madness\nand dotage. It differs from melancholy and madness, because their dotage is\nwithout an ague: this continual, with waking, or memory decayed, &c.\nMelancholy is most part silent, this clamorous; and many such like\ndifferences are assigned by physicians.\n\n_Madness_.] Madness, frenzy, and melancholy are confounded by Celsus, and\nmany writers; others leave out frenzy, and make madness and melancholy but\none disease, which [896]Jason Pratensis especially labours, and that they\ndiffer only _secundam majus_ or _minus_, in quantity alone, the one being a\ndegree to the other, and both proceeding from one cause. They differ\n_intenso et remisso gradu_, saith [897]Gordonius, as the humour is intended\nor remitted. Of the same mind is [898]Areteus, Alexander Tertullianus,\nGuianerius, Savanarola, Heurnius; and Galen himself writes promiscuously of\nthem both by reason of their affinity: but most of our neoterics do handle\nthem apart, whom I will follow in this treatise. Madness is therefore\ndefined to be a vehement dotage; or raving without a fever, far more\nviolent than melancholy, full of anger and clamour, horrible looks,\nactions, gestures, troubling the patients with far greater vehemency both\nof body and mind, without all fear and sorrow, with such impetuous force\nand boldness, that sometimes three or four men cannot hold them. Differing\nonly in this from frenzy, that it is without a fever, and their memory is\nmost part better. It hath the same causes as the other, as choler adust,\nand blood incensed, brains inflamed, &c. [899]Fracastorius adds, \"a due\ntime, and full age\" to this definition, to distinguish it from children,\nand will have it confirmed impotency, to separate it from such as\naccidentally come and go again, as by taking henbane, nightshade, wine, &c.\nOf this fury there be divers kinds; [900]ecstasy, which is familiar with\nsome persons, as Cardan saith of himself, he could be in one when he list;\nin which the Indian priests deliver their oracles, and the witches in\nLapland, as Olaus Magnus writeth, _l. 3, cap. 18._ _Extasi omnia\npraedicere_, answer all questions in an ecstasis you will ask; what your\nfriends do, where they are, how they fare, &c. The other species of this\nfury are enthusiasms, revelations, and visions, so often mentioned by\nGregory and Bede in their works; obsession or possession of devils,\nsibylline prophets, and poetical furies; such as come by eating noxious\nherbs, tarantulas stinging, &c., which some reduce to this. The most known\nare these, lycanthropia, hydrophobia, chorus sancti Viti.\n\n_Lycanthropia_.] Lycanthropia, which Avicenna calls _cucubuth_, others\n_lupinam insaniam_, or wolf-madness, when men run howling about graves and\nfields in the night, and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves, or\nsome such beasts. [901]Aetius and [902]Paulus call it a kind of melancholy;\nbut I should rather refer it to madness, as most do. Some make a doubt of\nit whether there be any such disease. [903]Donat ab Altomari saith, that he\nsaw two of them in his time: [904]Wierus tells a story of such a one at\nPadua 1541, that would not believe to the contrary, but that he was a wolf.\nHe hath another instance of a Spaniard, who thought himself a bear;\n[905]Forrestus confirms as much by many examples; one amongst the rest of\nwhich he was an eyewitness, at Alcmaer in Holland, a poor husbandman that\nstill hunted about graves, and kept in churchyards, of a pale, black, ugly,\nand fearful look. Such belike, or little better, were king Praetus'\n[906]daughters, that thought themselves kine. And Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel,\nas some interpreters hold, was only troubled with this kind of madness.\nThis disease perhaps gave occasion to that bold assertion of [907]Pliny,\n\"some men were turned into wolves in his time, and from wolves to men\nagain:\" and to that fable of Pausanias, of a man that was ten years a wolf,\nand afterwards turned to his former shape: to [908]Ovid's tale of Lycaon,\n&c. He that is desirous to hear of this disease, or more examples, let him\nread Austin in his 18th book _de Civitate Dei, cap. 5._ Mizaldus, _cent. 5.\n77._ Sckenkius, _lib. 1._ Hildesheim, _spicel. 2. de Mania_. Forrestus\n_lib. 10. de morbis cerebri._ Olaus Magnus, Vincentius Bellavicensis,\n_spec. met. lib. 31. c. 122._ Pierius, Bodine, Zuinger, Zeilger, Peucer,\nWierus, Spranger, &c. This malady, saith Avicenna, troubleth men most in\nFebruary, and is nowadays frequent in Bohemia and Hungary, according to\n[909]Heurnius. Scheretzius will have it common in Livonia. They lie hid\nmost part all day, and go abroad in the night, barking, howling, at graves\nand deserts; [910]\"they have usually hollow eyes, scabbed legs and thighs,\nvery dry and pale,\" [911]saith Altomarus; he gives a reason there of all\nthe symptoms, and sets down a brief cure of them.\n\n_Hydrophobia_ is a kind of madness, well known in every village, which\ncomes by the biting of a mad dog, or scratching, saith [912]Aurelianus;\ntouching, or smelling alone sometimes as [913]Sckenkius proves, and is\nincident to many other creatures as well as men: so called because the\nparties affected cannot endure the sight of water, or any liquor, supposing\nstill they see a mad dog in it. And which is more wonderful; though they be\nvery dry, (as in this malady they are) they will rather die than drink:\n[914]de Venenis Caelius Aurelianus, an ancient writer, makes a doubt\nwhether this Hydrophobia be a passion of the body or the mind. The part\naffected is the brain: the cause, poison that comes from the mad dog, which\nis so hot and dry, that it consumes all the moisture in the body. [915]\nHildesheim relates of some that died so mad; and being cut up, had no\nwater, scarce blood, or any moisture left in them. To such as are so\naffected, the fear of water begins at fourteen days after they are bitten,\nto some again not till forty or sixty days after: commonly saith Heurnius,\nthey begin to rave, fly water and glasses, to look red, and swell in the\nface, about twenty days after (if some remedy be not taken in the meantime)\nto lie awake, to be pensive, sad, to see strange visions, to bark and howl,\nto fall into a swoon, and oftentimes fits of the falling sickness. [916]\nSome say, little things like whelps will be seen in their urine. If any of\nthese signs appear, they are past recovery. Many times these symptoms will\nnot appear till six or seven months after, saith [917]Codronchus; and\nsometimes not till seven or eight years, as Guianerius; twelve as Albertus;\nsix or eight months after, as Galen holds. Baldus the great lawyer died of\nit: an Augustine friar, and a woman in Delft, that were [918]Forrestus'\npatients, were miserably consumed with it. The common cure in the country\n(for such at least as dwell near the seaside) is to duck them over head and\nears in sea water; some use charms: every good wife can prescribe\nmedicines. But the best cure to be had in such cases, is from the most\napproved physicians; they that will read of them, may consult with\nDioscorides, _lib. 6. c. 37_, Heurnius, Hildesheim, Capivaccius, Forrestus,\nSckenkius and before all others Codronchus an Italian, who hath lately\nwritten two exquisite books on the subject.\n\n_Chorus sancti Viti_, or St. Vitus's dance; the lascivious dance, [919]\nParacelsus calls it, because they that are taken from it, can do nothing\nbut dance till they be dead, or cured. It is so called, for that the\nparties so troubled were wont to go to St. Vitus for help, and after they\nhad danced there awhile, they were [920]certainly freed. 'Tis strange to\nhear how long they will dance, and in what manner, over stools, forms,\ntables; even great bellied women sometimes (and yet never hurt their\nchildren) will dance so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot, but\nseem to be quite dead. One in red clothes they cannot abide. Music above\nall things they love, and therefore magistrates in Germany will hire\nmusicians to play to them, and some lusty sturdy companions to dance with\nthem. This disease hath been very common in Germany, as appears by those\nrelations of [921]Sckenkius, and Paracelsus in his book of Madness, who\nbrags how many several persons he hath cured of it. Felix Plateras _de\nmentis alienat. cap. 3_, reports of a woman in Basil whom he saw, that\ndanced a whole month together. The Arabians call it a kind of palsy. Bodine\nin his 5th book _de Repub. cap. 1_, speaks of this infirmity; Monavius in\nhis last epistle to Scoltizius, and in another to Dudithus, where you may\nread more of it.\n\nThe last kind of madness or melancholy, is that demoniacal (if I may so\ncall it) obsession or possession of devils, which Platerus and others would\nhave to be preternatural: stupend things are said of them, their actions,\ngestures, contortions, fasting, prophesying, speaking languages they were\nnever taught, &c. Many strange stories are related of them, which because\nsome will not allow, (for Deacon and Darrel have written large volumes on\nthis subject pro and con.) I voluntarily omit.\n\n[922]Fuschius, _Institut. lib. 3. sec. 1. cap. 11_, Felix Plater,\n[923]Laurentius, add to these another fury that proceeds from love, and\nanother from study, another divine or religious fury; but these more\nproperly belong to melancholy; of all which I will speak [924]apart,\nintending to write a whole book of them.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Melancholy in Disposition, improperly so called,\nEquivocations_.\n\nMelancholy, the subject of our present discourse, is either in disposition\nor habit. In disposition, is that transitory melancholy which goes and\ncomes upon every small occasion of sorrow, need, sickness, trouble, fear,\ngrief, passion, or perturbation of the mind, any manner of care,\ndiscontent, or thought, which causeth anguish, dullness, heaviness and\nvexation of spirit, any ways opposite to pleasure, mirth, joy, delight,\ncausing frowardness in us, or a dislike. In which equivocal and improper\nsense, we call him melancholy that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill\ndisposed, solitary, any way moved, or displeased. And from these melancholy\ndispositions, [925]no man living is free, no stoic, none so wise, none so\nhappy, none so patient, so generous, so godly, so divine, that can\nvindicate himself; so well composed, but more or less, some time or other\nhe feels the smart of it. Melancholy in this sense is the character of\nmortality. [926]\"Man that is born of a woman, is of short continuance, and\nfull of trouble.\" Zeno, Cato, Socrates himself, whom [927]Aelian so highly\ncommends for a moderate temper, that \"nothing could disturb him, but going\nout, and coming in, still Socrates kept the same serenity of countenance,\nwhat misery soever befell him,\" (if we may believe Plato his disciple) was\nmuch tormented with it. Q. Metellus, in whom [928]Valerius gives instance\nof all happiness, \"the most fortunate man then living, born in that most\nflourishing city of Rome, of noble parentage, a proper man of person, well\nqualified, healthful, rich, honourable, a senator, a consul, happy in his\nwife, happy in his children,\" &c. yet this man was not void of melancholy,\nhe had his share of sorrow. [929]Polycrates Samius, that flung his ring\ninto the sea, because he would participate of discontent with others, and\nhad it miraculously restored to him again shortly after, by a fish taken as\nhe angled, was not free from melancholy dispositions. No man can cure\nhimself; the very gods had bitter pangs, and frequent passions, as their\nown [930]poets put upon them. In general, [931]\"as the heaven, so is our\nlife, sometimes fair, sometimes overcast, tempestuous, and serene; as in a\nrose, flowers and prickles; in the year itself, a temperate summer\nsometimes, a hard winter, a drought, and then again pleasant showers: so is\nour life intermixed with joys, hopes, fears, sorrows, calumnies: _Invicem\ncedunt dolor et voluptas_,\" there is a succession of pleasure and pain.\n\n[932]   ------\"medio de fonte leporum\n        Surgit amari aliquid, in ipsis floribus angat.\"\n\n\"Even in the midst of laughing there is sorrow,\" (as [933]Solomon holds):\neven in the midst of all our feasting and jollity, as [934]Austin infers in\nhis _Com. on the 41st Psalm_, there is grief and discontent. _Inter\ndelicias semper aliquid saevi nos strangulat_, for a pint of honey thou\nshalt here likely find a gallon of gall, for a dram of pleasure a pound of\npain, for an inch of mirth an ell of moan; as ivy doth an oak, these\nmiseries encompass our life. And it is most absurd and ridiculous for any\nmortal man to look for a perpetual tenure of happiness in his life. Nothing\nso prosperous and pleasant, but it hath [935]some bitterness in it, some\ncomplaining, some grudging; it is all [Greek: glukupikron], a mixed\npassion, and like a chequer table black and white: men, families, cities,\nhave their falls and wanes; now trines, sextiles, then quartiles and\noppositions. We are not here as those angels, celestial powers and bodies,\nsun and moon, to finish our course without all offence, with such\nconstancy, to continue for so many ages: but subject to infirmities,\nmiseries, interrupted, tossed and tumbled up and down, carried about with\nevery small blast, often molested and disquieted upon each slender\noccasion, [936]uncertain, brittle, and so is all that we trust unto. [937]\n\"And he that knows not this is not armed to endure it, is not fit to live\nin this world (as one condoles our time), he knows not the condition of it,\nwhere with a reciprocalty, pleasure and pain are still united, and succeed\none another in a ring.\" _Exi e mundo_, get thee gone hence if thou canst\nnot brook it; there is no way to avoid it, but to arm thyself with\npatience, with magnanimity, to [938]oppose thyself unto it, to suffer\naffliction as a good soldier of Christ; as [939]Paul adviseth constantly to\nbear it. But forasmuch as so few can embrace this good council of his, or\nuse it aright, but rather as so many brute beasts give away to their\npassion, voluntary subject and precipitate themselves into a labyrinth of\ncares, woes, miseries, and suffer their souls to be overcome by them,\ncannot arm themselves with that patience as they ought to do, it falleth\nout oftentimes that these dispositions become habits, and \"many affects\ncontemned\" (as [940]Seneca notes) \"make a disease. Even as one\ndistillation, not yet grown to custom, makes a cough; but continual and\ninveterate causeth a consumption of the lungs;\" so do these our melancholy\nprovocations: and according as the humour itself is intended, or remitted\nin men, as their temperature of body, or rational soul is better able to\nmake resistance; so are they more or less affected. For that which is but a\nflea-biting to one, causeth insufferable torment to another; and which one\nby his singular moderation, and well-composed carriage can happily\novercome, a second is no whit able to sustain, but upon every small\noccasion of misconceived abuse, injury, grief, disgrace, loss, cross,\nhumour, &c. (if solitary, or idle) yields so far to passion, that his\ncomplexion is altered, his digestion hindered, his sleep gone, his spirits\nobscured, and his heart heavy, his hypochondries misaffected; wind,\ncrudity, on a sudden overtake him, and he himself overcome with melancholy.\nAs it is with a man imprisoned for debt, if once in the gaol, every\ncreditor will bring his action against him, and there likely hold him. If\nany discontent seize upon a patient, in an instant all other perturbations\n(for--_qua data porta ruunt_) will set upon him, and then like a lame dog\nor broken-winged goose he droops and pines away, and is brought at last to\nthat ill habit or malady of melancholy itself. So that as the philosophers\nmake [941]eight degrees of heat and cold, we may make eighty-eight of\nmelancholy, as the parts affected are diversely seized with it, or have\nbeen plunged more or less into this infernal gulf, or waded deeper into it.\nBut all these melancholy fits, howsoever pleasing at first, or displeasing,\nviolent and tyrannizing over those whom they seize on for the time; yet\nthese fits I say, or men affected, are but improperly so called, because\nthey continue not, but come and go, as by some objects they aye moved. This\nmelancholy of which we are to treat, is a habit, _mosbus sonticus_, or\n_chronicus_, a chronic or continuate disease, a settled humour, as [942]\nAurelianus and [943]others call it, not errant, but fixed; and as it was\nlong increasing, so now being (pleasant, or painful) grown to an habit, it\nwill hardly be removed.\n\n\nSECT. I. MEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Digression of Anatomy_.\n\nBefore I proceed to define the disease of melancholy, what it is, or to\ndiscourse farther of it, I hold it not impertinent to make a brief\ndigression of the anatomy of the body and faculties of the soul, for the\nbetter understanding of that which is to follow; because many hard words\nwill often occur, as mirach, hypocondries, emerods, &c., imagination,\nreason, humours, spirits, vital, natural, animal, nerves, veins, arteries,\nchylus, pituita; which by the vulgar will not so easily be perceived, what\nthey are, how cited, and to what end they serve. And besides, it may\nperadventure give occasion to some men to examine more accurately, search\nfurther into this most excellent subject, and thereupon with that royal\n[944]prophet to praise God, (\"for a man is fearfully and wonderfully made,\nand curiously wrought\") that have time and leisure enough, and are\nsufficiently informed in all other worldly businesses, as to make a good\nbargain, buy and sell, to keep and make choice of a fair hawk, hound,\nhorse, &c. But for such matters as concern the knowledge of themselves,\nthey are wholly ignorant and careless; they know not what this body and\nsoul are, how combined, of what parts and faculties they consist, or how a\nman differs from a dog. And what can be more ignominious and filthy (as\n[945]Melancthon well inveighs) \"than for a man not to know the structure\nand composition of his own body, especially since the knowledge of it tends\nso much to the preservation, of his health, and information of his\nmanners?\" To stir them up therefore to this study, to peruse those\nelaborate works of [946]Galen, Bauhines, Plater, Vesalius, Falopius,\nLaurentius, Remelinus, &c., which have written copiously in Latin; or that\nwhich some of our industrious countrymen have done in our mother tongue,\nnot long since, as that translation of [947]Columbus and [948]\nMicrocosmographia, in thirteen books, I have made this brief digression.\nAlso because [949]Wecker, [950]Melancthon, [951]Fernelius, [952] Fuschius,\nand those tedious Tracts _de Anima_ (which have more compendiously handled\nand written of this matter,) are not at all times ready to be had, to give\nthem some small taste, or notice of the rest, let this epitome suffice.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Division of the Body, Humours, Spirits_.\n\nOf the parts of the body there may be many divisions: the most approved is\nthat of [953]Laurentius, out of Hippocrates: which is, into parts\ncontained, or containing. Contained, are either humours or spirits.\n\n_Humours_.] A humour is a liquid or fluent part of the body, comprehended\nin it, for the preservation of it; and is either innate or born with us, or\nadventitious and acquisite. The radical or innate, is daily supplied by\nnourishment, which some call cambium, and make those secondary humours of\nros and gluten to maintain it: or acquisite, to maintain these four first\nprimary humours, coming and proceeding from the first concoction in the\nliver, by which means chylus is excluded. Some divide them into profitable\nand excrementitious. But [954]Crato out of Hippocrates will have all four\nto be juice, and not excrements, without which no living creature can be\nsustained: which four, though they be comprehended in the mass of blood,\nyet they have their several affections, by which they are distinguished\nfrom one another, and from those adventitious, peccant, or [955]diseased\nhumours, as Melancthon calls them.\n\n_Blood_.] Blood is a hot, sweet, temperate, red humour, prepared in the\nmesaraic veins, and made of the most temperate parts of the chylus in the\nliver, whose office is to nourish the whole body, to give it strength and\ncolour, being dispersed by the veins through every part of it. And from it\nspirits are first begotten in the heart, which afterwards by the arteries\nare communicated to the other parts.\n\nPituita, or phlegm, is a cold and moist humour, begotten of the colder part\nof the chylus (or white juice coming out of the meat digested in the\nstomach,) in the liver; his office is to nourish and moisten the members of\nthe body, which as the tongue are moved, that they be not over dry.\n\nCholer, is hot and dry, bitter, begotten of the hotter parts of the chylus,\nand gathered to the gall: it helps the natural heat and senses, and serves\nto the expelling of excrements.\n\n_Melancholy_.] Melancholy, cold and dry, thick, black, and sour, begotten\nof the more feculent part of nourishment, and purged from the spleen, is a\nbridle to the other two hot humours, blood and choler, preserving them in\nthe blood, and nourishing the bones. These four humours have some analogy\nwith the four elements, and to the four ages in man.\n\n_Serum, Sweat, Tears_.] To these humours you may add serum, which is the\nmatter of urine, and those excrementitious humours of the third concoction,\nsweat and tears.\n\n_Spirits_.] Spirit is a most subtle vapour, which is expressed from the\nblood, and the instrument of the soul, to perform all his actions; a common\ntie or medium between the body and the soul, as some will have it; or as\n[956]Paracelsus, a fourth soul of itself. Melancthon holds the fountain of\nthose spirits to be the heart, begotten there; and afterward conveyed to\nthe brain, they take another nature to them. Of these spirits there be\nthree kinds, according to the three principal parts, brain, heart, liver;\nnatural, vital, animal. The natural are begotten in the liver, and thence\ndispersed through the veins, to perform those natural actions. The vital\nspirits are made in the heart of the natural, which by the arteries are\ntransported to all the other parts: if the spirits cease, then life\nceaseth, as in a syncope or swooning. The animal spirits formed of the\nvital, brought up to the brain, and diffused by the nerves, to the\nsubordinate members, give sense and motion to them all.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Similar Parts_.\n\n_Similar Parts_] Containing parts, by reason of their more solid substance,\nare either homogeneal or heterogeneal, similar or dissimilar; so Aristotle\ndivides them, _lib. 1, cap. 1, de Hist. Animal._; Laurentius, _cap. 20,\nlib. 1._ Similar, or homogeneal, are such as, if they be divided, are still\nsevered into parts of the same nature, as water into water. Of these some\nbe spermatical, some fleshy or carnal. [957]Spermatical are such as are\nimmediately begotten of the seed, which are bones, gristles, ligaments,\nmembranes, nerves, arteries, veins, skins, fibres or strings, fat.\n\n_Bones_.] The bones are dry and hard, begotten of the thickest of the seed,\nto strengthen and sustain other parts: some say there be 304, some 307, or\n313 in man's body. They have no nerves in them, and are therefore without\nsense.\n\nA gristle is a substance softer than bone, and harder than the rest,\nflexible, and serves to maintain the parts of motion.\n\nLigaments are they that tie the bones together, and other parts to the\nbones, with their subserving tendons: membranes' office is to cover the\nrest.\n\nNerves, or sinews, are membranes without, and full of marrow within; they\nproceed from the brain, and carry the animal spirits for sense and motion.\nOf these some be harder, some softer; the softer serve the senses, and\nthere be seven pair of them. The first be the optic nerves, by which we\nsee; the second move the eyes; the third pair serve for the tongue to\ntaste; the fourth pair for the taste in the palate; the fifth belong to the\nears; the sixth pair is most ample, and runs almost over all the bowels;\nthe seventh pair moves the tongue. The harder sinews serve for the motion\nof the inner parts, proceeding from the marrow in the back, of whom there\nbe thirty combinations, seven of the neck, twelve of the breast, &c.\n\n_Arteries_.] Arteries are long and hollow, with a double skin to convey the\nvital spirit; to discern which the better, they say that Vesalius the\nanatomist was wont to cut up men alive. [958]They arise in the left side of\nthe heart, and are principally two, from which the rest are derived, aorta\nand venosa: aorta is the root of all the other, which serve the whole body;\nthe other goes to the lungs, to fetch air to refrigerate the heart.\n\n_Veins_.] Veins are hollow and round, like pipes, arising from the liver,\ncarrying blood and natural spirits; they feed all the parts. Of these there\nbe two chief, _Vena porta_ and _Vena cava_, from which the rest are\ncorrivated. That _Vena porta_ is a vein coming from the concave of the\nliver, and receiving those mesaraical veins, by whom he takes the chylus\nfrom the stomach and guts, and conveys it to the liver. The other derives\nblood from the liver to nourish all the other dispersed members. The\nbranches of that _Vena porta_ are the mesaraical and haemorrhoids. The\nbranches of the _cava_ are inward or outward. Inward, seminal or emulgent.\nOutward, in the head, arms, feet, &c., and have several names.\n\n_Fibrae, Fat, Flesh_.] Fibrae are strings, white and solid, dispersed\nthrough the whole member, and right, oblique, transverse, all which have\ntheir several uses. Fat is a similar part, moist, without blood, composed\nof the most thick and unctuous matter of the blood. The [959]skin covers\nthe rest, and hath _cuticulum_, or a little skin tinder it. Flesh is soft\nand ruddy, composed of the congealing of blood, &c.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Dissimilar Parts_.\n\nDissimilar parts are those which we call organical, or instrumental, and\nthey be inward or outward. The chiefest outward parts are situate forward\nor backward:--forward, the crown and foretop of the head, skull, face,\nforehead, temples, chin, eyes, ears, nose, &c., neck, breast, chest, upper\nand lower part of the belly, hypocondries, navel, groin, flank, &c.;\nbackward, the hinder part of the head, back, shoulders, sides, loins,\nhipbones, _os sacrum_, buttocks, &c. Or joints, arms, hands, feet, legs,\nthighs, knees, &c. Or common to both, which, because they are obvious and\nwell known, I have carelessly repeated, _eaque praecipua et grandiora\ntantum; quod reliquum ex libris de anima qui volet, accipiat_.\n\nInward organical parts, which cannot be seen, are divers in number, and\nhave several names, functions, and divisions; but that of [960]Laurentius\nis most notable, into noble or ignoble parts. Of the noble there be three\nprincipal parts, to which all the rest belong, and whom they serve--brain,\nheart, liver; according to whose site, three regions, or a threefold\ndivision, is made of the whole body. As first of the head, in which the\nanimal organs are contained, and brain itself, which by his nerves give\nsense and motion to the rest, and is, as it were, a privy counsellor and\nchancellor to the heart. The second region is the chest, or middle belly,\nin which the heart as king keeps his court, and by his arteries\ncommunicates life to the whole body. The third region is the lower belly,\nin which the liver resides as a _Legat a latere_, with the rest of those\nnatural organs, serving for concoction, nourishment, expelling of\nexcrements. This lower region is distinguished from the upper by the\nmidriff, or diaphragma, and is subdivided again by [961]some into three\nconcavities or regions, upper, middle, and lower. The upper of the\nhypocondries, in whose right side is the liver, the left the spleen; from\nwhich is denominated hypochondriacal melancholy. The second of the navel\nand flanks, divided from the first by the rim. The last of the water\ncourse, which is again subdivided into three other parts. The Arabians make\ntwo parts of this region, _Epigastrium_ and _Hypogastrium_, upper or lower.\n_Epigastrium_ they call _Mirach_, from whence comes _Mirachialis\nMelancholia_, sometimes mentioned of them. Of these several regions I will\ntreat in brief apart; and first of the third region, in which the natural\norgans are contained.\n\n_De Anima.--The Lower Region, Natural Organs_.] But you that are readers in\nthe meantime, \"Suppose you were now brought into some sacred temple, or\nmajestical palace\" (as [962]Melancthon saith), \"to behold not the matter\nonly, but the singular art, workmanship, and counsel of this our great\nCreator. And it is a pleasant and profitable speculation, if it be\nconsidered aright.\" The parts of this region, which present themselves to\nyour consideration and view, are such as serve to nutrition or generation.\nThose of nutrition serve to the first or second concoction; as the\noesophagus or gullet, which brings meat and drink into the stomach. The\nventricle or stomach, which is seated in the midst of that part of the\nbelly beneath the midriff, the kitchen, as it were, of the first\nconcoction, and which turns our meat into chylus. It hath two mouths, one\nabove, another beneath. The upper is sometimes taken for the stomach\nitself; the lower and nether door (as Wecker calls it) is named Pylorus.\nThis stomach is sustained by a large kell or caul, called omentum; which\nsome will have the same with peritoneum, or rim of the belly. From the\nstomach to the very fundament are produced the guts, or intestina, which\nserve a little to alter and distribute the chylus, and convey away the\nexcrements. They are divided into small and great, by reason of their site\nand substance, slender or thicker: the slender is duodenum, or whole gut,\nwhich is next to the stomach, some twelve inches long, saith [963]\nFuschius. Jejunum, or empty gut, continuate to the other, which hath many\nmesaraic veins annexed to it, which take part of the chylus to the liver\nfrom it. Ilion the third, which consists of many crinkles, which serves\nwith the rest to receive, keep, and distribute the chylus from the stomach.\nThe thick guts are three, the blind gut, colon, and right gut. The blind is\na thick and short gut, having one mouth, in which the ilium and colon meet:\nit receives the excrements, and conveys them to the colon. This colon hath\nmany windings, that the excrements pass not away too fast: the right gut is\nstraight, and conveys the excrements to the fundament, whose lower part is\nbound up with certain muscles called sphincters, that the excrements may be\nthe better contained, until such time as a man be willing to go to the\nstool. In the midst of these guts is situated the mesenterium or midriff,\ncomposed of many veins, arteries, and much fat, serving chiefly to sustain\nthe guts. All these parts serve the first concoction. To the second, which\nis busied either in refining the good nourishment or expelling the bad, is\nchiefly belonging the liver, like in colour to congealed blood, the shop of\nblood, situate in the right hypochondry, in figure like to a half-moon,\n_generosum membrum_ Melancthon styles it, a generous part; it serves to\nturn the chylus to blood, for the nourishment of the body. The excrements\nof it are either choleric or watery, which the other subordinate parts\nconvey. The gall placed in the concave of the liver, extracts choler to it:\nthe spleen, melancholy; which is situate on the left side, over against the\nliver, a spongy matter, that draws this black choler to it by a secret\nvirtue, and feeds upon it, conveying the rest to the bottom of the stomach,\nto stir up appetite, or else to the guts as an excrement. That watery\nmatter the two kidneys expurgate by those emulgent veins and ureters. The\nemulgent draw this superfluous moisture from the blood; the two ureters\nconvey it to the bladder, which, by reason of his site in the lower belly,\nis apt to receive it, having two parts, neck and bottom: the bottom holds\nthe water, the neck is constringed with a muscle, which, as a porter, keeps\nthe water from running out against our will.\n\nMembers of generation are common to both sexes, or peculiar to one; which,\nbecause they are impertinent to my purpose, I do voluntarily omit.\n\n_Middle Region_.] Next in order is the middle region, or chest, which\ncomprehends the vital faculties and parts; which (as I have said) is\nseparated from the lower belly by the diaphragma or midriff, which is a\nskin consisting of many nerves, membranes; and amongst other uses it hath,\nis the instrument of laughing. There is also a certain thin membrane, full\nof sinews, which covereth the whole chest within, and is called pleura, the\nseat of the disease called pleurisy, when it is inflamed; some add a third\nskin, which is termed mediastinus, which divides the chest into two parts,\nright and left; of this region the principal part is the heart, which is\nthe seat and fountain of life, of heat, of spirits, of pulse and\nrespiration--the sun of our body, the king and sole commander of it--the\nseat and organ of all passions and affections. _Primum vivens, ultimum\nmoriens_, it lives first, dies last in all creatures. Of a pyramidical\nform, and not much unlike to a pineapple; a part worthy of [964]\nadmiration, that can yield such variety of affections, by whose motion it\nis dilated or contracted, to stir and command the humours in the body. As\nin sorrow, melancholy; in anger, choler; in joy, to send the blood\noutwardly; in sorrow, to call it in; moving the humours, as horses do a\nchariot. This heart, though it be one sole member, yet it may be divided\ninto two creeks right and left. The right is like the moon increasing,\nbigger than the other part, and receives blood from _vena cava_,\ndistributing some of it to the lungs to nourish them; the rest to the left\nside, to engender spirits. The left creek hath the form of a cone, and is\nthe seat of life, which, as a torch doth oil, draws blood unto it,\nbegetting of it spirits and fire; and as fire in a torch, so are spirits in\nthe blood; and by that great artery called aorta, it sends vital spirits\nover the body, and takes air from the lungs by that artery which is called\n_venosa_; so that both creeks have their vessels, the right two veins, the\nleft two arteries, besides those two common anfractuous ears, which serve\nthem both; the one to hold blood, the other air, for several uses. The\nlungs is a thin spongy part, like an ox hoof, (saith [965]Fernelius) the\ntown-clerk or crier, ([966]one terms it) the instrument of voice, as an\norator to a king; annexed to the heart, to express their thoughts by voice.\nThat it is the instrument of voice, is manifest, in that no creature can\nspeak, or utter any voice, which wanteth these lights. It is, besides, the\ninstrument of respiration, or breathing; and its office is to cool the\nheart, by sending air unto it, by the venosal artery, which vein comes to\nthe lungs by that _aspera arteria_ which consists of many gristles,\nmembranes, nerves, taking in air at the nose and mouth, and by it likewise\nexhales the fumes of the heart.\n\nIn the upper region serving the animal faculties, the chief organ is the\nbrain, which is a soft, marrowish, and white substance, engendered of the\npurest part of seed and spirits, included by many skins, and seated within\nthe skull or brain pan; and it is the most noble organ under heaven, the\ndwelling-house and seat of the soul, the habitation of wisdom, memory,\njudgment, reason, and in which man is most like unto God; and therefore\nnature hath covered it with a skull of hard bone, and two skins or\nmembranes, whereof the one is called _dura mater_, or meninx, the other\n_pia mater_. The dura mater is next to the skull, above the other, which\nincludes and protects the brain. When this is taken away, the pia mater is\nto be seen, a thin membrane, the next and immediate cover of the brain, and\nnot covering only, but entering into it. The brain itself is divided into\ntwo parts, the fore and hinder part; the fore part is much bigger than the\nother, which is called the little brain in respect of it. This fore part\nhath many concavities distinguished by certain ventricles, which are the\nreceptacles of the spirits, brought hither by the arteries from the heart,\nand are there refined to a more heavenly nature, to perform the actions of\nthe soul. Of these ventricles there are three--right, left, and middle. The\nright and left answer to their site, and beget animal spirits; if they be\nany way hurt, sense and motion ceaseth. These ventricles, moreover, are\nheld to be the seat of the common sense. The middle ventricle is a common\nconcourse and cavity of them both, and hath two passages--the one to\nreceive pituita, and the other extends itself to the fourth creek; in this\nthey place imagination and cogitation, and so the three ventricles of the\nfore part of the brain are used. The fourth creek behind the head is common\nto the cerebel or little brain, and marrow of the backbone, the last and\nmost solid of all the rest, which receives the animal spirits from the\nother ventricles, and conveys them to the marrow in the back, and is the\nplace where they say the memory is seated.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Of the Soul and her Faculties_.\n\nAccording to [967]Aristotle, the soul is defined to be [Greek:\nentelecheia], _perfectio et actus primus corporis organici, vitam habentis\nin potentia_: the perfection or first act of an organical body, having\npower of life, which most [968]philosophers approve. But many doubts arise\nabout the essence, subject, seat, distinction, and subordinate faculties of\nit. For the essence and particular knowledge, of all other things it is\nmost hard (be it of man or beast) to discern, as [969]Aristotle himself,\n[970]Tully, [971]Picus Mirandula, [972]Tolet, and other neoteric\nphilosophers confess:--[973]\"We can understand all things by her, but what\nshe is we cannot apprehend.\" Some therefore make one soul, divided into\nthree principal faculties; others, three distinct souls. Which question of\nlate hath been much controverted by Picolomineus and Zabarel. [974]\nParacelsus will have four souls, adding to the three grand faculties a\nspiritual soul: which opinion of his, Campanella, in his book _de sensu\nrerum_ [975]much labours to demonstrate and prove, because carcasses bleed\nat the sight of the murderer; with many such arguments And [976]some again,\none soul of all creatures whatsoever, differing only in organs; and that\nbeasts have reason as well as men, though, for some defect of organs, not\nin such measure. Others make a doubt whether it be all in all, and all in\nevery part; which is amply discussed in Zabarel amongst the rest. The\n[977]common division of the soul is into three principal\nfaculties--vegetal, sensitive, and rational, which make three distinct\nkinds of living creatures--vegetal plants, sensible beasts, rational men.\nHow these three principal faculties are distinguished and connected,\n_Humano ingenio inaccessum videtur_, is beyond human capacity, as [978]\nTaurellus, Philip, Flavins, and others suppose. The inferior may be alone,\nbut the superior cannot subsist without the other; so sensible includes\nvegetal, rational both; which are contained in it (saith Aristotle) _ut\ntrigonus in tetragono_ as a triangle in a quadrangle.\n\n_Vegetal Soul_.] Vegetal, the first of the three distinct faculties, is\ndefined to be \"a substantial act of an organical body, by which it is\nnourished, augmented, and begets another like unto itself.\" In which\ndefinition, three several operations are specified--altrix, auctrix,\nprocreatrix; the first is [979]nutrition, whose object is nourishment,\nmeat, drink, and the like; his organ the liver in sensible creatures; in\nplants, the root or sap. His office is to turn the nutriment into the\nsubstance of the body nourished, which he performs by natural heat. This\nnutritive operation hath four other subordinate functions or powers\nbelonging to it--attraction, retention, digestion, expulsion.\n\n_Attraction_.] [980]Attraction is a ministering faculty, which, as a\nloadstone doth iron, draws meat into the stomach, or as a lamp doth oil;\nand this attractive power is very necessary in plants, which suck up\nmoisture by the root, as, another mouth, into the sap, as a like stomach.\n\n_Retention_.] Retention keeps it, being attracted unto the stomach, until\nsuch time it be concocted; for if it should pass away straight, the body\ncould not be nourished.\n\n_Digestion_.] Digestion is performed by natural heat; for as the flame of a\ntorch consumes oil, wax, tallow, so doth it alter and digest the nutritive\nmatter. Indigestion is opposite unto it, for want of natural heat. Of this\ndigestion there be three differences--maturation, elixation, assation.\n\n_Maturation_.] Maturation is especially observed in the fruits of trees;\nwhich are then said to be ripe, when the seeds are fit to be sown again.\nCrudity is opposed to it, which gluttons, epicures, and idle persons are\nmost subject unto, that use no exercise to stir natural heat, or else choke\nit, as too much wood puts out a fire.\n\n_Elixation_.] Elixation is the seething of meat in the stomach, by the said\nnatural heat, as meat is boiled in a pot; to which corruption or\nputrefaction is opposite.\n\n_Assation_.] Assation is a concoction of the inward moisture by heat; his\nopposite is semiustulation.\n\n_Order of Concoction fourfold_.] Besides these three several operations of\ndigestion, there is a fourfold order of concoction:--mastication, or\nchewing in the mouth; chilification of this so chewed meat in the stomach;\nthe third is in the liver, to turn this chylus into blood, called\nsanguification; the last is assimilation, which is in every part.\n\n_Expulsion_.] Expulsion is a power of nutrition, by which it expels all\nsuperfluous excrements, and relics of meat and drink, by the guts, bladder,\npores; as by purging, vomiting, spitting, sweating, urine, hairs, nails,\n&c.\n\n_Augmentation_.] As this nutritive faculty serves to nourish the body, so\ndoth the augmenting faculty (the second operation or power of the vegetal\nfaculty) to the increasing of it in quantity, according to all dimensions,\nlong, broad, thick, and to make it grow till it come to his due proportion\nand perfect shape; which hath his period of augmentation, as of\nconsumption; and that most certain, as the poet observes:--\n\n       \"Stat sua cuique dies, breve et irreparabile tempus\n        Omnibus est vitae.\"------\n\n       \"A term of life is set to every man,\n        Which is but short, and pass it no one can.\"\n\n_Generation_.] The last of these vegetal faculties is generation, which\nbegets another by means of seed, like unto itself, to the perpetual\npreservation of the species. To this faculty they ascribe three subordinate\noperations:--the first to turn nourishment into seed, &c.\n\n_Life and Death concomitants of the Vegetal Faculties_.] Necessary\nconcomitants or affections of this vegetal faculty are life and his\nprivation, death. To the preservation of life the natural heat is most\nrequisite, though siccity and humidity, and those first qualities, be not\nexcluded. This heat is likewise in plants, as appears by their increasing,\nfructifying, &c., though not so easily perceived. In all bodies it must\nhave radical [981]moisture to preserve it, that it be not consumed; to\nwhich preservation our clime, country, temperature, and the good or bad use\nof those six non-natural things avail much. For as this natural heat and\nmoisture decays, so doth our life itself; and if not prevented before by\nsome violent accident, or interrupted through our own default, is in the\nend dried up by old age, and extinguished by death for want of matter, as a\nlamp for defect of oil to maintain it.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Of the sensible Soul_.\n\nNext in order is the sensible faculty, which is as far beyond the other in\ndignity, as a beast is preferred to a plant, having those vegetal powers\nincluded in it. 'Tis defined an \"Act of an organical body by which it\nlives, hath sense, appetite, judgment, breath, and motion.\" His object in\ngeneral is a sensible or passible quality, because the sense is affected\nwith it. The general organ is the brain, from which principally the\nsensible operations are derived. This sensible soul is divided into two\nparts, apprehending or moving. By the apprehensive power we perceive the\nspecies of sensible things present, or absent, and retain them as wax doth\nthe print of a seal. By the moving, the body is outwardly carried from one\nplace to another; or inwardly moved by spirits and pulse. The apprehensive\nfaculty is subdivided into two parts, inward or outward. Outward, as the\nfive senses, of touching, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, to which you\nmay add Scaliger's sixth sense of titillation, if you please; or that of\nspeech, which is the sixth external sense, according to Lullius. Inward are\nthree--common sense, phantasy, memory. Those five outward senses have their\nobject in outward things only, and such as are present, as the eye sees no\ncolour except it be at hand, the ear sound. Three of these senses are of\ncommodity, hearing, sight, and smell; two of necessity, touch, and taste,\nwithout which we cannot live. Besides, the sensitive power is active or\npassive. Active in sight, the eye sees the colour; passive when it is hurt\nby his object, as the eye by the sunbeams. According to that axiom,\n_visibile forte destruit sensum_. [982]Or if the object be not pleasing, as\na bad sound to the ear, a stinking smell to the nose, &c.\n\n_Sight_.] Of these five senses, sight is held to be most precious, and the\nbest, and that by reason of his object, it sees the whole body at once. By\nit we learn, and discern all things, a sense most excellent for use: to the\nsight three things are required; the object, the organ, and the medium. The\nobject in general is visible, or that which is to be seen, as colours, and\nall shining bodies. The medium is the illumination of the air, which comes\nfrom [983]light, commonly called diaphanum; for in dark we cannot see. The\norgan is the eye, and chiefly the apple of it, which by those optic nerves,\nconcurring both in one, conveys the sight to the common sense. Between the\norgan and object a true distance is required, that it be not too near, or\ntoo far off! Many excellent questions appertain to this sense, discussed by\nphilosophers: as whether this sight be caused _intra mittendo, vel extra\nmittendo_, &c., by receiving in the visible species, or sending of them\nout, which [984]Plato, [985]Plutarch, [986]Macrobius, [987]Lactantius and\nothers dispute. And, besides, it is the subject of the perspectives, of\nwhich Alhazen the Arabian, Vitellio, Roger Bacon, Baptista Porta, Guidus\nUbaldus, Aquilonius, &c., have written whole volumes.\n\n_Hearing_.] Hearing, a most excellent outward sense, \"by which we learn and\nget knowledge.\" His object is sound, or that which is heard; the medium,\nair; organ, the ear. To the sound, which is a collision of the air, three\nthings are required; a body to strike, as the hand of a musician; the body\nstruck, which must be solid and able to resist; as a bell, lute-string, not\nwool, or sponge; the medium, the air; which is inward, or outward; the\noutward being struck or collided by a solid body, still strikes the next\nair, until it come to that inward natural air, which as an exquisite organ\nis contained in a little skin formed like a drum-head, and struck upon by\ncertain small instruments like drum-sticks, conveys the sound by a pair of\nnerves, appropriated to that use, to the common sense, as to a judge of\nsounds. There is great variety and much delight in them; for the knowledge\nof which, consult with Boethius and other musicians.\n\n_Smelling_.] Smelling is an \"outward sense, which apprehends by the\nnostrils drawing in air;\" and of all the rest it is the weakest sense in\nmen. The organ in the nose, or two small hollow pieces of flesh a little\nabove it: the medium the air to men, as water to fish: the object, smell,\narising from a mixed body resolved, which, whether it be a quality, fume,\nvapour, or exhalation, I will not now dispute, or of their differences, and\nhow they are caused. This sense is an organ of health, as sight and\nhearing, saith [988]Agellius, are of discipline; and that by avoiding bad\nsmells, as by choosing good, which do as much alter and affect the body\nmany times, as diet itself.\n\n_Taste_.] Taste, a necessary sense, \"which perceives all savours by the\ntongue and palate, and that by means of a thin spittle, or watery juice.\"\nHis organ is the tongue with his tasting nerves; the medium, a watery\njuice; the object, taste, or savour, which is a quality in the juice,\narising from the mixture of things tasted. Some make eight species or kinds\nof savour, bitter, sweet, sharp, salt, &c., all which sick men (as in an\nague) cannot discern, by reason of their organs misaffected.\n\n_Touching_.] Touch, the last of the senses, and most ignoble, yet of as\ngreat necessity as the other, and of as much pleasure. This sense is\nexquisite in men, and by his nerves dispersed all over the body, perceives\nany tactile quality. His organ the nerves; his object those first\nqualities, hot, dry, moist, cold; and those that follow them, hard, soft,\nthick, thin, &c. Many delightsome questions are moved by philosophers about\nthese five senses; their organs, objects, mediums, which for brevity I\nomit.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VII.--_Of the Inward Senses._\n\n_Common Sense_.] Inner senses are three in number, so called, because they\nbe within the brainpan, as common sense, phantasy, memory. Their objects\nare not only things present, but they perceive the sensible species of\nthings to come, past, absent, such as were before in the sense. This common\nsense is the judge or moderator of the rest, by whom we discern all\ndifferences of objects; for by mine eye I do not know that I see, or by\nmine ear that I hear, but by my common sense, who judgeth of sounds and\ncolours: they are but the organs to bring the species to be censured; so\nthat all their objects are his, and all their offices are his. The fore\npart of the brain is his organ or seat.\n\n_Phantasy_.] Phantasy, or imagination, which some call estimative, or\ncogitative, (confirmed, saith [989]Fernelius, by frequent meditation,) is\nan inner sense which doth more fully examine the species perceived by\ncommon sense, of things present or absent, and keeps them longer, recalling\nthem to mind again, or making new of his own. In time of sleep this faculty\nis free, and many times conceive strange, stupend, absurd shapes, as in\nsick men we commonly observe. His organ is the middle cell of the brain;\nhis objects all the species communicated to him by the common sense, by\ncomparison of which he feigns infinite other unto himself. In melancholy\nmen this faculty is most powerful and strong, and often hurts, producing\nmany monstrous and prodigious things, especially if it be stirred up by\nsome terrible object, presented to it from common sense or memory. In poets\nand painters imagination forcibly works, as appears by their several\nfictions, antics, images: as Ovid's house of sleep, Psyche's palace in\nApuleius, &c. In men it is subject and governed by reason, or at least\nshould be; but in brutes it hath no superior, and is _ratio brutorum_, all\nthe reason they have.\n\n_Memory_.] Memory lays up all the species which the senses have brought in,\nand records them as a good register, that they may be forthcoming when they\nare called for by phantasy and reason. His object is the same with\nphantasy, his seat and organ the back part of the brain.\n\n_Affections of the Senses, sleep and waking._] The affections of these\nsenses are sleep and waking, common to all sensible creatures. \"Sleep is a\nrest or binding of the outward senses, and of the common sense, for the\npreservation of body and soul\" (as Scaliger [990]defines it); for when the\ncommon sense resteth, the outward senses rest also. The phantasy alone is\nfree, and his commander reason: as appears by those imaginary dreams, which\nare of divers kinds, natural, divine, demoniacal, &c., which vary according\nto humours, diet, actions, objects, &c., of which Artemidorus, Cardanus,\nand Sambucus, with their several interpretators, have written great\nvolumes. This litigation of senses proceeds from an inhibition of spirits,\nthe way being stopped by which they should come; this stopping is caused of\nvapours arising out of the stomach, filling the nerves, by which the\nspirits should be conveyed. When these vapours are spent, the passage is\nopen, and the spirits perform their accustomed duties: so that \"waking is\nthe action and motion of the senses, which the spirits dispersed over all\nparts cause.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. VIII.--_Of the Moving Faculty_.\n\n_Appetite_] This moving faculty is the other power of the sensitive soul,\nwhich causeth all those inward and outward animal motions in the body. It\nis divided into two faculties, the power of appetite, and of moving from\nplace to place. This of appetite is threefold, so some will have it;\nnatural, as it signifies any such inclination, as of a stone to fall\ndownward, and such actions as retention, expulsion, which depend not on\nsense, but are vegetal, as the appetite of meat and drink; hunger and\nthirst. Sensitive is common to men and brutes. Voluntary, the third, or\nintellective, which commands the other two in men, and is a curb unto them,\nor at least should be, but for the most part is captivated and overruled by\nthem; and men are led like beasts by sense, giving reins to their\nconcupiscence and several lusts. For by this appetite the soul is led or\ninclined to follow that good which the senses shall approve, or avoid that\nwhich they hold evil: his object being good or evil, the one he embraceth,\nthe other he rejecteth; according to that aphorism, _Omnia appetunt bonum_,\nall things seek their own good, or at least seeming good. This power is\ninseparable from sense, for where sense is, there are likewise pleasure and\npain. His organ is the same with the common sense, and is divided into two\npowers, or inclinations, concupiscible or irascible: or (as one [991]\ntranslates it) coveting, anger invading, or impugning. Concupiscible covets\nalways pleasant and delightsome things, and abhors that which is\ndistasteful, harsh, and unpleasant. _Irascible, quasi [992] aversans per\niram et odium_, as avoiding it with anger and indignation. All affections\nand perturbations arise out of these two fountains, which, although the\nstoics make light of, we hold natural, and not to be resisted. The good\naffections are caused by some object of the same nature; and if present,\nthey procure joy, which dilates the heart, and preserves the body: if\nabsent, they cause hope, love, desire, and concupiscence. The bad are\nsimple or mixed: simple for some bad object present, as sorrow, which\ncontracts the heart, macerates the soul, subverts the good estate of the\nbody, hindering all the operations of it, causing melancholy, and many\ntimes death itself; or future, as fear. Out of these two arise those mixed\naffections and passions of anger, which is a desire of revenge; hatred,\nwhich is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that\nhe loves; and [Greek: epikairekakia], a compound affection of joy and hate,\nwhen we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their\nprosperity; pride, self-love, emulation, envy, shame, &c., of which\nelsewhere.\n\n_Moving from place to place_, is a faculty necessarily following the other.\nFor in vain were it otherwise to desire and to abhor, if we had not\nlikewise power to prosecute or eschew, by moving the body from place to\nplace: by this faculty therefore we locally move the body, or any part of\nit, and go from one place to another. To the better performance of which,\nthree things are requisite: that which moves; by what it moves; that which\nis moved. That which moves, is either the efficient cause, or end. The end\nis the object, which is desired or eschewed; as in a dog to catch a hare,\n&c. The efficient cause in man is reason, or his subordinate phantasy,\nwhich apprehends good or bad objects: in brutes imagination alone, which\nmoves the appetite, the appetite this faculty, which by an admirable league\nof nature, and by meditation of the spirit, commands the organ by which it\nmoves: and that consists of nerves, muscles, cords, dispersed through the\nwhole body, contracted and relaxed as the spirits will, which move the\nmuscles, or [993]nerves in the midst of them, and draw the cord, and so\n_per consequens_ the joint, to the place intended. That which is moved, is\nthe body or some member apt to move. The motion of the body is divers, as\ngoing, running, leaping, dancing, sitting, and such like, referred to the\npredicament of _situs_. Worms creep, birds fly, fishes swim; and so of\nparts, the chief of which is respiration or breathing, and is thus\nperformed. The outward air is drawn in by the vocal artery, and sent by\nmediation of the midriff to the lungs, which, dilating themselves as a pair\nof bellows, reciprocally fetch it in, and send it out to the heart to cool\nit; and from thence now being hot, convey it again, still taking in fresh.\nSuch a like motion is that of the pulse, of which, because many have\nwritten whole books, I will say nothing.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IX.--_Of the Rational Soul._\n\nIn the precedent subsections I have anatomised those inferior faculties of\nthe soul; the rational remaineth, \"a pleasant, but a doubtful subject\" (as\n[994]one terms it), and with the like brevity to be discussed. Many\nerroneous opinions are about the essence and original of it; whether it be\nfire, as Zeno held; harmony, as Aristoxenus; number, as Xenocrates; whether\nit be organical, or inorganical; seated in the brain, heart or blood;\nmortal or immortal; how it comes into the body. Some hold that it is _ex\ntraduce_, as _Phil. 1. de Anima_, Tertullian, Lactantius _de opific. Dei,\ncap. 19._ Hugo, _lib. de Spiritu et Anima_, Vincentius Bellavic. _spec.\nnatural. lib. 23. cap. 2. et 11._ Hippocrates, Avicenna, and many [995]\nlate writers; that one man begets another, body and soul; or as a candle\nfrom a candle, to be produced from the seed: otherwise, say they, a man\nbegets but half a man, and is worse than a beast that begets both matter\nand form; and, besides, the three faculties of the soul must be together\ninfused, which is most absurd as they hold, because in beasts they are\nbegot, the two inferior I mean, and may not be well separated in men. [996]\nGalen supposeth the soul _crasin esse_, to be the temperature itself;\nTrismegistus, Musaeus, Orpheus, Homer, Pindarus, Phaerecides Syrus,\nEpictetus, with the Chaldees and Egyptians, affirmed the soul to be\nimmortal, as did those British [997]Druids of old. The [998]Pythagoreans\ndefend Metempsychosis; and Palingenesia, that souls go from one body to\nanother, _epota prius Lethes unda_, as men into wolves, bears, dogs, hogs,\nas they were inclined in their lives, or participated in conditions:\n\n[999]   ------\"inque ferinas\n        Possumus ire domus, pecudumque in corpora condi.\"\n\n[1000]Lucian's cock was first Euphorbus, a captain:\n\n       \"Ille ego (nam memini) Trojani tempore belli,\n        Panthoides Euphorbus eram,\"\n\na horse, a man, a sponge. [1001]Julian the Apostate thought Alexander's\nsoul was descended into his body: Plato in Timaeo, and in his Phaedon, (for\naught I can perceive,) differs not much from this opinion, that it was from\nGod at first, and knew all, but being enclosed in the body, it forgets, and\nlearns anew, which he calls _reminiscentia_, or recalling, and that it was\nput into the body for a punishment; and thence it goes into a beast's, or\nman's, as appears by his pleasant fiction _de sortitione animarum, lib. 10.\nde rep._ and after [1002]ten thousand years is to return into the former\nbody again,\n\n[1003]  ------\"post varios annos, per mille figuras,\n        Rursus ad humanae fertur primordia vitae.\"\n\nOthers deny the immortality of it, which Pomponatus of Padua decided out of\nAristotle not long since, Plinias Avunculus, _cap. 1. lib. 2, et lib. 7.\ncap. 55_; Seneca, _lib. 7. epist. ad Lucilium, epist. 55_; Dicearchus _in\nTull. Tusc._ Epicurus, Aratus, Hippocrates, Galen, Lucretius, _lib. 1._\n\n       (Praeterea gigni pariter cum corpore, et una\n        Cresere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.)[1004]\n\nAverroes, and I know not how many Neoterics. [1005]\"This question of the\nimmortality of the soul, is diversely and wonderfully impugned and\ndisputed, especially among the Italians of late,\" saith Jab. Colerus, _lib.\nde immort. animae, cap. 1._ The popes themselves have doubted of it: Leo\nDecimus, that Epicurean pope, as [1006]some record of him, caused this\nquestion to be discussed pro and con before him, and concluded at last, as\na profane and atheistical moderator, with that verse of Cornelius Gallus,\nEt redit in nihilum, quod fuit ante nihil. It began of nothing, and in\nnothing it ends. Zeno and his Stoics, as [1007]Austin quotes him, supposed\nthe soul so long to continue, till the body was fully putrified, and\nresolved into _materia prima_: but after that, _in fumos evanescere_, to be\nextinguished and vanished; and in the meantime, whilst the body was\nconsuming, it wandered all abroad, _et e longinquo multa annunciare_, and\n(as that Clazomenian Hermotimus averred) saw pretty visions, and suffered I\nknow not what. [1008]Errant exangues sine corpore et ossibus umbrae. Others\ngrant the immortality thereof, but they make many fabulous fictions in the\nmeantime of it, after the departure from the body: like Plato's Elysian\nfields, and that Turkey paradise. The souls of good men they deified; the\nbad (saith [1009]Austin) became devils, as they supposed; with many such\nabsurd tenets, which he hath confuted. Hierome, Austin, and other Fathers\nof the church, hold that the soul is immortal, created of nothing, and so\ninfused into the child or embryo in his mother's womb, six months after the\n[1010]conception; not as those of brutes, which are _ex traduce_, and dying\nwith them vanish into nothing. To whose divine treatises, and to the\nScriptures themselves, I rejourn all such atheistical spirits, as Tully did\nAtticus, doubting of this point, to Plato's Phaedon. Or if they desire\nphilosophical proofs and demonstrations, I refer them to Niphus, Nic.\nFaventinus' tracts of this subject. To Fran. and John Picus _in digress:\nsup. 3. de Anima_, Tholosanus, Eugubinus, To. Soto, Canas, Thomas,\nPeresius, Dandinus, Colerus, to that elaborate tract in Zanchius, to\nTolet's Sixty Reasons, and Lessius' Twenty-two Arguments, to prove the\nimmortality of the soul. Campanella, _lib. de sensu rerum_, is large in the\nsame discourse, Albertinus the Schoolman, Jacob. Nactantus, _tom. 2. op._\nhandleth it in four questions, Antony Brunus, Aonius Palearius, Marinus\nMarcennus, with many others. This reasonable soul, which Austin calls a\nspiritual substance moving itself, is defined by philosophers to be \"the\nfirst substantial act of a natural, humane, organical body, by which a man\nlives, perceives, and understands, freely doing all things, and with\nelection.\" Out of which definition we may gather, that this rational soul\nincludes the powers, and performs the duties of the two other, which are\ncontained in it, and all three faculties make one soul, which is\ninorganical of itself, although it be in all parts, and incorporeal, using\ntheir organs, and working by them. It is divided into two chief parts,\ndiffering in office only, not in essence. The understanding, which is the\nrational power apprehending; the will, which is the rational power moving:\nto which two, all the other rational powers are subject and reduced.\n\n\nSUBSECT. X.--_Of the Understanding_.\n\n\"Understanding is a power of the soul, [1011]by which we perceive, know,\nremember, and judge as well singulars, as universals, having certain innate\nnotices or beginnings of arts, a reflecting action, by which it judgeth of\nhis own doings, and examines them.\" Out of this definition (besides his\nchief office, which is to apprehend, judge all that he performs, without\nthe help of any instruments or organs) three differences appear betwixt a\nman and a beast. As first, the sense only comprehends singularities, the\nunderstanding universalities. Secondly, the sense hath no innate notions.\nThirdly, brutes cannot reflect upon themselves. Bees indeed make neat and\ncurious works, and many other creatures besides; but when they have done,\nthey cannot judge of them. His object is God, _ens_, all nature, and\nwhatsoever is to be understood: which successively it apprehends. The\nobject first moving the understanding, is some sensible thing; after by\ndiscoursing, the mind finds out the corporeal substance, and from thence\nthe spiritual. His actions (some say) are apprehension, composition,\ndivision, discoursing, reasoning, memory, which some include in invention,\nand judgment. The common divisions are of the understanding, agent, and\npatient; speculative, and practical; in habit, or in act; simple, or\ncompound. The agent is that which is called the wit of man, acumen or\nsubtlety, sharpness of invention, when he doth invent of himself without a\nteacher, or learns anew, which abstracts those intelligible species from\nthe phantasy, and transfers them to the passive understanding, [1012]\n\"because there is nothing in the understanding, which was not first in the\nsense.\" That which the imagination hath taken from the sense, this agent\njudgeth of, whether it be true or false; and being so judged he commits it\nto the passible to be kept. The agent is a doctor or teacher, the passive a\nscholar; and his office is to keep and further judge of such things as are\ncommitted to his charge; as a bare and rased table at first, capable of all\nforms and notions. Now these notions are twofold, actions or habits:\nactions, by which we take notions of, and perceive things; habits, which\nare durable lights and notions, which we may use when we will. Some reckon\nup eight kinds of them, sense, experience, intelligence, faith, suspicion,\nerror, opinion, science; to which are added art, prudency, wisdom: as also\n[1013]synteresis, _dictamen rationis_, conscience; so that in all there be\nfourteen species of the understanding, of which some are innate, as the\nthree last mentioned; the other are gotten by doctrine, learning, and use.\nPlato will have all to be innate: Aristotle reckons up but five\nintellectual habits; two practical, as prudency, whose end is to practise;\nto fabricate; wisdom to comprehend the use and experiments of all notions\nand habits whatsoever. Which division of Aristotle (if it be considered\naright) is all one with the precedent; for three being innate, and five\nacquisite, the rest are improper, imperfect, and in a more strict\nexamination excluded. Of all these I should more amply dilate, but my\nsubject will not permit. Three of them I will only point at, as more\nnecessary to my following discourse.\n\nSynteresis, or the purer part of the conscience, is an innate habit, and\ndoth signify \"a conversation of the knowledge of the law of God and Nature,\nto know good or evil.\" And (as our divines hold) it is rather in the\nunderstanding than in the will. This makes the major proposition in a\npractical syllogism. The _dictamen rationis_ is that which doth admonish us\nto do good or evil, and is the minor in the syllogism. The conscience is\nthat which approves good or evil, justifying or condemning our actions, and\nis the conclusion of the syllogism: as in that familiar example of Regulus\nthe Roman, taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and suffered to go to Rome,\non that condition he should return again, or pay so much for his ransom.\nThe synteresis proposeth the question; his word, oath, promise, is to be\nreligiously kept, although to his enemy, and that by the law of nature.\n[1014]\"Do not that to another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself.\"\nDictamen applies it to him, and dictates this or the like: Regulus, thou\nwouldst not another man should falsify his oath, or break promise with\nthee: conscience concludes, therefore, Regulus, thou dost well to perform\nthy promise, and oughtest to keep thine oath. More of this in Religious\nMelancholy.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XI.--_Of the Will_.\n\nWill is the other power of the rational soul, [1015]\"which covets or avoids\nsuch things as have been before judged and apprehended by the\nunderstanding.\" If good, it approves; if evil, it abhors it: so that his\nobject is either good or evil. Aristotle calls this our rational appetite;\nfor as, in the sensitive, we are moved to good or bad by our appetite,\nruled and directed by sense; so in this we are carried by reason. Besides,\nthe sensitive appetite hath a particular object, good or bad; this an\nuniversal, immaterial: that respects only things delectable and pleasant;\nthis honest. Again, they differ in liberty. The sensual appetite seeing an\nobject, if it be a convenient good, cannot but desire it; if evil, avoid\nit: but this is free in his essence, [1016]\"much now depraved, obscured,\nand fallen from his first perfection; yet in some of his operations still\nfree,\" as to go, walk, move at his pleasure, and to choose whether it will\ndo or not do, steal or not steal. Otherwise, in vain were laws,\ndeliberations, exhortations, counsels, precepts, rewards, promises, threats\nand punishments: and God should be the author of sin. But in [1017]\nspiritual things we will no good, prone to evil (except we be regenerate,\nand led by the Spirit), we are egged on by our natural concupiscence, and\nthere is [Greek: ataxia], a confusion in our powers, [1018]\"our whole will\nis averse from God and his law,\" not in natural things only, as to eat and\ndrink, lust, to which we are led headlong by our temperature and inordinate\nappetite,\n\n[1019] \"Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantum\n        Sufficimus,\"------\n\nwe cannot resist, our concupiscence is originally bad, our heart evil, the\nseat of our affections captivates and enforceth our will. So that in\nvoluntary things we are averse from God and goodness, bad by nature, by\n[1020]ignorance worse, by art, discipline, custom, we get many bad habits:\nsuffering them to domineer and tyrannise over us; and the devil is still\nready at hand with his evil suggestions, to tempt our depraved will to some\nill-disposed action, to precipitate us to destruction, except our will be\nswayed and counterpoised again with some divine precepts, and good motions\nof the spirit, which many times restrain, hinder and check us, when we are\nin the full career of our dissolute courses. So David corrected himself,\nwhen he had Saul at a vantage. Revenge and malice were as two violent\noppugners on the one side; but honesty, religion, fear of God, withheld him\non the other.\n\nThe actions of the will are _velle_ and _nolle_, to will and nill: which\ntwo words comprehend all, and they are good or bad, accordingly as they are\ndirected, and some of them freely performed by himself; although the stoics\nabsolutely deny it, and will have all things inevitably done by destiny,\nimposing a fatal necessity upon us, which we may not resist; yet we say\nthat our will is free in respect of us, and things contingent, howsoever in\nrespect of God's determinate counsel, they are inevitable and necessary.\nSome other actions of the will are performed by the inferior powers, which\nobey him, as the sensitive and moving appetite; as to open our eyes, to go\nhither and thither, not to touch a book, to speak fair or foul: but this\nappetite is many times rebellious in us, and will not be contained within\nthe lists of sobriety and temperance. It was (as I said) once well agreeing\nwith reason, and there was an excellent consent and harmony between them,\nbut that is now dissolved, they often jar, reason is overborne by passion:\n_Fertur equis auriga, nec audit currus habenas_, as so many wild horses run\naway with a chariot, and will not be curbed. We know many times what is\ngood, but will not do it, as she said,\n\n[1021] \"Trahit invitum nova vis, aliudque cupido,\n        Mens aliud suadet,\"------\n\nLust counsels one thing, reason another, there is a new reluctancy in men.\n[1022]_Odi, nec possum, cupiens non esse, quod odi_. We cannot resist, but\nas Phaedra confessed to her nurse, [1023]_quae loqueris, vera sunt, sed\nfuror suggerit sequi pejora_: she said well and true, she did acknowledge\nit, but headstrong passion and fury made her to do that which was opposite.\nSo David knew the filthiness of his fact, what a loathsome, foul, crying\nsin adultery was, yet notwithstanding he would commit murder, and take away\nanother man's wife, enforced against reason, religion, to follow his\nappetite.\n\nThose natural and vegetal powers are not commanded by will at all; for \"who\ncan add one cubit to his stature?\" These other may, but are not: and thence\ncome all those headstrong passions, violent perturbations of the mind; and\nmany times vicious habits, customs, feral diseases; because we give so much\nway to our appetite, and follow our inclination, like so many beasts. The\nprincipal habits are two in number, virtue and vice, whose peculiar\ndefinitions, descriptions, differences, and kinds, are handled at large in\nthe ethics, and are, indeed, the subject of moral philosophy.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Definition of Melancholy, Name, Difference_.\n\nHaving thus briefly anatomised the body and soul of man, as a preparative\nto the rest; I may now freely proceed to treat of my intended object, to\nmost men's capacity; and after many ambages, perspicuously define what this\nmelancholy is, show his name and differences. The name is imposed from the\nmatter, and disease denominated from the material cause: as Bruel observes,\n[Greek: Melancholia] quasi [Greek: Melainacholae], from black choler. And\nwhether it be a cause or an effect, a disease or symptom, let Donatus\nAltomarus and Salvianus decide; I will not contend about it. It hath\nseveral descriptions, notations, and definitions. [1024]Fracastorius, in\nhis second book of intellect, calls those melancholy, \"whom abundance of\nthat same depraved humour of black choler hath so misaffected, that they\nbecome mad thence, and dote in most things, or in all, belonging to\nelection, will, or other manifest operations of the understanding.\" [1025]\nMelanelius out of Galen, Ruffus, Aetius, describe it to be \"a bad and\npeevish disease, which makes men degenerate into beasts:\" Galen, \"a\nprivation or infection of the middle cell of the head,\" &c. defining it\nfrom the part affected, which [1026]Hercules de Saxonia approves, _lib. 1.\ncap. 16._ calling it \"a depravation of the principal function:\" Fuschius,\n_lib. 1. cap. 23._ Arnoldus _Breviar. lib. 1. cap. 18._ Guianerius, and\nothers: \"By reason of black choler,\" Paulus adds. Halyabbas simply calls it\na \"commotion of the mind.\" Aretaeus, [1027]\"a perpetual anguish of the\nsoul, fastened on one thing, without an ague;\" which definition of his,\nMercurialis _de affect. cap. lib. 1. cap. 10._ taxeth: but Aelianus\nMontaltus defends, _lib. de morb. cap. 1. de Melan._ for sufficient and\ngood. The common sort define it to be \"a kind of dotage without a fever,\nhaving for his ordinary companions, fear and sadness, without any apparent\noccasion.\" So doth Laurentius, _cap. 4._ Piso. _lib. 1. cap. 43._ Donatus\nAltomarus, _cap. 7. art. medic_. Jacchinus, _in com. in lib. 9. Rhasis ad\nAlmansor, cap. 15._ Valesius, _exerc. 17._ Fuschius, _institut. 3. sec. 1.\nc. 11._ &c. which common definition, howsoever approved by most,\n[1028]Hercules de Saxonia will not allow of, nor David Crucius, _Theat.\nmorb. Herm. lib. 2. cap. 6._ he holds it insufficient: as [1029]rather\nshowing what it is not, than what it is: as omitting the specific\ndifference, the phantasy and brain: but I descend to particulars. The\n_summum genus_ is \"dotage, or anguish of the mind,\" saith Aretaeus; \"of the\nprincipal parts,\" Hercules de Saxonia adds, to distinguish it from cramp\nand palsy, and such diseases as belong to the outward sense and motions\n[depraved] [1030]to distinguish it from folly and madness (which Montaltus\nmakes _angor animi_, to separate) in which those functions are not\ndepraved, but rather abolished; [without an ague] is added by all, to sever\nit from frenzy, and that melancholy which is in a pestilent fever. (Fear\nand sorrow) make it differ from madness: [without a cause] is lastly\ninserted, to specify it from all other ordinary passions of [fear and\nsorrow.] We properly call that dotage, as [1031]Laurentius interprets it,\n\"when some one principal faculty of the mind, as imagination, or reason, is\ncorrupted, as all melancholy persons have.\" It is without a fever, because\nthe humour is most part cold and dry, contrary to putrefaction. Fear and\nsorrow are the true characters and inseparable companions of most\nmelancholy, not all, as Her. de Saxonia, _Tract. de posthumo de\nMelancholia, cap. 2._ well excepts; for to some it is most pleasant, as to\nsuch as laugh most part; some are bold again, and free from all manner of\nfear and grief, as hereafter shall be declared.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Of the part affected. Affection. Parties affected_.\n\nSome difference I find amongst writers, about the principal part affected\nin this disease, whether it be the brain, or heart, or some other member.\nMost are of opinion that it is the brain: for being a kind of dotage, it\ncannot otherwise be but that the brain must be affected, as a similar part,\nbe it by [1032]consent or essence, not in his ventricles, or any\nobstructions in them, for then it would be an apoplexy, or epilepsy, as\n[1033]Laurentius well observes, but in a cold, dry distemperature of it in\nhis substance, which is corrupt and become too cold, or too dry, or else\ntoo hot, as in madmen, and such as are inclined to it: and this [1034]\nHippocrates confirms, Galen, the Arabians, and most of our new writers.\nMarcus de Oddis (in a consultation of his, quoted by [1035]Hildesheim) and\nfive others there cited are of the contrary part; because fear and sorrow,\nwhich are passions, be seated in the heart. But this objection is\nsufficiently answered by [1036]Montaltus, who doth not deny that the heart\nis affected (as [1037]Melanelius proves out of Galen) by reason of his\nvicinity, and so is the midriff and many other parts. They do _compati_,\nand have a fellow feeling by the law of nature: but forasmuch as this\nmalady is caused by precedent imagination, with the appetite, to whom\nspirits obey, and are subject to those principal parts, the brain must\nneeds primarily be misaffected, as the seat of reason; and then the heart,\nas the seat of affection. [1038]Capivaccius and Mercurialis have copiously\ndiscussed this question, and both conclude the subject is the inner brain,\nand from thence it is communicated to the heart and other inferior parts,\nwhich sympathise and are much troubled, especially when it comes by\nconsent, and is caused by reason of the stomach, or _mirach_, as the\nArabians term it, whole body, liver, or [1039]spleen, which are seldom\nfree, pylorus, mesaraic veins, &c. For our body is like a clock, if one\nwheel be amiss, all the rest are disordered; the whole fabric suffers: with\nsuch admirable art and harmony is a man composed, such excellent\nproportion, as Ludovicus Vives in his Fable of Man hath elegantly declared.\n\nAs many doubts almost arise about the [1040]affection, whether it be\nimagination or reason alone, or both, Hercules de Saxonia proves it out of\nGalen, Aetius, and Altomarus, that the sole fault is in [1041]imagination.\nBruel is of the same mind: Montaltus in his _2 cap._ of Melancholy confutes\nthis tenet of theirs, and illustrates the contrary by many examples: as of\nhim that thought himself a shellfish, of a nun, and of a desperate monk\nthat would not be persuaded but that he was damned; reason was in fault as\nwell as imagination, which did not correct this error: they make away\nthemselves oftentimes, and suppose many absurd and ridiculous things. Why\ndoth not reason detect the fallacy, settle and persuade, if she be free?\n[1042]Avicenna therefore holds both corrupt, to whom most Arabians\nsubscribe. The same is maintained by [1043]Areteus, [1044]Gorgonius,\nGuianerius, &c. To end the controversy, no man doubts of imagination, but\nthat it is hurt and misaffected here; for the other I determine with [1045]\nAlbertinus Bottonus, a doctor of Padua, that it is first in \"imagination,\nand afterwards in reason; if the disease be inveterate, or as it is more or\nless of continuance;\" but by accident, as [1046]Herc. de Saxonia adds;\n\"faith, opinion, discourse, ratiocination, are all accidentally depraved by\nthe default of imagination.\"\n\n_Parties affected_.] To the part affected, I may here add the parties,\nwhich shall be more opportunely spoken of elsewhere, now only signified.\nSuch as have the moon, Saturn, Mercury misaffected in their genitures, such\nas live in over cold or over hot climes: such as are born of melancholy\nparents; as offend in those six non-natural things, are black, or of a high\nsanguine complexion, [1047]that have little heads, that have a hot heart,\nmoist brain, hot liver and cold stomach, have been long sick: such as are\nsolitary by nature, great students, given to much contemplation, lead a\nlife out of action, are most subject to melancholy. Of sexes both, but men\nmore often; yet [1048]women misaffected are far more violent, and\ngrievously troubled. Of seasons of the year, the autumn is most melancholy.\nOf peculiar times: old age, from which natural melancholy is almost an\ninseparable accident; but this artificial malady is more frequent in such\nas are of a [1049]middle age. Some assign 40 years, Gariopontus 30.\nJubertus excepts neither young nor old from this adventitious. Daniel\nSennertus involves all of all sorts, out of common experience, [1050]_in\nomnibus omnino corporibus cujuscunque constitutionis dominatar_. Aetius and\nAretius [1051]ascribe into the number \"not only [1052]discontented,\npassionate, and miserable persons, swarthy, black; but such as are most\nmerry and pleasant, scoffers, and high coloured.\" \"Generally,\" saith\nRhasis, [1053]\"the finest wits and most generous spirits, are before other\nobnoxious to it;\" I cannot except any complexion, any condition, sex, or\nage, but [1054]fools and stoics, which, according to [1055]Synesius, are\nnever troubled with any manner of passion, but as Anacreon's _cicada, sine\nsanguine et dolore; similes fere diis sunt_. Erasmus vindicates fools from\nthis melancholy catalogue, because they have most part moist brains and\nlight hearts; [1056]they are free from ambition, envy, shame and fear; they\nare neither troubled in conscience, nor macerated with cares, to which our\nwhole life is most subject.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Of the Matter of Melancholy_.\n\nOf the matter of melancholy, there is much question betwixt Avicen and\nGalen, as you may read in [1057]Cardan's Contradictions, [1058]Valesius'\nControversies, Montanus, Prosper Calenus, Capivaccius, [1059]Bright,\n[1060]Ficinus, that have written either whole tracts, or copiously of it,\nin their several treatises of this subject. [1061]\"What this humour is, or\nwhence it proceeds, how it is engendered in the body, neither Galen, nor\nany old writer hath sufficiently discussed,\" as Jacchinus thinks: the\nNeoterics cannot agree. Montanus, in his Consultations, holds melancholy to\nbe material or immaterial: and so doth Arculanus: the material is one of\nthe four humours before mentioned, and natural. The immaterial or\nadventitious, acquisite, redundant, unnatural, artificial; which [1062]\nHercules de Saxonia will have reside in the spirits alone, and to proceed\nfrom a \"hot, cold, dry, moist distemperature, which, without matter, alter\nthe brain and functions of it.\" Paracelsus wholly rejects and derides this\ndivision of four humours and complexions, but our Galenists generally\napprove of it, subscribing to this opinion of Montanus.\n\nThis material melancholy is either simple or mixed; offending in quantity\nor quality, varying according to his place, where it settleth, as brain,\nspleen, mesaraic veins, heart, womb, and stomach; or differing according to\nthe mixture of those natural humours amongst themselves, or four unnatural\nadust humours, as they are diversely tempered and mingled. If natural\nmelancholy abound in the body, which is cold and dry, \"so that it be more\n[1063]than the body is well able to bear, it must needs be distempered,\"\nsaith Faventius, \"and diseased;\" and so the other, if it be depraved,\nwhether it arise from that other melancholy of choler adust, or from blood,\nproduceth the like effects, and is, as Montaltus contends, if it come by\nadustion of humours, most part hot and dry. Some difference I find, whether\nthis melancholy matter may be engendered of all four humours, about the\ncolour and temper of it. Galen holds it may be engendered of three alone,\nexcluding phlegm, or pituita, whose true assertion [1064]Valesius and\nMenardus stiffly maintain, and so doth [1065]Fuschius, Montaltus, [1066]\nMontanus. How (say they) can white become black? But Hercules de Saxonia,\n_lib. post. de mela. c. 8_, and [1067]Cardan are of the opposite part (it\nmay be engendered of phlegm, _etsi raro contingat_, though it seldom come\nto pass), so is [1068]Guianerius and Laurentius, _c. 1._ with Melanct. in\nhis book _de Anima_, and Chap. of Humours; he calls it _asininam_, dull,\nswinish melancholy, and saith that he was an eyewitness of it: so is\n[1069]Wecker. From melancholy adust ariseth one kind; from choler another,\nwhich is most brutish; another from phlegm, which is dull; and the last\nfrom blood, which is best. Of these some are cold and dry, others hot and\ndry, [1070]varying according to their mixtures, as they are intended, and\nremitted. And indeed as Rodericus a Fons. _cons. 12. l. 1._ determines,\nichors, and those serous matters being thickened become phlegm, and phlegm\ndegenerates into choler, choler adust becomes _aeruginosa melancholia_, as\nvinegar out of purest wine putrified or by exhalation of purer spirits is\nso made, and becomes sour and sharp; and from the sharpness of this humour\nproceeds much waking, troublesome thoughts and dreams, &c. so that I\nconclude as before. If the humour be cold, it is, saith [1071]Faventinus,\n\"a cause of dotage, and produceth milder symptoms: if hot, they are rash,\nraving mad, or inclining to it.\" If the brain be hot, the animal spirits\nare hot; much madness follows, with violent actions: if cold, fatuity and\nsottishness, [1072]Capivaccius. [1073]\"The colour of this mixture varies\nlikewise according to the mixture, be it hot or cold; 'tis sometimes black,\nsometimes not,\" Altomarus. The same [1074]Melanelius proves out of Galen;\nand Hippocrates in his Book of Melancholy (if at least it be his), giving\ninstance in a burning coal, \"which when it is hot, shines; when it is cold,\nlooks black; and so doth the humour.\" This diversity of melancholy matter\nproduceth diversity of effects. If it be within the [1075]body, and not\nputrified, it causeth black jaundice; if putrified, a quartan ague; if it\nbreak out to the skin, leprosy; if to parts, several maladies, as scurvy,\n&c. If it trouble the mind; as it is diversely mixed, it produceth several\nkinds of madness and dotage: of which in their place.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Of the species or kinds of Melancholy_.\n\nWhen the matter is divers and confused, how should it otherwise be, but\nthat the species should be divers and confused? Many new and old writers\nhave spoken confusedly of it, confounding melancholy and madness, as [1076]\nHeurnius, Guianerius, Gordonius, Salustius Salvianus, Jason Pratensis,\nSavanarola, that will have madness no other than melancholy in extent,\ndiffering (as I have said) in degrees. Some make two distinct species, as\nRuffus Ephesius, an old writer, Constantinus Africanus, Aretaeus, [1077]\nAurelianus, [1078]Paulus Aegineta: others acknowledge a multitude of kinds,\nand leave them indefinite, as Aetius in his _Tetrabiblos_, [1079]Avicenna,\n_lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 18._ Arculanus, _cap. 16. in 9. Rasis_.\nMontanus, _med. part. 1._ [1080]\"If natural melancholy be adust, it maketh\none kind; if blood, another; if choler, a third, differing from the first;\nand so many several opinions there are about the kinds, as there be men\nthemselves.\" [1081]Hercules de Saxonia sets down two kinds, \"material and\nimmaterial; one from spirits alone, the other from humours and spirits.\"\nSavanarola, _Rub. 11. Tract. 6. cap. 1. de aegritud. capitis_, will have\nthe kinds to be infinite; one from the mirach, called _myrachialis_ of the\nArabians; another _stomachalis_, from the stomach; another from the liver,\nheart, womb, haemorrhoids, [1082]\"one beginning, another consummate.\"\nMelancthon seconds him, [1083]\"as the humour is diversely adust and mixed,\nso are the species divers;\" but what these men speak of species I think\nought to be understood of symptoms; and so doth [1084] Arculanus interpret\nhimself: infinite species, _id est_, symptoms; and in that sense, as Jo.\nGorrheus acknowledgeth in his medicinal definitions, the species are\ninfinite, but they may be reduced to three kinds by reason of their seat;\nhead, body, and hypochrondries. This threefold division is approved by\nHippocrates in his Book of Melancholy, (if it be his, which some suspect)\nby Galen, _lib. 3. de loc. affectis, cap. 6._ by Alexander, _lib. 1. cap.\n16._ Rasis, _lib. 1. Continent. Tract. 9. lib. 1. cap. 16._ Avicenna and\nmost of our new writers. Th. Erastus makes two kinds; one perpetual, which\nis head melancholy; the other interrupt, which comes and goes by fits,\nwhich he subdivides into the other two kinds, so that all comes to the same\npass. Some again make four or five kinds, with Rodericus a Castro, _de\nmorbis mulier. lib. 2. cap. 3._ and Lod. Mercatus, who in his second book\n_de mulier. affect. cap. 4._ will have that melancholy of nuns, widows, and\nmore ancient maids, to be a peculiar species of melancholy differing from\nthe rest: some will reduce enthusiasts, ecstatical and demoniacal persons\nto this rank, adding [1085] love melancholy to the first, and lycanthropia.\nThe most received division is into three kinds. The first proceeds from the\nsole fault of the brain, and is called head melancholy; the second\nsympathetically proceeds from the whole body, when the whole temperature is\nmelancholy: the third ariseth from the bowels, liver, spleen, or membrane,\ncalled _mesenterium_, named hypochondriacal or windy melancholy, which\n[1086]Laurentius subdivides into three parts, from those three members,\nhepatic, splenetic, mesaraic. Love melancholy, which Avicenna calls\n_ilishi_: and Lycanthropia, which he calls _cucubuthe_, are commonly\nincluded in head melancholy; but of this last, which Gerardus de Solo calls\n_amoreus_, and most knight melancholy, with that of religious melancholy,\n_virginum et viduarum_, maintained by Rod. a Castro and Mercatus, and the\nother kinds of love melancholy, I will speak of apart by themselves in my\nthird partition. The three precedent species are the subject of my present\ndiscourse, which I will anatomise and treat of through all their causes,\nsymptoms, cures, together and apart; that every man that is in any measure\naffected with this malady, may know how to examine it in himself, and apply\nremedies unto it.\n\nIt is a hard matter, I confess, to distinguish these three species one from\nthe other, to express their several causes, symptoms, cures, being that\nthey are so often confounded amongst themselves, having such affinity, that\nthey can scarce be discerned by the most accurate physicians; and so often\nintermixed with other diseases, that the best experienced have been\nplunged. Montanus _consil. 26_, names a patient that had this disease of\nmelancholy and caninus appetitus both together; and _consil. 23_, with\nvertigo, [1087]Julius Caesar Claudinus with stone, gout, jaundice.\nTrincavellius with an ague, jaundice, caninus appetitus, &c. [1088]Paulus\nRegoline, a great doctor in his time, consulted in this case, was so\nconfounded with a confusion of symptoms, that he knew not to what kind of\nmelancholy to refer it. [1089]Trincavellius, Fallopius, and Francanzanus,\nfamous doctors in Italy, all three conferred with about one party, at the\nsame time, gave three different opinions. And in another place,\nTrincavellius being demanded what he thought of a melancholy young man to\nwhom he was sent for, ingenuously confessed that he was indeed melancholy,\nbut he knew not to what kind to reduce it. In his seventeenth consultation\nthere is the like disagreement about a melancholy monk. Those symptoms,\nwhich others ascribe to misaffected parts and humours, [1090]Herc. de\nSaxonia attributes wholly to distempered spirits, and those immaterial, as\nI have said. Sometimes they cannot well discern this disease from others.\nIn Reinerus Solenander's counsels, (_Sect, consil. 5_,) he and Dr. Brande\nboth agreed, that the patient's disease was hypochondriacal melancholy. Dr.\nMatholdus said it was asthma, and nothing else. [1091]Solenander and\nGuarionius, lately sent for to the melancholy Duke of Cleve, with others,\ncould not define what species it was, or agree amongst themselves. The\nspecies are so confounded, as in Caesar Claudinus his forty-fourth\nconsultation for a Polonian Count, in his judgment [1092]\"he laboured of\nhead melancholy, and that which proceeds from the whole temperature both at\nonce.\" I could give instance of some that have had all three kinds _semel\net simul_, and some successively. So that I conclude of our melancholy\nspecies, as [1093]many politicians do of their pure forms of commonwealths,\nmonarchies, aristocracies, democracies, are most famous in contemplation,\nbut in practice they are temperate and usually mixed, (so [1094]Polybius\ninformeth us) as the Lacedaemonian, the Roman of old, German now, and many\nothers. What physicians say of distinct species in their books it much\nmatters not, since that in their patients' bodies they are commonly mixed.\nIn such obscurity, therefore, variety and confused mixture of symptoms,\ncauses, how difficult a thing is it to treat of several kinds apart; to\nmake any certainty or distinction among so many casualties, distractions,\nwhen seldom two men shall be like effected _per omnia_? 'Tis hard, I\nconfess, yet nevertheless I will adventure through the midst of these\nperplexities, and, led by the clue or thread of the best writers, extricate\nmyself out of a labyrinth of doubts and errors, and so proceed to the\ncauses.\n\n\nSECT. II. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Causes of Melancholy. God a cause._\n\n\"It is in vain to speak of cures, or think of remedies, until such time as\nwe have considered of the causes,\" so [1095]Galen prescribes Glauco: and\nthe common experience of others confirms that those cures must be\nimperfect, lame, and to no purpose, wherein the causes have not first been\nsearched, as [1096]Prosper Calenius well observes in his tract _de atra\nbile_ to Cardinal Caesius. Insomuch that [1097]\"Fernelius puts a kind of\nnecessity in the knowledge of the causes, and without which it is\nimpossible to cure or prevent any manner of disease.\" Empirics may ease,\nand sometimes help, but not thoroughly root out; _sublata causa tollitur\neffectus_ as the saying is, if the cause be removed, the effect is likewise\nvanquished. It is a most difficult thing (I confess) to be able to discern\nthese causes whence they are, and in such [1098]variety to say what the\nbeginning was. [1099]He is happy that can perform it aright. I will\nadventure to guess as near as I can, and rip them all up, from the first to\nthe last, general and particular, to every species, that so they may the\nbetter be described.\n\nGeneral causes, are either supernatural, or natural. \"Supernatural are from\nGod and his angels, or by God's permission from the devil\" and his\nministers. That God himself is a cause for the punishment of sin, and\nsatisfaction of his justice, many examples and testimonies of holy\nScriptures make evident unto us, Ps. cvii, 17. \"Foolish men are plagued for\ntheir offence, and by reason of their wickedness.\" Gehazi was stricken with\nleprosy, 2 Reg. v. 27. Jehoram with dysentery and flux, and great diseases\nof the bowels, 2 Chron. xxi. 15. David plagued for numbering his people, 1\nPar. 21. Sodom and Gomorrah swallowed up. And this disease is peculiarly\nspecified, Psalm cxxvii. 12. \"He brought down their heart through\nheaviness.\" Deut. xxviii. 28. \"He struck them with madness, blindness, and\nastonishment of heart.\" [1100]\"An evil spirit was sent by the Lord upon\nSaul, to vex him.\" [1101]Nebuchadnezzar did eat grass like an ox, and his\n\"heart was made like the beasts of the field.\" Heathen stories are full of\nsuch punishments. Lycurgus, because he cut down the vines in the country,\nwas by Bacchus driven into madness: so was Pentheus and his mother Agave\nfor neglecting their sacrifice. [1102]Censor Fulvius ran mad for untiling\nJuno's temple, to cover a new one of his own, which he had dedicated to\nFortune, [1103]\"and was confounded to death with grief and sorrow of\nheart.\" When Xerxes would have spoiled [1104]Apollo's temple at Delphos of\nthose infinite riches it possessed, a terrible thunder came from heaven and\nstruck four thousand men dead, the rest ran mad. [1105]A little after, the\nlike happened to Brennus, lightning, thunder, earthquakes, upon such a\nsacrilegious occasion. If we may believe our pontifical writers, they will\nrelate unto us many strange and prodigious punishments in this kind,\ninflicted by their saints. How [1106]Clodoveus, sometime king of France,\nthe son of Dagobert, lost his wits for uncovering the body of St. Denis:\nand how a [1107]sacrilegious Frenchman, that would have stolen a silver\nimage of St. John, at Birgburge, became frantic on a sudden, raging, and\ntyrannising over his own flesh: of a [1108]Lord of Rhadnor, that coming\nfrom hunting late at night, put his dogs into St. Avan's church, (Llan Avan\nthey called it) and rising betimes next morning, as hunters use to do,\nfound all his dogs mad, himself being suddenly strucken blind. Of Tyridates\nan [1109]Armenian king, for violating some holy nuns, that was punished in\nlike sort, with loss of his wits. But poets and papists may go together for\nfabulous tales; let them free their own credits: howsoever they feign of\ntheir Nemesis, and of their saints, or by the devil's means may be deluded;\nwe find it true, that _ultor a tergo Deus_, [1110]\"He is God the avenger,\"\nas David styles him; and that it is our crying sins that pull this and many\nother maladies on our own heads. That he can by his angels, which are his\nministers, strike and heal (saith [1111]Dionysius) whom he will; that he\ncan plague us by his creatures, sun, moon, and stars, which he useth as his\ninstruments, as a husbandman (saith Zanchius) doth a hatchet: hail, snow,\nwinds, &c. [1112]_Et conjurati veniunt in classica venti_: as in Joshua's\ntime, as in Pharaoh's reign in Egypt; they are but as so many executioners\nof his justice. He can make the proudest spirits stoop, and cry out with\nJulian the Apostate, _Vicisti Galilaee_: or with Apollo's priest in\n[1113]Chrysostom, _O coelum! o terra! unde hostis hic_? What an enemy is\nthis? And pray with David, acknowledging his power, \"I am weakened and sore\nbroken, I roar for the grief of mine heart, mine heart panteth,\" &c. Psalm\nxxxviii. 8. \"O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in\nthy wrath,\" Psalm xxxviii. 1. \"Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the\nbones which thou hast broken, may rejoice,\" Psalm li. 8. and verse 12.\n\"Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and stablish me with thy free\nspirit.\" For these causes belike [1114]Hippocrates would have a physician\ntake special notice whether the disease come not from a divine supernatural\ncause, or whether it follow the course of nature. But this is farther\ndiscussed by Fran. Valesius, _de sacr. philos. cap. 8._ [1115] Fernelius,\nand [1116]J. Caesar Claudinus, to whom I refer you, how this place of\nHippocrates is to be understood. Paracelsus is of opinion, that such\nspiritual diseases (for so he calls them) are spiritually to be cured, and\nnot otherwise. Ordinary means in such cases will not avail: _Non est\nreluctandum cum Deo_ (we must not struggle with God.) When that\nmonster-taming Hercules overcame all in the Olympics, Jupiter at last in an\nunknown shape wrestled with him; the victory was uncertain, till at length\nJupiter descried himself, and Hercules yielded. No striving with supreme\npowers. _Nil juvat immensos Cratero promittere montes_, physicians and\nphysic can do no good, [1117]\"we must submit ourselves unto the mighty hand\nof God,\" acknowledge our offences, call to him for mercy. If he strike us\n_una eademque manus vulnus opemque feret_, as it is with them that are\nwounded with the spear of Achilles, he alone must help; otherwise our\ndiseases are incurable, and we not to be relieved.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_A Digression of the nature of Spirits, bad Angels, or\nDevils, and how they cause Melancholy_.\n\nHow far the power of spirits and devils doth extend, and whether they can\ncause this, or any other disease, is a serious question, and worthy to be\nconsidered: for the better understanding of which, I will make a brief\ndigression of the nature of spirits. And although the question be very\nobscure, according to [1118]Postellus, \"full of controversy and ambiguity,\"\nbeyond the reach of human capacity, _fateor excedere vires intentionis\nmeae_, saith [1119]Austin, I confess I am not able to understand it,\n_finitum de infinito non potest statuere_, we can sooner determine with\nTully, _de nat. deorum_, _quid non sint, quam quid sint_, our subtle\nschoolmen, Cardans, Scaligers, profound Thomists, Fracastoriana and\nFerneliana _acies_, are weak, dry, obscure, defective in these mysteries,\nand all our quickest wits, as an owl's eyes at the sun's light, wax dull,\nand are not sufficient to apprehend them; yet, as in the rest, I will\nadventure to say something to this point. In former times, as we read, Acts\nxxiii., the Sadducees denied that there were any such spirits, devils, or\nangels. So did Galen the physician, the Peripatetics, even Aristotle\nhimself, as Pomponatius stoutly maintains, and Scaliger in some sort\ngrants. Though Dandinus the Jesuit, _com. in lib. 2. de anima_, stiffly\ndenies it; _substantiae separatae_ and intelligences, are the same which\nChristians call angels, and Platonists devils, for they name all the\nspirits, _daemones_, be they good or bad angels, as Julius Pollux\n_Onomasticon, lib. 1. cap. 1._ observes. Epicures and atheists are of the\nsame mind in general, because they never saw them. Plato, Plotinus,\nPorphyrius, Jamblichus, Proclus, insisting in the steps of Trismegistus,\nPythagoras and Socrates, make no doubt of it: nor Stoics, but that there\nare such spirits, though much erring from the truth. Concerning the first\nbeginning of them, the [1120]Talmudists say that Adam had a wife called\nLilis, before he married Eve, and of her he begat nothing but devils. The\nTurks' [1121]Alcoran is altogether as absurd and ridiculous in this point:\nbut the Scripture informs us Christians, how Lucifer, the chief of them,\nwith his associates, [1122]fell from heaven for his pride and ambition;\ncreated of God, placed in heaven, and sometimes an angel of light, now cast\ndown into the lower aerial sublunary parts, or into hell, \"and delivered\ninto chains of darkness (2 Pet. ii. 4.) to be kept unto damnation.\"\n\n_Nature of Devils._] There is a foolish opinion which some hold, that they\nare the souls of men departed, good and more noble were deified, the baser\ngrovelled on the ground, or in the lower parts, and were devils, the which\nwith Tertullian, Porphyrius the philosopher, M. Tyrius, _ser. 27_\nmaintains. \"These spirits,\" he [1123]saith, \"which we call angels and\ndevils, are nought but souls of men departed, which either through love and\npity of their friends yet living, help and assist them, or else persecute\ntheir enemies, whom they hated,\" as Dido threatened to persecute Aeneas:\n\n       \"Omnibus umbra locis adero: dabis improbe poenas.\"\n\n       \"My angry ghost arising from the deep,\n        Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep;\n        At least my shade thy punishment shall know,\n        And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.\"\n\nThey are (as others suppose) appointed by those higher powers to keep men\nfrom their nativity, and to protect or punish them as they see cause: and\nare called _boni et mali Genii_ by the Romans. Heroes, lares, if good,\nlemures or larvae if bad, by the stoics, governors of countries, men,\ncities, saith [1124]Apuleius, _Deos appellant qui ex hominum numero juste\nac prudenter vitae curriculo gubernato, pro numine, postea ab hominibus\npraediti fanis et ceremoniis vulgo admittuntur, ut in Aegypto Osyris_, &c.\n_Praestites_, Capella calls them, \"which protected particular men as well\nas princes,\" Socrates had his _Daemonium Saturninum et ignium_, which of\nall spirits is best, _ad sublimes cogitationes animum erigentem_, as the\nPlatonists supposed; Plotinus his, and we Christians our assisting angel,\nas Andreas Victorellus, a copious writer of this subject, Lodovicus de\nLa-Cerda, the Jesuit, in his voluminous tract _de Angelo Custode_,\nZanchius, and some divines think. But this absurd tenet of Tyreus, Proclus\nconfutes at large in his book _de Anima et daemone_.\n\nPsellus [1125], a Christian, and sometimes tutor (saith Cuspinian) to\nMichael Parapinatius, Emperor of Greece, a great observer of the nature of\ndevils, holds they are corporeal [1126], and have \"aerial bodies, that they\nare mortal, live and die,\" (which Martianus Capella likewise maintains, but\nour Christian philosophers explode) \"that they [1127]are nourished and have\nexcrements, they feel pain if they be hurt\" (which Cardan confirms, and\nScaliger justly laughs him to scorn for; _Si pascantur aere, cur non\npugnant ob puriorem aera_? &c.) \"or stroken:\" and if their bodies be cut,\nwith admirable celerity they come together again. Austin, _in Gen. lib.\niii. lib. arbit._, approves as much, _mutata casu corpora in deteriorem\nqualitatem aeris spissioris_, so doth Hierome. _Comment. in epist. ad\nEphes. cap. 3_, Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius, and many ancient Fathers of\nthe Church: that in their fall their bodies were changed into a more aerial\nand gross substance. Bodine, _lib. 4, Theatri Naturae_ and David Crusius,\n_Hermeticae Philosophiae, lib. 1. cap. 4_, by several arguments proves\nangels and spirits to be corporeal: _quicquid continetur in loco corporeum\nest; At spiritus continetur in loco, ergo. [1128]Si spiritus sunt quanti,\nerunt corporei: At sunt quanti, ergo. sunt finiti, ergo. quanti_, &c.\nBodine [1129]goes farther yet, and will have these, _Animae separatae\ngenii_, spirits, angels, devils, and so likewise souls of men departed, if\ncorporeal (which he most eagerly contends) to be of some shape, and that\nabsolutely round, like Sun and Moon, because that is the most perfect form,\n_quae nihil habet asperitatis, nihil angulis incisum, nihil anfractibus\ninvolutem, nihil eminens, sed inter corpora perfecta est perfectissimum_;\n[1130]therefore all spirits are corporeal he concludes, and in their proper\nshapes round. That they can assume other aerial bodies, all manner of\nshapes at their pleasures, appear in what likeness they will themselves,\nthat they are most swift in motion, can pass many miles in an instant, and\nso likewise [1131]transform bodies of others into what shape they please,\nand with admirable celerity remove them from place to place; (as the Angel\ndid Habakkuk to Daniel, and as Philip the deacon was carried away by the\nSpirit, when he had baptised the eunuch; so did Pythagoras and Apollonius\nremove themselves and others, with many such feats) that they can represent\ncastles in the air, palaces, armies, spectrums, prodigies, and such strange\nobjects to mortal men's eyes, [1132]cause smells, savours, &c., deceive all\nthe senses; most writers of this subject credibly believe; and that they\ncan foretell future events, and do many strange miracles. Juno's image\nspake to Camillus, and Fortune's statue to the Roman matrons, with many\nsuch. Zanchius, Bodine, Spondanus, and others, are of opinion that they\ncause a true metamorphosis, as Nebuchadnezzar was really translated into a\nbeast, Lot's wife into a pillar of salt; Ulysses' companions into hogs and\ndogs, by Circe's charms; turn themselves and others, as they do witches\ninto cats, dogs, hares, crows, &c. Strozzius Cicogna hath many examples,\n_lib. iii. omnif. mag. cap. 4 and 5_, which he there confutes, as Austin\nlikewise doth, _de civ. Dei lib. xviii_. That they can be seen when and in\nwhat shape, and to whom they will, saith Psellus, _Tametsi nil tale\nviderim, nec optem videre_, though he himself never saw them nor desired\nit; and use sometimes carnal copulation (as elsewhere I shall [1133]prove\nmore at large) with women and men. Many will not believe they can be seen,\nand if any man shall say, swear, and stiffly maintain, though he be\ndiscreet and wise, judicious and learned, that he hath seen them, they\naccount him a timorous fool, a melancholy dizzard, a weak fellow, a\ndreamer, a sick or a mad man, they contemn him, laugh him to scorn, and yet\nMarcus of his credit told Psellus that he had often seen them. And Leo\nSuavius, a Frenchman, _c. 8, in Commentar. l. 1. Paracelsi de vita longa_,\nout of some Platonists, will have the air to be as full of them as snow\nfalling in the skies, and that they may be seen, and withal sets down the\nmeans how men may see them; _Si irreverberatus oculis sole splendente\nversus caelum continuaverint obtutus_, &c., [1134]and saith moreover he\ntried it, _praemissorum feci experimentum_, and it was true, that the\nPlatonists said. Paracelsus confesseth that he saw them divers times, and\nconferred with them, and so doth Alexander ab [1135]Alexandro, \"that he so\nfound it by experience, when as before he doubted of it.\" Many deny it,\nsaith Lavater, _de spectris, part 1. c. 2_, and _part 2. c. 11_, \"because\nthey never saw them themselves;\" but as he reports at large all over his\nbook, especially _c. 19. part 1_, they are often seen and heard, and\nfamiliarly converse with men, as Lod. Vives assureth us, innumerable\nrecords, histories, and testimonies evince in all ages, times, places, and\n[1136]all travellers besides; in the West Indies and our northern climes,\n_Nihil familiarius quam in agris et urbibus spiritus videre, audire qui\nvetent, jubeant_, &c. Hieronymus _vita Pauli_, Basil _ser. 40_, Nicephorus,\nEusebius, Socrates, Sozomenus, [1137]Jacobus Boissardus in his tract _de\nspirituum apparitionibus_, Petrus Loyerus _l. de spectris_, Wierus _l. 1._\nhave infinite variety of such examples of apparitions of spirits, for him\nto read that farther doubts, to his ample satisfaction. One alone I will\nbriefly insert. A nobleman in Germany was sent ambassador to the King of\nSweden (for his name, the time, and such circumstances, I refer you to\nBoissardus, mine [1138]Author). After he had done his business, he sailed\nto Livonia, on set purpose to see those familiar spirits, which are there\nsaid to be conversant with men, and do their drudgery works. Amongst other\nmatters, one of them told him where his wife was, in what room, in what\nclothes, what doing, and brought him a ring from her, which at his return,\n_non sine omnium admiratione_, he found to be true; and so believed that\never after, which before he doubted of. Cardan, _l. 19. de subtil_, relates\nof his father, Facius Cardan, that after the accustomed solemnities, _An._\n1491, 13 August, he conjured up seven devils, in Greek apparel, about forty\nyears of age, some ruddy of complexion, and some pale, as he thought; he\nasked them many questions, and they made ready answer, that they were\naerial devils, that they lived and died as men did, save that they were far\nlonger lived (700 or 800 [1139]years); they did as much excel men in\ndignity as we do juments, and were as far excelled again of those that were\nabove them; our [1140]governors and keepers they are moreover, which\n[1141]Plato in Critias delivered of old, and subordinate to one another,\n_Ut enim homo homini sic daemon daemoni dominatur_, they rule themselves as\nwell as us, and the spirits of the meaner sort had commonly such offices,\nas we make horse-keepers, neat-herds, and the basest of us, overseers of\nour cattle; and that we can no more apprehend their natures and functions,\nthan a horse a man's. They knew all things, but might not reveal them to\nmen; and ruled and domineered over us, as we do over our horses; the best\nkings amongst us, and the most generous spirits, were not comparable to the\nbasest of them. Sometimes they did instruct men, and communicate their\nskill, reward and cherish, and sometimes, again, terrify and punish, to\nkeep them in awe, as they thought fit, _Nihil magis cupientes_ (saith\nLysius, _Phis. Stoicorum_) _quam adorationem hominum_. [1142]The same\nAuthor, Cardan, in his _Hyperchen_, out of the doctrine of Stoics, will\nhave some of these _genii_ (for so he calls them) to be [1143]desirous of\nmen's company, very affable and familiar with them, as dogs are; others,\nagain, to abhor as serpents, and care not for them. The same belike\nTritemius calls _Ignios et sublunares, qui nunquam demergunt ad inferiora,\naut vix ullum habent in terris commercium_: [1144]\"Generally they far excel\nmen in worth, as a man the meanest worm; though some of them are inferior\nto those of their own rank in worth, as the blackguard in a prince's court,\nand to men again, as some degenerate, base, rational creatures, are\nexcelled of brute beasts.\"\n\nThat they are mortal, besides these testimonies of Cardan, Martianus, &c.,\nmany other divines and philosophers hold, _post prolixum tempus moriuntur\nomnes_; The [1145]Platonists, and some Rabbins, Porphyrius and Plutarch, as\nappears by that relation of Thamus: [1146]\"The great God Pan is dead;\nApollo Pythius ceased; and so the rest.\" St. Hierome, in the life of Paul\nthe Hermit, tells a story how one of them appeared to St. Anthony in the\nwilderness, and told him as much. [1147]Paracelsus of our late writers\nstiffly maintains that they are mortal, live and die as other creatures do.\nZozimus, _l. 2_, farther adds, that religion and policy dies and alters\nwith them. The [1148]Gentiles' gods, he saith, were expelled by\nConstantine, and together with them. _Imperii Romani majestas, et fortuna\ninteriit, et profligata est_; The fortune and majesty of the Roman Empire\ndecayed and vanished, as that heathen in [1149]Minutius formerly bragged,\nwhen the Jews were overcome by the Romans, the Jew's God was likewise\ncaptivated by that of Rome; and Rabsakeh to the Israelites, no God should\ndeliver them out of the hands of the Assyrians. But these paradoxes of\ntheir power, corporeity, mortality, taking of shapes, transposing bodies,\nand carnal copulations, are sufficiently confuted by Zanch. _c. 10, l. 4._\nPererius in his comment, and Tostatus questions on the 6th of Gen. Th.\nAquin., St. Austin, Wierus, Th. Erastus, Delrio, _tom. 2, l. 2, quaest.\n29_; Sebastian Michaelis, _c. 2, de spiritibus_, D. Reinolds _Lect. 47._\nThey may deceive the eyes of men, yet not take true bodies, or make a real\nmetamorphosis; but as Cicogna proves at large, they are [1150]_Illusoriae,\net praestigiatrices transformationes_, _omnif. mag. lib. 4. cap. 4_, mere\nillusions and cozenings, like that tale of _Pasetis obulus_ in Suidas, or\nthat of Autolicus, Mercury's son, that dwelt in Parnassus, who got so much\ntreasure by cozenage and stealth. His father Mercury, because he could\nleave him no wealth, taught him many fine tricks to get means, [1151]for he\ncould drive away men's cattle, and if any pursued him, turn them into what\nshapes he would, and so did mightily enrich himself, _hoc astu maximam\npraedam est adsecutus_. This, no doubt, is as true as the rest; yet thus\nmuch in general. Thomas, Durand, and others, grant that they have\nunderstanding far beyond men, can probably conjecture and [1152]foretell\nmany things; they can cause and cure most diseases, deceive our senses;\nthey have excellent skill in all Arts and Sciences; and that the most\nilliterate devil is _Quovis homine scientior_ (more knowing than any man),\nas [1153]Cicogna maintains out of others. They know the virtues of herbs,\nplants, stones, minerals, &c.; of all creatures, birds, beasts, the four\nelements, stars, planets, can aptly apply and make use of them as they see\ngood; perceiving the causes of all meteors, and the like: _Dant se\ncoloribus_ (as [1154] Austin hath it) _accommodant se figuris, adhaerent\nsonis, subjiciunt se odoribus, infundunt se saporibus, omnes sensus etiam\nipsam intelligentiam daemones fallunt_, they deceive all our senses, even\nour understanding itself at once. [1155]They can produce miraculous\nalterations in the air, and most wonderful effects, conquer armies, give\nvictories, help, further, hurt, cross and alter human attempts and projects\n(_Dei permissu_) as they see good themselves. [1156]When Charles the Great\nintended to make a channel betwixt the Rhine and the Danube, look what his\nworkmen did in the day, these spirits flung down in the night, _Ut conatu\nRex desisteret, pervicere_. Such feats can they do. But that which Bodine,\n_l. 4, Theat. nat._ thinks (following Tyrius belike, and the Platonists,)\nthey can tell the secrets of a man's heart, _aut cogitationes hominum_, is\nmost false; his reasons are weak, and sufficiently confuted by Zanch. _lib.\n4, cap. 9._ Hierom. _lib. 2, com. in Mat. ad cap. 15_, Athanasius _quaest.\n27, ad Antiochum Principem_, and others.\n\n_Orders_.] As for those orders of good and bad devils, which the Platonists\nhold, is altogether erroneous, and those Ethnics _boni et mali Genii_, are\nto be exploded: these heathen writers agree not in this point among\nthemselves, as Dandinus notes, _An sint [1157]mali non conveniunt_, some\nwill have all spirits good or bad to us by a mistake, as if an Ox or Horse\ncould discourse, he would say the Butcher was his enemy because he killed\nhim, the grazier his friend because he fed him; a hunter preserves and yet\nkills his game, and is hated nevertheless of his game; _nec piscatorem\npiscis amare potest_, &c. But Jamblichus, Psellus, Plutarch, and most\nPlatonists acknowledge bad, _et ab eorum maleficiis cavendum_, and we\nshould beware of their wickedness, for they are enemies of mankind, and\nthis Plato learned in Egypt, that they quarrelled with Jupiter, and were\ndriven by him down to hell. [1158]That which [1159]Apuleius, Xenophon, and\nPlato contend of Socrates Daemonium, is most absurd: That which Plotinus of\nhis, that he had likewise _Deum pro Daemonio_; and that which Porphyry\nconcludes of them all in general, if they be neglected in their sacrifice\nthey are angry; nay more, as Cardan in his _Hipperchen_ will, they feed on\nmen's souls, _Elementa sunt plantis elementum, animalibus plantae,\nhominibus animalia, erunt et homines aliis, non autem diis, nimis enim\nremota est eorum natura a nostra, quapropter daemonibus_: and so belike\nthat we have so many battles fought in all ages, countries, is to make them\na feast, and their sole delight: but to return to that I said before, if\ndispleased they fret and chafe, (for they feed belike on the souls of\nbeasts, as we do on their bodies) and send many plagues amongst us; but if\npleased, then they do much good; is as vain as the rest and confuted by\nAustin, _l. 9. c. 8. de Civ. Dei_. Euseb. _l. 4. praepar. Evang. c. 6._ and\nothers. Yet thus much I find, that our schoolmen and other [1160]divines\nmake nine kinds of bad spirits, as Dionysius hath done of angels. In the\nfirst rank are those false gods of the gentiles, which were adored\nheretofore in several idols, and gave oracles at Delphos, and elsewhere;\nwhose prince is Beelzebub. The second rank is of liars and equivocators, as\nApollo, Pythius, and the like. The third are those vessels of anger,\ninventors of all mischief; as that Theutus in Plato; Esay calls them\n[1161]vessels of fury; their prince is Belial. The fourth are malicious\nrevenging devils; and their prince is Asmodaeus. The fifth kind are\ncozeners, such as belong to magicians and witches; their prince is Satan.\nThe sixth are those aerial devils that [1162]corrupt the air and cause\nplagues, thunders, fires, &c.; spoken of in the Apocalypse, and Paul to the\nEphesians names them the princes of the air; Meresin is their prince. The\nseventh is a destroyer, captain of the furies, causing wars, tumults,\ncombustions, uproars, mentioned in the Apocalypse; and called Abaddon. The\neighth is that accusing or calumniating devil, whom the Greeks call [Greek:\nDiabolos], that drives men to despair. The ninth are those tempters in\nseveral kinds, and their prince is Mammon. Psellus makes six kinds, yet\nnone above the Moon: Wierus in his _Pseudo-monarchia Daemonis_, out of an\nold book, makes many more divisions and subordinations, with their several\nnames, numbers, offices, &c., but Gazaeus cited by [1163]Lipsius will have\nall places full of angels, spirits, and devils, above and beneath the Moon,\n[1164]ethereal and aerial, which Austin cites out of Varro _l. 7. de Civ.\nDei, c. 6._ \"The celestial devils above, and aerial beneath,\" or, as some\nwill, gods above, Semi-dei or half gods beneath, Lares, Heroes, Genii,\nwhich climb higher, if they lived well, as the Stoics held; but grovel on\nthe ground as they were baser in their lives, nearer to the earth: and are\nManes, Lemures, Lamiae, &c. [1165]They will have no place but all full of\nspirits, devils, or some other inhabitants; _Plenum Caelum, aer, aqua\nterra, et omnia sub terra_, saith [1166]Gazaeus; though Anthony Rusca in\nhis book _de Inferno, lib. v. cap. 7._ would confine them to the middle\nregion, yet they will have them everywhere. \"Not so much as a hair-breadth\nempty in heaven, earth, or waters, above or under the earth.\" The air is\nnot so full of flies in summer, as it is at all times of invisible devils:\nthis [1167]Paracelsus stiffly maintains, and that they have every one their\nseveral chaos, others will have infinite worlds, and each world his\npeculiar spirits, gods, angels, and devils to govern and punish it.\n\n       \"Singula [1168]nonnulli credunt quoque sidera posse\n        Dici orbes, terramque appellant sidus opacum,\n        Cui minimus divum praesit.\"------\n\n       \"Some persons believe each star to be a world, and this earth an\n        opaque star, over which the least of the gods presides.\"\n\n[1169]Gregorius Tholsanus makes seven kinds of ethereal spirits or angels,\naccording to the number of the seven planets, Saturnine, Jovial, Martial,\nof which Cardan discourseth _lib. 20. de subtil._ he calls them\n_substantias primas, Olympicos daemones Tritemius, qui praesunt Zodiaco_,\n&c., and will have them to be good angels above, devils beneath the Moon,\ntheir several names and offices he there sets down, and which Dionysius of\nAngels, will have several spirits for several countries, men, offices, &c.,\nwhich live about them, and as so many assisting powers cause their\noperations, will have in a word, innumerable, as many of them as there be\nstars in the skies. [1170]Marcilius Ficinus seems to second this opinion,\nout of Plato, or from himself, I know not, (still ruling their inferiors,\nas they do those under them again, all subordinate, and the nearest to the\nearth rule us, whom we subdivide into good and bad angels, call gods or\ndevils, as they help or hurt us, and so adore, love or hate) but it is most\nlikely from Plato, for he relying wholly on Socrates, _quem mori potius\nquam mentiri voluisse scribit_, whom he says would rather die than tell a\nfalsehood, out of Socrates' authority alone, made nine kinds of them: which\nopinion belike Socrates took from Pythagoras, and he from Trismegistus, he\nfrom Zoroastes, first God, second idea, 3. Intelligences, 4. Arch-Angels,\n5. Angels, 6. Devils, 7. Heroes, 8. Principalities, 9. Princes: of which\nsome were absolutely good, as gods, some bad, some indifferent _inter deos\net homines_, as heroes and daemons, which ruled men, and were called genii,\nor as [1171]Proclus and Jamblichus will, the middle betwixt God and men.\nPrincipalities and princes, which commanded and swayed kings and countries;\nand had several places in the spheres perhaps, for as every sphere is\nhigher, so hath it more excellent inhabitants: which belike is that\nGalilaeus a Galileo and Kepler aims at in his nuncio Syderio, when he will\nhave [1172]Saturnine and Jovial inhabitants: and which Tycho Brahe doth in\nsome sort touch or insinuate in one of his epistles: but these things\n[1173]Zanchius justly explodes, _cap. 3. lib. 4._ P. Martyr, _in 4. Sam.\n28._\n\nSo that according to these men the number of ethereal spirits must needs be\ninfinite: for if that be true that some of our mathematicians say: if a\nstone could fall from the starry heaven, or eighth sphere, and should pass\nevery hour an hundred miles, it would be 65 years, or more, before it would\ncome to ground, by reason of the great distance of heaven from earth, which\ncontains as some say 170 millions 800 miles, besides those other heavens,\nwhether they be crystalline or watery which Maginus adds, which\nperadventure holds as much more, how many such spirits may it contain? And\nyet for all this [1174]Thomas Albertus, and most hold that there be far\nmore angels than devils.\n\n_Sublunary devils, and their kinds._] But be they more or less, _Quod supra\nnos nihil ad nos_ (what is beyond our comprehension does not concern us).\nHowsoever as Martianus foolishly supposeth, _Aetherii Daemones non curant\nres humanas_, they care not for us, do not attend our actions, or look for\nus, those ethereal spirits have other worlds to reign in belike or business\nto follow. We are only now to speak in brief of these sublunary spirits or\ndevils: for the rest, our divines determine that the devil had no power\nover stars, or heavens; [1175]_Carminibus coelo possunt deducere lunam_,\n&C., (by their charms (verses) they can seduce the moon from the heavens).\nThose are poetical fictions, and that they can [1176]_sistere aquam\nfluviis, et vertere sidera retro_, &c., (stop rivers and turn the stars\nbackward in their courses) as Canadia in Horace, 'tis all false. [1177]\nThey are confined until the day of judgment to this sublunary world, and\ncan work no farther than the four elements, and as God permits them.\nWherefore of these sublunary devils, though others divide them otherwise\naccording to their several places and offices, Psellus makes six kinds,\nfiery, aerial, terrestrial, watery, and subterranean devils, besides those\nfairies, satyrs, nymphs, &c.\n\nFiery spirits or devils are such as commonly work by blazing stars,\nfire-drakes, or _ignes fatui_; which lead men often _in flumina aut\npraecipitia_, saith Bodine, _lib. 2. Theat. Naturae, fol. 221._ _Quos\ninquit arcere si volunt viatores, clara voce Deum appellare aut pronam\nfacie terram contingente adorare oportet, et hoc amuletum majoribus nostris\nacceptum ferre debemus_, &c., (whom if travellers wish to keep off they\nmust pronounce the name of God with a clear voice, or adore him with their\nfaces in contact with the ground, &c.); likewise they counterfeit suns and\nmoons, stars oftentimes, and sit on ship masts: _In navigiorum summitatibus\nvisuntur_; and are called _dioscuri_, as Eusebius _l. contra Philosophos,\nc. xlviii_. informeth us, out of the authority of Zenophanes; or little\nclouds, _ad motum nescio quem volantes_; which never appear, saith Cardan,\nbut they signify some mischief or other to come unto men, though some again\nwill have them to pretend good, and victory to that side they come towards\nin sea fights, St. Elmo's fires they commonly call them, and they do likely\nappear after a sea storm; Radzivilius, the Polonian duke, calls this\napparition, _Sancti Germani sidus_; and saith moreover that he saw the same\nafter in a storm, as he was sailing, 1582, from Alexandria to Rhodes.\n[1178]Our stories are full of such apparitions in all kinds. Some think\nthey keep their residence in that Hecla, a mountain in Iceland, Aetna in\nSicily, Lipari, Vesuvius, &c. These devils were worshipped heretofore by\nthat superstitious Pyromanteia [1179]and the like.\n\nAerial spirits or devils, are such as keep quarter most part in the [1180]\nair, cause many tempests, thunder, and lightnings, tear oaks, fire\nsteeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain stones, as in Livy's\ntime, wool, frogs, &c. Counterfeit armies in the air, strange noises,\nswords, &c., as at Vienna before the coming of the Turks, and many times in\nRome, as Scheretzius _l. de spect. c. 1. part 1._ Lavater _de spect. part.\n1. c. 17._ Julius Obsequens, an old Roman, in his book of prodigies, _ab\nurb. cond._ 505. [1181]Machiavel hath illustrated by many examples, and\nJosephus, in his book _de bello Judaico_, before the destruction of\nJerusalem. All which Guil. Postellus, in his first book, _c. 7, de orbis\nconcordia_, useth as an effectual argument (as indeed it is) to persuade\nthem that will not believe there be spirits or devils. They cause\nwhirlwinds on a sudden, and tempestuous storms; which though our\nmeteorologists generally refer to natural causes, yet I am of Bodine's\nmind, _Theat. Nat. l. 2._ they are more often caused by those aerial\ndevils, in their several quarters; for _Tempestatibus se ingerunt_, saith\n[1182] Rich. Argentine; as when a desperate man makes away with himself,\nwhich by hanging or drowning they frequently do, as Kommanus observes, _de\nmirac. mort. part. 7, c. 76._ _tripudium agentes_, dancing and rejoicing at\nthe death of a sinner. These can corrupt the air, and cause plagues,\nsickness, storms, shipwrecks, fires, inundations. At Mons Draconis in\nItaly, there is a most memorable example in [1183]Jovianus Pontanus: and\nnothing so familiar (if we may believe those relations of Saxo Grammaticus,\nOlaus Magnus, Damianus A. Goes) as for witches and sorcerers, in Lapland,\nLithuania, and all over Scandia, to sell winds to mariners, and cause\ntempests, which Marcus Paulus the Venetian relates likewise of the Tartars.\nThese kind of devils are much [1184]delighted in sacrifices (saith\nPorphyry), held all the world in awe, and had several names, idols,\nsacrifices, in Rome, Greece, Egypt, and at this day tyrannise over, and\ndeceive those Ethnics and Indians, being adored and worshipped for [1185]\ngods. For the Gentiles' gods were devils (as [1186]Trismegistus confesseth\nin his Asclepius), and he himself could make them come to their images by\nmagic spells: and are now as much \"respected by our papists\" (saith [1187]\nPictorius) \"under the name of saints.\" These are they which Cardan thinks\ndesire so much carnal copulation with witches (Incubi and Succubi),\ntransform bodies, and are so very cold, if they be touched; and that serve\nmagicians. His father had one of them (as he is not ashamed to relate),\n[1188]an aerial devil, bound to him for twenty and eight years. As\nAgrippa's dog had a devil tied to his collar; some think that Paracelsus\n(or else Erastus belies him) had one confined to his sword pummel; others\nwear them in rings, &c. Jannes and Jambres did many things of old by their\nhelp; Simon Magus, Cinops, Apollonius Tianeus, Jamblichus, and Tritemius of\nlate, that showed Maximilian the emperor his wife, after she was dead; _Et\nverrucam in collo ejus_ (saith [1189]Godolman) so much as the wart in her\nneck. Delrio, _lib. 2._ hath divers examples of their feats: Cicogna, _lib.\n3. cap. 3._ and Wierus in his book _de praestig. daemonum_. Boissardus _de\nmagis et veneficis_.\n\nWater-devils are those Naiads or water nymphs which have been heretofore\nconversant about waters and rivers. The water (as Paracelsus thinks) is\ntheir chaos, wherein they live; some call them fairies, and say that\nHabundia is their queen; these cause inundations, many times shipwrecks,\nand deceive men divers ways, as Succuba, or otherwise, appearing most part\n(saith Tritemius) in women's shapes. [1190]Paracelsus hath several stories\nof them that have lived and been married to mortal men, and so continued\nfor certain years with them, and after, upon some dislike, have forsaken\nthem. Such a one as Aegeria, with whom Numa was so familiar, Diana, Ceres,\n&c. [1191]Olaus Magnus hath a long narration of one Hotherus, a king of\nSweden, that having lost his company, as he was hunting one day, met with\nthese water nymphs or fairies, and was feasted by them; and Hector\nBoethius, or Macbeth, and Banquo, two Scottish lords, that as they were\nwandering in the woods, had their fortunes told them by three strange\nwomen. To these, heretofore, they did use to sacrifice, by that [Greek:\nhydromanteia], or divination by waters.\n\nTerrestrial devils are those [1192]Lares, genii, fauns, satyrs, [1193]\nwood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, Robin Goodfellows, trulli, &c., which as\nthey are most conversant with men, so they do them most harm. Some think it\nwas they alone that kept the heathen people in awe of old, and had so many\nidols and temples erected to them. Of this range was Dagon amongst the\nPhilistines, Bel amongst the Babylonians, Astartes amongst the Sidonians,\nBaal amongst the Samaritans, Isis and Osiris amongst the Egyptians, &c.;\nsome put our [1194]fairies into this rank, which have been in former times\nadored with much superstition, with sweeping their houses, and setting of a\npail of clean water, good victuals, and the like, and then they should not\nbe pinched, but find money in their shoes, and be fortunate in their\nenterprises. These are they that dance on heaths and greens, as [1195]\nLavater thinks with Tritemius, and as [1196]Olaus Magnus adds, leave that\ngreen circle, which we commonly find in plain fields, which others hold to\nproceed from a meteor falling, or some accidental rankness of the ground,\nso nature sports herself; they are sometimes seen by old women and\nchildren. Hierom. Pauli, in his description of the city of Bercino in\nSpain, relates how they have been familiarly seen near that town, about\nfountains and hills; _Nonnunquam_ (saith Tritemius) _in sua latibula\nmontium simpliciores homines ducant, stupenda mirantibus ostentes miracula,\nnolarum sonitus, spectacula_, &c. [1197]Giraldus Cambrensis gives instance\nin a monk of Wales that was so deluded. [1198]Paracelsus reckons up many\nplaces in Germany, where they do usually walk in little coats, some two\nfeet long. A bigger kind there is of them called with us hobgoblins, and\nRobin Goodfellows, that would in those superstitious times grind corn for a\nmess of milk, cut wood, or do any manner of drudgery work. They would mend\nold irons in those Aeolian isles of Lipari, in former ages, and have been\noften seen and heard. [1199]Tholosanus calls them _trullos_ and Getulos,\nand saith, that in his days they were common in many places of France.\nDithmarus Bleskenius, in his description of Iceland, reports for a\ncertainty, that almost in every family they have yet some such familiar\nspirits; and Felix Malleolus, in his book _de crudel. daemon._ affirms as\nmuch, that these trolli or telchines are very common in Norway, \"and [1200]\nseen to do drudgery work;\" to draw water, saith Wierus, _lib. 1. cap. 22_,\ndress meat, or any such thing. Another sort of these there are, which\nfrequent forlorn [1201]houses, which the Italians call foliots, most part\ninnoxious, [1202]Cardan holds; \"They will make strange noises in the night,\nhowl sometimes pitifully, and then laugh again, cause great flame and\nsudden lights, fling stones, rattle chains, shave men, open doors and shut\nthem, fling down platters, stools, chests, sometimes appear in the likeness\nof hares, crows, black dogs,\" &c. of which read [1203]Pet Thyraeus the\nJesuit, in his Tract, _de locis infestis, part. 1. et cap. 4_, who will\nhave them to be devils or the souls of damned men that seek revenge, or\nelse souls out of purgatory that seek ease; for such examples peruse [1204]\nSigismundus Scheretzius, _lib. de spectris, part 1. c. 1._ which he saith\nhe took out of Luther most part; there be many instances. [1205]Plinius\nSecundus remembers such a house at Athens, which Athenodorus the\nphilosopher hired, which no man durst inhabit for fear of devils. Austin,\n_de Civ. Dei. lib. 22, cap. 1._ relates as much of Hesperius the Tribune's\nhouse, at Zubeda, near their city of Hippos, vexed with evil spirits, to\nhis great hindrance, _Cum afflictione animalium et servorum suorum_. Many\nsuch instances are to be read in Niderius Formicar, _lib. 5. cap. xii. 3._\n&c. Whether I may call these Zim and Ochim, which Isaiah, cap. xiii. 21.\nspeaks of, I make a doubt. See more of these in the said Scheretz. _lib. 1.\nde spect. cap. 4._ he is full of examples. These kind of devils many times\nappear to men, and affright them out of their wits, sometimes walking at\n[1206]noonday, sometimes at nights, counterfeiting dead men's ghosts, as\nthat of Caligula, which (saith Suetonius) was seen to walk in Lavinia's\ngarden, where his body was buried, spirits haunted, and the house where he\ndied, [1207]_Nulla nox sine terrore transacta, donec incendio consumpta_;\nevery night this happened, there was no quietness, till the house was\nburned. About Hecla, in Iceland, ghosts commonly walk, _animas mortuorum\nsimulantes_, saith Joh. Anan, _lib. 3. de nat. daem._ Olaus. _lib. 2. cap.\n2._ Natal Tallopid. _lib. de apparit. spir._ Kornmannus _de mirac. mort.\npart. 1. cap. 44._ such sights are frequently seen _circa sepulchra et\nmonasteria_, saith Lavat. _lib. 1. cap. 19._ in monasteries and about\nchurchyards, _loca paludinosa, ampla aedificia, solitaria, et caede hominum\nnotata_, &c. (marshes, great buildings, solitary places, or remarkable as\nthe scene of some murder.) Thyreus adds, _ubi gravius peccatum est\ncommissum, impii, pauperum oppressores et nequiter insignes habitant_\n(where some very heinous crime was committed, there the impious and\ninfamous generally dwell). These spirits often foretell men's deaths by\nseveral signs, as knocking, groanings, &c. [1208]though Rich. Argentine,\n_c. 18. de praestigiis daemonum_, will ascribe these predictions to good\nangels, out of the authority of Ficinus and others; _prodigia in obitu\nprincipum saepius contingunt_, &c. (prodigies frequently occur at the\ndeaths of illustrious men), as in the Lateran church in [1209]Rome, the\npopes' deaths are foretold by Sylvester's tomb. Near Rupes Nova in Finland,\nin the kingdom of Sweden, there is a lake, in which, before the governor of\nthe castle dies, a spectrum, in the habit of Arion with his harp, appears,\nand makes excellent music, like those blocks in Cheshire, which (they say)\npresage death to the master of the family; or that [1210]oak in Lanthadran\npark in Cornwall, which foreshows as much. Many families in Europe are so\nput in mind of their last by such predictions, and many men are forewarned\n(if we may believe Paracelsus) by familiar spirits in divers shapes, as\ncocks, crows, owls, which often hover about sick men's chambers, _vel quia\nmorientium foeditatem sentiunt_, as [1211]Baracellus conjectures, _et ideo\nsuper tectum infirmorum crocitant_, because they smell a corse; or for that\n(as [1212]Bernardinus de Bustis thinketh) God permits the devil to appear\nin the form of crows, and such like creatures, to scare such as live\nwickedly here on earth. A little before Tully's death (saith Plutarch) the\ncrows made a mighty noise about him, _tumultuose perstrepentes_, they\npulled the pillow from under his head. Rob. Gaguinus, _hist. Franc. lib.\n8_, telleth such another wonderful story at the death of Johannes de\nMonteforti, a French lord, _anno_ 1345, _tanta corvorum multitudo aedibus\nmorientis insedit, quantam esse in Gallia nemo judicasset_ (a multitude of\ncrows alighted on the house of the dying man, such as no one imagined\nexisted in France). Such prodigies are very frequent in authors. See more\nof these in the said Lavater, Thyreus _de locis infestis, part 3, cap. 58._\nPictorius, Delrio, Cicogna, _lib. 3, cap. 9._ Necromancers take upon them\nto raise and lay them at their pleasures: and so likewise, those which\nMizaldus calls _ambulones_, that walk about midnight on great heaths and\ndesert places, which (saith [1213]Lavater) \"draw men out of the way, and\nlead them all night a byway, or quite bar them of their way;\" these have\nseveral names in several places; we commonly call them Pucks. In the\ndeserts of Lop, in Asia, such illusions of walking spirits are often\nperceived, as you may read in M. Paulus the Venetian his travels; if one\nlose his company by chance, these devils will call him by his name, and\ncounterfeit voices of his companions to seduce him. Hieronym. Pauli, in his\nbook of the hills of Spain, relates of a great [1214]mount in Cantabria,\nwhere such spectrums are to be seen; Lavater and Cicogna have variety of\nexamples of spirits and walking devils in this kind. Sometimes they sit by\nthe highway side, to give men falls, and make their horses stumble and\nstart as they ride (if you will believe the relation of that holy man\nKetellus in [1215]Nubrigensis), that had an especial grace to see devils,\n_Gratiam divinitus collatam_, and talk with them, _Et impavidus cum\nspiritibus sermonem miscere_, without offence, and if a man curse or spur\nhis horse for stumbling, they do heartily rejoice at it; with many such\npretty feats.\n\nSubterranean devils are as common as the rest, and do as much harm. Olaus\nMagnus, _lib. 6, cap. 19_, make six kinds of them; some bigger, some less.\nThese (saith [1216]Munster) are commonly seen about mines of metals, and\nare some of them noxious; some again do no harm. The metal-men in many\nplaces account it good luck, a sign of treasure and rich ore when they see\nthem. Georgius Agricola, in his book _de subterraneis animantibus, cap.\n37_, reckons two more notable kinds of them, which he calls [1217]_getuli_\nand _cobali_, both \"are clothed after the manner of metal-men, and will\nmany times imitate their works.\" Their office, as Pictorius and Paracelsus\nthink, is to keep treasure in the earth, that it be not all at once\nrevealed; and besides, [1218]Cicogna avers that they are the frequent\ncauses of those horrible earthquakes \"which often swallow up, not only\nhouses, but whole islands and cities;\" in his third book, _cap. 11_, he\ngives many instances.\n\nThe last are conversant about the centre of the earth to torture the souls\nof damned men to the day of judgment; their egress and regress some suppose\nto be about Etna, Lipari, Mons Hecla in Iceland, Vesuvius, Terra del Fuego,\n&c., because many shrieks and fearful cries are continually heard\nthereabouts, and familiar apparitions of dead men, ghosts and goblins.\n\n_Their Offices, Operations, Study_.] Thus the devil reigns, and in a\nthousand several shapes, \"as a roaring lion still seeks whom he may\ndevour,\" 1 Pet. v., by sea, land, air, as yet unconfined, though [1219]\nsome will have his proper place the air; all that space between us and the\nmoon for them that transgressed least, and hell for the wickedest of them,\n_Hic velut in carcere ad finem mundi, tunc in locum funestiorum trudendi_,\nas Austin holds _de Civit. Dei, c. 22, lib. 14, cap. 3 et 23_; but be where\nhe will, he rageth while he may to comfort himself, as [1220] Lactantius\nthinks, with other men's falls, he labours all he can to bring them into\nthe same pit of perdition with him. For [1221]\"men's miseries, calamities,\nand ruins are the devil's banqueting dishes.\" By many temptations and\nseveral engines, he seeks to captivate our souls. The Lord of Lies, saith\n[1222]Austin, \"as he was deceived himself, he seeks to deceive others,\" the\nringleader to all naughtiness, as he did by Eve and Cain, Sodom and\nGomorrah, so would he do by all the world. Sometimes he tempts by\ncovetousness, drunkenness, pleasure, pride, &c., errs, dejects, saves,\nkills, protects, and rides some men, as they do their horses. He studies\nour overthrow, and generally seeks our destruction; and although he pretend\nmany times human good, and vindicate himself for a god by curing of several\ndiseases, _aegris sanitatem, et caecis luminis usum restituendo_, as Austin\ndeclares, _lib. 10, de civit Dei, cap. 6_, as Apollo, Aesculapius, Isis, of\nold have done; divert plagues, assist them in wars, pretend their\nhappiness, yet _nihil his impurius, scelestius, nihil humano generi\ninfestius_, nothing so impure, nothing so pernicious, as may well appear by\ntheir tyrannical and bloody sacrifices of men to Saturn and Moloch, which\nare still in use among those barbarous Indians, their several deceits and\ncozenings to keep men in obedience, their false oracles, sacrifices, their\nsuperstitious impositions of fasts, penury, &c. Heresies, superstitious\nobservations of meats, times, &c., by which they [1223] crucify the souls\nof mortal men, as shall be showed in our Treatise of Religious Melancholy.\n_Modico adhuc tempore sinitur malignari_, as [1224] Bernard expresseth it,\nby God's permission he rageth a while, hereafter to be confined to hell and\ndarkness, \"which is prepared for him and his angels,\" Mat. xxv.\n\nHow far their power doth extend it is hard to determine; what the ancients\nheld of their effects, force and operations, I will briefly show you: Plato\nin Critias, and after him his followers, gave out that these spirits or\ndevils, \"were men's governors and keepers, our lords and masters, as we are\nof our cattle.\" [1225]\"They govern provinces and kingdoms by oracles,\nauguries,\" dreams, rewards and punishments, prophecies, inspirations,\nsacrifices, and religious superstitions, varied in as many forms as there\nbe diversity of spirits; they send wars, plagues, peace, sickness, health,\ndearth, plenty, [1226]_Adstantes hic jam nobis, spectantes, et\narbitrantes_, &c. as appears by those histories of Thucydides, Livius,\nDionysius Halicarnassus, with many others that are full of their wonderful\nstratagems, and were therefore by those Roman and Greek commonwealths\nadored and worshipped for gods with prayers and sacrifices, &c. [1227]In a\nword, _Nihil magis quaerunt quam metum et admirationem hominum_; [1228]and\nas another hath it, _Dici non potest, quam impotenti ardore in homines\ndominium, et Divinos cultus maligni spiritus affectent_. [1229]Tritemius in\nhis book _de septem secundis_, assigns names to such angels as are\ngovernors of particular provinces, by what authority I know not, and gives\nthem several jurisdictions. Asclepiades a Grecian, Rabbi Achiba the Jew,\nAbraham Avenezra, and Rabbi Azariel, Arabians, (as I find them cited by\n[1230]Cicogna) farther add, that they are not our governors only, _Sed ex\neorum concordia et discordia, boni et mali affectus promanant_, but as they\nagree, so do we and our princes, or disagree; stand or fall. Juno was a\nbitter enemy to Troy, Apollo a good friend, Jupiter indifferent, _Aequa\nVenus Teucris, Pallas iniqua fuit_; some are for us still, some against us,\n_Premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem_. Religion, policy, public and private\nquarrels, wars are procured by them, and they are [1231]delighted perhaps\nto see men fight, as men are with cocks, bulls and dogs, bears, &c.,\nplagues, dearths depend on them, our _bene_ and _male esse_, and almost all\nour other peculiar actions, (for as Anthony Rusea contends, _lib. 5, cap.\n18_, every man hath a good and a bad angel attending on him in particular,\nall his life long, which Jamblichus calls _daemonem_,) preferments, losses,\nweddings, deaths, rewards and punishments, and as [1232]Proclus will, all\noffices whatsoever, _alii genetricem, alii opificem potestatem habent_, &c.\nand several names they give them according to their offices, as Lares,\nIndegites, Praestites, &c. When the Arcades in that battle at Cheronae,\nwhich was fought against King Philip for the liberty of Greece, had\ndeceitfully carried themselves, long after, in the very same place, _Diis\nGraeciae, ultoribus_ (saith mine author) they were miserably slain by\nMetellus the Roman: so likewise, in smaller matters, they will have things\nfall out, as these _boni_ and _mali genii_ favour or dislike us: _Saturni\nnon conveniunt Jovialibus_, &c. He that is Saturninus shall never likely be\npreferred. [1233]That base fellows are often advanced, undeserving\nGnathoes, and vicious parasites, whereas discreet, wise, virtuous and\nworthy men are neglected and unrewarded; they refer to those domineering\nspirits, or subordinate Genii; as they are inclined, or favour men, so they\nthrive, are ruled and overcome; for as [1234]Libanius supposeth in our\nordinary conflicts and contentions, _Genius Genio cedit et obtemperat_, one\ngenius yields and is overcome by another. All particular events almost they\nrefer to these private spirits; and (as Paracelsus adds) they direct,\nteach, inspire, and instruct men. Never was any man extraordinary famous in\nany art, action, or great commander, that had not _familiarem daemonem_ to\ninform him, as Numa, Socrates, and many such, as Cardan illustrates, _cap.\n128_, _Arcanis prudentiae civilis_, [1235] _Speciali siquidem gratia, se a\nDeo donari asserunt magi, a Geniis caelestibus instrui, ab iis doceri_. But\nthese are most erroneous paradoxes, _ineptae et fabulosae nugae_, rejected\nby our divines and Christian churches. 'Tis true they have, by God's\npermission, power over us, and we find by experience, that they can\n[1236]hurt not our fields only, cattle, goods, but our bodies and minds. At\nHammel in Saxony, _An._ 1484. 20 _Junii_, the devil, in likeness of a pied\npiper, carried away 130 children that were never after seen. Many times men\nare [1237]affrighted out of their wits, carried away quite, as Scheretzius\nillustrates, _lib. 1, c. iv._, and severally molested by his means,\nPlotinus the Platonist, _lib. 14, advers. Gnos._ laughs them to scorn, that\nhold the devil or spirits can cause any such diseases. Many think he can\nwork upon the body, but not upon the mind. But experience pronounceth\notherwise, that he can work both upon body and mind. Tertullian is of this\nopinion, _c. 22._ [1238]\"That he can cause both sickness and health,\" and\nthat secretly. [1239]Taurellus adds \"by clancular poisons he can infect the\nbodies, and hinder the operations of the bowels, though we perceive it not,\nclosely creeping into them,\" saith [1240]Lipsius, and so crucify our souls:\n_Et nociva melancholia furiosos efficit_. For being a spiritual body, he\nstruggles with our spirits, saith Rogers, and suggests (according to\n[1241]Cardan, _verba sine voce, species sine visu_, envy, lust, anger, &c.)\nas he sees men inclined.\n\nThe manner how he performs it, Biarmannus in his Oration against Bodine,\nsufficiently declares. [1242]\"He begins first with the phantasy, and moves\nthat so strongly, that no reason is able to resist.\" Now the phantasy he\nmoves by mediation of humours; although many physicians are of opinion,\nthat the devil can alter the mind, and produce this disease of himself.\n_Quibusdam medicorum visum_, saith [1243]Avicenna, _quod Melancholia\ncontingat a daemonio_. Of the same mind is Psellus and Rhasis the Arab.\n_lib. 1. Tract. 9. Cont_. [1244]\"That this disease proceeds especially from\nthe devil, and from him alone.\" Arculanus, _cap. 6. in 9. Rhasis_, Aelianus\nMontaltus, in his _9. cap_. Daniel Sennertus, _lib. 1. part. 2. cap. 11._\nconfirm as much, that the devil can cause this disease; by reason many\ntimes that the parties affected prophesy, speak strange language, but _non\nsine interventu humoris_, not without the humour, as he interprets himself;\nno more doth Avicenna, _si contingat a daemonio, sufficit nobis ut\nconvertat complexionem ad choleram nigram, et sit causa ejus propinqua\ncholera nigra_; the immediate cause is choler adust, which [1245]\nPomponatius likewise labours to make good: Galgerandus of Mantua, a famous\nphysician, so cured a demoniacal woman in his time, that spake all\nlanguages, by purging black choler, and thereupon belike this humour of\nmelancholy is called _balneum diaboli_, the devil's bath; the devil spying\nhis opportunity of such humours drives them many times to despair, fury,\nrage, &c., mingling himself among these humours. This is that which\nTertullian avers, _Corporibus infligunt acerbos casus, animaeque\nrepentinos, membra distorquent, occulte repentes_, &c. and which Lemnius\ngoes about to prove, _Immiscent se mali Genii pravis humoribus, atque\natrae, bili_, &c. And [1246]Jason Pratensis, \"that the devil, being a\nslender incomprehensible spirit, can easily insinuate and wind himself into\nhuman bodies, and cunningly couched in our bowels vitiate our healths,\nterrify our souls with fearful dreams, and shake our minds with furies.\"\nAnd in another place, \"These unclean spirits settled in our bodies, and now\nmixed with our melancholy humours, do triumph as it were, and sport\nthemselves as in another heaven.\" Thus he argues, and that they go in and\nout of our bodies, as bees do in a hive, and so provoke and tempt us as\nthey perceive our temperature inclined of itself, and most apt to be\ndeluded. [1247] Agrippa and [1248]Lavater are persuaded, that this humour\ninvites the devil to it, wheresoever it is in extremity, and of all other,\nmelancholy persons are most subject to diabolical temptations and\nillusions, and most apt to entertain them, and the Devil best able to work\nupon them. But whether by obsession, or possession, or otherwise, I will\nnot determine; 'tis a difficult question. Delrio the Jesuit, _Tom. 3. lib.\n6._ Springer and his colleague, _mall. malef_. Pet. Thyreus the Jesuit,\n_lib. de daemoniacis, de locis infestis, de Terrificationibus nocturnis_,\nHieronymus Mengus _Flagel. daem_. and others of that rank of pontifical\nwriters, it seems, by their exorcisms and conjurations approve of it,\nhaving forged many stories to that purpose. A nun did eat a lettuce\n[1249]without grace, or signing it with the sign of the cross, and was\ninstantly possessed. Durand. _lib. 6. Rationall. c. 86. numb. 8._ relates\nthat he saw a wench possessed in Bononia with two devils, by eating an\nunhallowed pomegranate, as she did afterwards confess, when she was cured\nby exorcisms. And therefore our Papists do sign themselves so often with\nthe sign of the cross, _Ne daemon ingredi ausit_, and exorcise all manner\nof meats, as being unclean or accursed otherwise, as Bellarmine defends.\nMany such stories I find amongst pontifical writers, to prove their\nassertions, let them free their own credits; some few I will recite in this\nkind out of most approved physicians. Cornelius Gemma, _lib. 2. de nat.\nmirac. c. 4._ relates of a young maid, called Katherine Gualter, a cooper's\ndaughter, _an._ 1571. that had such strange passions and convulsions, three\nmen could not sometimes hold her; she purged a live eel, which he saw, a\nfoot and a half long, and touched it himself; but the eel afterwards\nvanished; she vomited some twenty-four pounds of fulsome stuff of all\ncolours, twice a day for fourteen days; and after that she voided great\nballs of hair, pieces of wood, pigeon's dung, parchment, goose dung, coals;\nand after them two pounds of pure blood, and then again coals and stones,\nor which some had inscriptions bigger than a walnut, some of them pieces of\nglass, brass, &c. besides paroxysms of laughing, weeping and ecstasies, &c.\n_Et hoc (inquit) cum horore vidi_, this I saw with horror. They could do no\ngood on her by physic, but left her to the clergy. Marcellus Donatus, _lib.\n2. c. 1. de med. mirab._ hath such another story of a country fellow, that\nhad four knives in his belly, _Instar serrae dentatos_, indented like a\nsaw, every one a span long, and a wreath of hair like a globe, with much\nbaggage of like sort, wonderful to behold: how it should come into his\nguts, he concludes, _Certe non alio quam daemonis astutia et dolo_, (could\nassuredly only have been through the artifice of the devil). Langius,\n_Epist. med. lib. 1. Epist. 38._ hath many relations to this effect, and so\nhath Christophorus a Vega: Wierus, Skenkius, Scribanius, all agree that\nthey are done by the subtlety and illusion of the devil. If you shall ask a\nreason of this, 'tis to exercise our patience; for as [1250]Tertullian\nholds, _Virtus non est virtus, nisi comparem habet aliquem, in quo\nsuperando vim suam ostendat_ 'tis to try us and our faith, 'tis for our\noffences, and for the punishment of our sins, by God's permission they do\nit, _Carnifices vindictae justae Dei_, as [1251]Tolosanus styles them,\nExecutioners of his will; or rather as David, Ps. 78. ver. 49. \"He cast\nupon them the fierceness of his anger, indignation, wrath, and vexation, by\nsending out of evil angels:\" so did he afflict Job, Saul, the Lunatics and\ndemoniacal persons whom Christ cured, Mat. iv. 8. Luke iv. 11. Luke xiii.\nMark ix. Tobit. viii. 3. &c. This, I say, happeneth for a punishment of\nsin, for their want of faith, incredulity, weakness, distrust, &c.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Of Witches and Magicians, how they cause Melancholy_.\n\nYou have heard what the devil can do of himself, now you shall hear what he\ncan perform by his instruments, who are many times worse (if it be\npossible) than he himself, and to satisfy their revenge and lust cause more\nmischief, _Multa enim mala non egisset daemon, nisi provocatus a sagis_, as\n[1252]Erastus thinks; much harm had never been done, had he not been\nprovoked by witches to it. He had not appeared in Samuel's shape, if the\nWitch of Endor had let him alone; or represented those serpents in\nPharaoh's presence, had not the magicians urged him unto it; _Nec morbos\nvel hominibus, vel brutis infligeret_ (Erastus maintains) _si sagae\nquiescerent_; men and cattle might go free, if the witches would let him\nalone. Many deny witches at all, or if there be any they can do no harm; of\nthis opinion is Wierus, _lib. 3. cap. 53. de praestig. daem_. Austin\nLerchemer a Dutch writer, Biarmanus, Ewichius, Euwaldus, our countryman\nScot; with him in Horace,\n\n       \"Somnia, terrores Magicos, miracula, sagas,\n        Nocturnos Lemures, portentaque Thessala risu\n        Excipiunt.\"------\n\n       \"Say, can you laugh indignant at the schemes\n        Of magic terrors, visionary dreams,\n        Portentous wonders, witching imps of Hell,\n        The nightly goblin, and enchanting spell?\"\n\nThey laugh at all such stories; but on the contrary are most lawyers,\ndivines, physicians, philosophers, Austin, Hemingius, Danaeus, Chytraeus,\nZanchius, Aretius, &c. Delrio, Springer, [1253]Niderius, _lib. 5._\nFornicar. Guiatius, Bartolus, _consil. 6. tom. 1. Bodine, daemoniant. lib\n2. cap. 8._ Godelman, Damhoderius, &c. Paracelsus, Erastus, Scribanius,\nCamerarius, &c. The parties by whom the devil deals, may be reduced to\nthese two, such as command him in show at least, as conjurors, and\nmagicians, whose detestable and horrid mysteries are contained in their\nbook called [1254]Arbatell; _daemonis enim advocati praesto sunt, seque\nexorcismis et conjurationibus quasi cogi patiuntur, ut miserum magorum\ngenus, in impietate detineant_. Or such as are commanded, as witches, that\ndeal _ex parte implicite_, or _explicite_, as the [1255]king hath well\ndefined; many subdivisions there are, and many several species of\nsorcerers, witches, enchanters, charmers, &c. They have been tolerated\nheretofore some of them; and magic hath been publicly professed in former\ntimes, in [1256]Salamanca, [1257]Krakow, and other places, though after\ncensured by several [1258]Universities, and now generally contradicted,\nthough practised by some still, maintained and excused, _Tanquam res\nsecreta quae non nisi viris magnis et peculiari beneficio de Coelo\ninstructis communicatur_ (I use [1259]Boesartus his words) and so far\napproved by some princes, _Ut nihil ausi aggredi in politicis, in sacris,\nin consiliis, sine eorum arbitrio_; they consult still with them, and dare\nindeed do nothing without their advice. Nero and Heliogabalus, Maxentius,\nand Julianus Apostata, were never so much addicted to magic of old, as some\nof our modern princes and popes themselves are nowadays. Erricus, King of\nSweden, had an [1260]enchanted cap, by virtue of which, and some magical\nmurmur or whispering terms, he could command spirits, trouble the air, and\nmake the wind stand which way he would, insomuch that when there was any\ngreat wind or storm, the common people were wont to say, the king now had\non his conjuring cap. But such examples are infinite. That which they can\ndo, is as much almost as the devil himself, who is still ready to satisfy\ntheir desires, to oblige them the more unto him. They can cause tempests,\nstorms, which is familiarly practised by witches in Norway, Iceland, as I\nhave proved. They can make friends enemies, and enemies friends by\nphilters; [1261]_Turpes amores conciliare_, enforce love, tell any man\nwhere his friends are, about what employed, though in the most remote\nplaces; and if they will, [1262]\"bring their sweethearts to them by night,\nupon a goat's back flying in the air.\" Sigismund Scheretzius, _part. 1.\ncap. 9. de spect._ reports confidently, that he conferred with sundry such,\nthat had been so carried many miles, and that he heard witches themselves\nconfess as much; hurt and infect men and beasts, vines, corn, cattle,\nplants, make women abortive, not to conceive, [1263]barren, men and women\nunapt and unable, married and unmarried, fifty several ways, saith Bodine,\n_lib. 2. c. 2._ fly in the air, meet when and where they will, as Cicogna\nproves, and Lavat. _de spec. part. 2. c. 17._ \"steal young children out of\ntheir cradles, _ministerio daemonum_, and put deformed in their rooms,\nwhich we call changelings,\" saith [1264]Scheretzius, _part. 1. c. 6._ make\nmen victorious, fortunate, eloquent; and therefore in those ancient\nmonomachies and combats they were searched of old, [1265]they had no\nmagical charms; they can make [1266]stick frees, such as shall endure a\nrapier's point, musket shot, and never be wounded: of which read more in\nBoissardus, _cap. 6. de Magia_, the manner of the adjuration, and by whom\n'tis made, where and how to be used _in expeditionibus bellicis, praeliis,\nduellis_, &c., with many peculiar instances and examples; they can walk in\nfiery furnaces, make men feel no pain on the rack, _aut alias torturas\nsentire_; they can stanch blood, [1267]represent dead men's shapes, alter\nand turn themselves and others into several forms, at their pleasures.\n[1268]Agaberta, a famous witch in Lapland, would do as much publicly to all\nspectators, _Modo Pusilla, modo anus, modo procera ut quercus, modo vacca,\navis, coluber_, &c. Now young, now old, high, low, like a cow, like a bird,\na snake, and what not? She could represent to others what forms they most\ndesired to see, show them friends absent, reveal secrets, _maxima omnium\nadmiratione_, &c. And yet for all this subtlety of theirs, as Lipsius well\nobserves, _Physiolog. Stoicor. lib. 1. cap. 17._ neither these magicians\nnor devils themselves can take away gold or letters out of mine or Crassus'\nchest, _et Clientelis suis largiri_, for they are base, poor, contemptible\nfellows most part; as [1269]Bodine notes, they can do nothing _in Judicum\ndecreta aut poenas, in regum concilia vel arcana, nihil in rem nummariam\naut thesauros_, they cannot give money to their clients, alter judges'\ndecrees, or councils of kings, these _minuti Genii_ cannot do it, _altiores\nGenii hoc sibi adservarunt_, the higher powers reserve these things to\nthemselves. Now and then peradventure there may be some more famous\nmagicians like Simon Magus, [1270]Apollonius Tyaneus, Pasetes, Jamblichus,\n[1271]Odo de Stellis, that for a time can build castles in the air,\nrepresent armies, &c., as they are [1272]said to have done, command wealth\nand treasure, feed thousands with all variety of meats upon a sudden,\nprotect themselves and their followers from all princes' persecutions, by\nremoving from place to place in an instant, reveal secrets, future events,\ntell what is done in far countries, make them appear that died long since,\nand do many such miracles, to the world's terror, admiration and opinion of\ndeity to themselves, yet the devil forsakes them at last, they come to\nwicked ends, and _raro aut nunquam_ such impostors are to be found. The\nvulgar sort of them can work no such feats. But to my purpose, they can,\nlast of all, cure and cause most diseases to such as they love or hate, and\nthis of [1273]melancholy amongst the rest. Paracelsus, _Tom. 4. de morbis\namentium, Tract. 1._ in express words affirms; _Multi fascinantur in\nmelancholiam_, many are bewitched into melancholy, out of his experience.\nThe same saith Danaeus, _lib. 3. de sortiariis_. _Vidi, inquit, qui\nMelancholicos morbos gravissimos induxerunt_: I have seen those that have\ncaused melancholy in the most grievous manner, [1274]dried up women's paps,\ncured gout, palsy; this and apoplexy, falling sickness, which no physic\ncould help, _solu tactu_, by touch alone. Ruland in his _3 Cent. Cura 91._\ngives an instance of one David Helde, a young man, who by eating cakes\nwhich a witch gave him, _mox delirare coepit_, began to dote on a sudden,\nand was instantly mad: F. H. D. in [1275]Hildesheim, consulted about a\nmelancholy man, thought his disease was partly magical, and partly natural,\nbecause he vomited pieces of iron and lead, and spake such languages as he\nhad never been taught; but such examples are common in Scribanius, Hercules\nde Saxonia, and others. The means by which they work are usually charms,\nimages, as that in Hector Boethius of King Duffe; characters stamped of\nsundry metals, and at such and such constellations, knots, amulets, words,\nphilters, &c., which generally make the parties affected, melancholy; as\n[1276]Monavius discourseth at large in an epistle of his to Acolsius,\ngiving instance in a Bohemian baron that was so troubled by a philter\ntaken. Not that there is any power at all in those spells, charms,\ncharacters, and barbarous words; but that the devil doth use such means to\ndelude them. _Ut fideles inde magos_ (saith [1277]Libanius) _in officio\nretineat, tum in consortium malefactorum vocet._\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Stars a cause. Signs from Physiognomy, Metoposcopy,\nChiromancy_.\n\nNatural causes are either primary and universal, or secondary and more\nparticular. Primary causes are the heavens, planets, stars, &c., by their\ninfluence (as our astrologers hold) producing this and such like effects. I\nwill not here stand to discuss _obiter_, whether stars be causes, or signs;\nor to apologise for judical astrology. If either Sextus Empericus, Picus\nMirandula, Sextus ab Heminga, Pererius, Erastus, Chambers, &c., have so far\nprevailed with any man, that he will attribute no virtue at all to the\nheavens, or to sun, or moon, more than he doth to their signs at an\ninnkeeper's post, or tradesman's shop, or generally condemn all such\nastrological aphorisms approved by experience: I refer him to Bellantius,\nPirovanus, Marascallerus, Goclenius, Sir Christopher Heidon, &c. If thou\nshalt ask me what I think, I must answer, _nam et doctis hisce erroribus\nversatus sum_, (for I am conversant with these learned errors,) they do\nincline, but not compel; no necessity at all: [1278]_agunt non cogunt_: and\nso gently incline, that a wise man may resist them; _sapiens dominabitur\nastris_: they rule us, but God rules them. All this (methinks) [1279]Joh.\nde Indagine hath comprised in brief, _Quaeris a me quantum in nobis\noperantur astra_? &c. \"Wilt thou know how far the stars work upon us? I say\nthey do but incline, and that so gently, that if we will be ruled by\nreason, they have no power over us; but if we follow our own nature, and be\nled by sense, they do as much in us as in brute beasts, and we are no\nbetter.\" So that, I hope, I may justly conclude with [1280]Cajetan, _Coelum\nest vehiculum divinae virtutis_, &c., that the heaven is God's instrument,\nby mediation of which he governs and disposeth these elementary bodies; or\na great book, whose letters are the stars, (as one calls it,) wherein are\nwritten many strange things for such as can read, [1281]\"or an excellent\nharp, made by an eminent workman, on which, he that can but play, will make\nmost admirable music.\" But to the purpose.\n\n[1282]Paracelsus is of opinion, \"that a physician without the knowledge of\nstars can neither understand the cause or cure of any disease, either of\nthis or gout, not so much as toothache; except he see the peculiar geniture\nand scheme of the party effected.\" And for this proper malady, he will have\nthe principal and primary cause of it proceed from the heaven, ascribing\nmore to stars than humours, [1283]\"and that the constellation alone many\ntimes produceth melancholy, all other causes set apart.\" He gives instance\nin lunatic persons, that are deprived of their wits by the moon's motion;\nand in another place refers all to the ascendant, and will have the true\nand chief cause of it to be sought from the stars. Neither is it his\nopinion only, but of many Galenists and philosophers, though they do not so\nperemptorily maintain as much. \"This variety of melancholy symptoms\nproceeds from the stars,\" saith [1284]Melancthon: the most generous\nmelancholy, as that of Augustus, comes from the conjunction of Saturn and\nJupiter in Libra: the bad, as that of Catiline's, from the meeting of\nSaturn and the moon in Scorpio. Jovianus Pontanus, in his tenth book, and\nthirteenth chapter _de rebus coelestibus_, discourseth to this purpose at\nlarge, _Ex atra bile varii generantur morbi_, &c., [1285]\"many diseases\nproceed from black choler, as it shall be hot or cold; and though it be\ncold in its own nature, yet it is apt to be heated, as water may be made to\nboil, and burn as bad as fire; or made cold as ice: and thence proceed such\nvariety of symptoms, some mad, some solitary, some laugh, some rage,\" &c.\nThe cause of all which intemperance he will have chiefly and primarily\nproceed from the heavens, [1286]\"from the position of Mars, Saturn, and\nMercury.\" His aphorisms be these, [1287]\"Mercury in any geniture, if he\nshall be found in Virgo, or Pisces his opposite sign, and that in the\nhoroscope, irradiated by those quartile aspects of Saturn or Mars, the\nchild shall be mad or melancholy.\" Again, [1288]\"He that shall have Saturn\nand Mars, the one culminating, the other in the fourth house, when he shall\nbe born, shall be melancholy, of which he shall be cured in time, if\nMercury behold them. [1289]If the moon be in conjunction or opposition at\nthe birth time with the sun, Saturn or Mars, or in a quartile aspect with\nthem,\" (_e malo coeli loco_, Leovitius adds,) \"many diseases are signified,\nespecially the head and brain is like to be misaffected with pernicious\nhumours, to be melancholy, lunatic, or mad,\" Cardan adds, _quarta luna\nnatos_, eclipses, earthquakes. Garcaeus and Leovitius will have the chief\njudgment to be taken from the lord of the geniture, or where there is an\naspect between the moon and Mercury, and neither behold the horoscope, or\nSaturn and Mars shall be lord of the present conjunction or opposition in\nSagittarius or Pisces, of the sun or moon, such persons are commonly\nepileptic, dote, demoniacal, melancholy: but see more of these aphorisms in\nthe above-named Pontanus. Garcaeus, _cap. 23. de Jud. genitur. Schoner.\nlib. 1. cap. 8_, which he hath gathered out of [1290]Ptolemy, Albubater,\nand some other Arabians, Junctine, Ranzovius, Lindhout, Origen, &c. But\nthese men you will reject peradventure, as astrologers, and therefore\npartial judges; then hear the testimony of physicians, Galenists\nthemselves. [1291]Carto confesseth the influence of stars to have a great\nhand to this peculiar disease, so doth Jason Pratensis, Lonicerius\n_praefat. de Apoplexia_, Ficinus, Fernelius, &c. [1292]P. Cnemander\nacknowledgeth the stars an universal cause, the particular from parents,\nand the use of the six non-natural things. Baptista Port. _mag. l. 1. c.\n10, 12, 15_, will have them causes to every particular _individium_.\nInstances and examples, to evince the truth of those aphorisms, are common\namongst those astrologian treatises. Cardan, in his thirty-seventh\ngeniture, gives instance in Matth. Bolognius. _Camerar. hor. natalit.\ncentur. 7. genit. 6. et 7._ of Daniel Gare, and others; but see Garcaeus,\n_cap. 33._ Luc. Gauricus, _Tract. 6. de Azemenis_, &c. The time of this\nmelancholy is, when the significators of any geniture are directed\naccording to art, as the hor: moon, hylech, &c. to the hostile beams or\nterms of [Symbol: Saturn] and [Symbol: Mars] especially, or any fixed star\nof their nature, or if [Symbol: Saturn] by his revolution or transitus,\nshall offend any of those radical promissors in the geniture.\n\nOther signs there are taken from physiognomy, metoposcopy, chiromancy,\nwhich because Joh. de Indagine, and Rotman, the landgrave of Hesse his\nmathematician, not long since in his Chiromancy; Baptista Porta, in his\ncelestial Physiognomy, have proved to hold great affinity with astrology,\nto satisfy the curious, I am the more willing to insert.\n\nThe general notions [1293]physiognomers give, be these; \"black colour\nargues natural melancholy; so doth leanness, hirsuteness, broad veins, much\nhair on the brows,\" saith [1294]Gratanarolus, _cap. 7_, and a little head,\nout of Aristotle, high sanguine, red colour, shows head melancholy; they\nthat stutter and are bald, will be soonest melancholy, (as Avicenna\nsupposeth,) by reason of the dryness of their brains; but he that will know\nmore of the several signs of humour and wits out of physiognomy, let him\nconsult with old Adamantus and Polemus, that comment, or rather paraphrase\nupon Aristotle's Physiognomy, Baptista Porta's four pleasant books, Michael\nScot _de secretis naturae_, John de Indagine, Montaltus, Antony Zara.\n_anat. ingeniorum, sect. 1. memb. 13. et lib. 4._\n\nChiromancy hath these aphorisms to foretell melancholy, Tasneir. _lib. 5.\ncap. 2_, who hath comprehended the sum of John de Indagine: Tricassus,\nCorvinus, and others in his book, thus hath it; [1295]\"The Saturnine line\ngoing from the rascetta through the hand, to Saturn's mount, and there\nintersected by certain little lines, argues melancholy; so if the vital and\nnatural make an acute angle, Aphorism 100. The saturnine, hepatic, and\nnatural lines, making a gross triangle in the hand, argue as much;\" which\nGoclenius, _cap. 5. Chiros._ repeats verbatim out of him. In general they\nconclude all, that if Saturn's mount be full of many small lines and\nintersections, [1296]\"such men are most part melancholy, miserable and full\nof disquietness, care and trouble, continually vexed with anxious and\nbitter thoughts, always sorrowful, fearful, suspicious; they delight in\nhusbandry, buildings, pools, marshes, springs, woods, walks,\" &c. Thaddaeus\nHaggesius, in his _Metoposcopia_, hath certain aphorisms derived from\nSaturn's lines in the forehead, by which he collects a melancholy\ndisposition; and [1297]Baptista Porta makes observations from those other\nparts of the body, as if a spot be over the spleen; [1298]\"or in the nails;\nif it appear black, it signifieth much care, grief, contention, and\nmelancholy;\" the reason he refers to the humours, and gives instance in\nhimself, that for seven years space he had such black spots in his nails,\nand all that while was in perpetual lawsuits, controversies for his\ninheritance, fear, loss of honour, banishment, grief, care, &c. and when\nhis miseries ended, the black spots vanished. Cardan, in his book _de\nlibris propriis_, tells such a story of his own person, that a little\nbefore his son's death, he had a black spot, which appeared in one of his\nnails; and dilated itself as he came nearer to his end. But I am over\ntedious in these toys, which howsoever, in some men's too severe censures,\nthey may be held absurd and ridiculous, I am the bolder to insert, as not\nborrowed from circumforanean rogues and gipsies, but out of the writings of\nworthy philosophers and physicians, yet living some of them, and religious\nprofessors in famous universities, who are able to patronise that which\nthey have said, and vindicate themselves from all cavillers and ignorant\npersons.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Old age a cause_.\n\nSecondary peculiar causes efficient, so called in respect of the other\nprecedent, are either _congenitae, internae, innatae_, as they term them,\ninward, innate, inbred; or else outward and adventitious, which happen to\nus after we are born: congenite or born with us, are either natural, as old\nage, or _praeter naturam_ (as [1299]Fernelius calls it) that\ndistemperature, which we have from our parent's seed, it being an\nhereditary disease. The first of these, which is natural to all, and which\nno man living can avoid, is [1300]old age, which being cold and dry, and of\nthe same quality as melancholy is, must needs cause it, by diminution of\nspirits and substance, and increasing of adust humours; therefore [1301]\nMelancthon avers out of Aristotle, as an undoubted truth, _Senes plerunque\ndelirasse in senecta_, that old men familiarly dote, _ob atram bilem_, for\nblack choler, which is then superabundant in them: and Rhasis, that Arabian\nphysician, in his _Cont. lib. 1. cap. 9_, calls it [1302]\"a necessary and\ninseparable accident,\" to all old and decrepit persons. After seventy years\n(as the Psalmist saith) [1303]\"all is trouble and sorrow;\" and common\nexperience confirms the truth of it in weak and old persons, especially\nsuch as have lived in action all their lives, had great employment, much\nbusiness, much command, and many servants to oversee, and leave off _ex\nabrupto_; as [1304]Charles the Fifth did to King Philip, resign up all on a\nsudden; they are overcome with melancholy in an instant: or if they do\ncontinue in such courses, they dote at last, (_senex bis puer_,) and are\nnot able to manage their estates through common infirmities incident in\ntheir age; full of ache, sorrow and grief, children again, dizzards, they\ncarl many times as they sit, and talk to themselves, they are angry,\nwaspish, displeased with every thing, \"suspicious of all, wayward,\ncovetous, hard\" (saith Tully,) \"self-willed, superstitious, self-conceited,\nbraggers and admirers of themselves,\" as [1305]Balthazar Castilio hath\ntruly noted of them. [1306]This natural infirmity is most eminent in old\nwomen, and such as are poor, solitary, live in most base esteem and\nbeggary, or such as are witches; insomuch that Wierus, Baptista Porta,\nUlricus Molitor, Edwicus, do refer all that witches are said to do, to\nimagination alone, and this humour of melancholy. And whereas it is\ncontroverted, whether they can bewitch cattle to death, ride in the air\nupon a cowl-staff out of a chimney-top, transform themselves into cats,\ndogs, &c., translate bodies from place to place, meet in companies, and\ndance, as they do, or have carnal copulation with the devil, they ascribe\nall to this redundant melancholy, which domineers in them, to [1307]\nsomniferous potions, and natural causes, the devil's policy. _Non laedunt\nomnino_ (saith Wierus) _aut quid mirum faciunt_, (_de Lamiis, lib. 3. cap.\n36_), _ut putatur, solam vitiatam habent phantasiam_; they do no such\nwonders at all, only their [1308]brains are crazed. [1309]\"They think they\nare witches, and can do hurt, but do not.\" But this opinion Bodine,\nErastus, Danaeus, Scribanius, Sebastian Michaelis, Campanella _de Sensu\nrerum, lib. 4. cap. 9._ [1310]Dandinus the Jesuit, _lib. 2. de Animae\nexplode_; [1311]Cicogna confutes at large. That witches are melancholy,\nthey deny not, but not out of corrupt phantasy alone, so to delude\nthemselves and others, or to produce such effects.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Parents a cause by Propagation_.\n\nThat other inward inbred cause of Melancholy is our temperature, in whole\nor part, which we receive from our parents, which [1312]Fernelius calls\n_Praeter naturam_, or unnatural, it being an hereditary disease; for as he\njustifies [1313]_Quale parentum maxime patris semen obtigerit, tales\nevadunt similares spermaticaeque paries, quocunque etiam morbo Pater quum\ngenerat tenetur, cum semine transfert, in Prolem_; such as the temperature\nof the father is, such is the son's, and look what disease the father had\nwhen he begot him, his son will have after him; [1314]\"and is as well\ninheritor of his infirmities, as of his lands. And where the complexion and\nconstitution of the father is corrupt, there ([1315]saith Roger Bacon) the\ncomplexion and constitution of the son must needs be corrupt, and so the\ncorruption is derived from the father to the son.\" Now this doth not so\nmuch appear in the composition of the body, according to that of\nHippocrates, [1316]\"in habit, proportion, scars, and other lineaments; but\nin manners and conditions of the mind,\" _Et patrum in natos abeunt cum\nsemine mores._\n\nSeleucus had an anchor on his thigh, so had his posterity, as Trogus\nrecords, _lib. 15._ Lepidus, in Pliny _l. 7. c. 17_, was purblind, so was\nhis son. That famous family of Aenobarbi were known of old, and so surnamed\nfrom their red beards; the Austrian lip, and those Indian flat noses are\npropagated, the Bavarian chin, and goggle eyes amongst the Jews, as [1317]\nBuxtorfius observes; their voice, pace, gesture, looks, are likewise\nderived with all the rest of their conditions and infirmities; such a\nmother, such a daughter; their very [1318]affections Lemnius contends \"to\nfollow their seed, and the malice and bad conditions of children are many\ntimes wholly to be imputed to their parents;\" I need not therefore make any\ndoubt of Melancholy, but that it is an hereditary disease. [1319]\nParacelsus in express words affirms it, _lib. de morb. amentium to. 4. tr.\n1_; so doth [1320]Crato in an Epistle of his to Monavius. So doth Bruno\nSeidelius in his book _de morbo incurab._ Montaltus proves, _cap. 11_, out\nof Hippocrates and Plutarch, that such hereditary dispositions are\nfrequent, _et hanc (inquit) fieri reor ob participatam melancholicam\nintemperantiam_ (speaking of a patient) I think he became so by\nparticipation of Melancholy. Daniel Sennertus, _lib. 1. part 2. cap. 9_,\nwill have his melancholy constitution derived not only from the father to\nthe son, but to the whole family sometimes; _Quandoque totis familiis\nhereditativam_, [1321]Forestus, in his medicinal observations, illustrates\nthis point, with an example of a merchant, his patient, that had this\ninfirmity by inheritance; so doth Rodericus a Fonseca, _tom. 1. consul.\n69_, by an instance of a young man that was so affected _ex matre\nmelancholica_, had a melancholy mother, _et victu melancholico_, and bad\ndiet together. Ludovicus Mercatus, a Spanish physician, in that excellent\nTract which he hath lately written of hereditary diseases, _tom. 2. oper.\nlib. 5_, reckons up leprosy, as those [1322]Galbots in Gascony, hereditary\nlepers, pox, stone, gout, epilepsy, &c. Amongst the rest, this and madness\nafter a set time comes to many, which he calls a miraculous thing in\nnature, and sticks for ever to them as an incurable habit. And that which\nis more to be wondered at, it skips in some families the father, and goes\nto the son, [1323]\"or takes every other, and sometimes every third in a\nlineal descent, and doth not always produce the same, but some like, and a\nsymbolizing disease.\" These secondary causes hence derived, are commonly so\npowerful, that (as [1324]Wolfius holds) _saepe mutant decreta siderum_,\nthey do often alter the primary causes, and decrees of the heavens. For\nthese reasons, belike, the Church and commonwealth, human and Divine laws,\nhave conspired to avoid hereditary diseases, forbidding such marriages as\nare any whit allied; and as Mercatus adviseth all families to take such,\n_si fieri possit quae maxime distant natura_, and to make choice of those\nthat are most differing in complexion from them; if they love their own,\nand respect the common good. And sure, I think, it hath been ordered by\nGod's especial providence, that in all ages there should be (as usually\nthere is) once in [1325]600 years, a transmigration of nations, to amend\nand purify their blood, as we alter seed upon our land, and that there\nshould be as it were an inundation of those northern Goths and Vandals, and\nmany such like people which came out of that continent of Scandia and\nSarmatia (as some suppose) and overran, as a deluge, most part of Europe\nand Africa, to alter for our good, our complexions, which were much defaced\nwith hereditary infirmities, which by our lust and intemperance we had\ncontracted. A sound generation of strong and able men were sent amongst us,\nas those northern men usually are, innocuous, free from riot, and free from\ndiseases; to qualify and make us as those poor naked Indians are generally\nat this day; and those about Brazil (as a late [1326]writer observes), in\nthe Isle of Maragnan, free from all hereditary diseases, or other\ncontagion, whereas without help of physic they live commonly 120 years or\nmore, as in the Orcades and many other places. Such are the common effects\nof temperance and intemperance, but I will descend to particular, and show\nby what means, and by whom especially, this infirmity is derived unto us.\n\n_Filii ex senibus nati, raro sunt firmi temperamenti_, old men's children\nare seldom of a good temperament, as Scoltzius supposeth, _consult. 177_,\nand therefore most apt to this disease; and as [1327]Levinus Lemnius\nfarther adds, old men beget most part wayward, peevish, sad, melancholy\nsons, and seldom merry. He that begets a child on a full stomach, will\neither have a sick child, or a crazed son (as [1328]Cardan thinks),\n_contradict. med. lib. 1. contradict. 18_, or if the parents be sick, or\nhave any great pain of the head, or megrim, headache, (Hieronymus Wolfius\n[1329]doth instance in a child of Sebastian Castalio's); if a drunken man\nget a child, it will never likely have a good brain, as Gellius argues,\n_lib. 12. cap. 1._ _Ebrii gignunt Ebrios_, one drunkard begets another,\nsaith [1330]Plutarch, _symp. lib. 1. quest. 5_, whose sentence\n[1331]Lemnius approves, _l. 1. c. 4._ Alsarius Crutius, _Gen. de qui sit\nmed. cent. 3. fol. 182._ Macrobius, _lib. 1._ Avicenna, _lib. 3. Fen. 21.\nTract 1. cap. 8_, and Aristotle himself, _sect. 2. prob. 4_, foolish,\ndrunken, or hair-brain women, most part bring forth children like unto\nthemselves, _morosos et languidos_, and so likewise he that lies with a\nmenstruous woman. _Intemperantia veneris, quam in nautis praesertim\ninsectatur [1332] Lemnius, qui uxores ineunt, nulla menstrui decursus\nratione habita nec observato interlunio, praecipua causa est, noxia,\npernitiosa, concubitum hunc exitialem ideo, et pestiferum vocat.\n[1333]Rodoricus a Castro Lucitanus, detestantur ad unum omnes medici, tum\net quarta luna concepti, infelices plerumque et amentes, deliri, stolidi,\nmorbosi, impuri, invalidi, tetra lue sordidi minime vitales, omnibus bonis\ncorporis atque animi destituti: ad laborem nati, si seniores, inquit\nEustathius, ut Hercules, et alii. [1334]Judaei maxime insectantur foedum\nhunc, et immundum apud Christianas Concubitum, ut illicitum abhorrent, et\napud suos prohibent; et quod Christiani toties leprosi, amentes, tot\nmorbili, impetigines, alphi, psorae, cutis et faciei decolorationes, tam\nmulti morbi epidemici, acerbi, et venenosi sint, in hunc immundum\nconcubitum rejiciunt, et crudeles in pignora vocant, qui quarta, luna\nprofluente hac mensium illuvie concubitum hunc non perhorrescunt. Damnavit\nolim divina Lex et morte mulctavit hujusmodi homines, Lev. 18, 20, et inde\nnati, siqui deformes aut mutili, pater dilapidatus, quod non contineret ab\n[1335] immunda muliere. Gregorius Magnus, petenti Augustino nunquid apud\n[1336]Britannos hujusmodi concubitum toleraret, severe prohibuit viris suis\ntum misceri foeminas in consuetis suis menstruis_, &c. I spare to English\nthis which I have said. Another cause some give, inordinate diet, as if a\nman eat garlic, onions, fast overmuch, study too hard, be over-sorrowful,\ndull, heavy, dejected in mind, perplexed in his thoughts, fearful, &c.,\n\"their children\" (saith [1337]Cardan _subtil. lib. 18_) \"will be much\nsubject to madness and melancholy; for if the spirits of the brain be\nfuzzled, or misaffected by such means, at such a time, their children will\nbe fuzzled in the brain: they will be dull, heavy, timorous, discontented\nall their lives.\" Some are of opinion, and maintain that paradox or\nproblem, that wise men beget commonly fools; Suidas gives instance in\nAristarchus the Grammarian, _duos reliquit Filios Aristarchum et\nAristachorum, ambos stultos_; and which [1338]Erasmus urgeth in his\n_Moria_, fools beget wise men. Card. _subt. l. 12_, gives this cause,\n_Quoniam spiritus sapientum ob studium resolvuntur, et in cerebrum feruntur\na corde_: because their natural spirits are resolved by study, and turned\ninto animal; drawn from the heart, and those other parts to the brain.\nLemnius subscribes to that of Cardan, and assigns this reason, _Quod\npersolvant debitum languide, et obscitanter, unde foetus a parentum\ngenerositate desciscit_: they pay their debt (as Paul calls it) to their\nwives remissly, by which means their children are weaklings, and many times\nidiots and fools.\n\nSome other causes are given, which properly pertain, and do proceed from\nthe mother: if she be over-dull, heavy, angry, peevish, discontented, and\nmelancholy, not only at the time of conception, but even all the while she\ncarries the child in her womb (saith Fernelius, _path. l. 1, 11_) her son\nwill be so likewise affected, and worse, as [1339]Lemnius adds, _l. 4. c.\n7_, if she grieve overmuch, be disquieted, or by any casualty be affrighted\nand terrified by some fearful object, heard or seen, she endangers her\nchild, and spoils the temperature of it; for the strange imagination of a\nwoman works effectually upon her infant, that as Baptista Porta proves,\n_Physiog. caelestis l. 5. c. 2_, she leaves a mark upon it, which is most\nespecially seen in such as prodigiously long for such and such meats, the\nchild will love those meats, saith Fernelius, and be addicted to like\nhumours: [1340]\"if a great-bellied woman see a hare, her child will often\nhave a harelip,\" as we call it. Garcaeus, _de Judiciis geniturarum, cap.\n33_, hath a memorable example of one Thomas Nickell, born in the city of\nBrandeburg, 1551, [1341]\"that went reeling and staggering all the days of\nhis life, as if he would fall to the ground, because his mother being great\nwith child saw a drunken man reeling in the street.\" Such another I find in\nMartin Wenrichius, _com. de ortu monstrorum, c. 17_, I saw (saith he) at\nWittenberg, in Germany, a citizen that looked like a carcass; I asked him\nthe cause, he replied, [1342]\"His mother, when she bore him in her womb,\nsaw a carcass by chance, and was so sore affrighted with it, that _ex eo\nfoetus ei assimilatus_, from a ghastly impression the child was like it.\"\n\nSo many several ways are we plagued and punished for our father's defaults;\ninsomuch that as Fernelius truly saith, [1343]\"It is the greatest part of\nour felicity to be well born, and it were happy for human kind, if only\nsuch parents as are sound of body and mind should be suffered to marry.\" An\nhusbandman will sow none but the best and choicest seed upon his land, he\nwill not rear a bull or a horse, except he be right shapen in all parts, or\npermit him to cover a mare, except he be well assured of his breed; we make\nchoice of the best rams for our sheep, rear the neatest kine, and keep the\nbest dogs, _Quanto id diligentius in procreandis liberis observandum_? And\nhow careful then should we be in begetting of our children? In former times\nsome [1344]countries have been so chary in this behalf, so stern, that if a\nchild were crooked or deformed in body or mind, they made him away; so did\nthe Indians of old by the relation of Curtius, and many other well-governed\ncommonwealths, according to the discipline of those times. Heretofore in\nScotland, saith [1345]Hect. Boethius, \"if any were visited with the falling\nsickness, madness, gout, leprosy, or any such dangerous disease, which was\nlikely to be propagated from the father to the son, he was instantly\ngelded; a woman kept from all company of men; and if by chance having some\nsuch disease, she were found to be with child, she with her brood were\nburied alive:\" and this was done for the common good, lest the whole nation\nshould be injured or corrupted. A severe doom you will say, and not to be\nused amongst Christians, yet more to be looked into than it is. For now by\nour too much facility in this kind, in giving way for all to marry that\nwill, too much liberty and indulgence in tolerating all sorts, there is a\nvast confusion of hereditary diseases, no family secure, no man almost free\nfrom some grievous infirmity or other, when no choice is had, but still the\neldest must marry, as so many stallions of the race; or if rich, be they\nfools or dizzards, lame or maimed, unable, intemperate, dissolute, exhaust\nthrough riot, as he said, [1346]_jura haereditario sapere jubentur_; they\nmust be wise and able by inheritance: it comes to pass that our generation\nis corrupt, we have many weak persons, both in body and mind, many feral\ndiseases raging amongst us, crazed families, _parentes, peremptores_; our\nfathers bad, and we are like to be worse.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Bad Diet a cause. Substance. Quality of Meats_.\n\nAccording to my proposed method, having opened hitherto these secondary\ncauses, which are inbred with us, I must now proceed to the outward and\nadventitious, which happen unto us after we are born. And those are either\nevident, remote, or inward, antecedent, and the nearest: continent causes\nsome call them. These outward, remote, precedent causes are subdivided\nagain into necessary and not necessary. Necessary (because we cannot avoid\nthem, but they will alter us, as they are used, or abused) are those six\nnon-natural things, so much spoken of amongst physicians, which are\nprincipal causes of this disease. For almost in every consultation, whereas\nthey shall come to speak of the causes, the fault is found, and this most\npart objected to the patient; _Peccavit circa res sex non naturales_: he\nhath still offended in one of those six. Montanus, _consil. 22_, consulted\nabout a melancholy Jew, gives that sentence, so did Frisemelica in the same\nplace; and in his 244 counsel, censuring a melancholy soldier, assigns that\nreason of his malady, [1347]\"he offended in all those six non-natural\nthings, which were the outward causes, from which came those inward\nobstructions;\" and so in the rest.\n\nThese six non-natural things are diet, retention and evacuation, which are\nmore material than the other because they make new matter, or else are\nconversant in keeping or expelling of it. The other four are air, exercise,\nsleeping, waking, and perturbations of the mind, which only alter the\nmatter. The first of these is diet, which consists in meat and drink, and\ncauseth melancholy, as it offends in substance, or accidents, that is,\nquantity, quality, or the like. And well it may be called a material cause,\nsince that, as [1348]Fernelius holds, \"it hath such a power in begetting of\ndiseases, and yields the matter and sustenance of them; for neither air,\nnor perturbations, nor any of those other evident causes take place, or\nwork this effect, except the constitution of body, and preparation of\nhumours, do concur. That a man may say, this diet is the mother of\ndiseases, let the father be what he will, and from this alone, melancholy\nand frequent other maladies arise.\" Many physicians, I confess, have\nwritten copious volumes of this one subject, of the nature and qualities of\nall manner of meats; as namely, Galen, Isaac the Jew, Halyabbas, Avicenna,\nMesue, also four Arabians, Gordonius, Villanovanus, Wecker, Johannes\nBruerinus, _sitologia de Esculentis et Poculentis_, Michael Savanarola,\n_Tract 2. c. 8_, Anthony Fumanellus, _lib. de regimine senum_, Curio in his\ncomment on Schola Salerna, Godefridus Steckius _arte med._, Marcilius\nCognatus, Ficinus, Ranzovius, Fonseca, Lessius, Magninus, _regim.\nsanitatis_, Frietagius, Hugo Fridevallius, &c., besides many other in\n[1349]English, and almost every peculiar physician, discourseth at large of\nall peculiar meats in his chapter of melancholy: yet because these books\nare not at hand to every man, I will briefly touch what kind of meats\nengender this humour, through their several species, and which are to be\navoided. How they alter and change the matter, spirits first, and after\nhumours, by which we are preserved, and the constitution of our body,\nFernelius and others will show you. I hasten to the thing itself: and first\nof such diet as offends in substance.\n\n_Beef._] Beef, a strong and hearty meat (cold in the first degree, dry in\nthe second, saith _Gal. l. 3. c. 1. de alim. fac._) is condemned by him and\nall succeeding Authors, to breed gross melancholy blood: good for such as\nare sound, and of a strong constitution, for labouring men if ordered\naright, corned, young, of an ox (for all gelded meats in every species are\nheld best), or if old, [1350]such as have been tired out with labour, are\npreferred. Aubanus and Sabellicus commend Portugal beef to be the most\nsavoury, best and easiest of digestion; we commend ours: but all is\nrejected, and unfit for such as lead a resty life, any ways inclined to\nmelancholy, or dry of complexion: _Tales_ (Galen thinks) _de facile\nmelancholicis aegritudinibus capiuntur_.\n\n_Pork._] Pork, of all meats, is most nutritive in his own nature, [1351]\nbut altogether unfit for such as live at ease, are any ways unsound of body\nor mind: too moist, full of humours, and therefore _noxia delicatis_, saith\nSavanarola, _ex earum usu ut dubitetur an febris quartana generetur_:\nnaught for queasy stomachs, insomuch that frequent use of it may breed a\nquartan ague.\n\n_Goat._] Savanarola discommends goat's flesh, and so doth [1352]Bruerinus,\n_l. 13. c. 19_, calling it a filthy beast, and rammish: and therefore\nsupposeth it will breed rank and filthy substance; yet kid, such as are\nyoung and tender, Isaac accepts, Bruerinus and Galen, _l. 1. c. 1. de\nalimentorum facultatibus_.\n\n_Hart._] Hart and red deer [1353]hath an evil name: it yields gross\nnutriment: a strong and great grained meat, next unto a horse. Which\nalthough some countries eat, as Tartars, and they of China; yet [1354]\nGalen condemns. Young foals are as commonly eaten in Spain as red deer, and\nto furnish their navies, about Malaga especially, often used; but such\nmeats ask long baking, or seething, to qualify them, and yet all will not\nserve.\n\nVenison, Fallow Deer.] All venison is melancholy, and begets bad blood; a\npleasant meat: in great esteem with us (for we have more parks in England\nthan there are in all Europe besides) in our solemn feasts. 'Tis somewhat\nbetter hunted than otherwise, and well prepared by cookery; but generally\nbad, and seldom to be used.\n\n_Hare._] Hare, a black meat, melancholy, and hard of digestion, it breeds\nincubus, often eaten, and causeth fearful dreams, so doth all venison, and\nis condemned by a jury of physicians. Mizaldus and some others say, that\nhare is a merry meat, and that it will make one fair, as Martial's epigram\ntestifies to Gellia; but this is _per accidens_, because of the good sport\nit makes, merry company and good discourse that is commonly at the eating\nof it, and not otherwise to be understood.\n\n_Conies._] [1355]Conies are of the nature of hares. Magninus compares them\nto beef, pig, and goat, _Reg. sanit. part. 3. c. 17_; yet young rabbits by\nall men are approved to be good.\n\nGenerally, all such meats as are hard of digestion breed melancholy.\nAreteus, _lib. 7. cap. 5_, reckons up heads and feet, [1356]bowels, brains,\nentrails, marrow, fat, blood, skins, and those inward parts, as heart,\nlungs, liver, spleen, &c. They are rejected by Isaac, _lib. 2. part. 3_,\nMagninus, _part. 3. cap. 17_, Bruerinus, _lib. 12_, Savanarola, _Rub. 32.\nTract. 2._\n\n_Milk._] Milk, and all that comes of milk, as butter and cheese, curds,\n&c., increase melancholy (whey only excepted, which is most wholesome):\n[1357]some except asses' milk. The rest, to such as are sound, is nutritive\nand good, especially for young children, but because soon turned to\ncorruption, [1358]not good for those that have unclean stomachs, are\nsubject to headache, or have green wounds, stone, &c. Of all cheeses, I\ntake that kind which we call Banbury cheese to be the best, _ex vetustis\npessimus_, the older, stronger, and harder, the worst, as Langius\ndiscourseth in his Epistle to Melancthon, cited by Mizaldus, Isaac, _p. 5.\nGal. 3. de cibis boni succi_. &c.\n\n_Fowl._] Amongst fowl, [1359]peacocks and pigeons, all fenny fowl are\nforbidden, as ducks, geese, swans, herons, cranes, coots, didappers,\nwater-hens, with all those teals, curs, sheldrakes, and peckled fowls, that\ncome hither in winter out of Scandia, Muscovy, Greenland, Friesland, which\nhalf the year are covered all over with snow, and frozen up. Though these\nbe fair in feathers, pleasant in taste, and have a good outside, like\nhypocrites, white in plumes, and soft, their flesh is hard, black,\nunwholesome, dangerous, melancholy meat; _Gravant et putrefaciant\nstomachum_, saith Isaac, _part. 5. de vol._, their young ones are more\ntolerable, but young pigeons he quite disapproves.\n\n_Fishes._] Rhasis and [1360]Magninus discommend all fish, and say, they\nbreed viscosities, slimy nutriment, little and humorous nourishment.\nSavanarola adds, cold, moist: and phlegmatic, Isaac; and therefore\nunwholesome for all cold and melancholy complexions: others make a\ndifference, rejecting only amongst freshwater fish, eel, tench, lamprey,\ncrawfish (which Bright approves, _cap. 6_), and such as are bred in muddy\nand standing waters, and have a taste of mud, as Franciscus Bonsuetus\npoetically defines, _Lib. de aquatilibus_.\n\n       \"Nam pisces omnes, qui stagna, lacusque frequentant,\n        Semper plus succi deterioris habent.\"\n\n       \"All fish, that standing pools, and lakes frequent,\n        Do ever yield bad juice and nourishment.\"\n\nLampreys, Paulus Jovius, _c. 34. de piscibus fluvial._, highly magnifies,\nand saith, None speak against them, but _inepti et scrupulosi_, some\nscrupulous persons; but [1361]eels, _c. 33_, \"he abhorreth in all places,\nat all times, all physicians detest them, especially about the solstice.\"\nGomesius, _lib. 1. c. 22, de sale_, doth immoderately extol sea-fish, which\nothers as much vilify, and above the rest, dried, soused, indurate fish, as\nling, fumados, red-herrings, sprats, stock-fish, haberdine, poor-John, all\nshellfish. [1362]Tim. Bright excepts lobster and crab. Messarius commends\nsalmon, which Bruerinus contradicts, _lib. 22. c. 17._ Magninus rejects\nconger, sturgeon, turbot, mackerel, skate.\n\nCarp is a fish of which I know not what to determine. Franciscus Bonsuetus\naccounts it a muddy fish. Hippolitus Salvianus, in his Book _de Piscium\nnatura et praeparatione_, which was printed at Rome in folio, 1554, with\nmost elegant pictures, esteems carp no better than a slimy watery meat.\nPaulus Jovius on the other side, disallowing tench, approves of it; so doth\nDubravius in his Books of Fishponds. Freitagius [1363]extols it for an\nexcellent wholesome meat, and puts it amongst the fishes of the best rank;\nand so do most of our country gentlemen, that store their ponds almost with\nno other fish. But this controversy is easily decided, in my judgment, by\nBruerinus, _l. 22. c. 13._ The difference riseth from the site and nature\nof pools, [1364]sometimes muddy, sometimes sweet; they are in taste as the\nplace is from whence they be taken. In like manner almost we may conclude\nof other fresh fish. But see more in Rondoletius, Bellonius, Oribasius,\n_lib. 7. cap. 22_, Isaac, _l. 1_, especially Hippolitus Salvianus, who is\n_instar omnium solus_, &c. Howsoever they may be wholesome and approved,\nmuch use of them is not good; P. Forestus, in his medicinal observations,\n[1365]relates, that Carthusian friars, whose living is most part fish, are\nmore subject to melancholy than any other order, and that he found by\nexperience, being sometimes their physician ordinary at Delft, in Holland.\nHe exemplifies it with an instance of one Buscodnese, a Carthusian of a\nruddy colour, and well liking, that by solitary living, and fish-eating,\nbecame so misaffected.\n\n_Herbs._] Amongst herbs to be eaten I find gourds, cucumbers, coleworts,\nmelons, disallowed, but especially cabbage. It causeth troublesome dreams,\nand sends up black vapours to the brain. Galen, _loc. affect. l. 3. c. 6_,\nof all herbs condemns cabbage; and Isaac, _lib. 2. c. 1._ _Animae\ngravitatem facit_, it brings heaviness to the soul. Some are of opinion\nthat all raw herbs and salads breed melancholy blood, except bugloss and\nlettuce. Crato, _consil. 21. lib. 2_, speaks against all herbs and worts,\nexcept borage, bugloss, fennel, parsley, dill, balm, succory. Magninus,\n_regim. sanitatis, part. 3. cap. 31._ _Omnes herbae simpliciter malae, via\ncibi_; all herbs are simply evil to feed on (as he thinks). So did that\nscoffing cook in [1366]Plautus hold:\n\n       \"Non ego coenam condio ut alii coqui solent,\n        Qui mihi condita prata in patinis proferunt,\n        Boves qui convivas faciunt, herbasque aggerunt.\"\n\n       \"Like other cooks I do not supper dress,\n          That put whole meadows into a platter,\n        And make no better of their guests than beeves,\n          With herbs and grass to feed them fatter.\"\n\nOur Italians and Spaniards do make a whole dinner of herbs and salads\n(which our said Plautus calls _coenas terrestras_, Horace, _coenas sine\nsanguine_), by which means, as he follows it,\n\n[1367] \"Hic homines tam brevem vitam colunt------\n        Qui herbas hujusmodi in alvum suum congerunt,\n        Formidolosum dictu, non esu modo,\n        Quas herbas pecudes non edunt, homines edunt.\"\n\n       \"Their lives, that eat such herbs, must needs be short,\n        And 'tis a fearful thing for to report,\n        That men should feed on such a kind of meat,\n        Which very juments would refuse to eat.\"\n\n[1368]They are windy, and not fit therefore to be eaten of all men raw,\nthough qualified with oil, but in broths, or otherwise. See more of these\nin every [1369]husbandman, and herbalist.\n\n_Roots._] Roots, _Etsi quorundam gentium opes sint_, saith Bruerinus, the\nwealth of some countries, and sole food, are windy and bad, or troublesome\nto the head: as onions, garlic, scallions, turnips, carrots, radishes,\nparsnips: Crato, _lib. 2. consil. 11_, disallows all roots, though [1370]\nsome approve of parsnips and potatoes. [1371]Magninus is of Crato's\nopinion, [1372]\"They trouble the mind, sending gross fumes to the brain,\nmake men mad,\" especially garlic, onions, if a man liberally feed on them a\nyear together. Guianerius, _tract. 15. cap. 2_, complains of all manner of\nroots, and so doth Bruerinus, even parsnips themselves, which are the best,\n_Lib. 9. cap. 14._\n\n_Fruits._] _Pastinacarum usus succos gignit improbos_. Crato, _consil. 21.\nlib. 1_, utterly forbids all manner of fruits, as pears, apples, plums,\ncherries, strawberries, nuts, medlars, serves, &c. _Sanguinem inficiunt_,\nsaith Villanovanus, they infect the blood, and putrefy it, Magninus holds,\nand must not therefore be taken _via cibi, aut quantitate magna_, not to\nmake a meal of, or in any great quantity. [1373]Cardan makes that a cause\nof their continual sickness at Fessa in Africa, \"because they live so much\non fruits, eating them thrice a day.\" Laurentius approves of many fruits,\nin his Tract of Melancholy, which others disallow, and amongst the rest\napples, which some likewise commend, sweetings, pearmains, pippins, as good\nagainst melancholy; but to him that is any way inclined to, or touched with\nthis malady, [1374]Nicholas Piso in his Practics, forbids all fruits, as\nwindy, or to be sparingly eaten at least, and not raw. Amongst other\nfruits, [1375]Bruerinus, out of Galen, excepts grapes and figs, but I find\nthem likewise rejected.\n\n_Pulse._] All pulse are naught, beans, peas, vetches, &c., they fill the\nbrain (saith Isaac) with gross fumes, breed black thick blood, and cause\ntroublesome dreams. And therefore, that which Pythagoras said to his\nscholars of old, may be for ever applied to melancholy men, _A fabis\nabstinete_, eat no peas, nor beans; yet to such as will needs eat them, I\nwould give this counsel, to prepare them according to those rules that\nArnoldus Villanovanus, and Frietagius prescribe, for eating, and dressing.\nfruits, herbs, roots, pulse, &c.\n\n_Spices._] Spices cause hot and head melancholy, and are for that cause\nforbidden by our physicians to such men as are inclined to this malady, as\npepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, mace, dates, &c. honey and sugar. [1376]\nSome except honey; to those that are cold, it may be tolerable, but [1377]\n_Dulcia se in bilem vertunt_, (sweets turn into bile,) they are\nobstructive. Crato therefore forbids all spice, in a consultation of his,\nfor a melancholy schoolmaster, _Omnia aromatica et quicquid sanguinem\nadurit_: so doth Fernelius, _consil. 45._ Guianerius, _tract 15. cap. 2._\nMercurialis, _cons. 189._ To these I may add all sharp and sour things,\nluscious and over-sweet, or fat, as oil, vinegar, verjuice, mustard, salt;\nas sweet things are obstructive, so these are corrosive. Gomesius, in his\nbooks, _de sale, l. 1. c. 21_, highly commends salt; so doth Codronchus in\nhis tract, _de sale Absynthii_, Lemn. _l. 3. c. 9. de occult, nat. mir._\nyet common experience finds salt, and salt-meats, to be great procurers of\nthis disease. And for that cause belike those Egyptian priests abstained\nfrom salt, even so much, as in their bread, _ut sine perturbatione anima\nesset_, saith mine author, that their souls might be free from\nperturbations.\n\n_Bread._] Bread that is made of baser grain, as peas, beans, oats, rye, or\n[1378]over-hard baked, crusty, and black, is often spoken against, as\ncausing melancholy juice and wind. Joh. Mayor, in the first book of his\nHistory of Scotland, contends much for the wholesomeness of oaten bread: it\nwas objected to him then living at Paris in France, that his countrymen fed\non oats, and base grain, as a disgrace; but he doth ingenuously confess,\nScotland, Wales, and a third part of England, did most part use that kind\nof bread, that it was as wholesome as any grain, and yielded as good\nnourishment. And yet Wecker out of Galen calls it horsemeat, and fitter\nfor juments than men to feed on. But read Galen himself, _Lib. 1. De cibis\nboni et mali succi_, more largely discoursing of corn and bread.\n\n_Wine._] All black wines, over-hot, compound, strong thick drinks, as\nMuscadine, Malmsey, Alicant, Rumney, Brownbastard, Metheglen, and the like,\nof which they have thirty several kinds in Muscovy, all such made drinks\nare hurtful in this case, to such as are hot, or of a sanguine choleric\ncomplexion, young, or inclined to head-melancholy. For many times the\ndrinking of wine alone causeth it. Arculanus, _c. 16. in 9. Rhasis_, puts\nin [1379]wine for a great cause, especially if it be immoderately used.\nGuianerius, _tract. 15. c. 2_, tells a story of two Dutchmen, to whom he\ngave entertainment in his house, \"that [1380]in one month's space were both\nmelancholy by drinking of wine, one did nought but sing, the other sigh.\"\nGalen, _l. de causis morb. c. 3._ Matthiolus on Dioscorides, and above all\nother Andreas Bachius, _l. 3. 18, 19, 20_, have reckoned upon those\ninconveniences that come by wine: yet notwithstanding all this, to such as\nare cold, or sluggish melancholy, a cup of wine is good physic, and so doth\nMercurialis grant, _consil. 25_, in that case, if the temperature be cold,\nas to most melancholy men it is, wine is much commended, if it be\nmoderately used.\n\n_Cider, Perry._] Cider and perry are both cold and windy drinks, and for\nthat cause to be neglected, and so are all those hot spiced strong drinks.\n\nBeer.] Beer, if it be over-new or over-stale, over-strong, or not sodden,\nsmell of the cask, sharp, or sour, is most unwholesome, frets, and galls,\n&c. Henricus Ayrerus, in a [1381]consultation of his, for one that laboured\nof hypochondriacal melancholy, discommends beer. So doth [1382] Crato in\nthat excellent counsel of his, _Lib. 2. consil. 21_, as too windy, because\nof the hop. But he means belike that thick black Bohemian beer used in some\nother parts of [1383]Germany.\n\n        ------\"nil spissius illa\n        Dum bibitur, nil clarius est dum mingitur, unde\n        Constat, quod multas faeces in corpore linquat.\"\n\n       \"Nothing comes in so thick,\n        Nothing goes out so thin,\n        It must needs follow then\n        The dregs are left within.\"\n\nAs that [1384]old poet scoffed, calling it _Stygiae monstrum conforme\npaludi_, a monstrous drink, like the river Styx. But let them say as they\nlist, to such as are accustomed unto it, \"'tis a most wholesome\" (so [1385]\nPolydore Virgil calleth it) \"and a pleasant drink,\" it is more subtle and\nbetter, for the hop that rarefies it, hath an especial virtue against\nmelancholy, as our herbalists confess, Fuchsius approves, _Lib. 2. sec. 2.\ninstit. cap. 11_, and many others.\n\nWaters] Standing waters, thick and ill-coloured, such as come forth of\npools, and moats, where hemp hath been steeped, or slimy fishes live, are\nmost unwholesome, putrefied, and full of mites, creepers, slimy, muddy,\nunclean, corrupt, impure, by reason of the sun's heat, and still-standing;\nthey cause foul distemperatures in the body and mind of man, are unfit to\nmake drink of, to dress meat with, or to be [1386]used about men inwardly\nor outwardly. They are good for many domestic uses, to wash horses, water\ncattle, &c., or in time of necessity, but not otherwise. Some are of\nopinion, that such fat standing waters make the best beer, and that\nseething doth defecate it, as [1387]Cardan holds, _Lib. 13. subtil._ \"It\nmends the substance, and savour of it,\" but it is a paradox. Such beer may\nbe stronger, but not so wholesome as the other, as [1388]Jobertus truly\njustifieth out of Galen, _Paradox, dec. 1. Paradox 5_, that the seething of\nsuch impure waters doth not purge or purify them, Pliny, _lib. 31. c. 3_,\nis of the same tenet, and P. Crescentius, _agricult. lib. 1. et lib. 4. c.\n11. et c. 45._ Pamphilius Herilachus, _l. 4. de not. aquarum_, such waters\nare naught, not to be used, and by the testimony of [1389]Galen, \"breed\nagues, dropsies, pleurisies, splenetic and melancholy passions, hurt the\neyes, cause a bad temperature, and ill disposition of the whole body, with\nbad colour.\" This Jobertus stiffly maintains, _Paradox, lib. 1. part. 5_,\nthat it causeth blear eyes, bad colour, and many loathsome diseases to such\nas use it: this which they say, stands with good reason; for as geographers\nrelate, the water of Astracan breeds worms in such as drink it. [1390]\nAxius, or as now called Verduri, the fairest river in Macedonia, makes all\ncattle black that taste of it. Aleacman now Peleca, another stream in\nThessaly, turns cattle most part white, _si polui ducas_, L. Aubanus\nRohemus refers that [1391]struma or poke of the Bavarians and Styrians to\nthe nature of their waters, as [1392]Munster doth that of Valesians in the\nAlps, and [1393]Bodine supposeth the stuttering of some families in\nAquitania, about Labden, to proceed from the same cause, \"and that the\nfilth is derived from the water to their bodies.\" So that they that use\nfilthy, standing, ill-coloured, thick, muddy water, must needs have muddy,\nill-coloured, impure, and infirm bodies. And because the body works upon\nthe mind, they shall have grosser understandings, dull, foggy, melancholy\nspirits, and be really subject to all manner of infirmities.\n\nTo these noxious simples, we may reduce an infinite number of compound,\nartificial, made dishes, of which our cooks afford us a great variety, as\ntailors do fashions in our apparel. Such are [1394]puddings stuffed with\nblood, or otherwise composed; baked, meats, soused indurate meats, fried\nand broiled buttered meats; condite, powdered, and over-dried, [1395]all\ncakes, simnels, buns, cracknels made with butter, spice, &c., fritters,\npancakes, pies, sausages, and those several sauces, sharp, or over-sweet,\nof which _scientia popinae_, as Seneca calls it, hath served those [1396]\nApician tricks, and perfumed dishes, which Adrian the sixth Pope so much\nadmired in the accounts of his predecessor Leo Decimus; and which\nprodigious riot and prodigality have invented in this age. These do\ngenerally engender gross humours, fill the stomach with crudities, and all\nthose inward parts with obstructions. Montanus, _consil. 22_, gives\ninstance, in a melancholy Jew, that by eating such tart sauces, made\ndishes, and salt meats, with which he was overmuch delighted, became\nmelancholy, and was evil affected. Such examples are familiar and common.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Quantity of Diet a Cause._\n\nThere is not so much harm proceeding from the substance itself of meat, and\nquality of it, in ill-dressing and preparing, as there is from the\nquantity, disorder of time and place, unseasonable use of it, [1397]\nintemperance, overmuch, or overlittle taking of it. A true saying it is,\n_Plures crapula quam gladius_. This gluttony kills more than the sword,\nthis _omnivorantia et homicida gula_, this all-devouring and murdering gut.\nAnd that of [1398]Pliny is truer, \"Simple diet is the best; heaping up of\nseveral meats is pernicious, and sauces worse; many dishes bring many\ndiseases.\" [1399]Avicen cries out, \"That nothing is worse than to feed on\nmany dishes, or to protract the time of meats longer than ordinary; from\nthence proceed our infirmities, and 'tis the fountain of all diseases,\nwhich arise out of the repugnancy of gross humours.\" Thence, saith [1400]\nFernelius, come crudities, wind, oppilations, cacochymia, plethora,\ncachexia, bradiopepsia, [1401]_Hinc subitae, mortes, atque intestata\nsenectus_, sudden death, &c., and what not.\n\nAs a lamp is choked with a multitude of oil, or a little fire with overmuch\nwood quite extinguished, so is the natural heat with immoderate eating,\nstrangled in the body. _Pernitiosa sentina est abdomen insaturabile_: one\nsaith, An insatiable paunch is a pernicious sink, and the fountain of all\ndiseases, both of body and mind. [1402]Mercurialis will have it a peculiar\ncause of this private disease; Solenander, _consil. 5. sect. 3_,\nillustrates this of Mercurialis, with an example of one so melancholy, _ab\nintempestivis commessationibus_, unseasonable feasting. [1403]Crato\nconfirms as much, in that often cited counsel, _21. lib. 2_, putting\nsuperfluous eating for a main cause. But what need I seek farther for\nproofs? Hear [1404]Hippocrates himself, _lib. 2. aphor. 10_, \"Impure bodies\nthe more they are nourished, the more they are hurt, for the nourishment is\nputrefied with vicious humours.\"\n\nAnd yet for all this harm, which apparently follows surfeiting and\ndrunkenness, see how we luxuriate and rage in this kind; read what Johannes\nStuckius hath written lately of this subject, in his great volume _De\nAntiquorum Conviviis_, and of our present age; _Quam [1405]portentosae\ncoenae_, prodigious suppers, [1406]_Qui dum invitant ad coenam efferunt ad\nsepulchrum_, what Fagos, Epicures, Apetios, Heliogables, our times afford?\nLucullus' ghost walks still, and every man desires to sup in Apollo;\nAesop's costly dish is ordinarily served up. [1407]_Magis illa juvant, quae\npluris emuntur_. The dearest cates are best, and 'tis an ordinary thing to\nbestow twenty or thirty pounds on a dish, some thousand crowns upon a\ndinner: [1408]Mully-Hamet, king of Fez and Morocco, spent three pounds on\nthe sauce of a capon: it is nothing in our times, we scorn all that is\ncheap. \"We loathe the very [1409]light\" (some of us, as Seneca notes)\n\"because it comes free, and we are offended with the sun's heat, and those\ncool blasts, because we buy them not.\" This air we breathe is so common, we\ncare not for it; nothing pleaseth but what is dear. And if we be\n[1410]witty in anything, it is _ad gulam_: If we study at all, it is\n_erudito luxu_, to please the palate, and to satisfy the gut. \"A cook of\nold was a base knave\" (as [1411]Livy complains), \"but now a great man in\nrequest; cookery is become an art, a noble science: cooks are gentlemen:\"\n_Venter Deus_: They wear \"their brains in their bellies, and their guts in\ntheir heads,\" as [1412]Agrippa taxed some parasites of his time, rushing on\ntheir own destruction, as if a man should run upon the point of a sword,\n_usque dum rumpantur comedunt_, \"They eat till they burst:\" [1413]All day,\nall night, let the physician say what he will, imminent danger, and feral\ndiseases are now ready to seize upon them, that will eat till they vomit,\n_Edunt ut vomant, vomut ut edant_, saith Seneca; which Dion relates of\nVitellius, _Solo transitu ciborum nutriri judicatus_: His meat did pass\nthrough and away, or till they burst again. [1414]_Strage animantium\nventrem onerant_, and rake over all the world, as so many [1415]slaves,\nbelly-gods, and land-serpents, _Et totus orbis ventri nimis angustus_, the\nwhole world cannot satisfy their appetite. [1416]\"Sea, land, rivers, lakes,\n&c., may not give content to their raging guts.\" To make up the mess, what\nimmoderate drinking in every place? _Senem potum pota trahebat anus_, how\nthey flock to the tavern: as if they were _fruges consumere nati_, born to\nno other end but to eat and drink, like Offellius Bibulus, that famous\nRoman parasite, _Qui dum vixit, aut bibit aut minxit_; as so many casks to\nhold wine, yea worse than a cask, that mars wine, and itself is not marred\nby it, yet these are brave men, Silenus Ebrius was no braver. _Et quae\nfuerunt vitia, mores sunt_: 'tis now the fashion of our times, an honour:\n_Nunc vero res ista eo rediit_ (as Chrysost. _serm. 30. in v. Ephes._\ncomments) _Ut effeminatae ridendaeque ignaviae loco habeatur, nolle\ninebriari_; 'tis now come to that pass that he is no gentleman, a very\nmilk-sop, a clown, of no bringing up, that will not drink; fit for no\ncompany; he is your only gallant that plays it off finest, no disparagement\nnow to stagger in the streets, reel, rave, &c., but much to his fame and\nrenown; as in like case Epidicus told Thesprio his fellow-servant, in the\n[1417]Poet. _Aedipol facinus improbum_, one urged, the other replied, _At\njam alii fecere idem, erit illi illa res honori_, 'tis now no fault, there\nbe so many brave examples to bear one out; 'tis a credit to have a strong\nbrain, and carry his liquor well; the sole contention who can drink most,\nand fox his fellow the soonest. 'Tis the _summum bonum_ of our tradesmen,\ntheir felicity, life, and soul, _Tanta dulcedine affectant_, saith Pliny,\n_lib. 14. cap. 12._ _Ut magna pars non aliud vitae praemium intelligat_,\ntheir chief comfort, to be merry together in an alehouse or tavern, as our\nmodern Muscovites do in their mead-inns, and Turks in their coffeehouses,\nwhich much resemble our taverns; they will labour hard all day long to be\ndrunk at night, and spend _totius anni labores_, as St. Ambrose adds, in a\ntippling feast; convert day into night, as Seneca taxes some in his times,\n_Pervertunt officia anoctis et lucis_; when we rise, they commonly go to\nbed, like our antipodes,\n\n       \"Nosque ubi primus equis oriens afflavit anhelis,\n        Illis sera rubens ascendit lumina vesper.\"\n\nSo did Petronius in Tacitus, Heliogabalus in Lampridius.\n\n[1418]  ------\"Noctes vigilibat ad ipsum\n        Mane, diem totum stertebat?\"------\n\n        ------\"He drank the night away\n        Till rising dawn, then snored out all the day.\"\n\nSnymdiris the Sybarite never saw the sun rise or set so much as once in\ntwenty years. Verres, against whom Tully so much inveighs, in winter he\nnever was _extra tectum vix extra lectum_, never almost out of bed, [1419]\nstill wenching and drinking; so did he spend his time, and so do myriads in\nour days. They have _gymnasia bibonum_, schools and rendezvous; these\ncentaurs and Lapithae toss pots and bowls as so many balls; invent new\ntricks, as sausages, anchovies, tobacco, caviar, pickled oysters, herrings,\nfumados, &c.: innumerable salt meats to increase their appetite, and study\nhow to hurt themselves by taking antidotes [1420]\"to carry their drink the\nbetter; [1421]and when nought else serves, they will go forth, or be\nconveyed out, to empty their gorge, that they may return to drink afresh.\"\nThey make laws, _insanas leges, contra bibendi fallacias_, and [1422]brag\nof it when they have done, crowning that man that is soonest gone, as their\ndrunken predecessors have done, --[1423]_quid ego video_? Ps. _Cum corona\nPseudolum ebrium tuum_--. And when they are dead, will have a can of wine\nwith [1424]Maron's old woman to be engraven on their tombs. So they triumph\nin villainy, and justify their wickedness; with Rabelais, that French\nLucian, drunkenness is better for the body than physic, because there be\nmore old drunkards than old physicians. Many such frothy arguments they\nhave, [1425]inviting and encouraging others to do as they do, and love them\ndearly for it (no glue like to that of good fellowship). So did Alcibiades\nin Greece; Nero, Bonosus, Heliogabalus in Rome, or Alegabalus rather, as he\nwas styled of old (as [1426]Ignatius proves out of some old coins). So do\nmany great men still, as [1427]Heresbachius observes. When a prince drinks\ntill his eyes stare, like Bitias in the Poet,\n\n[1428]  ------(\"ille impiger hausit\n        Spumantem vino pateram.\")\n\n        ------\"a thirsty soul;\n        He took challenge and embrac'd the bowl;\n        With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceased to draw\n        Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.\"\n\nand comes off clearly, sound trumpets, fife and drums, the spectators will\napplaud him, \"the [1429]bishop himself (if he belie them not) with his\nchaplain will stand by and do as much,\" _O dignum principe haustum_, 'twas\ndone like a prince. \"Our Dutchmen invite all comers with a pail and a\ndish,\" _Velut infundibula integras obbas exhauriunt, et in monstrosis\npoculis, ipsi monstrosi monstrosius epotant_, \"making barrels of their\nbellies.\" _Incredibile dictu_, as [1430]one of their own countrymen\ncomplains: [1431]_Quantum liquoris immodestissima gens capiat_, &c. \"How\nthey love a man that will be drunk, crown him and honour him for it,\" hate\nhim that will not pledge him, stab him, kill him: a most intolerable\noffence, and not to be forgiven. [1432]\"He is a mortal enemy that will not\ndrink with him,\" as Munster relates of the Saxons. So in Poland, he is the\nbest servitor, and the honestest fellow, saith Alexander Gaguinus, [1433]\n\"that drinketh most healths to the honour of his master, he shall be\nrewarded as a good servant, and held the bravest fellow that carries his\nliquor best,\" when a brewer's horse will bear much more than any sturdy\ndrinker, yet for his noble exploits in this kind, he shall be accounted a\nmost valiant man, for [1434]_Tam inter epulas fortis vir esse potest ac in\nbello_, as much valour is to be found in feasting as in fighting, and some\nof our city captains, and carpet knights will make this good, and prove it.\nThus they many times wilfully pervert the good temperature of their bodies,\nstifle their wits, strangle nature, and degenerate into beasts.\n\nSome again are in the other extreme, and draw this mischief on their heads\nby too ceremonious and strict diet, being over-precise, cockney-like, and\ncurious in their observation of meats, times, as that _Medicina statica_\nprescribes, just so many ounces at dinner, which Lessius enjoins, so much\nat supper, not a little more, nor a little less, of such meat, and at such\nhours, a diet-drink in the morning, cock-broth, China-broth, at dinner,\nplum-broth, a chicken, a rabbit, rib of a rack of mutton, wing of a capon,\nthe merry-thought of a hen, &c.; to sounder bodies this is too nice and\nmost absurd. Others offend in overmuch fasting: pining adays, saith [1435]\nGuianerius, and waking anights, as many Moors and Turks in these our times\ndo. \"Anchorites, monks, and the rest of that superstitious rank (as the\nsame Guianerius witnesseth, that he hath often seen to have happened in his\ntime) through immoderate fasting, have been frequently mad.\" Of such men\nbelike Hippocrates speaks, _l. Aphor. 5_, when as he saith, [1436]\"they\nmore offend in too sparing diet, and are worse damnified, than they that\nfeed liberally, and are ready to surfeit.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Custom of Diet, Delight, Appetite, Necessity, how they\ncause or hinder_.\n\nNo rule is so general, which admits not some exception; to this, therefore,\nwhich hath been hitherto said, (for I shall otherwise put most men out of\ncommons,) and those inconveniences which proceed from the substance of\nmeats, an intemperate or unseasonable use of them, custom somewhat detracts\nand qualifies, according to that of Hippocrates, _2 Aphoris. 50._ [1437]\n\"Such things as we have been long accustomed to, though they be evil in\ntheir own nature, yet they are less offensive.\" Otherwise it might well be\nobjected that it were a mere [1438]tyranny to live after those strict rules\nof physic; for custom [1439]doth alter nature itself, and to such as are\nused to them it makes bad meats wholesome, and unseasonable times to cause\nno disorder. Cider and perry are windy drinks, so are all fruits windy in\nthemselves, cold most part, yet in some shires of [1440]England, Normandy\nin France, Guipuscoa in Spain, 'tis their common drink, and they are no\nwhit offended with it. In Spain, Italy, and Africa, they live most on\nroots, raw herbs, camel's [1441]milk, and it agrees well with them: which\nto a stranger will cause much grievance. In Wales, _lacticiniis vescuntur_,\nas Humphrey Llwyd confesseth, a Cambro-Briton himself, in his elegant\nepistle to Abraham Ortelius, they live most on white meats: in Holland on\nfish, roots, [1442]butter; and so at this day in Greece, as [1443]Bellonius\nobserves, they had much rather feed on fish than flesh. With us, _Maxima\npars victus in carne consistit_, we feed on flesh most part, saith\n[1444]Polydore Virgil, as all northern countries do; and it would be very\noffensive to us to live after their diet, or they to live after ours. We\ndrink beer, they wine; they use oil, we butter; we in the north are\n[1445]great eaters; they most sparing in those hotter countries; and yet\nthey and we following our own customs are well pleased. An Ethiopian of old\nseeing an European eat bread, wondered, _quomodo stercoribus vescentes\nviverimus_, how we could eat such kind of meats: so much differed his\ncountrymen from ours in diet, that as mine [1446]author infers, _si quis\nillorum victum apud nos aemulari vellet_; if any man should so feed with\nus, it would be all one to nourish, as Cicuta, Aconitum, or Hellebore\nitself. At this day in China the common people live in a manner altogether\non roots and herbs, and to the wealthiest, horse, ass, mule, dogs,\ncat-flesh, is as delightsome as the rest, so [1447]Mat. Riccius the Jesuit\nrelates, who lived many years amongst them. The Tartars eat raw meat, and\nmost commonly [1448]horse-flesh, drink milk and blood, as the nomades of\nold. _Et lac concretum cum sanguine potat equino_. They scoff at our\nEuropeans for eating bread, which they call tops of weeds, and horse meat,\nnot fit for men; and yet Scaliger accounts them a sound and witty nation,\nliving a hundred years; even in the civilest country of them they do thus,\nas Benedict the Jesuit observed in his travels, from the great Mogul's\nCourt by land to Pekin, which Riccius contends to be the same with Cambulu\nin Cataia. In Scandia their bread is usually dried fish, and so likewise in\nthe Shetland Isles; and their other fare, as in Iceland, saith\n[1449]Dithmarus Bleskenius, butter, cheese, and fish; their drink water,\ntheir lodging on the ground. In America in many places their bread is\nroots, their meat palmettos, pinas, potatoes, &c., and such fruits. There\nbe of them too that familiarly drink [1450]salt seawater all their lives,\neat [1451]raw meat, grass, and that with delight. With some, fish,\nserpents, spiders: and in divers places they [1452]eat man's flesh, raw and\nroasted, even the Emperor [1453]Montezuma himself. In some coasts, again,\n[1454]one tree yields them cocoanuts, meat and drink, fire, fuel, apparel;\nwith his leaves, oil, vinegar, cover for houses, &c., and yet these men\ngoing naked, feeding coarse, live commonly a hundred years, are seldom or\nnever sick; all which diet our physicians forbid. In Westphalia they feed\nmost part on fat meats and worts, knuckle deep, and call it [1455]_cerebrum\nIovis_: in the Low Countries with roots, in Italy frogs and snails are\nused. The Turks, saith Busbequius, delight most in fried meats. In Muscovy,\ngarlic and onions are ordinary meat and sauce, which would be pernicious to\nsuch as are unaccustomed to them, delightsome to others; and all is\n[1456]because they have been brought up unto it. Husbandmen, and such as\nlabour, can eat fat bacon, salt gross meat, hard cheese, &c., (_O dura\nmessorum illa_), coarse bread at all times, go to bed and labour upon a\nfull stomach, which to some idle persons would be present death, and is\nagainst the rules of physic, so that custom is all in all. Our travellers\nfind this by common experience when they come in far countries, and use\ntheir diet, they are suddenly offended, [1457]as our Hollanders and\nEnglishmen when they touch upon the coasts of Africa, those Indian capes\nand islands, are commonly molested with calentures, fluxes, and much\ndistempered by reason of their fruits. [1458]_Peregrina, etsi suavia solent\nvescentibus perturbationes insignes adferre_, strange meats, though\npleasant, cause notable alterations and distempers. On the other side, use\nor custom mitigates or makes all good again. Mithridates by often use,\nwhich Pliny wonders at, was able to drink poison; and a maid, as Curtius\nrecords, sent to Alexander from King Porus, was brought up with poison from\nher infancy. The Turks, saith Bellonius, lib. 3. c. 15, eat opium\nfamiliarly, a dram at once, which we dare not take in grains. [1459]Garcias\nab Horto writes of one whom he saw at Goa in the East Indies, that took ten\ndrams of opium in three days; and yet _consulto loquebatur_, spake\nunderstandingly, so much can custom do. [1460] Theophrastus speaks of a\nshepherd that could eat hellebore in substance. And therefore Cardan\nconcludes out of Galen, _Consuetudinem utcunque ferendam, nisi valde\nmalam_. Custom is howsoever to be kept, except it be extremely bad: he\nadviseth all men to keep their old customs, and that by the authority of\n[1461]Hippocrates himself, _Dandum aliquid tempori, aetati regioni,\nconsuetudini_, and therefore to [1462]continue as they began, be it diet,\nbath, exercise, &c., or whatsoever else.\n\nAnother exception is delight, or appetite, to such and such meats: though\nthey be hard of digestion, melancholy; yet as Fuchsius excepts, _cap. 6.\nlib. 2. Instit. sect. 2_, [1463]\"The stomach doth readily digest, and\nwillingly entertain such meats we love most, and are pleasing to us, abhors\non the other side such as we distaste.\" Which Hippocrates confirms,\n_Aphoris. 2. 38._ Some cannot endure cheese, out of a secret antipathy; or\nto see a roasted duck, which to others is a [1464]delightsome meat.\n\nThe last exception is necessity, poverty, want, hunger, which drives men\nmany times to do that which otherwise they are loath, cannot endure, and\nthankfully to accept of it: as beverage in ships, and in sieges of great\ncities, to feed on dogs, cats, rats, and men themselves. Three outlaws in\n[1465]Hector Boethius, being driven to their shifts, did eat raw flesh, and\nflesh of such fowl as they could catch, in one of the Hebrides for some few\nmonths. These things do mitigate or disannul that which hath been said of\nmelancholy meats, and make it more tolerable; but to such as are wealthy,\nlive plenteously, at ease, may take their choice, and refrain if they will,\nthese viands are to be forborne, if they be inclined to, or suspect\nmelancholy, as they tender their healths: Otherwise if they be intemperate,\nor disordered in their diet, at their peril be it. _Qui monet amat, Ave et\ncave_.\n\n       \"He who advises is your friend\n        Farewell, and to your health attend.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Retention and Evacuation a cause, and how_.\n\nOf retention and evacuation, there be divers kinds, which are either\nconcomitant, assisting, or sole causes many times of melancholy. [1466]\nGalen reduceth defect and abundance to this head; others [1467]\"All that is\nseparated, or remains.\"\n\n_Costiveness_.] In the first rank of these, I may well reckon up\ncostiveness, and keeping in of our ordinary excrements, which as it often\ncauseth other diseases, so this of melancholy in particular. [1468]Celsus,\nlib. 1. cap. 3, saith, \"It produceth inflammation of the head, dullness,\ncloudiness, headache,\" &c. Prosper Calenus, _lib. de atra bile_, will have\nit distemper not the organ only, [1469]\"but the mind itself by troubling of\nit:\" and sometimes it is a sole cause of madness, as you may read in the\nfirst book of [1470]Skenkius's Medicinal Observations. A young merchant\ngoing to Nordeling fair in Germany, for ten days' space never went to\nstool; at his return he was [1471]grievously melancholy, thinking that he\nwas robbed, and would not be persuaded but that all his money was gone; his\nfriends thought he had some philtrum given him, but Cnelius, a physician,\nbeing sent for, found his [1472]costiveness alone to be the cause, and\nthereupon gave him a clyster, by which he was speedily recovered.\nTrincavellius, _consult. 35. lib. 1_, saith as much of a melancholy lawyer,\nto whom he administered physic, and Rodericus a Fonseca, _consult. 85. tom.\n2_, [1473]of a patient of his, that for eight days was bound, and therefore\nmelancholy affected. Other retentions and evacuations there are, not simply\nnecessary, but at some times; as Fernelius accounts them, _Path. lib. 1.\ncap. 15_, as suppression of haemorrhoids, monthly issues in women, bleeding\nat nose, immoderate or no use at all of Venus: or any other ordinary\nissues.\n\n[1474]Detention of haemorrhoids, or monthly issues, Villanovanus _Breviar.\nlib. 1. cap. 18._ Arculanus, _cap. 16. in 9. Rhasis_, Vittorius Faventinus,\n_pract. mag. tract. 2. cap. 15._ Bruel, &c. put for ordinary causes.\nFuchsius, _l. 2. sect. 5. c. 30_, goes farther, and saith, [1475]\"That many\nmen unseasonably cured of the haemorrhoids have been corrupted with\nmelancholy, seeking to avoid Scylla, they fall into Charybdis.\" Galen, _l.\nde hum. commen. 3. ad text. 26_, illustrates this by an example of Lucius\nMartius, whom he cured of madness, contracted by this means: And [1476]\nSkenkius hath two other instances of two melancholy and mad women, so\ncaused from the suppression of their months. The same may be said of\nbleeding at the nose, if it be suddenly stopped, and have been formerly\nused, as [1477]Villanovanus urgeth: And [1478]Fuchsius, _lib. 2. sect. 5.\ncap. 33_, stiffly maintains, \"That without great danger, such an issue may\nnot be stayed.\"\n\nVenus omitted produceth like effects. Mathiolus, _epist. 5. l. penult._,\n[1479]\"avoucheth of his knowledge, that some through bashfulness abstained\nfrom venery, and thereupon became very heavy and dull; and some others that\nwere very timorous, melancholy, and beyond all measure sad.\" Oribasius,\n_med. collect. l. 6. c. 37_, speaks of some, [1480]\"That if they do not use\ncarnal copulation, are continually troubled with heaviness and headache;\nand some in the same case by intermission of it.\" Not use of it hurts many,\nArculanus, _c. 6. in 9. Rhasis, et Magninus, part. 3. cap. 5_, think,\nbecause it [1481]\"sends up poisoned vapours to the brain and heart.\" And so\ndoth Galen himself hold, \"That if this natural seed be over-long kept (in\nsome parties) it turns to poison.\" Hieronymus Mercurialis, in his chapter\nof melancholy, cites it for an especial cause of this malady,\n[1482]priapismus, satyriasis, &c. Haliabbas, _5. Theor. c. 36_, reckons up\nthis and many other diseases. Villanovanus _Breviar. l. 1. c. 18_, saith,\n\"He knew [1483]many monks and widows grievously troubled with melancholy,\nand that from this sole cause.\" [1484]Ludovicus Mercatus, _l. 2. de\nmulierum affect. cap. 4_, and Rodericus a Castro, _de morbis mulier. l. 2.\nc. 3_, treat largely of this subject, and will have it produce a peculiar\nkind of melancholy in stale maids, nuns, and widows, _Ob suppressionem\nmensium et venerem omissam, timidae, moestae anxiae, verecundae,\nsuspicioscae, languentes, consilii inopes, cum summa vitae et rerum\nmeliorum desperatione_, &c., they are melancholy in the highest degree, and\nall for want of husbands. Aelianus Montaltus, _cap. 37. de melanchol._,\nconfirms as much out of Galen; so doth Wierus, Christophorus a Vega _de\nart. med. lib. 3. c. 14_, relates many such examples of men and women, that\nhe had seen so melancholy. Felix Plater in the first book of his\nObservations, [1485]\"tells a story of an ancient gentleman in Alsatia, that\nmarried a young wife, and was not able to pay his debts in that kind for a\nlong time together, by reason of his several infirmities: but she, because\nof this inhibition of Venus, fell into a horrible fury, and desired every\none that came to see her, by words, looks, and gestures, to have to do with\nher,\" &c. [1486]Bernardus Paternus, a physician, saith, \"He knew a good\nhonest godly priest, that because he would neither willingly marry, nor\nmake use of the stews, fell into grievous melancholy fits.\" Hildesheim,\n_spicel. 2_, hath such another example of an Italian melancholy priest, in\na consultation had _Anno_ 1580. Jason Pratensis gives instance in a married\nman, that from his wife's death abstaining, [1487]\"after marriage, became\nexceedingly melancholy,\" Rodericus a Fonseca in a young man so misaffected,\n_Tom. 2. consult. 85._ To these you may add, if you please, that conceited\ntale of a Jew, so visited in like sort, and so cured, out of Poggius\nFlorentinus.\n\nIntemperate Venus is all but as bad in the other extreme. Galen, _l. 6. de\nmortis popular. sect. 5. text. 26_, reckons up melancholy amongst those\ndiseases which are [1488]\"exasperated by venery:\" so doth Avicenna, _2, 3,\nc. 11._ Oribasius, _loc. citat._ Ficinus, _lib. 2. de sanitate tuenda_.\nMarsilius Cognatus, Montaltus, _cap. 27._ Guianerius, _Tract. 3. cap. 2._\nMagninus, _cap. 5. part. 3._ [1489]gives the reason, because [1490]\"it\ninfrigidates and dries up the body, consumes the spirits; and would\ntherefore have all such as are cold and dry to take heed of and to avoid it\nas a mortal enemy.\" Jacchinus _in 9 Rhasis, cap. 15_, ascribes the same\ncause, and instanceth in a patient of his, that married a young wife in a\nhot summer, [1491]\"and so dried himself with chamber-work, that he became\nin short space from melancholy, mad:\" he cured him by moistening remedies.\nThe like example I find in Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus, _consult. 129_, of a\ngentleman of Venice, that upon the same occasion was first melancholy,\nafterwards mad. Read in him the story at large.\n\nAny other evacuation stopped will cause it, as well as these above named,\nbe it bile, [1492]ulcer, issue, &c. Hercules de Saxonia, _lib. 1. c. 16_,\nand Gordonius, verify this out of their experience. They saw one wounded in\nthe head who as long as the sore was open, _Lucida habuit mentis\nintervalla_, was well; but when it was stopped, _Rediit melancholia_, his\nmelancholy fit seized on him again.\n\nArtificial evacuations are much like in effect, as hot houses, baths,\nbloodletting, purging, unseasonably and immoderately used. [1493]Baths dry\ntoo much, if used in excess, be they natural or artificial, and offend\nextreme hot, or cold; [1494]one dries, the other refrigerates overmuch.\nMontanus, _consil. 137_, saith, they overheat the liver. Joh. Struthius,\n_Stigmat. artis. l. 4. c. 9_, contends, [1495]\"that if one stay longer than\nordinary at the bath, go in too oft, or at unseasonable times, he putrefies\nthe humours in his body.\" To this purpose writes Magninus, _l. 3. c. 5._\nGuianerius, _Tract. 15. c. 21_, utterly disallows all hot baths in\nmelancholy adust. [1496]\"I saw\" (saith he) \"a man that laboured of the\ngout, who to be freed of this malady came to the bath, and was instantly\ncured of his disease, but got another worse, and that was madness.\" But\nthis judgment varies as the humour doth, in hot or cold: baths may be good\nfor one melancholy man, bad for another; that which will cure it in this\nparty, may cause it in a second.\n\n_Phlebotomy_.] Phlebotomy, many times neglected, may do much harm to the\nbody, when there is a manifest redundance of bad humours, and melancholy\nblood; and when these humours heat and boil, if this be not used in time,\nthe parties affected, so inflamed, are in great danger to be mad; but if it\nbe unadvisedly, importunely, immoderately used, it doth as much harm by\nrefrigerating the body, dulling the spirits, and consuming them: as Joh.\n[1497]Curio in his 10th chapter well reprehends, such kind of letting blood\ndoth more hurt than good: [1498]\"The humours rage much more than they did\nbefore, and is so far from avoiding melancholy, that it increaseth it, and\nweakeneth the sight.\" [1499]Prosper Calenus observes as much of all\nphlebotomy, except they keep a very good diet after it; yea, and as\n[1500]Leonartis Jacchinus speaks out of his own experience, [1501]\"The\nblood is much blacker to many men after their letting of blood than it was\nat first.\" For this cause belike Salust. Salvinianus, _l. 2. c. 1_, will\nadmit or hear of no bloodletting at all in this disease, except it be\nmanifest it proceed from blood: he was (it appears) by his own words in\nthat place, master of an hospital of mad men, [1502]\"and found by long\nexperience, that this kind of evacuation, either in head, arm, or any other\npart, did more harm than good.\" To this opinion of his, [1503]Felix Plater\nis quite opposite, \"though some wink at, disallow and quite contradict all\nphlebotomy in melancholy, yet by long experience I have found innumerable\nso saved, after they had been twenty, nay, sixty times let blood, and to\nlive happily after it. It was an ordinary thing of old, in Galen's time, to\ntake at once from such men six pounds of blood, which now we dare scarce\ntake in ounces: _sed viderint medici_;\" great books are written of this\nsubject.\n\nPurging upward and downward, in abundance of bad humours omitted, may be\nfor the worst; so likewise as in the precedent, if overmuch, too frequent\nor violent, it [1504]weakeneth their strength, saith Fuchsius, _l. 2.\nsect., 2 c. 17_, or if they be strong or able to endure physic, yet it\nbrings them to an ill habit, they make their bodies no better than\napothecaries' shops, this and such like infirmities must needs follow.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Bad Air, a cause of Melancholy_.\n\nAir is a cause of great moment, in producing this, or any other disease,\nbeing that it is still taken into our bodies by respiration, and our more\ninner parts. [1505]\"If it be impure and foggy, it dejects the spirits, and\ncauseth diseases by infection of the heart,\" as Paulus hath it, _lib. 1. c.\n49._ Avicenna, _lib. 1. Gal. de san. tuenda_. Mercurialis, Montaltus, &c.\n[1506]Fernelius saith, \"A thick air thickeneth the blood and humours.\"\n[1507]Lemnius reckons up two main things most profitable, and most\npernicious to our bodies; air and diet: and this peculiar disease, nothing\nsooner causeth [1508](Jobertus holds) \"than the air wherein we breathe and\nlive.\" [1509]Such as is the air, such be our spirits; and as our spirits,\nsuch are our humours. It offends commonly if it be too [1510]hot and dry,\nthick, fuliginous, cloudy, blustering, or a tempestuous air. Bodine in his\nfifth Book, _De repub. cap. 1, 5_, of his Method of History, proves that\nhot countries are most troubled with melancholy, and that there are\ntherefore in Spain, Africa, and Asia Minor, great numbers of mad men,\ninsomuch that they are compelled in all cities of note, to build peculiar\nhospitals for them. Leo [1511]Afer, _lib. 3. de Fessa urbe_, Ortelius and\nZuinger, confirm as much: they are ordinarily so choleric in their\nspeeches, that scarce two words pass without railing or chiding in common\ntalk, and often quarrelling in their streets. [1512]Gordonius will have\nevery man take notice of it: \"Note this\" (saith he) \"that in hot countries\nit is far more familiar than in cold.\" Although this we have now said be\nnot continually so, for as [1513]Acosta truly saith, under the Equator\nitself, is a most temperate habitation, wholesome air, a paradise of\npleasure: the leaves ever green, cooling showers. But it holds in such as\nare intemperately hot, as [1514]Johannes a Meggen found in Cyprus, others\nin Malta, Aupulia, and the [1515]Holy Land, where at some seasons of the\nyear is nothing but dust, their rivers dried up, the air scorching hot, and\nearth inflamed; insomuch that many pilgrims going barefoot for devotion\nsake, from Joppa to Jerusalem upon the hot sands, often run mad, or else\nquite overwhelmed with sand, _profundis arenis_, as in many parts of\nAfrica, Arabia Deserta, Bactriana, now Charassan, when the west wind blows\n[1516]_Involuti arenis transeuntes necantur_. [1517]Hercules de Saxonia, a\nprofessor in Venice, gives this cause why so many Venetian women are\nmelancholy, _Quod diu sub sole degant_, they tarry too long in the sun.\nMontanus, _consil. 21_, amongst other causes assigns this; Why that Jew his\npatient was mad, _Quod tam multum exposuit se calori et frigori_: he\nexposed himself so much to heat and cold, and for that reason in Venice,\nthere is little stirring in those brick paved streets in summer about noon,\nthey are most part then asleep: as they are likewise in the great Mogol's\ncountries, and all over the East Indies. At Aden in Arabia, as [1518]\nLodovicus Vertomannus relates in his travels, they keep their markets in\nthe night, to avoid extremity of heat; and in Ormus, like cattle in a\npasture, people of all sorts lie up to the chin in water all day long. At\nBraga in Portugal; Burgos in Castile; Messina in Sicily, all over Spain and\nItaly, their streets are most part narrow, to avoid the sunbeams. The Turks\nwear great turbans _ad fugandos solis radios_, to refract the sunbeams; and\nmuch inconvenience that hot air of Bantam in Java yields to our men, that\nsojourn there for traffic; where it is so hot, [1519]\"that they that are\nsick of the pox, lie commonly bleaching in the sun, to dry up their sores.\"\nSuch a complaint I read of those isles of Cape Verde, fourteen degrees from\nthe Equator, they do _male audire_: [1520]One calls them the unhealthiest\nclime of the world, for fluxes, fevers, frenzies, calentures, which\ncommonly seize on seafaring men that touch at them, and all by reason of a\nhot distemperature of the air. The hardiest men are offended with this\nheat, and stiffest clowns cannot resist it, as Constantine affirms,\n_Agricult. l. 2. c. 45._ They that are naturally born in such air, may not\n[1521]endure it, as Niger records of some part of Mesopotamia, now called\nDiarbecha: _Quibusdam in locis saevienti aestui adeo subjecta est, ut\npleraque animalia fervore solis et coeli extinguantur_, 'tis so hot there\nin some places, that men of the country and cattle are killed with it; and\n[1522]Adricomius of Arabia Felix, by reason of myrrh, frankincense, and hot\nspices there growing, the air is so obnoxious to their brains, that the\nvery inhabitants at some times cannot abide it, much less weaklings and\nstrangers. [1523]Amatus Lusitanus, _cent. 1. curat. 45_, reports of a young\nmaid, that was one Vincent a currier's daughter, some thirteen years of\nage, that would wash her hair in the heat of the day (in July) and so let\nit dry in the sun, [1524]\"to make it yellow, but by that means tarrying too\nlong in the heat, she inflamed her head, and made herself mad.\"\n\nCold air in the other extreme is almost as bad as hot, and so doth\nMontaltus esteem of it, _c. 11_, if it be dry withal. In those northern\ncountries, the people are therefore generally dull, heavy, and many\nwitches, which (as I have before quoted) Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus, Baptista\nPorta ascribe to melancholy. But these cold climes are more subject to\nnatural melancholy (not this artificial) which is cold and dry: for which\ncause [1525]Mercurius Britannicus belike puts melancholy men to inhabit\njust under the Pole. The worst of the three is a [1526]thick, cloudy,\nmisty, foggy air, or such as come from fens, moorish grounds, lakes,\nmuck-hills, draughts, sinks, where any carcasses, or carrion lies, or from\nwhence any stinking fulsome smell comes: Galen, Avicenna, Mercurialis, new\nand old physicians, hold that such air is unwholesome, and engenders\nmelancholy, plagues, and what not? [1527]Alexandretta, an haven-town in the\nMediterranean Sea, Saint John de Ulloa, an haven in Nova-Hispania, are much\ncondemned for a bad air, so are Durazzo in Albania, Lithuania, Ditmarsh,\nPomptinae Paludes in Italy, the territories about Pisa, Ferrara, &c. Romney\nMarsh with us; the Hundreds in Essex, the fens in Lincolnshire. Cardan, _de\nrerum varietate, l. 17, c. 96_, finds fault with the sight of those rich,\nand most populous cities in the Low Countries, as Bruges, Ghent, Amsterdam,\nLeiden, Utrecht, &c. the air is bad; and so at Stockholm in Sweden; Regium\nin Italy, Salisbury with us, Hull and Lynn: they may be commodious for\nnavigation, this new kind of fortification, and many other good necessary\nuses; but are they so wholesome? Old Rome hath descended from the hills to\nthe valley, 'tis the site of most of our new cities, and held best to build\nin plains, to take the opportunity of rivers. Leander Albertus pleads hard\nfor the air and site of Venice, though the black moorish lands appear at\nevery low water: the sea, fire, and smoke (as he thinks) qualify the air;\nand [1528]some suppose, that a thick foggy air helps the memory, as in them\nof Pisa in Italy; and our Camden, out of Plato, commends the site of\nCambridge, because it is so near the fens. But let the site of such places\nbe as it may, how can they be excused that have a delicious seat, a\npleasant air, and all that nature can afford, and yet through their own\nnastiness, and sluttishness, immund and sordid manner of life, suffer their\nair to putrefy, and themselves to be chocked up? Many cities in Turkey do\n_male audire_ in this kind: Constantinople itself, where commonly carrion\nlies in the street. Some find the same fault in Spain, even in Madrid, the\nking's seat, a most excellent air, a pleasant site; but the inhabitants are\nslovens, and the streets uncleanly kept.\n\nA troublesome tempestuous air is as bad as impure, rough and foul weather,\nimpetuous winds, cloudy dark days, as it is commonly with us, _Coelum visu\nfoedum_, [1529]Polydore calls it a filthy sky, _et in quo facile generantur\nnubes_; as Tully's brother Quintus wrote to him in Rome, being then\nquaestor in Britain. \"In a thick and cloudy air\" (saith Lemnius) \"men are\ntetric, sad, and peevish: And if the western winds blow, and that there be\na calm, or a fair sunshine day, there is a kind of alacrity in men's minds;\nit cheers up men and beasts: but if it be a turbulent, rough, cloudy,\nstormy weather, men are sad, lumpish, and much dejected, angry, waspish,\ndull, and melancholy.\" This was [1530]Virgil's experiment of old,\n\n       \"Verum ubi tempestas, et coeli mobilis humor\n        Mutavere vices, et Jupiter humidus Austro,\n        Vertuntur species animorum, et pectore motus\n        Concipiunt alios\"------\n\n       \"But when the face of Heaven changed is\n          To tempests, rain, from season fair:\n        Our minds are altered, and in our breasts\n          Forthwith some new conceits appear.\"\n\nAnd who is not weather-wise against such and such conjunctions of planets,\nmoved in foul weather, dull and heavy in such tempestuous seasons? [1531]\n_Gelidum contristat Aquarius annum_: the time requires, and the autumn\nbreeds it; winter is like unto it, ugly, foul, squalid, the air works on\nall men, more or less, but especially on such as are melancholy, or\ninclined to it, as Lemnius holds, [1532]\"They are most moved with it, and\nthose which are already mad, rave downright, either in, or against a\ntempest. Besides, the devil many times takes his opportunity of such\nstorms, and when the humours by the air be stirred, he goes in with them,\nexagitates our spirits, and vexeth our souls; as the sea waves, so are the\nspirits and humours in our bodies tossed with tempestuous winds and\nstorms.\" To such as are melancholy therefore, Montanus, _consil. 24_, will\nhave tempestuous and rough air to be avoided, and _consil. 27_, all night\nair, and would not have them to walk abroad, but in a pleasant day.\nLemnius, _l. 3. c. 3_, discommends the south and eastern winds, commends\nthe north. Montanus, _consil. 31._ [1533]\"Will not any windows to be opened\nin the night.\" _Consil. 229. et consil. 230_, he discommends especially the\nsouth wind, and nocturnal air: So doth [1534]Plutarch. The night and\ndarkness makes men sad, the like do all subterranean vaults, dark houses in\ncaves and rocks, desert places cause melancholy in an instant, especially\nsuch as have not been used to it, or otherwise accustomed.

VI.--_Immoderate Exercise a cause, and how.

Fernelius out of Galen, _Path. lib. 1.\nc. 16_, saith, [1535]\"That much exercise and weariness consumes the spirits\nand substance, refrigerates the body; and such humours which Nature would\nhave otherwise concocted and expelled, it stirs up and makes them rage:\nwhich being so enraged, diversely affect and trouble the body and mind.\" So\ndoth it, if it be unseasonably used, upon a full stomach, or when the body\nis full of crudities, which Fuchsius so much inveighs against, _lib. 2.\ninstit. sec. 2. c. 4_, giving that for a cause, why schoolboys in Germany\nare so often scabbed, because they use exercise presently after meats.\n[1536]Bayerus puts in a caveat against such exercise, because \"it\n[1537]corrupts the meat in the stomach, and carries the same juice raw, and\nas yet undigested, into the veins\" (saith Lemnius), \"which there putrefies\nand confounds the animal spirits.\" Crato, _consil. 21. l. 2_,\n[1538]protests against all such exercise after meat, as being the greatest\nenemy to concoction that may be, and cause of corruption of humours, which\nproduce this, and many other diseases. Not without good reason then doth\nSalust. Salvianus, _l. 2. c. 1_, and Leonartus Jacchinus, _in 9. Rhasis_,\nMercurialis, Arcubanus, and many other, set down [1539]immoderate exercise\nas a most forcible cause of melancholy.\n\nOpposite to exercise is idleness (the badge of gentry) or want of exercise,\nthe bane of body and mind, the nurse of naughtiness, stepmother of\ndiscipline, the chief author of all mischief, one of the seven deadly sins,\nand a sole cause of this and many other maladies, the devil's cushion, as\n[1540]Gualter calls it, his pillow and chief reposal. \"For the mind can\nnever rest, but still meditates on one thing or other, except it be\noccupied about some honest business, of his own accord it rusheth into\nmelancholy.\" [1541]\"As too much and violent exercise offends on the one\nside, so doth an idle life on the other\" (saith Crato), \"it fills the body\nfull of phlegm, gross humours, and all manner of obstructions, rheums,\ncatarrhs,\" &c. Rhasis, _cont. lib. 1. tract. 9_, accounts of it as the\ngreatest cause of melancholy. [1542]\"I have often seen\" (saith he) \"that\nidleness begets this humour more than anything else.\" Montaltus, _c. 1_,\nseconds him out of his experience, [1543]\"They that are idle are far more\nsubject to melancholy than such as are conversant or employed about any\noffice or business.\" [1544]Plutarch reckons up idleness for a sole cause of\nthe sickness of the soul: \"There are they\" (saith he) \"troubled in mind,\nthat have no other cause but this.\" Homer, _Iliad. 1_, brings in Achilles\neating of his own heart in his idleness, because he might not fight.\nMercurialis, _consil. 86_, for a melancholy young man urgeth, [1545]it as a\nchief cause; why was he melancholy? because idle. Nothing begets it sooner,\nincreaseth and continueth it oftener than idleness. [1546]A disease\nfamiliar to all idle persons, an inseparable companion to such as live at\nease, _Pingui otio desidiose agentes_, a life out of action, and have no\ncalling or ordinary employment to busy themselves about, that have small\noccasions; and though they have, such is their laziness, dullness, they\nwill not compose themselves to do aught; they cannot abide work, though it\nbe necessary; easy as to dress themselves, write a letter, or the like; yet\nas he that is benumbed with cold sits still shaking, that might relieve\nhimself with a little exercise or stirring, do they complain, but will not\nuse the facile and ready means to do themselves good; and so are still\ntormented with melancholy. Especially if they have been formerly brought up\nto business, or to keep much company, and upon a sudden come to lead a\nsedentary life; it crucifies their souls, and seizeth on them in an\ninstant; for whilst they are any ways employed, in action, discourse, about\nany business, sport or recreation, or in company to their liking, they are\nvery well; but if alone or idle, tormented instantly again; one day's\nsolitariness, one hour's sometimes, doth them more harm, than a week's\nphysic, labour, and company can do good. Melancholy seizeth on them\nforthwith being alone, and is such a torture, that as wise Seneca well\nsaith, _Malo mihi male quam molliter esse_, I had rather be sick than idle.\nThis idleness is either of body or mind. That of body is nothing but a kind\nof benumbing laziness, intermitting exercise, which, if we may believe\n[1547]Fernelius, \"causeth crudities, obstructions, excremental humours,\nquencheth the natural heat, dulls the spirits, and makes them unapt to do\nany thing whatsoever.\"\n\n[1548] \"Neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris.\"\n\n        ------\"for, a neglected field\n        Shall for the fire its thorns and thistles yield.\"\n\nAs fern grows in untilled grounds, and all manner of weeds, so do gross\nhumours in an idle body, _Ignavum corrumpunt otia corpus_. A horse in a\nstable that never travels, a hawk in a mew that seldom flies, are both\nsubject to diseases; which left unto themselves, are most free from any\nsuch encumbrances. An idle dog will be mangy, and how shall an idle person\nthink to escape? Idleness of the mind is much worse than this of the body;\nwit without employment is a disease [1549]_Aerugo animi, rubigo ingenii_:\nthe rust of the soul, [1550]a plague, a hell itself, _Maximum animi\nnocumentum_, Galen, calls it. [1551]\"As in a standing pool, worms and\nfilthy creepers increase, (_et vitium capiunt ni moveantur aquae_, the\nwater itself putrefies, and air likewise, if it be not continually stirred\nby the wind) so do evil and corrupt thoughts in an idle person,\" the soul\nis contaminated. In a commonwealth, where is no public enemy, there is\nlikely civil wars, and they rage upon themselves: this body of ours, when\nit is idle, and knows not how to bestow itself, macerates and vexeth itself\nwith cares, griefs, false fears, discontents, and suspicions; it tortures\nand preys upon his own bowels, and is never at rest. Thus much I dare\nboldly say; he or she that is idle, be they of what condition they will,\nnever so rich, so well allied, fortunate, happy, let them have all things\nin abundance and felicity that heart can wish and desire, all contentment,\nso long as he or she or they are idle, they shall never be pleased, never\nwell in body and mind, but weary still, sickly still, vexed still, loathing\nstill, weeping, sighing, grieving, suspecting, offended with the world,\nwith every object, wishing themselves gone or dead, or else earned away\nwith some foolish phantasy or other. And this is the true cause that so\nmany great men, ladies, and gentlewomen, labour of this disease in country\nand city; for idleness is an appendix to nobility; they count it a disgrace\nto work, and spend all their days in sports, recreations, and pastimes, and\nwill therefore take no pains; be of no vocation: they feed liberally, fare\nwell, want exercise, action, employment, (for to work, I say, they may not\nabide,) and Company to their desires, and thence their bodies become full\nof gross humours, wind, crudities; their minds disquieted, dull, heavy, &c.\ncare, jealousy, fear of some diseases, sullen fits, weeping fits seize too\n[1552]familiarly on them. For what will not fear and phantasy work in an\nidle body? what distempers will they not cause? when the children of [1553]\nIsrael murmured against Pharaoh in Egypt, he commanded his officers to\ndouble their task, and let them get straw themselves, and yet make their\nfull number of bricks; for the sole cause why they mutiny, and are evil at\nease, is, \"they are idle.\" When you shall hear and see so many discontented\npersons in all places where you come, so many several grievances,\nunnecessary complaints, fears, suspicions, [1554]the best means to redress\nit is to set them awork, so to busy their minds; for the truth is, they are\nidle. Well they may build castles in the air for a time, and sooth up\nthemselves with fantastical and pleasant humours, but in the end they will\nprove as bitter as gall, they shall be still I say discontent, suspicious,\n[1555]fearful, jealous, sad, fretting and vexing of themselves; so long as\nthey be idle, it is impossible to please them, _Otio qui nescit uti, plus\nhabet negotii quam qui negotium in negotio_, as that [1556]Agellius could\nobserve: He that knows not how to spend his time, hath more business, care,\ngrief, anguish of mind, than he that is most busy in the midst of all his\nbusiness. _Otiosus animus nescit quid volet_: An idle person (as he follows\nit) knows not when he is well, what he would have, or whither he would go,\n_Quum illuc ventum est, illinc lubet_, he is tired out with everything,\ndispleased with all, weary of his life: _Nec bene domi, nec militiae_,\nneither at home nor abroad, _errat, et praeter vitam vivitur_, he wanders\nand lives besides himself. In a word, What the mischievous effects of\nlaziness and idleness are, I do not find any where more accurately\nexpressed, than in these verses of Philolaches in the [1557]Comical Poet,\nwhich for their elegancy I will in part insert.\n\n       \"Novarum aedium esse arbitror similem ego hominem,\n        Quando hic natus est: Ei rei argumenta dicam.\n        Aedes quando sunt ad amussim expolitae,\n        Quisque laudat fabrum, atque exemplum expetit, &c.\n        At ubi illo migrat nequam homo indiligensque, &c.\n        Tempestas venit, confringit tegulas, imbricesque,\n        Putrifacit aer operam fabri, &c.\n        Dicam ut homines similes esse aedium arbitremini,\n        Fabri parentes fundamentum substruunt liberorum,\n        Expoliunt, docent literas, nec parcunt sumptui,\n        Ego autem sub fabrorum potestate frugi fui,\n        Postquam autem migravi in ingenium meum,\n        Perdidi operam fabrorum illico oppido,\n        Venit ignavia, ea mihi tempestas fuit,\n        Adventuque suo grandinem et imbrem attulit,\n        Illa mihi virtutem deturbavit,\" &c.\n\nA young man is like a fair new house, the carpenter leaves it well built,\nin good repair, of solid stuff; but a bad tenant lets it rain in, and for\nwant of reparation, fall to decay, &c. Our parents, tutors, friends, spare\nno cost to bring us up in our youth, in all manner of virtuous education;\nbut when we are left to ourselves, idleness as a tempest drives all\nvirtuous motions out of our minds, et _nihili sumus_, on a sudden, by sloth\nand such bad ways, we come to nought.\n\nCousin german to idleness, and a concomitant cause, which goes hand in hand\nwith it, is [1558]_nimia solitudo_, too much solitariness, by the testimony\nof all physicians, cause and symptom both; but as it is here put for a\ncause, it is either coact, enforced, or else voluntary. Enforced\nsolitariness is commonly seen in students, monks, friars, anchorites, that\nby their order and course of life must abandon all company, society of\nother men, and betake themselves to a private cell: _Otio superstitioso\nseclusi_, as Bale and Hospinian well term it, such as are the Carthusians\nof our time, that eat no flesh (by their order), keep perpetual silence,\nnever go abroad. Such as live in prison, or some desert place, and cannot\nhave company, as many of our country gentlemen do in solitary houses, they\nmust either be alone without companions, or live beyond their means, and\nentertain all comers as so many hosts, or else converse with their servants\nand hinds, such as are unequal, inferior to them, and of a contrary\ndisposition: or else as some do, to avoid solitariness, spend their time\nwith lewd fellows in taverns, and in alehouses, and thence addict\nthemselves to some unlawful disports, or dissolute courses. Divers again\nare cast upon this rock of solitariness for want of means, or out of a\nstrong apprehension of some infirmity, disgrace, or through bashfulness,\nrudeness, simplicity, they cannot apply themselves to others' company.\n_Nullum solum infelici gratius solitudine, ubi nullus sit qui miseriam\nexprobret_; this enforced solitariness takes place, and produceth his\neffect soonest in such as have spent their time jovially, peradventure in\nall honest recreations, in good company, in some great family or populous\ncity, and are upon a sudden confined to a desert country cottage far off,\nrestrained of their liberty, and barred from their ordinary associates;\nsolitariness is very irksome to such, most tedious, and a sudden cause of\ngreat inconvenience.\n\nVoluntary solitariness is that which is familiar with melancholy, and\ngently brings on like a Siren, a shoeing-horn, or some sphinx to this\nirrevocable gulf, [1559]a primary cause, Piso calls it; most pleasant it is\nat first, to such as are melancholy given, to lie in bed whole days, and\nkeep their chambers, to walk alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and\nwater, by a brook side, to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant\nsubject, which shall affect them most; _amabilis insania, et mentis\ngratissimus error_: a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise,\nand build castles in the air, to go smiling to themselves, acting an\ninfinite variety of parts, which they suppose and strongly imagine they\nrepresent, or that they see acted or done: _Blandae quidem ab initio_,\nsaith Lemnius, to conceive and meditate of such pleasant things, sometimes,\n[1560]\"present, past, or to come,\" as Rhasis speaks. So delightsome these\ntoys are at first, they could spend whole days and nights without sleep,\neven whole years alone in such contemplations, and fantastical meditations,\nwhich are like unto dreams, and they will hardly be drawn from them, or\nwillingly interrupt, so pleasant their vain conceits are, that they hinder\ntheir ordinary tasks and necessary business, they cannot address themselves\nto them, or almost to any study or employment, these fantastical and\nbewitching thoughts so covertly, so feelingly, so urgently, so continually\nset upon, creep in, insinuate, possess, overcome, distract, and detain\nthem, they cannot, I say, go about their more necessary business, stave off\nor extricate themselves, but are ever musing, melancholising, and carried\nalong, as he (they say) that is led round about a heath with a Puck in the\nnight, they run earnestly on in this labyrinth of anxious and solicitous\nmelancholy meditations, and cannot well or willingly refrain, or easily\nleave off, winding and unwinding themselves, as so many clocks, and still\npleasing their humours, until at last the scene is turned upon a sudden, by\nsome bad object, and they being now habituated to such vain meditations and\nsolitary places, can endure no company, can ruminate of nothing but harsh\nand distasteful subjects. Fear, sorrow, suspicion, _subrusticus pudor_,\ndiscontent, cares, and weariness of life surprise them in a moment, and\nthey can think of nothing else, continually suspecting, no sooner are their\neyes open, but this infernal plague of melancholy seizeth on them, and\nterrifies their souls, representing some dismal object to their minds,\nwhich now by no means, no labour, no persuasions they can avoid, _haeret\nlateri lethalis arundo_, (the arrow of death still remains in the side),\nthey may not be rid of it, [1561]they cannot resist. I may not deny but\nthat there is some profitable meditation, contemplation, and kind of\nsolitariness to be embraced, which the fathers so highly commended, [1562]\nHierom, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Austin, in whole tracts, which Petrarch,\nErasmus, Stella, and others, so much magnify in their books; a paradise, a\nheaven on earth, if it be used aright, good for the body, and better for\nthe soul: as many of those old monks used it, to divine contemplations, as\nSimulus, a courtier in Adrian's time, Diocletian the emperor, retired\nthemselves, &c., in that sense, _Vatia solus scit vivere_, Vatia lives\nalone, which the Romans were wont to say, when they commended a country\nlife. Or to the bettering of their knowledge, as Democritus, Cleanthes, and\nthose excellent philosophers have ever done, to sequester themselves from\nthe tumultuous world, or as in Pliny's villa Laurentana, Tully's Tusculan,\nJovius' study, that they might better _vacare studiis et Deo_, serve God,\nand follow their studies. Methinks, therefore, our too zealous innovators\nwere not so well advised in that general subversion of abbeys and religious\nhouses, promiscuously to fling down all; they might have taken away those\ngross abuses crept in amongst them, rectified such inconveniences, and not\nso far to have raved and raged against those fair buildings, and\neverlasting monuments of our forefathers' devotion, consecrated to pious\nuses; some monasteries and collegiate cells might have been well spared,\nand their revenues otherwise employed, here and there one, in good towns or\ncities at least, for men and women of all sorts and conditions to live in,\nto sequester themselves from the cares and tumults of the world, that were\nnot desirous, or fit to marry; or otherwise willing to be troubled with\ncommon affairs, and know not well where to bestow themselves, to live apart\nin, for more conveniency, good education, better company sake, to follow\ntheir studies (I say), to the perfection of arts and sciences, common good,\nand as some truly devoted monks of old had done, freely and truly to serve\nGod. For these men are neither solitary, nor idle, as the poet made answer\nto the husbandman in Aesop, that objected idleness to him; he was never so\nidle as in his company; or that Scipio Africanus in [1563]Tully, _Nunquam\nminus solus, quam cum solus; nunquam minus otiosus, quam quum esset\notiosus_; never less solitary, than when he was alone, never more busy,\nthan when he seemed to be most idle. It is reported by Plato in his\ndialogue _de Amore_, in that prodigious commendation of Socrates, how a\ndeep meditation coming into Socrates' mind by chance, he stood still\nmusing, _eodem vestigio cogitabundus_, from morning to noon, and when as\nthen he had not yet finished his meditation, _perstabat cogitans_, he so\ncontinued till the evening, the soldiers (for he then followed the camp)\nobserved him with admiration, and on set purpose watched all night, but he\npersevered immovable _ad exhortim solis_, till the sun rose in the morning,\nand then saluting the sun, went his ways. In what humour constant Socrates\ndid thus, I know not, or how he might be affected, but this would be\npernicious to another man; what intricate business might so really possess\nhim, I cannot easily guess; but this is _otiosum otium_, it is far\notherwise with these men, according to Seneca, _Omnia nobis mala solitudo\npersuadet_; this solitude undoeth us, _pugnat cum vita sociali_; 'tis a\ndestructive solitariness. These men are devils alone, as the saying is,\n_Homo solus aut Deus, aut Daemon_: a man alone, is either a saint or a\ndevil, _mens ejus aut languescit, aut tumescit_; and [1564]_Vae soli_ in\nthis sense, woe be to him that is so alone. These wretches do frequently\ndegenerate from men, and of sociable creatures become beasts, monsters,\ninhumane, ugly to behold, _Misanthropi_; they do even loathe themselves,\nand hate the company of men, as so many Timons, Nebuchadnezzars, by too\nmuch indulging to these pleasing humours, and through their own default. So\nthat which Mercurialis, _consil. 11_, sometimes expostulated with his\nmelancholy patient, may be justly applied to every solitary and idle person\nin particular. [1565]_Natura de te videtur conqueri posse_, &c. \"Nature may\njustly complain of thee, that whereas she gave thee a good wholesome\ntemperature, a sound body, and God hath given thee so divine and excellent\na soul, so many good parts, and profitable gifts, thou hast not only\ncontemned and rejected, but hast corrupted them, polluted them, overthrown\ntheir temperature, and perverted those gifts with riot, idleness,\nsolitariness, and many other ways, thou art a traitor to God and nature, an\nenemy to thyself and to the world.\" _Perditio tua ex te_; thou hast lost\nthyself wilfully, cast away thyself, \"thou thyself art the efficient cause\nof thine own misery, by not resisting such vain cogitations, but giving way\nunto them.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. VII.--_Sleeping and Waking, Causes_.\n\nWhat I have formerly said of exercise, I may now repeat of sleep. Nothing\nbetter than moderate sleep, nothing worse than it, if it be in extremes, or\nunseasonably used. It is a received opinion, that a melancholy man cannot\nsleep overmuch; _Somnus supra modum prodest_, as an only antidote, and\nnothing offends them more, or causeth this malady sooner, than waking, yet\nin some cases sleep may do more harm than good, in that phlegmatic,\nswinish, cold, and sluggish melancholy which Melancthon speaks of, that\nthinks of waters, sighing most part, &c. [1566]It dulls the spirits, if\novermuch, and senses; fills the head full of gross humours; causeth\ndistillations, rheums, great store of excrements in the brain, and all the\nother parts, as [1567]Fuchsius speaks of them, that sleep like so many\ndormice. Or if it be used in the daytime, upon a full stomach, the body\nill-composed to rest, or after hard meats, it increaseth fearful dreams,\nincubus, night walking, crying out, and much unquietness; such sleep\nprepares the body, as [1568]one observes, \"to many perilous diseases.\" But,\nas I have said, waking overmuch, is both a symptom, and an ordinary cause.\n\"It causeth dryness of the brain, frenzy, dotage, and makes the body dry,\nlean, hard, and ugly to behold,\" as [1569]Lemnius hath it. \"The temperature\nof the brain is corrupted by it, the humours adust, the eyes made to sink\ninto the head, choler increased, and the whole body inflamed:\" and, as may\nbe added out of Galen, _3. de sanitate tuendo_, Avicenna _3. 1._ [1570]\"It\noverthrows the natural heat, it causeth crudities, hurts, concoction,\" and\nwhat not? Not without good cause therefore Crato, _consil. 21. lib. 2_;\nHildesheim, _spicel. 2. de delir. et Mania_, Jacchinus, Arculanus on\nRhasis, Guianerius and Mercurialis, reckon up this overmuch waking as a\nprincipal cause.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Passions and Perturbations of the Mind, how they cause\nMelancholy_.\n\nAs that gymnosophist in [1571]Plutarch made answer to Alexander (demanding\nwhich spake best), Every one of his fellows did speak better than the\nother: so may I say of these causes; to him that shall require which is the\ngreatest, every one is more grievous than other, and this of passion the\ngreatest of all. A most frequent and ordinary cause of melancholy, [1572]\n_fulmen perturbationum_ (Picolomineus calls it) this thunder and lightning\nof perturbation, which causeth such violent and speedy alterations in this\nour microcosm, and many times subverts the good estate and temperature of\nit. For as the body works upon the mind by his bad humours, troubling the\nspirits, sending gross fumes into the brain, and so _per consequens_\ndisturbing the soul, and all the faculties of it,\n\n[1573]  ------\"Corpus onustum,\n        Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una,\"\n\nwith fear, sorrow, &c., which are ordinary symptoms of this disease: so on\nthe other side, the mind most effectually works upon the body, producing by\nhis passions and perturbations miraculous alterations, as melancholy,\ndespair, cruel diseases, and sometimes death itself. Insomuch that it is\nmost true which Plato saith in his Charmides, _omnia corporis mala ab anima\nprocedere_; all the [1574]mischiefs of the body proceed from the soul: and\nDemocritus in [1575]Plutarch urgeth, _Damnatam iri animam a corpore_, if\nthe body should in this behalf bring an action against the soul, surely the\nsoul would be cast and convicted, that by her supine negligence had caused\nsuch inconveniences, having authority over the body, and using it for an\ninstrument, as a smith doth his hammer (saith [1576]Cyprian), imputing all\nthose vices and maladies to the mind. Even so doth [1577]Philostratus, _non\ncoinquinatur corpus, nisi consensuanimae_; the body is not corrupted, but\nby the soul. Lodovicus Vives will have such turbulent commotions proceed\nfrom ignorance and indiscretion. [1578]All philosophers impute the miseries\nof the body to the soul, that should have governed it better, by command of\nreason, and hath not done it. The Stoics are altogether of opinion (as\n[1579]Lipsius and [1580]Picolomineus record), that a wise man should be\n[Greek: apathaes], without all manner of passions and perturbations\nwhatsoever, as [1581]Seneca reports of Cato, the [1582] Greeks of Socrates,\nand [1583]Io. Aubanus of a nation in Africa, so free from passion, or\nrather so stupid, that if they be wounded with a sword, they will only look\nback. [1584]Lactantius, _2 instit._, will exclude \"fear from a wise man:\"\nothers except all, some the greatest passions. But let them dispute how\nthey will, set down in Thesi, give precepts to the contrary; we find that\nof [1585]Lemnius true by common experience; \"No mortal man is free from\nthese perturbations: or if he be so, sure he is either a god, or a block.\"\nThey are born and bred with us, we have them from our parents by\ninheritance. _A parentibus habemus malum hunc assem_, saith [1586]Pelezius,\n_Nascitur una nobiscum, aliturque_, 'tis propagated from Adam, Cain was\nmelancholy, [1587]as Austin hath it, and who is not? Good discipline,\neducation, philosophy, divinity (I cannot deny), may mitigate and restrain\nthese passions in some few men at some times, but most part they domineer,\nand are so violent, [1588]that as a torrent (_torrens velut aggere rupto_)\nbears down all before, and overflows his banks, _sternit agros, sternit\nsata_, (lays waste the fields, prostrates the crops,) they overwhelm\nreason, judgment, and pervert the temperature of the body; _Fertur [1589]\nequis auriga, nec audit currus habenas_. Now such a man (saith\n[1590]Austin) \"that is so led, in a wise man's eye, is no better than he\nthat stands upon his head.\" It is doubted by some, _Gravioresne morbi a\nperturbationibus, an ab humoribus_, whether humours or perturbations cause\nthe more grievous maladies. But we find that of our Saviour, Mat. xxvi. 41,\nmost true, \"The spirit is willing, the flesh is weak,\" we cannot resist;\nand this of [1591]Philo Judeus, \"Perturbations often offend the body, and\nare most frequent causes of melancholy, turning it out of the hinges of his\nhealth.\" Vives compares them to [1592]\"Winds upon the sea, some only move\nas those great gales, but others turbulent quite overturn the ship.\" Those\nwhich are light, easy, and more seldom, to our thinking, do us little harm,\nand are therefore contemned of us: yet if they be reiterated, [1593]\"as the\nrain\" (saith Austin) \"doth a stone, so do these perturbations penetrate the\nmind:\" [1594]and (as one observes) \"produce a habit of melancholy at the\nlast,\" which having gotten the mastery in our souls, may well be called\ndiseases.\n\nHow these passions produce this effect, [1595]Agrippa hath handled at\nlarge, _Occult. Philos. l. 11. c. 63._ Cardan, _l. 14. subtil._ Lemnius,\n_l. 1. c. 12, de occult. nat. mir. et lib. 1. cap. 16._ Suarez, _Met.\ndisput. 18. sect. 1. art. 25._ T. Bright, _cap. 12._ of his Melancholy\nTreatise. Wright the Jesuit, in his Book of the Passions of the Mind, &c.\nThus in brief, to our imagination cometh by the outward sense or memory,\nsome object to be known (residing in the foremost part of the brain), which\nhe misconceiving or amplifying presently communicates to the heart, the\nseat of all affections. The pure spirits forthwith flock from the brain to\nthe heart, by certain secret channels, and signify what good or bad object\nwas presented; [1596]which immediately bends itself to prosecute, or avoid\nit; and withal, draweth with it other humours to help it: so in pleasure,\nconcur great store of purer spirits; in sadness, much melancholy blood; in\nire, choler. If the imagination be very apprehensive, intent, and violent,\nit sends great store of spirits to, or from the heart, and makes a deeper\nimpression, and greater tumult, as the humours in the body be likewise\nprepared, and the temperature itself ill or well disposed, the passions are\nlonger and stronger; so that the first step and fountain of all our\ngrievances in this kind, is [1597]_laesa imaginatio_, which misinforming\nthe heart, causeth all these distemperatures, alteration and confusion of\nspirits and humours. By means of which, so disturbed, concoction is\nhindered, and the principal parts are much debilitated; as [1598]Dr.\nNavarra well declared, being consulted by Montanus about a melancholy Jew.\nThe spirits so confounded, the nourishment must needs be abated, bad\nhumours increased, crudities and thick spirits engendered with melancholy\nblood. The other parts cannot perform their functions, having the spirits\ndrawn from them by vehement passion, but fail in sense and motion; so we\nlook upon a thing, and see it not; hear, and observe not; which otherwise\nwould much affect us, had we been free. I may therefore conclude with\n[1599]Arnoldus, _Maxima vis est phantasiae, et huic uni fere, non autem\ncorporis intemperiei, omnis melancholiae causa est ascribenda_: \"Great is\nthe force of imagination, and much more ought the cause of melancholy to be\nascribed to this alone, than to the distemperature of the body.\" Of which\nimagination, because it hath so great a stroke in producing this malady,\nand is so powerful of itself, it will not be improper to my discourse, to\nmake a brief digression, and speak of the force of it, and how it causeth\nthis alteration. Which manner of digression, howsoever some dislike, as\nfrivolous and impertinent, yet I am of [1600]Beroaldus's opinion, \"Such\ndigressions do mightily delight and refresh a weary reader, they are like\nsauce to a bad stomach, and I do therefore most willingly use them.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Of the Force of Imagination_.\n\nWhat imagination is, I have sufficiently declared in my digression of the\nanatomy of the soul. I will only now point at the wonderful effects and\npower of it; which, as it is eminent in all, so most especially it rageth\nin melancholy persons, in keeping the species of objects so long,\nmistaking, amplifying them by continual and [1601]strong meditation, until\nat length it produceth in some parties real effects, causeth this, and many\nother maladies. And although this phantasy of ours be a subordinate faculty\nto reason, and should be ruled by it, yet in many men, through inward or\noutward distemperatures, defect of organs, which are unapt, or otherwise\ncontaminated, it is likewise unapt, or hindered, and hurt. This we see\nverified in sleepers, which by reason of humours and concourse of vapours\ntroubling the phantasy, imagine many times absurd and prodigious things,\nand in such as are troubled with incubus, or witch-ridden (as we call it),\nif they lie on their backs, they suppose an old woman rides, and sits so\nhard upon them, that they are almost stifled for want of breath; when there\nis nothing offends, but a concourse of bad humours, which trouble the\nphantasy. This is likewise evident in such as walk in the night in their\nsleep, and do strange feats: [1602]these vapours move the phantasy, the\nphantasy the appetite, which moving the animal spirits causeth the body to\nwalk up and down as if they were awake. Fracast. _l. 3. de intellect_,\nrefers all ecstasies to this force of imagination, such as lie whole days\ntogether in a trance: as that priest whom [1603]Celsus speaks of, that\ncould separate himself from his senses when he list, and lie like a dead\nman, void of life and sense. Cardan brags of himself, that he could do as\nmuch, and that when he list. Many times such men when they come to\nthemselves, tell strange things of heaven and hell, what visions they have\nseen; as that St. Owen, in Matthew Paris, that went into St. Patrick's\npurgatory, and the monk of Evesham in the same author. Those common\napparitions in Bede and Gregory, Saint Bridget's revelations, Wier. _l. 3.\nde lamiis, c. 11._ Caesar Vanninus, in his Dialogues, &c. reduceth (as I\nhave formerly said), with all those tales of witches' progresses, dancing,\nriding, transformations, operations, &c. to the force of [1604]\nimagination, and the [1605]devil's illusions. The like effects almost are\nto be seen in such as are awake: how many chimeras, antics, golden\nmountains and castles in the air do they build unto themselves? I appeal to\npainters, mechanicians, mathematicians. Some ascribe all vices to a false\nand corrupt imagination, anger, revenge, lust, ambition, covetousness,\nwhich prefers falsehood before that which is right and good, deluding the\nsoul with false shows and suppositions. [1606]Bernardus Penottus will have\nheresy and superstition to proceed from this fountain; as he falsely\nimagineth, so he believeth; and as he conceiveth of it, so it must be, and\nit shall be, _contra gentes_, he will have it so. But most especially in\npassions and affections, it shows strange and evident effects: what will\nnot a fearful man conceive in the dark? What strange forms of bugbears,\ndevils, witches, goblins? Lavater imputes the greatest cause of spectrums,\nand the like apparitions, to fear, which above all other passions begets\nthe strongest imagination (saith [1607]Wierus), and so likewise love,\nsorrow, joy, &c. Some die suddenly, as she that saw her son come from the\nbattle at Cannae, &c. Jacob the patriarch, by force of imagination, made\nspeckled lambs, laying speckled rods before his sheep. Persina, that\nEthiopian queen in Heliodorus, by seeing the picture of Persius and\nAndromeda, instead of a blackamoor, was brought to bed of a fair white\nchild. In imitation of whom belike, a hard-favoured fellow in Greece,\nbecause he and his wife were both deformed, to get a good brood of\nchildren, _Elegantissimas imagines in thalamo collocavit_, &c. hung the\nfairest pictures he could buy for money in his chamber, \"That his wife by\nfrequent sight of them, might conceive and bear such children.\" And if we\nmay believe Bale, one of Pope Nicholas the Third's concubines by seeing of\n[1608]a bear was brought to bed of a monster. \"If a woman\" (saith [1609]\nLemnius), \"at the time of her conception think of another man present or\nabsent, the child will be like him.\" Great-bellied women, when they long,\nyield us prodigious examples in this kind, as moles, warts, scars,\nharelips, monsters, especially caused in their children by force of a\ndepraved phantasy in them: _Ipsam speciem quam animo effigiat, faetui\ninducit_: She imprints that stamp upon her child which she [1610]conceives\nunto herself. And therefore Lodovicus Vives, _lib. 2. de Christ, faem._,\ngives a special caution to great-bellied women, [1611]\"that they do not\nadmit such absurd conceits and cogitations, but by all means avoid those\nhorrible objects, heard or seen, or filthy spectacles.\" Some will laugh,\nweep, sigh, groan, blush, tremble, sweat, at such things as are suggested\nunto them by their imagination. Avicenna speaks of one that could cast\nhimself into a palsy when he list; and some can imitate the tunes of birds\nand beasts that they can hardly be discerned: Dagebertus' and Saint\nFrancis' scars and wounds, like those of Christ's (if at the least any such\nwere), [1612]Agrippa supposeth to have happened by force of imagination:\nthat some are turned to wolves, from men to women, and women again to men\n(which is constantly believed) to the same imagination; or from men to\nasses, dogs, or any other shapes. [1613]Wierus ascribes all those famous\ntransformations to imagination; that in hydrophobia they seem to see the\npicture of a dog, still in their water, [1614]that melancholy men and sick\nmen conceive so many fantastical visions, apparitions to themselves, and\nhave such absurd apparitions, as that they are kings, lords, cocks, bears,\napes, owls; that they are heavy, light, transparent, great and little,\nsenseless and dead (as shall be showed more at large, in our [1615]\nsections of symptoms), can be imputed to nought else, but to a corrupt,\nfalse, and violent imagination. It works not in sick and melancholy men\nonly, but even most forcibly sometimes in such as are sound: it makes them\nsuddenly sick, and [1616]alters their temperature in an instant. And\nsometimes a strong conceit or apprehension, as [1617]Valesius proves, will\ntake away diseases: in both kinds it will produce real effects. Men, if\nthey see but another man tremble, giddy or sick of some fearful disease,\ntheir apprehension and fear is so strong in this kind, that they will have\nthe same disease. Or if by some soothsayer, wiseman, fortune-teller, or\nphysician, they be told they shall have such a disease, they will so\nseriously apprehend it, that they will instantly labour of it. A thing\nfamiliar in China (saith Riccius the Jesuit), [1618]\"If it be told them\nthey shall be sick on such a day, when that day comes they will surely be\nsick, and will be so terribly afflicted, that sometimes they die upon it.\"\nDr. Cotta in his discovery of ignorant practitioners of physic, _cap. 8_,\nhath two strange stories to this purpose, what fancy is able to do. The one\nof a parson's wife in Northamptonshire, _An._ 1607, that coming to a\nphysician, and told by him that she was troubled with the sciatica, as he\nconjectured (a disease she was free from), the same night after her return,\nupon his words, fell into a grievous fit of a sciatica: and such another\nexample he hath of another good wife, that was so troubled with the cramp,\nafter the same manner she came by it, because her physician did but name\nit. Sometimes death itself is caused by force of phantasy. I have heard of\none that coming by chance in company of him that was thought to be sick of\nthe plague (which was not so) fell down suddenly dead. Another was sick of\nthe plague with conceit. One seeing his fellow let blood falls down in a\nswoon. Another (saith [1619]Cardan out of Aristotle), fell down dead (which\nis familiar to women at any ghastly sight), seeing but a man hanged. A Jew\nin France (saith [1620]Lodovicus Vives), came by chance over a dangerous\npassage or plank, that lay over a brook in the dark, without harm, the next\nday perceiving what danger he was in, fell down dead. Many will not believe\nsuch stories to be true, but laugh commonly, and deride when they hear of\nthem; but let these men consider with themselves, as [1621]Peter Byarus\nillustrates it, If they were set to walk upon a plank on high, they would\nbe giddy, upon which they dare securely walk upon the ground. Many (saith\nAgrippa), [1622]\"strong-hearted men otherwise, tremble at such sights,\ndazzle, and are sick, if they look but down from a high place, and what\nmoves them but conceit?\" As some are so molested by phantasy; so some\nagain, by fancy alone, and a good conceit, are as easily recovered. We see\ncommonly the toothache, gout, falling-sickness, biting of a mad dog, and\nmany such maladies cured by spells, words, characters, and charms, and many\ngreen wounds by that now so much used _Unguentum Armarium_, magnetically\ncured, which Crollius and Goclenius in a book of late hath defended,\nLibavius in a just tract as stiffly contradicts, and most men controvert.\nAll the world knows there is no virtue in such charms or cures, but a\nstrong conceit and opinion alone, as [1623]Pomponatius holds, \"which\nforceth a motion of the humours, spirits, and blood, which takes away the\ncause of the malady from the parts affected.\" The like we may say of our\nmagical effects, superstitious cures, and such as are done by mountebanks\nand wizards. \"As by wicked incredulity many men are hurt\" (so saith\n[1624]Wierus of charms, spells, &c.), \"we find in our experience, by the\nsame means many are relieved.\" An empiric oftentimes, and a silly\nchirurgeon, doth more strange cures than a rational physician. Nymannus\ngives a reason, because the patient puts his confidence in him, [1625]\nwhich Avicenna \"prefers before art, precepts, and all remedies whatsoever.\"\n'Tis opinion alone (saith [1626]Cardan), that makes or mars physicians, and\nhe doth the best cures, according to Hippocrates, in whom most trust. So\ndiversely doth this phantasy of ours affect, turn, and wind, so imperiously\ncommand our bodies, which as another [1627]\"Proteus, or a chameleon, can\ntake all shapes; and is of such force (as Ficinus adds), that it can work\nupon others, as well as ourselves.\" How can otherwise blear eyes in one man\ncause the like affection in another? Why doth one man's yawning [1628]make\nanother yawn? One man's pissing provoke a second many times to do the like?\nWhy doth scraping of trenchers offend a third, or hacking of files? Why\ndoth a carcass bleed when the murderer is brought before it, some weeks\nafter the murder hath been done? Why do witches and old women fascinate and\nbewitch children: but as Wierus, Paracelsus, Cardan, Mizaldus, Valleriola,\nCaesar Vanninus, Campanella, and many philosophers think, the forcible\nimagination of the one party moves and alters the spirits of the other. Nay\nmore, they can cause and cure not only diseases, maladies, and several\ninfirmities, by this means, as Avicenna, _de anim. l. 4. sect. 4_,\nsupposeth in parties remote, but move bodies from their places, cause\nthunder, lightning, tempests, which opinion Alkindus, Paracelsus, and some\nothers, approve of. So that I may certainly conclude this strong conceit or\nimagination is _astrum hominis_, and the rudder of this our ship, which\nreason should steer, but, overborne by phantasy, cannot manage, and so\nsuffers itself, and this whole vessel of ours to be overruled, and often\noverturned. Read more of this in Wierus, _l. 3. de Lamiis, c. 8, 9, 10._\nFranciscus Valesius, _med. controv. l. 5. cont. 6._ Marcellus Donatus, _l.\n2. c. 1. de hist. med. mirabil_. Levinus Lemnius, _de occult. nat. mir. l.\n1. c. 12._ Cardan, _l. 18. de rerum var_. Corn. Agrippa, _de occult.\nplilos. cap. 64, 65._ Camerarius, _1 cent. cap. 54. horarum subcis_.\nNymannus, _morat. de Imag_. Laurentius, and him that is _instar omnium_,\nFienus, a famous physician of Antwerp, that wrote three books _de viribus\nimaginationis_. I have thus far digressed, because this imagination is the\nmedium deferens of passions, by whose means they work and produce many\ntimes prodigious effects: and as the phantasy is more or less intended or\nremitted, and their humours disposed, so do perturbations move, more or\nless, and take deeper impression.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Division of Perturbations_.\n\nPerturbations and passions, which trouble the phantasy, though they dwell\nbetween the confines of sense and reason, yet they rather follow sense than\nreason, because they are drowned in corporeal organs of sense. They are\ncommonly [1629]reduced into two inclinations, irascible and concupiscible.\nThe Thomists subdivide them into eleven, six in the coveting, and five in\nthe invading. Aristotle reduceth all to pleasure and pain, Plato to love\nand hatred, [1630]Vives to good and bad. If good, it is present, and then\nwe absolutely joy and love; or to come, and then we desire and hope for it.\nIf evil, we absolute hate it; if present, it is by sorrow; if to come fear.\nThese four passions [1631]Bernard compares \"to the wheels of a chariot, by\nwhich we are carried in this world.\" All other passions are subordinate\nunto these four, or six, as some will: love, joy, desire, hatred, sorrow,\nfear; the rest, as anger, envy, emulation, pride, jealousy, anxiety, mercy,\nshame, discontent, despair, ambition, avarice, &c., are reducible unto the\nfirst; and if they be immoderate, they [1632]consume the spirits, and\nmelancholy is especially caused by them. Some few discreet men there are,\nthat can govern themselves, and curb in these inordinate affections, by\nreligion, philosophy, and such divine precepts, of meekness, patience, and\nthe like; but most part for want of government, out of indiscretion,\nignorance, they suffer themselves wholly to be led by sense, and are so far\nfrom repressing rebellious inclinations, that they give all encouragement\nunto them, leaving the reins, and using all provocations to further them:\nbad by nature, worse by art, discipline, [1633]custom, education, and a\nperverse will of their own, they follow on, wheresoever their unbridled\naffections will transport them, and do more out of custom, self-will, than\nout of reason. _Contumax voluntas_, as Melancthon calls it, _malum facit_:\nthis stubborn will of ours perverts judgment, which sees and knows what\nshould and ought to be done, and yet will not do it. _Mancipia gulae_,\nslaves to their several lusts and appetite, they precipitate and plunge\n[1634]themselves into a labyrinth of cares, blinded with lust, blinded with\nambition; [1635]\"They seek that at God's hands which they may give unto\nthemselves, if they could but refrain from those cares and perturbations,\nwherewith they continually macerate their minds.\" But giving way to these\nviolent passions of fear, grief, shame, revenge, hatred, malice, &c., they\nare torn in pieces, as Actaeon was with his dogs, and [1636]crucify their\nown souls.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Sorrow a Cause of Melancholy_.\n\n_Sorrow. Insanus dolor_.] In this catalogue of passions, which so much\ntorment the soul of man, and cause this malady, (for I will briefly speak\nof them all, and in their order,) the first place in this irascible\nappetite, may justly be challenged by sorrow. An inseparable companion,\n[1637]\"The mother and daughter of melancholy, her epitome, symptom, and\nchief cause:\" as Hippocrates hath it, they beget one another, and tread in\na ring, for sorrow is both cause and symptom of this disease. How it is a\nsymptom shall be shown in its place. That it is a cause all the world\nacknowledgeth, _Dolor nonnullis insaniae causa fuit, et aliorum morborum\ninsanabilium_, saith Plutarch to Apollonius; a cause of madness, a cause of\nmany other diseases, a sole cause of this mischief, [1638]Lemnius calls it.\nSo doth Rhasis, _cont. l. 1. tract. 9._ Guianerius, _Tract. 15. c. 5_, And\nif it take root once, it ends in despair, as [1639]Felix Plater observes,\nand as in [1640]Cebes' table, may well be coupled with it.\n[1641]Chrysostom, in his seventeenth epistle to Olympia, describes it to be\n\"a cruel torture of the soul, a most inexplicable grief, poisoned worm,\nconsuming body and soul, and gnawing the very heart, a perpetual\nexecutioner, continual night, profound darkness, a whirlwind, a tempest, an\nague not appearing, heating worse than any fire, and a battle that hath no\nend. It crucifies worse than any tyrant; no torture, no strappado, no\nbodily punishment is like unto it.\" 'Tis the eagle without question which\nthe poets feigned to gnaw [1642]Prometheus' heart, and \"no heaviness is\nlike unto the heaviness of the heart,\" Eccles. xxv. 15, 16. [1643]\"Every\nperturbation is a misery, but grief a cruel torment,\" a domineering\npassion: as in old Rome, when the Dictator was created, all inferior\nmagistracies ceased; when grief appears, all other passions vanish. \"It\ndries up the bones,\" saith Solomon, cap. 17. Prov., makes them hollow-eyed,\npale, and lean, furrow-faced, to have dead looks, wrinkled brows,\nshrivelled cheeks, dry bodies, and quite perverts their temperature that\nare misaffected with it. As Eleonara, that exiled mournful duchess (in our\n[1644]English Ovid), laments to her noble husband Humphrey, Duke of\nGloucester,\n\n       \"Sawest thou those eyes in whose sweet cheerful look\n        Duke Humphrey once such joy and pleasure took,\n        Sorrow hath so despoil'd me of all grace,\n        Thou couldst not say this was my Elnor's face.\n        Like a foul Gorgon,\" &c.\n\n[1645]\"It hinders concoction, refrigerates the heart, takes away stomach,\ncolour, and sleep, thickens the blood,\" ([1646]Fernelius, _l. 1. c. 18. de\nmorb. causis_,) \"contaminates the spirits.\" ([1647]Piso.) Overthrows the\nnatural heat, perverts the good estate of body and mind, and makes them\nweary of their lives, cry out, howl and roar for very anguish of their\nsouls. David confessed as much, Psalm xxxviii. 8, \"I have roared for the\nvery disquietness of my heart.\" And Psalm cxix. 4, part 4 v. \"My soul\nmelteth away for very heaviness,\" v. 38. \"I am like a bottle in the smoke.\"\nAntiochus complained that he could not sleep, and that his heart fainted\nfor grief, [1648]Christ himself, _vir dolorum_, out of an apprehension of\ngrief, did sweat blood, Mark xiv. \"His soul was heavy to the death, and no\nsorrow was like unto his.\" Crato, _consil. 24. l. 2_, gives instance in one\nthat was so melancholy by reason of [1649]grief; and Montanus, _consil.\n30_, in a noble matron, [1650]\"that had no other cause of this mischief.\"\nI. S. D. in Hildesheim, fully cured a patient of his that was much troubled\nwith melancholy, and for many years, [1651]\"but afterwards, by a little\noccasion of sorrow, he fell into his former fits, and was tormented as\nbefore.\" Examples are common, how it causeth melancholy, [1652]desperation,\nand sometimes death itself; for (Eccles. xxxviii. 15,) \"Of heaviness comes\ndeath; worldly sorrow causeth death.\" 2 Cor. vii. 10, Psalm xxxi. 10, \"My\nlife is wasted with heaviness, and my years with mourning.\" Why was Hecuba\nsaid to be turned to a dog? Niobe into a stone? but that for grief she was\nsenseless and stupid. Severus the Emperor [1653] died for grief; and how\n[1654]many myriads besides? _Tanta illi est feritas, tanta est insania\nluctus_. [1655]Melancthon gives a reason of it, [1656]\"the gathering of\nmuch melancholy blood about the heart, which collection extinguisheth the\ngood spirits, or at least dulleth them, sorrow strikes the heart, makes it\ntremble and pine away, with great pain; and the black blood drawn from the\nspleen, and diffused under the ribs, on the left side, makes those perilous\nhypochondriacal convulsions, which happen to them that are troubled with\nsorrow.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Fear, a Cause_.\n\nCousin german to sorrow, is fear, or rather a sister, _fidus Achates_, and\ncontinual companion, an assistant and a principal agent in procuring of\nthis mischief; a cause and symptom as the other. In a word, as [1657]\nVirgil of the Harpies, I may justly say of them both,\n\n       \"Tristius haud illis monstrum, nec saevior ulla\n        Pestis et ira Deum stygiis sese extulit undis.\"\n\n       \"A sadder monster, or more cruel plague so fell,\n        Or vengeance of the gods, ne'er came from Styx or Hell.\"\n\nThis foul fiend of fear was worshipped heretofore as a god by the\nLacedaemonians, and most of those other torturing [1658]affections, and so\nwas sorrow amongst the rest, under the name of Angerona Dea, they stood in\nsuch awe of them, as Austin, _de Civitat. Dei, lib. 4. cap. 8_, noteth out\nof Varro, fear was commonly [1659]adored and painted in their temples with\na lion's head; and as Macrobius records, _l. 10. Saturnalium_; [1660]\"In\nthe calends of January, Angerona had her holy day, to whom in the temple of\nVolupia, or goddess of pleasure, their augurs and bishops did yearly\nsacrifice; that, being propitious to them, she might expel all cares,\nanguish, and vexation of the mind for that year following.\" Many lamentable\neffects this fear causeth in men, as to be red, pale, tremble, sweat,\n[1661]it makes sudden cold and heat to come over all the body, palpitation\nof the heart, syncope, &c. It amazeth many men that are to speak, or show\nthemselves in public assemblies, or before some great personages, as Tully\nconfessed of himself, that he trembled still at the beginning of his\nspeech; and Demosthenes, that great orator of Greece, before Philippus. It\nconfounds voice and memory, as Lucian wittily brings in Jupiter Tragoedus,\nso much afraid of his auditory, when he was to make a speech to the rest of\nthe Gods, that he could not utter a ready word, but was compelled to use\nMercury's help in prompting. Many men are so amazed and astonished with\nfear, they know not where they are, what they say, [1662]what they do, and\nthat which is worst, it tortures them many days before with continual\naffrights and suspicion. It hinders most honourable attempts, and makes\ntheir hearts ache, sad and heavy. They that live in fear are never free,\n[1663]resolute, secure, never merry, but in continual pain: that, as Vives\ntruly said, _Nulla est miseria major quam metus_, no greater misery, no\nrack, nor torture like unto it, ever suspicious, anxious, solicitous, they\nare childishly drooping without reason, without judgment, [1664]\"especially\nif some terrible object be offered,\" as Plutarch hath it. It causeth\noftentimes sudden madness, and almost all manner of diseases, as I have\nsufficiently illustrated in my [1665] digression of the force of\nimagination, and shall do more at large in my section of [1666]terrors.\nFear makes our imagination conceive what it list, invites the devil to come\nto us, as [1667]Agrippa and Cardan avouch, and tyranniseth over our\nphantasy more than all other affections, especially in the dark. We see\nthis verified in most men, as [1668]Lavater saith, _Quae metuunt, fingunt_;\nwhat they fear they conceive, and feign unto themselves; they think they\nsee goblins, hags, devils, and many times become melancholy thereby.\nCardan, _subtil. lib. 18_, hath an example of such an one, so caused to be\nmelancholy (by sight of a bugbear) all his life after. Augustus Caesar\ndurst not sit in the dark, _nisi aliquo assidente_, saith [1669]Suetonius,\n_Nunquam tenebris exigilavit_. And 'tis strange what women and children\nwill conceive unto themselves, if they go over a churchyard in the night,\nlie, or be alone in a dark room, how they sweat and tremble on a sudden.\nMany men are troubled with future events, foreknowledge of their fortunes,\ndestinies, as Severus the Emperor, Adrian and Domitian, _Quod sciret\nultimum vitae diem_, saith Suetonius, _valde solicitus_, much tortured in\nmind because he foreknew his end; with many such, of which I shall speak\nmore opportunely in another place.[1670] Anxiety, mercy, pity, indignation,\n&c., and such fearful branches derived from these two stems of fear and\nsorrow, I voluntarily omit; read more of them in [1671]Carolus Pascalius,\n[1672]Dandinus, &c.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Shame and Disgrace, Causes_.\n\nShame and disgrace cause most violent passions and bitter pangs. _Ob\npudorem et dedecus publicum, ob errorum commissum saepe moventur generosi\nanimi_ (Felix Plater, _lib. 3. de alienat mentis_.) Generous minds are\noften moved with shame, to despair for some public disgrace. And he, saith\nPhilo, _lib. 2. de provid. dei_, [1673]\"that subjects himself to fear,\ngrief, ambition, shame, is not happy, but altogether miserable, tortured\nwith continual labour, care, and misery.\" It is as forcible a batterer as\nany of the rest: [1674]\"Many men neglect the tumults of the world, and care\nnot for glory, and yet they are afraid of infamy, repulse, disgrace,\"\n(_Tul. offic. l. 1_,) \"they can severely contemn pleasure, bear grief\nindifferently, but they are quite [1675]battered and broken, with reproach\nand obloquy:\" (_siquidem vita et fama pari passu ambulant_) and are so\ndejected many times for some public injury, disgrace, as a box on the ear\nby their inferior, to be overcome of their adversary, foiled in the field,\nto be out in a speech, some foul fact committed or disclosed, &c. that they\ndare not come abroad all their lives after, but melancholise in corners,\nand keep in holes. The most generous spirits are most subject to it;\n_Spiritus altos frangit et generosos_: Hieronymus. Aristotle, because he\ncould not understand the motion of Euripus, for grief and shame drowned\nhimself: Caelius Rodigimus _antiquar. lec. lib. 29. cap. 8._ _Homerus\npudore consumptus_, was swallowed up with this passion of shame [1676]\n\"because he could not unfold the fisherman's riddle.\" Sophocles killed\nhimself, [1677]\"for that a tragedy of his was hissed off the stage:\"\n_Valer. max. lib. 9. cap. 12._ Lucretia stabbed herself, and so did\n[1678]Cleopatra, \"when she saw that she was reserved for a triumph, to\navoid the infamy.\" Antonius the Roman, [1679]\"after he was overcome of his\nenemy, for three days' space sat solitary in the fore-part of the ship,\nabstaining from all company, even of Cleopatra herself, and afterwards for\nvery shame butchered himself,\" Plutarch, _vita ejus_. Apollonius Rhodius\n[1680]\"wilfully banished himself, forsaking his country, and all his dear\nfriends, because he was out in reciting his poems,\" Plinius, _lib. 7. cap.\n23._ Ajax ran mad, because his arms were adjudged to Ulysses. In China 'tis\nan ordinary thing for such as are excluded in those famous trials of\ntheirs, or should take degrees, for shame and grief to lose their wits,\n[1681]Mat Riccius _expedit. ad Sinas, l. 3. c. 9._ Hostratus the friar took\nthat book which Reuclin had writ against him, under the name of _Epist.\nobscurorum virorum_, so to heart, that for shame and grief he made away\nwith himself, [1682]_Jovius in elogiis_. A grave and learned minister, and\nan ordinary preacher at Alcmar in Holland, was (one day as he walked in the\nfields for his recreation) suddenly taken with a lax or looseness, and\nthereupon compelled to retire to the next ditch; but being [1683]surprised\nat unawares, by some gentlewomen of his parish wandering that way, was so\nabashed, that he did never after show his head in public, or come into the\npulpit, but pined away with melancholy: (Pet. Forestus _med. observat. lib.\n10. observat. 12._) So shame amongst other passions can play his prize.\n\nI know there be many base, impudent, brazenfaced rogues, that will [1684]\n_Nulla pallescere culpa_, be moved with nothing, take no infamy or disgrace\nto heart, laugh at all; let them be proved perjured, stigmatised, convict\nrogues, thieves, traitors, lose their ears, be whipped, branded, carted,\npointed at, hissed, reviled, and derided with [1685]Ballio the Bawd in\nPlautus, they rejoice at it, _Cantores probos_; \"babe and Bombax,\" what\ncare they? We have too many such in our times,\n\n        ------\"Exclamat Melicerta perisse\n        ------Frontem de rebus.\"[1686]\n\nYet a modest man, one that hath grace, a generous spirit, tender of his\nreputation, will be deeply wounded, and so grievously affected with it,\nthat he had rather give myriads of crowns, lose his life, than suffer the\nleast defamation of honour, or blot in his good name. And if so be that he\ncannot avoid it, as a nightingale, _Que cantando victa moritur_, (saith\n[1687]Mizaldus,) dies for shame if another bird sing better, he languisheth\nand pineth away in the anguish of his spirit.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VII.--_Envy, Malice, Hatred, Causes_.\n\nEnvy and malice are two links of this chain, and both, as Guianerius,\n_Tract. 15. cap. 2_, proves out of Galen, _3 Aphorism, com. 22_, [1688]\n\"cause this malady by themselves, especially if their bodies be otherwise\ndisposed to melancholy.\" 'Tis Valescus de Taranta, and Felix Platerus'\nobservation, [1689]\"Envy so gnaws many men's hearts, that they become\naltogether melancholy.\" And therefore belike Solomon, Prov. xiv. 13, calls\nit, \"the rotting of the bones,\" Cyprian, _vulnus occultum_;\n\n[1690]  ------\"Siculi non invenere tyranni\n        Majus tormentum\"------\n\nThe Sicilian tyrants never invented the like torment. It crucifies their\nsouls, withers their bodies, makes them hollow-eyed, [1691]pale, lean, and\nghastly to behold, Cyprian, _ser. 2. de zelo et livore_. [1692]\"As a moth\ngnaws a garment, so,\" saith Chrysostom, \"doth envy consume a man;\" to be a\nliving anatomy: a \"skeleton, to be a lean and [1693]pale carcass, quickened\nwith a [1694]fiend\", Hall _in Charact._ for so often as an envious wretch\nsees another man prosper, to be enriched, to thrive, and be fortunate in\nthe world, to get honours, offices, or the like, he repines and grieves.\n\n[1695]  ------\"intabescitque videndo\n        Successus hominum--suppliciumque suum est.\"\n\nHe tortures himself if his equal, friend, neighbour, be preferred,\ncommended, do well; if he understand of it, it galls him afresh; and no\ngreater pain can come to him than to hear of another man's well-doing; 'tis\na dagger at his heart every such object. He looks at him as they that fell\ndown in Lucian's rock of honour, with an envious eye, and will damage\nhimself, to do another a mischief: _Atque cadet subito, dum super hoste\ncadat_. As he did in Aesop, lose one eye willingly, that his fellow might\nlose both, or that rich man in [1696]Quintilian that poisoned the flowers\nin his garden, because his neighbour's bees should get no more honey from\nthem. His whole life is sorrow, and every word he speaks a satire: nothing\nfats him but other men's ruins. For to speak in a word, envy is nought else\nbut _Tristitia de bonis alienis_, sorrow for other men's good, be it\npresent, past, or to come: _et gaudium de adversis_, and [1697]joy at their\nharms, opposite to mercy, [1698]which grieves at other men's mischances,\nand misaffects the body in another kind; so Damascen defines it, _lib. 2.\nde orthod. fid._ Thomas, _2. 2. quaest. 36. art. 1._ Aristotle, _l. 2.\nRhet. c. 4. et 10._ Plato _Philebo_. Tully, _3. Tusc_. Greg. Nic. _l. de\nvirt. animae, c. 12._ Basil, _de Invidia_. Pindarus _Od. 1. ser. 5_, and we\nfind it true. 'Tis a common disease, and almost natural to us, as\n[1699]Tacitus holds, to envy another man's prosperity. And 'tis in most men\nan incurable disease. [1700]\"I have read,\" saith Marcus Aurelius, \"Greek,\nHebrew, Chaldee authors; I have consulted with many wise men for a remedy\nfor envy, I could find none, but to renounce all happiness, and to be a\nwretch, and miserable for ever.\" 'Tis the beginning of hell in this life,\nand a passion not to be excused. [1701]\"Every other sin hath some pleasure\nannexed to it, or will admit of an excuse; envy alone wants both. Other\nsins last but for awhile; the gut may be satisfied, anger remits, hatred\nhath an end, envy never ceaseth.\" Cardan, _lib. 2. de sap._ Divine and\nhumane examples are very familiar; you may run and read them, as that of\nSaul and David, Cain and Abel, _angebat illum non proprium peccatum, sed\nfratris prosperitas_, saith Theodoret, it was his brother's good fortune\ngalled him. Rachel envied her sister, being barren, Gen. xxx. Joseph's\nbrethren him, Gen. xxxvii. David had a touch of this vice, as he\nconfesseth, [1702]Psal. 37. [1703]Jeremy and [1704]Habakkuk, they repined\nat others' good, but in the end they corrected themselves, Psal. 75, \"fret\nnot thyself,\" &c. Domitian spited Agricola for his worth, [1705]\"that a\nprivate man should be so much glorified.\" [1706]Cecinna was envied of his\nfellow-citizens, because he was more richly adorned. But of all others,\n[1707]women are most weak, _ob pulchritudinem invidae sunt foeminae\n(Musaeus) aut amat, aut odit, nihil est tertium (Granatensis.)_ They love\nor hate, no medium amongst them. _Implacabiles plerumque laesae mulieres_,\nAgrippina like, [1708]\"A woman, if she see her neighbour more neat or\nelegant, richer in tires, jewels, or apparel, is enraged, and like a\nlioness sets upon her husband, rails at her, scoffs at her, and cannot\nabide her;\" so the Roman ladies in Tacitus did at Solonina, Cecinna's wife,\n[1709]\"because she had a better horse, and better furniture, as if she had\nhurt them with it; they were much offended.\" In like sort our gentlewomen\ndo at their usual meetings, one repines or scoffs at another's bravery and\nhappiness. Myrsine, an Attic wench, was murdered of her fellows, [1710]\n\"because she did excel the rest in beauty,\" Constantine, _Agricult. l. 11.\nc. 7._ Every village will yield such examples.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VIII.--_Emulation, Hatred, Faction, Desire of Revenge, Causes_.\n\nOut of this root of envy [1711]spring those feral branches of faction,\nhatred, livor, emulation, which cause the like grievances, and are, _serrae\nanimae_, the saws of the soul, [1712]_consternationis pleni affectus_,\naffections full of desperate amazement; or as Cyprian describes emulation,\nit is [1713]\"a moth of the soul, a consumption, to make another man's\nhappiness his misery, to torture, crucify, and execute himself, to eat his\nown heart. Meat and drink can do such men no good, they do always grieve,\nsigh, and groan, day and night without intermission, their breast is torn\nasunder:\" and a little after, [1714]\"Whomsoever he is whom thou dost\nemulate and envy, he may avoid thee, but thou canst neither avoid him nor\nthyself; wheresoever thou art he is with thee, thine enemy is ever in thy\nbreast, thy destruction is within thee, thou art a captive, bound hand and\nfoot, as long as thou art malicious and envious, and canst not be\ncomforted. It was the devil's overthrow;\" and whensoever thou art\nthoroughly affected with this passion, it will be thine. Yet no\nperturbation so frequent, no passion so common.\n\n[1715] \"[Greek: kai kerameus keramei koteei kai tektoni tekton,\n        kai ptochos ptochoi phthoneei kai aoidos aoido.]\"\n\n       \"A potter emulates a potter:\n          One smith envies another:\n        A beggar emulates a beggar;\n          A singing man his brother.\"\n\nEvery society, corporation, and private family is full of it, it takes hold\nalmost of all sorts of men, from the prince to the ploughman, even amongst\ngossips it is to be seen, scarce three in a company but there is siding,\nfaction, emulation, between two of them, some _simultas_, jar, private\ngrudge, heart-burning in the midst of them. Scarce two gentlemen dwell\ntogether in the country, (if they be not near kin or linked in marriage)\nbut there is emulation betwixt them and their servants, some quarrel or\nsome grudge betwixt their wives or children, friends and followers, some\ncontention about wealth, gentry, precedency, &c., by means of which, like\nthe frog in [1716]Aesop, \"that would swell till she was as big as an ox,\nburst herself at last;\" they will stretch beyond their fortunes, callings,\nand strive so long that they consume their substance in lawsuits, or\notherwise in hospitality, feasting, fine clothes, to get a few bombast\ntitles, for _ambitiosa paupertate laboramus omnes_, to outbrave one\nanother, they will tire their bodies, macerate their souls, and through\ncontentions or mutual invitations beggar themselves. Scarce two great\nscholars in an age, but with bitter invectives they fall foul one on the\nother, and their adherents; Scotists, Thomists, Reals, Nominals, Plato and\nAristotle, Galenists and Paracelsians, &c., it holds in all professions.\n\nHonest [1717]emulation in studies, in all callings is not to be disliked,\n'tis _ingeniorum cos_, as one calls it, the whetstone of wit, the nurse of\nwit and valour, and those noble Romans out of this spirit did brave\nexploits. There is a modest ambition, as Themistocles was roused up with\nthe glory of Miltiades; Achilles' trophies moved Alexander,\n\n[1718] \"Ambire semper stulta confidentia est,\n        Ambire nunquam deses arrogantia est.\"\n\n'Tis a sluggish humour not to emulate or to sue at all, to withdraw\nhimself, neglect, refrain from such places, honours, offices, through\nsloth, niggardliness, fear, bashfulness, or otherwise, to which by his\nbirth, place, fortunes, education, he is called, apt, fit, and well able to\nundergo; but when it is immoderate, it is a plague and a miserable pain.\nWhat a deal of money did Henry VIII. and Francis I. king of France, spend\nat that [1719]famous interview? and how many vain courtiers, seeking each\nto outbrave other, spent themselves, their livelihood and fortunes, and\ndied beggars? [1720]Adrian the Emperor was so galled with it, that he\nkilled all his equals; so did Nero. This passion made [1721]Dionysius the\ntyrant banish Plato and Philoxenus the poet, because they did excel and\neclipse his glory, as he thought; the Romans exile Coriolanus, confine\nCamillus, murder Scipio; the Greeks by ostracism to expel Aristides,\nNicias, Alcibiades, imprison Theseus, make away Phocion, &c. When Richard\nI. and Philip of France were fellow soldiers together, at the siege of Acon\nin the Holy Land, and Richard had approved himself to be the more valiant\nman, insomuch that all men's eyes were upon him, it so galled Philip,\n_Francum urebat Regis victoria_, saith mine [1722]author, _tam aegre\nferebat Richardi gloriam, ut carpere dicta, calumniari facta_; that he\ncavilled at all his proceedings, and fell at length to open defiance; he\ncould contain no longer, but hasting home, invaded his territories, and\nprofessed open war. \"Hatred stirs up contention,\" Prov. x. 12, and they\nbreak out at last into immortal enmity, into virulency, and more than\nVatinian hate and rage; [1723]they persecute each other, their friends,\nfollowers, and all their posterity, with bitter taunts, hostile wars,\nscurrile invectives, libels, calumnies, fire, sword, and the like, and will\nnot be reconciled. Witness that Guelph and Ghibelline faction in Italy;\nthat of the Adurni and Fregosi in Genoa; that of Cneius Papirius, and\nQuintus Fabius in Rome; Caesar and Pompey; Orleans and Burgundy in France;\nYork and Lancaster in England: yea, this passion so rageth [1724]many\ntimes, that it subverts not men only, and families, but even populous\ncities. [1725]Carthage and Corinth can witness as much, nay, flourishing\nkingdoms are brought into a wilderness by it. This hatred, malice, faction,\nand desire of revenge, invented first all those racks and wheels,\nstrappadoes, brazen bulls, feral engines, prisons, inquisitions, severe\nlaws to macerate and torment one another. How happy might we be, and end\nour time with blessed days and sweet content, if we could contain\nourselves, and, as we ought to do, put up injuries, learn humility,\nmeekness, patience, forget and forgive, as in [1726]God's word we are\nenjoined, compose such final controversies amongst ourselves, moderate our\npassions in this kind, \"and think better of others,\" as [1727]Paul would\nhave us, \"than of ourselves: be of like affection one towards another, and\nnot avenge ourselves, but have peace with all men.\" But being that we are\nso peevish and perverse, insolent and proud, so factious and seditious, so\nmalicious and envious; we do _invicem angariare_, maul and vex one another,\ntorture, disquiet, and precipitate ourselves into that gulf of woes and\ncares, aggravate our misery and melancholy, heap upon us hell and eternal\ndamnation.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IX.--_Anger, a Cause_.\n\nAnger, a perturbation, which carries the spirits outwards, preparing the\nbody to melancholy, and madness itself: _Ira furor brevis est_, \"anger is\ntemporary madness;\" and as [1728]Picolomineus accounts it, one of the three\nmost violent passions. [1729]Areteus sets it down for an especial cause (so\ndoth Seneca, _ep. 18. l. 1_,) of this malady. [1730]Magninus gives the\nreason, _Ex frequenti ira supra modum calefiunt_; it overheats their\nbodies, and if it be too frequent, it breaks out into manifest madness,\nsaith St. Ambrose. 'Tis a known saying, _Furor fit Iaesa saepius\npalienlia_, the most patient spirit that is, if he be often provoked, will\nbe incensed to madness; it will make a devil of a saint: and therefore\nBasil (belike) in his Homily _de Ira_, calls it _tenebras rationis, morbum\nanimae, et daemonem pessimum_; the darkening of our understanding, and a\nbad angel. [1731]Lucian, _in Abdicato, tom. 1_, will have this passion to\nwork this effect, especially in old men and women. \"Anger and calumny\"\n(saith he) \"trouble them at first, and after a while break out into\nmadness: many things cause fury in women, especially if they love or hate\novermuch, or envy, be much grieved or angry; these things by little and\nlittle lead them on to this malady.\" From a disposition they proceed to an\nhabit, for there is no difference between a mad man, and an angry man, in\nthe time of his fit; anger, as Lactantius describes it, _L. de Ira Dei, ad\nDonatum, c. 5_, is [1732]_saeva animi tempestas_, &c., a cruel tempest of\nthe mind; \"making his eye sparkle fire, and stare, teeth gnash in his head,\nhis tongue stutter, his face pale, or red, and what more filthy imitation\ncan be of a mad man?\"\n\n[1733] \"Ora tument ira, fervescunt sanguine venae,\n        Lumina Gorgonio saevius angue micant.\"\n\nThey are void of reason, inexorable, blind, like beasts and monsters for\nthe time, say and do they know not what, curse, swear, rail, fight, and\nwhat not? How can a mad man do more? as he said in the comedy, [1734]\n_Iracundia non sum apud me_, I am not mine own man. If these fits be\nimmoderate, continue long, or be frequent, without doubt they provoke\nmadness. Montanus, _consil. 21_, had a melancholy Jew to his patient, he\nascribes this for a principal cause: _Irascebatur levibus de causis_, he\nwas easily moved to anger. Ajax had no other beginning of his madness; and\nCharles the Sixth, that lunatic French king, fell into this misery, out of\nthe extremity of his passion, desire of revenge and malice, [1735]incensed\nagainst the duke of Britain, he could neither eat, drink, nor sleep for\nsome days together, and in the end, about the calends of July, 1392, he\nbecame mad upon his horseback, drawing his sword, striking such as came\nnear him promiscuously, and so continued all the days of his life, Aemil.,\n_lib. 10._ Gal. _hist._ Aegesippus _de exid. urbis Hieros, l. 1. c. 37_,\nhath such a story of Herod, that out of an angry fit, became mad,\n[1736]leaping out of his bed, he killed Jossippus, and played many such\nbedlam pranks, the whole court could not rule him for a long time after:\nsometimes he was sorry and repented, much grieved for that he had done,\n_Postquam deferbuit ira_, by and by outrageous again. In hot choleric\nbodies, nothing so soon causeth madness, as this passion of anger, besides\nmany other diseases, as Pelesius observes, _cap. 21. l. 1. de hum. affect.\ncausis_; _Sanguinem imminuit, fel auget_: and as [1737]Valesius\ncontroverts, _Med. controv., lib. 5. contro. 8_, many times kills them\nquite out. If this were the worst of this passion, it were more tolerable,\n[1738]\"but it ruins and subverts whole towns, [1739]cities, families, and\nkingdoms;\" _Nulla pestis humano generi pluris stetit_, saith Seneca, _de\nIra, lib. 1._ No plague hath done mankind so much harm. Look into our\nhistories, and you shall almost meet with no other subject, but what a\ncompany [1740]of harebrains have done in their rage. We may do well\ntherefore to put this in our procession amongst the rest; \"From all\nblindness of heart, from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy, from envy, hatred\nand malice, anger, and all such pestiferous perturbations, good Lord\ndeliver us.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. X.--_Discontents, Cares, Miseries, &c. Causes_.\n\nDiscontents, cares, crosses, miseries, or whatsoever it is, that shall\ncause any molestation of spirits, grief, anguish, and perplexity, may well\nbe reduced to this head, (preposterously placed here in some men's\njudgments they may seem,) yet in that Aristotle in his [1741]Rhetoric\ndefines these cares, as he doth envy, emulation, &c. still by grief, I\nthink I may well rank them in this irascible row; being that they are as\nthe rest, both causes and symptoms of this disease, producing the like\ninconveniences, and are most part accompanied with anguish and pain. The\ncommon etymology will evince it, _Cura quasi cor uro, Dementes curae,\ninsomnes curae, damnosae curae, tristes, mordaces, carnifices_, &c. biting,\neating, gnawing, cruel, bitter, sick, sad, unquiet, pale, tetric,\nmiserable, intolerable cares, as the poets [1742]call them, worldly cares,\nand are as many in number as the sea sands. [1743]Galen, Fernelius, Felix\nPlater, Valescus de Taranta, &c., reckon afflictions, miseries, even all\nthese contentions, and vexations of the mind, as principal causes, in that\nthey take away sleep, hinder concoction, dry up the body, and consume the\nsubstance of it. They are not so many in number, but their causes be as\ndivers, and not one of a thousand free from them, or that can vindicate\nhimself, whom that _Ate dea_,\n\n[1744] \"Per hominum capita molliter ambulans,\n        Plantas pedum teneras habens:\"\n\n       \"Over men's heads walking aloft,\n        With tender feet treading so soft,\"\n\nHomer's Goddess Ate hath not involved into this discontented [1745]rank, or\nplagued with some misery or other. Hyginus, _fab. 220_, to this purpose\nhath a pleasant tale. Dame Cura by chance went over a brook, and taking up\nsome of the dirty slime, made an image of it; Jupiter eftsoons coming by,\nput life to it, but Cura and Jupiter could not agree what name to give him,\nor who should own him; the matter was referred to Saturn as judge; he gave\nthis arbitrement: his name shall be _Homo ab humo, Cura eum possideat\nquamdiu vivat_, Care shall have him whilst he lives, Jupiter his soul, and\nTellus his body when he dies. But to leave tales. A general cause, a\ncontinuate cause, an inseparable accident, to all men, is discontent, care,\nmisery; were there no other particular affliction (which who is free from?)\nto molest a man in this life, the very cogitation of that common misery\nwere enough to macerate, and make him weary of his life; to think that he\ncan never be secure, but still in danger, sorrow, grief, and persecution.\nFor to begin at the hour of his birth, as [1746]Pliny doth elegantly\ndescribe it, \"he is born naked, and falls [1747]a whining at the very\nfirst: he is swaddled, and bound up like a prisoner, cannot help himself,\nand so he continues to his life's end.\" _Cujusque ferae pabulum_, saith\n[1748]Seneca, impatient of heat and cold, impatient of labour, impatient of\nidleness, exposed to fortune's contumelies. To a naked mariner Lucretius\ncompares him, cast on shore by shipwreck, cold and comfortless in an\nunknown land: [1749]no estate, age, sex, can secure himself from this\ncommon misery. \"A man that is born of a woman is of short continuance, and\nfull of trouble,\" Job xiv. 1, 22. \"And while his flesh is upon him he shall\nbe sorrowful, and while his soul is in him it shall mourn. All his days are\nsorrow and his travels griefs: his heart also taketh not rest in the\nnight.\" Eccles. ii. 23, and ii. 11. \"All that is in it is sorrow and\nvexation of spirit. [1750]Ingress, progress, regress, egress, much alike:\nblindness seizeth on us in the beginning, labour in the middle, grief in\nthe end, error in all. What day ariseth to us without some grief, care, or\nanguish? Or what so secure and pleasing a morning have we seen, that hath\nnot been overcast before the evening?\" One is miserable, another\nridiculous, a third odious. One complains of this grievance, another of\nthat. _Aliquando nervi, aliquando pedes vexant_, (Seneca) _nunc\ndistillatio, nunc epatis morbus; nunc deest, nunc superest sanguis_: now\nthe head aches, then the feet, now the lungs, then the liver, &c. _Huic\nsensus exuberat, sed est pudori degener sanguis_, &c. He is rich, but base\nborn; he is noble, but poor; a third hath means, but he wants health\nperadventure, or wit to manage his estate; children vex one, wife a second,\n&c. _Nemo facile cum conditione sua concordat_, no man is pleased with his\nfortune, a pound of sorrow is familiarly mixed with a dram of content,\nlittle or no joy, little comfort, but [1751]everywhere danger, contention,\nanxiety, in all places: go where thou wilt, and thou shalt find\ndiscontents, cares, woes, complaints, sickness, diseases, encumbrances,\nexclamations: \"If thou look into the market, there\" (saith [1752]\nChrysostom) \"is brawling and contention; if to the court, there knavery and\nflattery, &c.; if to a private man's house, there's cark and care,\nheaviness,\" &c. As he said of old,\n\n[1753] \"Nil homine in terra spirat miserum magis alma?\"\n\nNo creature so miserable as man, so generally molested, [1754]\"in miseries\nof body, in miseries of mind, miseries of heart, in miseries asleep, in\nmiseries awake, in miseries wheresoever he turns,\" as Bernard found,\n_Nunquid tentatio est vita humana super terram_? A mere temptation is our\nlife, (Austin, _confess. lib. 10. cap. 28_,) _catena perpetuorum malorum,\net quis potest molestias et difficultates pati_? Who can endure the\nmiseries of it? [1755]\"In prosperity we are insolent and intolerable,\ndejected in adversity, in all fortunes foolish and miserable.\" [1756]\"In\nadversity I wish for prosperity, and in prosperity I am afraid of\nadversity. What mediocrity may be found? Where is no temptation? What\ncondition of life is free?\" [1757]\"Wisdom hath labour annexed to it, glory,\nenvy; riches and cares, children and encumbrances, pleasure and diseases,\nrest and beggary, go together: as if a man were therefore born\" (as the\nPlatonists hold) \"to be punished in this life for some precedent sins.\" Or\nthat, as [1758]Pliny complains, \"Nature may be rather accounted a\nstepmother, than a mother unto us, all things considered: no creature's\nlife so brittle, so full of fear, so mad, so furious; only man is plagued\nwith envy, discontent, griefs, covetousness, ambition, superstition.\" Our\nwhole life is an Irish sea, wherein there is nought to be expected but\ntempestuous storms and troublesome waves, and those infinite,\n\n[1759] \"Tantum malorum pelagus aspicio,\n        Ut non sit inde enatandi copia,\"\n\nno halcyonian times, wherein a man can hold himself secure, or agree with\nhis present estate; but as Boethius infers, [1760]\"there is something in\nevery one of us which before trial we seek, and having tried abhor: [1761]\nwe earnestly wish, and eagerly covet, and are eftsoons weary of it.\" Thus\nbetween hope and fear, suspicions, angers, [1762]_Inter spemque metumque,\ntimores inter et iras_, betwixt falling in, falling out, &c., we bangle\naway our best days, befool out our times, we lead a contentious,\ndiscontent, tumultuous, melancholy, miserable life; insomuch, that if we\ncould foretell what was to come, and it put to our choice, we should rather\nrefuse than accept of this painful life. In a word, the world itself is a\nmaze, a labyrinth of errors, a desert, a wilderness, a den of thieves,\ncheaters, &c., full of filthy puddles, horrid rocks, precipitiums, an ocean\nof adversity, an heavy yoke, wherein infirmities and calamities overtake,\nand follow one another, as the sea waves; and if we scape Scylla, we fall\nfoul on Charybdis, and so in perpetual fear, labour, anguish, we run from\none plague, one mischief, one burden to another, _duram servientes\nservitutem_, and you may as soon separate weight from lead, heat from fire,\nmoistness from water, brightness from the sun, as misery, discontent, care,\ncalamity, danger, from a man. Our towns and cities are but so many\ndwellings of human misery. \"In which grief and sorrow\" ([1763]as he right\nwell observes out of Solon) \"innumerable troubles, labours of mortal men,\nand all manner of vices, are included, as in so many pens.\" Our villages\nare like molehills, and men as so many emmets, busy, busy still, going to\nand fro, in and out, and crossing one another's projects, as the lines of\nseveral sea-cards cut each other in a globe or map. \"Now light and merry,\"\nbut ([1764]as one follows it) \"by-and-by sorrowful and heavy; now hoping,\nthen distrusting; now patient, tomorrow crying out; now pale, then red;\nrunning, sitting, sweating, trembling, halting,\" &c. Some few amongst the\nrest, or perhaps one of a thousand, may be Pullus Jovis, in the world's\nesteem, _Gallinae filius albae_, an happy and fortunate man, _ad invidiam\nfelix_, because rich, fair, well allied, in honour and office; yet\nperadventure ask himself, and he will say, that of all others [1765]he is\nmost miserable and unhappy. A fair shoe, _Hic soccus novus, elegans_, as he\n[1766]said, _sed nescis ubi urat_, but thou knowest not where it pincheth.\nIt is not another man's opinion can make me happy: but as [1767]Seneca well\nhath it, \"He is a miserable wretch that doth not account himself happy,\nthough he be sovereign lord of a world: he is not happy, if he think\nhimself not to be so; for what availeth it what thine estate is, or seem to\nothers, if thou thyself dislike it?\" A common humour it is of all men to\nthink well of other men's fortunes, and dislike their own: [1768]_Cui\nplacet alterius, sua nimirum est odio sors_; but [1769]_qui fit Mecoenas_,\n&c., how comes it to pass, what's the cause of it? Many men are of such a\nperverse nature, they are well pleased with nothing, (saith [1770]\nTheodoret,) \"neither with riches nor poverty, they complain when they are\nwell and when they are sick, grumble at all fortunes, prosperity and\nadversity; they are troubled in a cheap year, in a barren, plenty or not\nplenty, nothing pleaseth them, war nor peace, with children, nor without.\"\nThis for the most part is the humour of us all, to be discontent,\nmiserable, and most unhappy, as we think at least; and show me him that is\nnot so, or that ever was otherwise. Quintus Metellus his felicity is\ninfinitely admired amongst the Romans, insomuch that as [1771]Paterculus\nmentioneth of him, you can scarce find of any nation, order, age, sex, one\nfor happiness to be compared unto him: he had, in a word, _Bona animi,\ncorporis et fortunae_, goods of mind, body, and fortune, so had P.\nMutianus, [1772]Crassus. Lampsaca, that Lacedaemonian lady, was such\nanother in [1773]Pliny's conceit, a king's wife, a king's mother, a king's\ndaughter: and all the world esteemed as much of Polycrates of Samos. The\nGreeks brag of their Socrates, Phocion, Aristides; the Psophidians in\nparticular of their Aglaus, _Omni vita felix, ab omni periculo immunis_\n(which by the way Pausanias held impossible;) the Romans of their [1774]\nCato, Curius, Fabricius, for their composed fortunes, and retired estates,\ngovernment of passions, and contempt of the world: yet none of all these\nwere happy, or free from discontent, neither Metellus, Crassus, nor\nPolycrates, for he died a violent death, and so did Cato; and how much evil\ndoth Lactantius and Theodoret speak of Socrates, a weak man, and so of the\nrest. There is no content in this life, but as [1775]he said, \"All is\nvanity and vexation of spirit;\" lame and imperfect. Hadst thou Sampson's\nhair, Milo's strength, Scanderbeg's arm, Solomon's wisdom, Absalom's\nbeauty, Croesus' wealth, _Pasetis obulum_, Caesar's valour, Alexander's\nspirit, Tully's or Demosthenes' eloquence, Gyges' ring, Perseus' Pegasus,\nand Gorgon's head, Nestor's years to come, all this would not make thee\nabsolute; give thee content, and true happiness in this life, or so\ncontinue it. Even in the midst of all our mirth, jollity, and laughter, is\nsorrow and grief, or if there be true happiness amongst us, 'tis but for a\ntime,\n\n[1776] \"Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne:\"\n\n       \"A handsome woman with a fish's tail,\"\n\na fair morning turns to a lowering afternoon. Brutus and Cassius, once\nrenowned, both eminently happy, yet you shall scarce find two (saith\nPaterculus) _quos fortuna maturius destiturit_, whom fortune sooner\nforsook. Hannibal, a conqueror all his life, met with his match, and was\nsubdued at last, _Occurrit forti, qui mage fortis erit._ One is brought in\ntriumph, as Caesar into Rome, Alcibiades into Athens, _coronis aureis\ndonatus_, crowned, honoured, admired; by-and-by his statues demolished, he\nhissed out, massacred, &c. [1777]Magnus Gonsalva, that famous Spaniard, was\nof the prince and people at first honoured, approved; forthwith confined\nand banished. _Admirandas actiones; graves plerunque sequuntur invidiae, et\nacres calumniae_: 'tis Polybius his observation, grievous enmities, and\nbitter calumnies, commonly follow renowned actions. One is born rich, dies\na beggar; sound today, sick tomorrow; now in most flourishing estate,\nfortunate and happy, by-and-by deprived of his goods by foreign enemies,\nrobbed by thieves, spoiled, captivated, impoverished, as they of\n[1778]\"Rabbah put under iron saws, and under iron harrows, and under axes\nof iron, and cast into the tile kiln,\"\n\n[1779] \"Quid me felicem toties jactastis amici,\n        Qui cecidit, stabili non erat ille gradu.\"\n\nHe that erst marched like Xerxes with innumerable armies, as rich as\nCroesus, now shifts for himself in a poor cock-boat, is bound in iron\nchains, with Bajazet the Turk, and a footstool with Aurelian, for a\ntyrannising conqueror to trample on. So many casualties there are, that as\nSeneca said of a city consumed with fire, _Una dies interest inter maximum\ncivitatem et nullam_, one day betwixt a great city and none: so many\ngrievances from outward accidents, and from ourselves, our own\nindiscretion, inordinate appetite, one day betwixt a man and no man. And\nwhich is worse, as if discontents and miseries would not come fast enough\nupon us: _homo homini daemon_, we maul, persecute, and study how to sting,\ngall, and vex one another with mutual hatred, abuses, injuries; preying\nupon and devouring as so many, [1780]ravenous birds; and as jugglers,\npanders, bawds, cozening one another; or raging as [1781]wolves, tigers,\nand devils, we take a delight to torment one another; men are evil, wicked,\nmalicious, treacherous, and [1782]naught, not loving one another, or loving\nthemselves, not hospitable, charitable, nor sociable as they ought to be,\nbut counterfeit, dissemblers, ambidexters, all for their own ends,\nhard-hearted, merciless, pitiless, and to benefit themselves, they care not\nwhat mischief they procure to others. [1783]Praxinoe and Gorgo in the poet,\nwhen they had got in to see those costly sights, they then cried _bene\nest_, and would thrust out all the rest: when they are rich themselves, in\nhonour, preferred, full, and have even that they would, they debar others\nof those pleasures which youth requires, and they formerly have enjoyed. He\nsits at table in a soft chair at ease, but he doth remember in the mean\ntime that a tired waiter stands behind him, \"an hungry fellow ministers to\nhim full, he is athirst that gives him drink\" (saith [1784]Epictetus) \"and\nis silent whilst he speaks his pleasure: pensive, sad, when he laughs.\"\n_Pleno se proluit auro_: he feasts, revels, and profusely spends, hath\nvariety of robes, sweet music, ease, and all the pleasure the world can\nafford, whilst many an hunger-starved poor creature pines in the street,\nwants clothes to cover him, labours hard all day long, runs, rides for a\ntrifle, fights peradventure from sun to sun, sick and ill, weary, full of\npain and grief, is in great distress and sorrow of heart. He loathes and\nscorns his inferior, hates or emulates his equal, envies his superior,\ninsults over all such as are under him, as if he were of another species, a\ndemigod, not subject to any fall, or human infirmities. Generally they love\nnot, are not beloved again: they tire out others' bodies with continual\nlabour, they themselves living at ease, caring for none else, _sibi nati_;\nand are so far many times from putting to their helping hand, that they\nseek all means to depress, even most worthy and well deserving, better than\nthemselves, those whom they are by the laws of nature bound to relieve and\nhelp, as much as in them lies, they will let them caterwaul, starve, beg,\nand hang, before they will any ways (though it be in their power) assist or\nease: [1785]so unnatural are they for the most part, so unregardful; so\nhard-hearted, so churlish, proud, insolent, so dogged, of so bad a\ndisposition. And being so brutish, so devilishly bent one towards another,\nhow is it possible but that we should be discontent of all sides, full of\ncares, woes, and miseries?\n\nIf this be not a sufficient proof of their discontent and misery, examine\nevery condition and calling apart. Kings, princes, monarchs, and\nmagistrates seem to be most happy, but look into their estate, you shall\n[1786]find them to be most encumbered with cares, in perpetual fear, agony,\nsuspicion, jealousy: that, as [1787]he said of a crown, if they knew but\nthe discontents that accompany it, they would not stoop to take it up.\n_Quem mihi regent dabis_ (saith Chrysostom) _non curis plenum_? What king\ncanst thou show me, not full of cares? [1788]\"Look not on his crown, but\nconsider his afflictions; attend not his number of servants, but multitude\nof crosses.\" _Nihil aliud potestas culminis, quam tempestas mentis_, as\nGregory seconds him; sovereignty is a tempest of the soul: Sylla like they\nhave brave titles, but terrible fits: _splendorem titulo, cruciatum animo_:\nwhich made [1789]Demosthenes vow, _si vel ad tribunal, vel ad interitum\nduceretur_: if to be a judge, or to be condemned, were put to his choice,\nhe would be condemned. Rich men are in the same predicament; what their\npains are, _stulti nesciunt, ipsi sentiunt_: they feel, fools perceive not,\nas I shall prove elsewhere, and their wealth is brittle, like children's\nrattles: they come and go, there is no certainty in them: those whom they\nelevate, they do as suddenly depress, and leave in a vale of misery. The\nmiddle sort of men are as so many asses to bear burdens; or if they be\nfree, and live at ease, they spend themselves, and consume their bodies and\nfortunes with luxury and riot, contention, emulation, &c. The poor I\nreserve for another [1790]place and their discontents.\n\nFor particular professions, I hold as of the rest, there's no content or\nsecurity in any; on what course will you pitch, how resolve? to be a\ndivine, 'tis contemptible in the world's esteem; to be a lawyer, 'tis to be\na wrangler; to be a physician, [1791]_pudet lotii_, 'tis loathed; a\nphilosopher, a madman; an alchemist, a beggar; a poet, _esurit_, an hungry\njack; a musician, a player; a schoolmaster, a drudge; an husbandman, an\nemmet; a merchant, his gains are uncertain; a mechanician, base; a\nchirurgeon, fulsome; a tradesman, a [1792]liar; a tailor, a thief; a\nserving-man, a slave; a soldier, a butcher; a smith, or a metalman, the\npot's never from his nose; a courtier a parasite, as he could find no tree\nin the wood to hang himself; I can show no state of life to give content.\nThe like you may say of all ages; children live in a perpetual slavery,\nstill under that tyrannical government of masters; young men, and of riper\nyears, subject to labour, and a thousand cares of the world, to treachery,\nfalsehood, and cozenage,\n\n[1793]  ------\"Incedit per ignes,\n        Suppositos cineri doloso,\"\n\n        ------\"you incautious tread\n        On fires, with faithless ashes overhead.\"\n\n[1794]old are full of aches in their bones, cramps and convulsions,\n_silicernia_, dull of hearing, weak sighted, hoary, wrinkled, harsh, so\nmuch altered as that they cannot know their own face in a glass, a burthen\nto themselves and others, after 70 years, \"all is sorrow\" (as David hath\nit), they do not live but linger. If they be sound, they fear diseases; if\nsick, weary of their lives: _Non est vivere, sed valere vita._ One\ncomplains of want, a second of servitude, [1795]another of a secret or\nincurable disease; of some deformity of body, of some loss, danger, death\nof friends, shipwreck, persecution, imprisonment, disgrace, repulse, [1796]\ncontumely, calumny, abuse, injury, contempt, ingratitude, unkindness,\nscoffs, flouts, unfortunate marriage, single life, too many children, no\nchildren, false servants, unhappy children, barrenness, banishment,\noppression, frustrate hopes and ill-success, &c.\n\n[1797] \"Talia de genere hoc adeo sunt multa, loquacem ut\n        Delassare valent Fabium.\"------\n\n       \"But, every various instance to repeat,\n        Would tire even Fabius of incessant prate.\"\n\nTalking Fabius will be tired before he can tell half of them; they are the\nsubject of whole volumes, and shall (some of them) be more opportunely\ndilated elsewhere. In the meantime thus much I may say of them, that\ngenerally they crucify the soul of man, [1798]attenuate our bodies, dry\nthem, wither them, shrivel them up like old apples, make them as so many\nanatomies ([1799]_ossa atque pellis est totus, ita curis macet_) they cause\n_tempus foedum et squalidum_, cumbersome days, _ingrataque tempora_, slow,\ndull, and heavy times: make us howl, roar, and tear our hairs, as sorrow\ndid in [1800]Cebes' table, and groan for the very anguish of our souls. Our\nhearts fail us as David's did, Psal. xl. 12, \"for innumerable troubles that\ncompassed him;\" and we are ready to confess with Hezekiah, Isaiah lviii.\n17, \"behold, for felicity I had bitter grief;\" to weep with Heraclitus, to\ncurse the day of our birth with Jeremy, xx. 14, and our stars with Job: to\nhold that axiom of Silenus, [1801]\"better never to have been born, and the\nbest next of all, to die quickly:\" or if we must live, to abandon the\nworld, as Timon did; creep into caves and holes, as our anchorites; cast\nall into the sea, as Crates Thebanus; or as Theombrotus Ambrociato's 400\nauditors, precipitate ourselves to be rid of these miseries.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XI.--_Concupiscible Appetite, as Desires, Ambition, Causes_.\n\nThese concupiscible and irascible appetites are as the two twists of a\nrope, mutually mixed one with the other, and both twining about the heart:\nboth good, as Austin, holds, _l. 14. c. 9. de civ. Dei_, [1802]\"if they be\nmoderate; both pernicious if they be exorbitant.\" This concupiscible\nappetite, howsoever it may seem to carry with it a show of pleasure and\ndelight, and our concupiscences most part affect us with content and a\npleasing object, yet if they be in extremes, they rack and wring us on the\nother side. A true saying it is, \"Desire hath no rest;\" is infinite in\nitself, endless; and as [1803]one calls it, a perpetual rack, [1804]or\nhorse-mill, according to Austin, still going round as in a ring. They are\nnot so continual, as divers, _felicius atomos denumerare possem_, saith\n[1805]Bernard, _quam motus cordis; nunc haec, nunc illa cogito_, you may as\nwell reckon up the motes in the sun as them. [1806]\"It extends itself to\neverything,\" as Guianerius will have it, \"that is superfluously sought\nafter:\"' or to any [1807]fervent desire, as Fernelius interprets it; be it\nin what kind soever, it tortures if immoderate, and is (according to [1808]\nPlater and others) an especial cause of melancholy. _Multuosis\nconcupiscentiis dilaniantur cogitationes meae_, [1809]Austin confessed,\nthat he was torn a pieces with his manifold desires: and so doth [1810]\nBernard complain, \"that he could not rest for them a minute of an hour:\nthis I would have, and that, and then I desire to be such and such.\" 'Tis a\nhard matter therefore to confine them, being they are so various and many,\nimpossible to apprehend all. I will only insist upon some few of the chief,\nand most noxious in their kind, as that exorbitant appetite and desire of\nhonour, which we commonly call ambition; love of money, which is\ncovetousness, and that greedy desire of gain: self-love, pride, and\ninordinate desire of vainglory or applause, love of study in excess; love\nof women (which will require a just volume of itself), of the other I will\nbriefly speak, and in their order.\n\nAmbition, a proud covetousness, or a dry thirst of honour, a great torture\nof the mind, composed of envy, pride, and covetousness, a gallant madness,\none [1811]defines it a pleasant poison, Ambrose, \"a canker of the soul, an\nhidden plague:\" [1812]Bernard, \"a secret poison, the father of livor, and\nmother of hypocrisy, the moth of holiness, and cause of madness, crucifying\nand disquieting all that it takes hold of.\" [1813]Seneca calls it, _rem\nsolicitam, timidam, vanam, ventosam_, a windy thing, a vain, solicitous,\nand fearful thing. For commonly they that, like Sisyphus, roll this\nrestless stone of ambition, are in a perpetual agony, still [1814]\nperplexed, _semper taciti, tritesque recedunt_ (Lucretius), doubtful,\ntimorous, suspicious, loath to offend in word or deed, still cogging and\ncolloguing, embracing, capping, cringing, applauding, flattering, fleering,\nvisiting, waiting at men's doors, with all affability, counterfeit honesty\nand humility. [1815]If that will not serve, if once this humour (as\n[1816]Cyprian describes it) possess his thirsty soul, _ambitionis salsugo\nubi bibulam animam possidet_, by hook and by crook he will obtain it, \"and\nfrom his hole he will climb to all honours and offices, if it be possible\nfor him to get up, flattering one, bribing another, he will leave no means\nunessay'd to win all.\" [1817]It is a wonder to see how slavishly these kind\nof men subject themselves, when they are about a suit, to every inferior\nperson; what pains they will take, run, ride, cast, plot, countermine,\nprotest and swear, vow, promise, what labours undergo, early up, down late;\nhow obsequious and affable they are, how popular and courteous, how they\ngrin and fleer upon every man they meet; with what feasting and inviting,\nhow they spend themselves and their fortunes, in seeking that many times,\nwhich they had much better be without; as [1818]Cyneas the orator told\nPyrrhus: with what waking nights, painful hours, anxious thoughts, and\nbitterness of mind, _inter spemque metumque_, distracted and tired, they\nconsume the interim of their time. There can be no greater plague for the\npresent. If they do obtain their suit, which with such cost and solicitude\nthey have sought, they are not so freed, their anxiety is anew to begin,\nfor they are never satisfied, _nihil aliud nisi imperium spirant_, their\nthoughts, actions, endeavours are all for sovereignty and honour, like\n[1819]Lues Sforza that huffing Duke of Milan, \"a man of singular wisdom,\nbut profound ambition, born to his own, and to the destruction of Italy,\"\nthough it be to their own ruin, and friends' undoing, they will contend,\nthey may not cease, but as a dog in a wheel, a bird in a cage, or a\nsquirrel in a chain, so [1820]Budaeus compares them; [1821]they climb and\nclimb still, with much labour, but never make an end, never at the top. A\nknight would be a baronet, and then a lord, and then a viscount, and then\nan earl, &c.; a doctor, a dean, and then a bishop; from tribune to praetor;\nfrom bailiff to major; first this office, and then that; as Pyrrhus in\n[1822]Plutarch, they will first have Greece, then Africa, and then Asia,\nand swell with Aesop's frog so long, till in the end they burst, or come\ndown with Sejanus, _ad Gemonias scalas_, and break their own necks; or as\nEvangelus the piper in Lucian, that blew his pipe so long, till he fell\ndown dead. If he chance to miss, and have a canvass, he is in a hell on the\nother side; so dejected, that he is ready to hang himself, turn heretic,\nTurk, or traitor in an instant. Enraged against his enemies, he rails,\nswears, fights, slanders, detracts, envies, murders: and for his own part,\n_si appetitum explere non potest, furore corripitur_; if he cannot satisfy\nhis desire (as [1823]Bodine writes) he runs mad. So that both ways, hit or\nmiss, he is distracted so long as his ambition lasts, he can look for no\nother but anxiety and care, discontent and grief in the meantime,\n[1824]madness itself, or violent death in the end. The event of this is\ncommon to be seen in populous cities, or in princes' courts, for a\ncourtier's life (as Budaeus describes it) \"is a [1825]gallimaufry of\nambition, lust, fraud, imposture, dissimulation, detraction, envy, pride;\n[1826]the court, a common conventicle of flatterers, time-servers,\npoliticians,\" &c.; or as [1827] Anthony Perez will, \"the suburbs of hell\nitself.\" If you will see such discontented persons, there you shall likely\nfind them. [1828]And which he observed of the markets of old Rome,\n\n       \"Qui perjurum convenire vult hominem, mitto in Comitium;\n        Qui mendacem et gloriosum, apud Cluasinae sacrum;\n        Dites, damnosos maritos, sub basilica quaerito,\" &c.\n\nPerjured knaves, knights of the post, liars, crackers, bad husbands, &c.\nkeep their several stations; they do still, and always did in every\ncommonwealth.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XII.--[Greek: philarguria], _Covetousness, a Cause_.\n\nPlutarch, in his [1829]book whether the diseases of the body be more\ngrievous than those of the soul, is of opinion, \"if you will examine all\nthe causes of our miseries in this life, you shall find them most part to\nhave had their beginning from stubborn anger, that furious desire of\ncontention, or some unjust or immoderate affection, as covetousness,\" &c.\nFrom whence \"are wars and contentions amongst you?\" [1830]St. James asks: I\nwill add usury, fraud, rapine, simony, oppression, lying, swearing, bearing\nfalse witness, &c. are they not from this fountain of covetousness, that\ngreediness in getting, tenacity in keeping, sordidity in spending; that\nthey are so wicked, [1831]\"unjust against God, their neighbour,\nthemselves;\" all comes hence. \"The desire of money is the root of all evil,\nand they that lust after it, pierce themselves through with many sorrows,\"\n1 Tim. vi. 10. Hippocrates therefore in his Epistle to Crateva, an\nherbalist, gives him this good counsel, that if it were possible, [1832]\n\"amongst other herbs, he should cut up that weed of covetousness by the\nroots, that there be no remainder left, and then know this for a certainty,\nthat together with their bodies, thou mayst quickly cure all the diseases\nof their minds.\" For it is indeed the pattern, image, epitome of all\nmelancholy, the fountain of many miseries, much discontented care and woe;\nthis \"inordinate, or immoderate desire of gain, to get or keep money,\" as\n[1833]Bonaventure defines it: or, as Austin describes it, a madness of the\nsoul, Gregory a torture; Chrysostom, an insatiable drunkenness; Cyprian,\nblindness, _speciosum supplicium_, a plague subverting kingdoms, families,\nan [1834]incurable disease; Budaeus, an ill habit, [1835]\"yielding to no\nremedies:\" neither Aesculapius nor Plutus can cure them: a continual\nplague, saith Solomon, and vexation of spirit, another hell. I know there\nbe some of opinion, that covetous men are happy, and worldly, wise, that\nthere is more pleasure in getting of wealth than in spending, and no\ndelight in the world like unto it. 'Twas [1836]Bias' problem of old, \"With\nwhat art thou not weary? with getting money. What is most delectable? to\ngain.\" What is it, trow you, that makes a poor man labour all his lifetime,\ncarry such great burdens, fare so hardly, macerate himself, and endure so\nmuch misery, undergo such base offices with so great patience, to rise up\nearly, and lie down late, if there were not an extraordinary delight in\ngetting and keeping of money? What makes a merchant that hath no need,\n_satis superque domi_, to range all over the world, through all those\nintemperate [1837]Zones of heat and cold; voluntarily to venture his life,\nand be content with such miserable famine, nasty usage, in a stinking ship;\nif there were not a pleasure and hope to get money, which doth season the\nrest, and mitigate his indefatigable pains? What makes them go into the\nbowels of the earth, an hundred fathom deep, endangering their dearest\nlives, enduring damps and filthy smells, when they have enough already, if\nthey could be content, and no such cause to labour, but an extraordinary\ndelight they take in riches. This may seem plausible at first show, a\npopular and strong argument; but let him that so thinks, consider better of\nit, and he shall soon perceive, that it is far otherwise than he supposeth;\nit may be haply pleasing at the first, as most part all melancholy is. For\nsuch men likely have some _lucida intervalla_, pleasant symptoms\nintermixed; but you must note that of [1838]Chrysostom, \"'Tis one thing to\nbe rich, another to be covetous:\" generally they are all fools, dizzards,\nmadmen, [1839]miserable wretches, living besides themselves, _sine arte\nfruendi_, in perpetual slavery, fear, suspicion, sorrow, and discontent,\n_plus aloes quam mellis habent_; and are indeed, \"rather possessed by their\nmoney, than possessors:\" as [1840]Cyprian hath it, _mancipati pecuniis_;\nbound prentice to their goods, as [1841]Pliny; or as Chrysostom, _servi\ndivitiarum_, slaves and drudges to their substance; and we may conclude of\nthem all, as [1842]Valerius doth of Ptolomaeus king of Cyprus, \"He was in\ntitle a king of that island, but in his mind, a miserable drudge of money:\"\n\n[1843]  ------\"potiore metallis\n        libertate carens\"------\n\nwanting his liberty, which is better than gold. Damasippus the Stoic, in\nHorace, proves that all mortal men dote by fits, some one way, some\nanother, but that covetous men [1844]are madder than the rest; and he that\nshall truly look into their estates, and examine their symptoms, shall find\nno better of them, but that they are all [1845]fools, as Nabal was, _Re et\nnomine_ (1. Reg. 15.) For what greater folly can there be, or [1846]\nmadness, than to macerate himself when he need not? and when, as Cyprian\nnotes, [1847]\"he may be freed from his burden, and eased of his pains, will\ngo on still, his wealth increasing, when he hath enough, to get more, to\nlive besides himself,\" to starve his genius, keep back from his wife\n[1848]and children, neither letting them nor other friends use or enjoy\nthat which is theirs by right, and which they much need perhaps; like a\nhog, or dog in the manger, he doth only keep it, because it shall do nobody\nelse good, hurting himself and others: and for a little momentary pelf,\ndamn his own soul? They are commonly sad and tetric by nature, as Achab's\nspirit was because he could not get Naboth's vineyard, (1. Reg. 22.) and if\nhe lay out his money at any time, though it be to necessary uses, to his\nown children's good, he brawls and scolds, his heart is heavy, much\ndisquieted he is, and loath to part from it: _Miser abstinet et timet uti_,\nHor. He is of a wearish, dry, pale constitution, and cannot sleep for cares\nand worldly business; his riches, saith Solomon, will not let him sleep,\nand unnecessary business which he heapeth on himself; or if he do sleep,\n'tis a very unquiet, interrupt, unpleasing sleep: with his bags in his\narms,\n\n        ------\"congestis undique sacc\n        indormit inhians,\"------\n\nAnd though he be at a banquet, or at some merry feast, \"he sighs for grief\nof heart\" (as [1849]Cyprian hath it) \"and cannot sleep though it be upon a\ndown bed; his wearish body takes no rest,\" [1850]\"troubled in his\nabundance, and sorrowful in plenty, unhappy for the present, and more\nunhappy in the life to come.\" Basil. He is a perpetual drudge,\n[1851]restless in his thoughts, and never satisfied, a slave, a wretch, a\ndust-worm, _semper quod idolo suo immolet, sedulus observat_ Cypr. _prolog.\nad sermon_ still seeking what sacrifice he may offer to his golden god,\n_per fas et nefas_, he cares not how, his trouble is endless,\n[1852]_crescunt divitiae, tamen curtae nescio quid semper abest rei_: his\nwealth increaseth, and the more he hath, the more [1853]he wants: like\nPharaoh's lean kine, which devoured the fat, and were not satisfied.\n[1854]Austin therefore defines covetousness, _quarumlibet rerum inhonestam\net insatiabilem cupiditatem_ a dishonest and insatiable desire of gain; and\nin one of his epistles compares it to hell; [1855]\"which devours all, and\nyet never hath enough, a bottomless pit,\" an endless misery; _in quem\nscopulum avaritiae cadaverosi senes utplurimum impingunt_, and that which\nis their greatest corrosive, they are in continual suspicion, fear, and\ndistrust, He thinks his own wife and children are so many thieves, and go\nabout to cozen him, his servants are all false:\n\n       \"Rem suam periisse, seque eradicarier,\n        Et divum atque hominum clamat continuo fidem,\n        De suo tigillo si qua exit foras.\"\n\n       \"If his doors creek, then out he cries anon,\n        His goods are gone, and he is quite undone.\"\n\n_Timidus Plutus_, an old proverb, As fearful as Plutus: so doth\nAristophanes and Lucian bring him in fearful still, pale, anxious,\nsuspicious, and trusting no man, [1856]\"They are afraid of tempests for\ntheir corn; they are afraid of their friends lest they should ask something\nof them, beg or borrow; they are afraid of their enemies lest they hurt\nthem, thieves lest they rob them; they are afraid of war and afraid of\npeace, afraid of rich and afraid of poor; afraid of all.\" Last of all, they\nare afraid of want, that they shall die beggars, which makes them lay up\nstill, and dare not use that they have: what if a dear year come, or\ndearth, or some loss? and were it not that they are both to [1857]lay out\nmoney on a rope, they would be hanged forthwith, and sometimes die to save\ncharges, and make away themselves, if their corn and cattle miscarry;\nthough they have abundance left, as [1858]Agellius notes. [1859]Valerius\nmakes mention of one that in a famine sold a mouse for 200 pence, and\nfamished himself: such are their cares, [1860]griefs and perpetual fears.\nThese symptoms are elegantly expressed by Theophrastus in his character of\na covetous man; [1861]\"lying in bed, he asked his wife whether she shut the\ntrunks and chests fast, the cap-case be sealed, and whether the hall door\nbe bolted; and though she say all is well, he riseth out of his bed in his\nshirt, barefoot and barelegged, to see whether it be so, with a dark\nlantern searching every corner, scarce sleeping a wink all night.\" Lucian\nin that pleasant and witty dialogue called Gallus, brings in Mycillus the\ncobbler disputing with his cock, sometimes Pythagoras; where after much\nspeech pro and con, to prove the happiness of a mean estate, and\ndiscontents of a rich man, Pythagoras' cock in the end, to illustrate by\nexamples that which he had said, brings him to Gnyphon the usurer's house\nat midnight, and after that to Encrates; whom, they found both awake,\ncasting up their accounts, and telling of their money, [1862]lean, dry,\npale and anxious, still suspecting lest somebody should make a hole through\nthe wall, and so get in; or if a rat or mouse did but stir, starting upon a\nsudden, and running to the door to see whether all were fast. Plautus, in\nhis Aulularia, makes old Euclio [1863]commanding Staphyla his wife to shut\nthe doors fast, and the fire to be put out, lest anybody should make that\nan errand to come to his house: when he washed his hands, [1864]he was\nloath to fling away the foul water, complaining that he was undone, because\nthe smoke got out of his roof. And as he went from home, seeing a crow\nscratch upon the muck-hill, returned in all haste, taking it for _malum\nomen_, an ill sign, his money was digged up; with many such. He that will\nbut observe their actions, shall find these and many such passages not\nfeigned for sport, but really performed, verified indeed by such covetous\nand miserable wretches, and that it is,\n\n[1865]  ------\"manifesta phrenesis\n        Ut locuples moriaris egenti vivere fato.\"\n\nA mere madness, to live like a wretch, and die rich.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XIII.--_Love of Gaming, &c. and pleasures immoderate; Causes_.\n\nIt is a wonder to see, how many poor, distressed, miserable wretches, one\nshall meet almost in every path and street, begging for an alms, that have\nbeen well descended, and sometimes in flourishing estate, now ragged,\ntattered, and ready to be starved, lingering out a painful life, in\ndiscontent and grief of body and mind, and all through immoderate lust,\ngaming, pleasure and riot. 'Tis the common end of all sensual epicures and\nbrutish prodigals, that are stupefied and carried away headlong with their\nseveral pleasures and lusts. Cebes in his table, St. Ambrose in his second\nbook of Abel and Cain, and amongst the rest Lucian in his tract _de Mercede\nconductis_, hath excellent well deciphered such men's proceedings in his\npicture of Opulentia, whom he feigns to dwell on the top of a high mount,\nmuch sought after by many suitors; at their first coming they are generally\nentertained by pleasure and dalliance, and have all the content that\npossibly may be given, so long as their money lasts: but when their means\nfail, they are contemptibly thrust out at a back door, headlong, and there\nleft to shame, reproach, despair. And he at first that had so many\nattendants, parasites, and followers, young and lusty, richly arrayed, and\nall the dainty fare that might be had, with all kind of welcome and good\nrespect, is now upon a sudden stripped of all, [1866]pale, naked, old,\ndiseased and forsaken, cursing his stars, and ready to strangle himself;\nhaving no other company but repentance, sorrow, grief, derision, beggary,\nand contempt, which are his daily attendants to his life's end. As the\n[1867]prodigal son had exquisite music, merry company, dainty fare at\nfirst; but a sorrowful reckoning in the end; so have all such vain delights\nand their followers. [1868]_Tristes voluptatum exitus, et quisquis\nvoluptatum suarum reminisci volet, intelliget_, as bitter as gall and\nwormwood is their last; grief of mind, madness itself. The ordinary rocks\nupon which such men do impinge and precipitate themselves, are cards, dice,\nhawks, and hounds, _Insanum venandi studium_, one calls it, _insanae\nsubstructiones_: their mad structures, disports, plays, &c., when they are\nunseasonably used, imprudently handled, and beyond their fortunes. Some men\nare consumed by mad fantastical buildings, by making galleries, cloisters,\nterraces, walks, orchards, gardens, pools, rillets, bowers, and such like\nplaces of pleasure; _Inutiles domos_, [1869]Xenophon calls them, which\nhowsoever they be delightsome things in themselves, and acceptable to all\nbeholders, an ornament, and benefiting some great men: yet unprofitable to\nothers, and the sole overthrow of their estates. Forestus in his\nobservations hath an example of such a one that became melancholy upon the\nlike occasion, having consumed his substance in an unprofitable building,\nwhich would afterward yield him no advantage. Others, I say, are [1870]\noverthrown by those mad sports of hawking and hunting; honest recreations,\nand fit for some great men, but not for every base inferior person; whilst\nthey will maintain their falconers, dogs, and hunting nags, their wealth,\nsaith [1871]Salmutze, \"runs away with hounds, and their fortunes fly away\nwith hawks.\" They persecute beasts so long, till in the end they themselves\ndegenerate into beasts, as [1872]Agrippa taxeth them, [1873]Actaeon like,\nfor as he was eaten to death by his own dogs, so do they devour themselves\nand their patrimonies, in such idle and unnecessary disports, neglecting in\nthe mean time their more necessary business, and to follow their vocations.\nOver-mad too sometimes are our great men in delighting, and doting too much\non it. [1874]\"When they drive poor husbandmen from their tillage,\" as\n[1875]Sarisburiensis objects, _Polycrat. l. 1. c. 4_, \"fling down country\nfarms, and whole towns, to make parks, and forests, starving men to feed\nbeasts, and [1876]punishing in the mean time such a man that shall molest\ntheir game, more severely than him that is otherwise a common hacker, or a\nnotorious thief.\" But great men are some ways to be excused, the meaner\nsort have no evasion why they should not be counted mad. Poggius the\nFlorentine tells a merry story to this purpose, condemning the folly and\nimpertinent business of such kind of persons. A physician of Milan, saith\nhe, that cured mad men, had a pit of water in his house, in which he kept\nhis patients, some up to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the chin,\n_pro modo insaniae_, as they were more or less affected. One of them by\nchance, that was well recovered, stood in the door, and seeing a gallant\nride by with a hawk on his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him,\nwould needs know to what use all this preparation served; he made answer to\nkill certain fowls; the patient demanded again, what his fowl might be\nworth which he killed in a year; he replied 5 or 10 crowns; and when he\nurged him farther what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him in, he told him\n400 crowns; with that the patient bad be gone, as he loved his life and\nwelfare, for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the\npit amongst mad men up to the chin: taxing the madness and folly of such\nvain men that spend themselves in those idle sports, neglecting their\nbusiness and necessary affairs. Leo Decimus, that hunting pope, is much\ndiscommended by [1877]Jovius in his life, for his immoderate desire of\nhawking and hunting, in so much that (as he saith) he would sometimes live\nabout Ostia weeks and months together, leave suitors [1878]unrespected,\nbulls and pardons unsigned, to his own prejudice, and many private men's\nloss. [1879]\"And if he had been by chance crossed in his sport, or his game\nnot so good, he was so impatient, that he would revile and miscall many\ntimes men of great worth with most bitter taunts, look so sour, be so angry\nand waspish, so grieved and molested, that it is incredible to relate it.\"\nBut if he had good sport, and been well pleased, on the other side,\n_incredibili munificentia_, with unspeakable bounty and munificence he\nwould reward all his fellow hunters, and deny nothing to any suitor when he\nwas in that mood. To say truth, 'tis the common humour of all gamesters, as\nGalataeus observes, if they win, no men living are so jovial and merry, but\n[1880]if they lose, though it be but a trifle, two or three games at\ntables, or a dealing at cards for two pence a game, they are so choleric\nand testy that no man may speak with them, and break many times into\nviolent passions, oaths, imprecations, and unbeseeming speeches, little\ndiffering from mad men for the time. Generally of all gamesters and gaming,\nif it be excessive, thus much we may conclude, that whether they win or\nlose for the present, their winnings are not _Munera fortunae, sed\ninsidiae_ as that wise Seneca determines, not fortune's gifts, but baits,\nthe common catastrophe is [1881]beggary, [1882]_Ut pestis vitam, sic adimit\nalea pecuniam_, as the plague takes away life, doth gaming goods, for\n[1883] _omnes nudi, inopes et egeni_;\n\n[1884] \"Alea Scylla vorax, species certissima furti,\n        Non contenta bonis animum quoque perfida mergit,\n        Foeda, furax, infamis, iners, furiosa, ruina.\"\n\nFor a little pleasure they take, and some small gains and gettings now and\nthen, their wives and children are ringed in the meantime, and they\nthemselves with loss of body and soul rue it in the end. I will say nothing\nof those prodigious prodigals, _perdendae pecuniae, genitos_, as he [1885]\ntaxed Anthony, _Qui patrimonium sine ulla fori calumnia amittunt_, saith\n[1886]Cyprian, and [1887]mad sybaritical spendthrifts, _Quique una comedunt\npatrimonia coena_; that eat up all at a breakfast, at a supper, or amongst\nbawds, parasites, and players, consume themselves in an instant, as if they\nhad flung it into [1888]Tiber, with great wages, vain and idle expenses,\n&c., not themselves only, but even all their friends, as a man desperately\nswimming drowns him that comes to help him, by suretyship and borrowing\nthey will willingly undo all their associates and allies. [1889] _Irati\npecuniis_, as he saith, angry with their money: [1890]\"what with a wanton\neye, a liquorish tongue, and a gamesome hand,\" when they have indiscreetly\nimpoverished themselves, mortgaged their wits, together with their lands,\nand entombed their ancestors' fair possessions in their bowels, they may\nlead the rest of their days in prison, as many times they do; they repent\nat leisure; and when all is gone begin to be thrifty: but _Sera est in\nfundo parsimonia_, 'tis then too late to look about; their [1891]end is\nmisery, sorrow, shame, and discontent. And well they deserve to be infamous\nand discontent. [1892]_Catamidiari in Amphitheatro_, as by Adrian the\nemperor's edict they were of old, _decoctores bonorum suorum_, so he calls\nthem, prodigal fools, to be publicly shamed, and hissed out of all\nsocieties, rather than to be pitied or relieved. [1893]The Tuscans and\nBoetians brought their bankrupts into the marketplace in a bier with an\nempty purse carried before them, all the boys following, where they sat all\nday _circumstante plebe_, to be infamous and ridiculous. At [1894]Padua in\nItaly they have a stone called the stone of turpitude, near the\nsenate-house, where spendthrifts, and such as disclaim non-payment of\ndebts, do sit with their hinder parts bare, that by that note of disgrace\nothers may be terrified from all such vain expense, or borrowing more than\nthey can tell how to pay. The [1895]civilians of old set guardians over\nsuch brain-sick prodigals, as they did over madmen, to moderate their\nexpenses, that they should not so loosely consume their fortunes, to the\nutter undoing of their families.\n\nI may not here omit those two main plagues, and common dotages of human\nkind, wine and women, which have infatuated and besotted myriads of people;\nthey go commonly together.\n\n[1896] \"Qui vino indulget, quemque aloa decoquit, ille\n        In venerem putret\"------\n\nTo whom is sorrow, saith Solomon, Pro. xxiii. 39, to whom is woe, but to\nsuch a one as loves drink? it causeth torture, (_vino tortus et ira_) and\nbitterness of mind, Sirac. 31. 21. _Vinum furoris_, Jeremy calls it, _15.\ncap._ wine of madness, as well he may, for _insanire facit sanos_, it makes\nsound men sick and sad, and wise men [1897]mad, to say and do they know not\nwhat. _Accidit hodie terribilis casus_ (saith [1898]S. Austin) hear a\nmiserable accident; Cyrillus' son this day in his drink, _Matrem\npraegnantem nequiter oppressit, sororem violare voluit, patrem occidit\nfere, et duas alias sorores ad mortem vulneravit_, would have violated his\nsister, killed his father, &c. A true saying it was of him, _Vino dari\nlaetitiam et dolorem_, drink causeth mirth, and drink causeth sorrow, drink\ncauseth \"poverty and want,\" (Prov. xxi.) shame and disgrace. _Multi\nignobiles evasere ob vini potum, et_ (Austin) _amissis honoribus profugi\naberrarunt_: many men have made shipwreck of their fortunes, and go like\nrogues and beggars, having turned all their substance into _aurum\npotabile_, that otherwise might have lived in good worship and happy\nestate, and for a few hours' pleasure, for their Hilary term's but short,\nor [1899]free madness, as Seneca calls it, purchase unto themselves eternal\ntediousness and trouble.\n\nThat other madness is on women, _Apostatare facit cor_, saith the wise man,\n[1900]_Atque homini cerebrum minuit_. Pleasant at first she is, like\nDioscorides Rhododaphne, that fair plant to the eye, but poison to the\ntaste, the rest as bitter as wormwood in the end (Prov. v. 4.) and sharp as\na two-edged sword, (vii. 27.) \"Her house is the way to hell, and goes down\nto the chambers of death.\" What more sorrowful can be said? they are\nmiserable in this life, mad, beasts, led like [1901]\"oxen to the\nslaughter:\" and that which is worse, whoremasters and drunkards shall be\njudged, _amittunt gratiam_, saith Austin, _perdunt gloriam, incurrunt\ndamnationem aeternam_. They lose grace and glory;\n\n[1902]  ------\"brevis illa voluptas\n        Abrogat aeternum caeli decus\"------\n\nthey gain hell and eternal damnation.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XIV.--_Philautia, or Self-love, Vainglory, Praise, Honour,\nImmoderate Applause, Pride, overmuch Joy, &c., Causes_.\n\nSelf-love, pride, and vainglory, [1903]_caecus amor sui_, which Chrysostom\ncalls one of the devil's three great nets; [1904]\"Bernard, an arrow which\npierceth the soul through, and slays it; a sly, insensible enemy, not\nperceived,\" are main causes. Where neither anger, lust, covetousness, fear,\nsorrow, &c., nor any other perturbation can lay hold; this will slyly and\ninsensibly pervert us, _Quem non gula vicit, Philautia, superavit_, (saith\nCyprian) whom surfeiting could not overtake, self-love hath overcome.\n[1905]\"He hath scorned all money, bribes, gifts, upright otherwise and\nsincere, hath inserted himself to no fond imagination, and sustained all\nthose tyrannical concupiscences of the body, hath lost all his honour,\ncaptivated by vainglory.\" Chrysostom, _sup. Io._ _Tu sola animum mentemque\nperuris, gloria_. A great assault and cause of our present malady, although\nwe do most part neglect, take no notice of it, yet this is a violent\nbatterer of our souls, causeth melancholy and dotage. This pleasing humour;\nthis soft and whispering popular air, _Amabilis insania_; this delectable\nfrenzy, most irrefragable passion, _Mentis gratissimus error_, this\nacceptable disease, which so sweetly sets upon us, ravisheth our senses,\nlulls our souls asleep, puffs up our hearts as so many bladders, and that\nwithout all feeling, [1906]insomuch as \"those that are misaffected with it,\nnever so much as once perceive it, or think of any cure.\" We commonly love\nhim best in this [1907]malady, that doth us most harm, and are very willing\nto be hurt; _adulationibus nostris libentur facemus_ (saith [1908] Jerome)\nwe love him, we love him for it: [1909]_O Bonciari suave, suave fuit a te\ntali haec tribui_; 'Twas sweet to hear it. And as [1910]Pliny doth\ningenuously confess to his dear friend Augurinus, \"all thy writings are\nmost acceptable, but those especially that speak of us.\" Again, a little\nafter to Maximus, [1911]\"I cannot express how pleasing it is to me to hear\nmyself commended.\" Though we smile to ourselves, at least ironically, when\nparasites bedaub us with false encomiums, as many princes cannot choose but\ndo, _Quum tale quid nihil intra se repererint_, when they know they come as\nfar short, as a mouse to an elephant, of any such virtues; yet it doth us\ngood. Though we seem many times to be angry, [1912] \"and blush at our own\npraises, yet our souls inwardly rejoice, it puffs us up;\" 'tis _fallax\nsuavitas, blandus daemon_, \"makes us swell beyond our bounds, and forget\nourselves.\" Her two daughters are lightness of mind, immoderate joy and\npride, not excluding those other concomitant vices, which [1913]Iodocus\nLorichius reckons up; bragging, hypocrisy, peevishness, and curiosity.\n\nNow the common cause of this mischief, ariseth from ourselves or others,\n[1914]we are active and passive. It proceeds inwardly from ourselves, as we\nare active causes, from an overweening conceit we have of our good parts,\nown worth, (which indeed is no worth) our bounty, favour, grace, valour,\nstrength, wealth, patience, meekness, hospitality, beauty, temperance,\ngentry, knowledge, wit, science, art, learning, our [1915] excellent gifts\nand fortunes, for which, Narcissus-like, we admire, flatter, and applaud\nourselves, and think all the world esteems so of us; and as deformed women\neasily believe those that tell them they be fair, we are too credulous of\nour own good parts and praises, too well persuaded of ourselves. We brag\nand venditate our [1916]own works, and scorn all others in respect of us;\n_Inflati scientia_, (saith Paul) our wisdom, [1917]our learning, all our\ngeese are swans, and we as basely esteem and vilify other men's, as we do\nover-highly prize and value our own. We will not suffer them to be _in\nsecundis_, no, not _in tertiis_; what, _Mecum confertur Ulysses_? they are\n_Mures, Muscae, culices prae se_, nits and flies compared to his inexorable\nand supercilious, eminent and arrogant worship: though indeed they be far\nbefore him. Only wise, only rich, only fortunate, valorous, and fair,\npuffed up with this tympany of self-conceit; [1918]as that proud Pharisee,\nthey are not (as they suppose) \"like other men,\" of a purer and more\nprecious metal: [1919]_Soli rei gerendi sunt efficaces_, which that wise\nPeriander held of such: [1920]_meditantur omne qui prius negotium_, &c.\n_Novi quendam_ (saith [1921]Erasmus) I knew one so arrogant that he thought\nhimself inferior to no man living, like [1922]Callisthenes the philosopher,\nthat neither held Alexander's acts, or any other subject worthy of his pen,\nsuch was his insolency; or Seleucus king of Syria, who thought none fit to\ncontend with him but the Romans. [1923]_Eos solos dignos ratus quibuscum de\nimperio certaret_. That which Tully writ to Atticus long since, is still in\nforce. [1924]\"There was never yet true poet nor orator, that thought any\nother better than himself.\" And such for the most part are your princes,\npotentates, great philosophers, historiographers, authors of sects or\nheresies, and all our great scholars, as [1925]Hierom defines; \"a natural\nphilosopher is a glorious creature, and a very slave of rumour, fame, and\npopular opinion,\" and though they write _de contemptu gloriae_, yet as he\nobserves, they will put their names to their books. _Vobis et famae, me\nsemper dedi_, saith Trebellius Pollio, I have wholly consecrated myself to\nyou and fame. \"'Tis all my desire, night and day, 'tis all my study to\nraise my name.\" Proud [1926]Pliny seconds him; _Quamquam O_! &c. and that\nvainglorious [1927]orator is not ashamed to confess in an Epistle of his to\nMarcus Lecceius, _Ardeo incredibili cupididate_, &c. \"I burn with an\nincredible desire to have my [1928]name registered in thy book.\" Out of\nthis fountain proceed all those cracks and brags,--[1929]_speramus carmina\nfingi Posse linenda cedro, et leni servanda cupresso_--[1930]_Non usitata\nnec tenui ferar penna.--nec in terra morabor longius. Nil parvum aut humili\nmodo, nil mortale loquor. Dicar qua violens obstrepit Ausidus.--Exegi\nmonumentum aere perennius. Iamque opus exegi, quod nec Jovis ira, nec\nignis, &c. cum venit ille dies, &c. parte tamen meliore mei super alta\nperennis astra ferar, nomenque erit indelebile nostrum_. (This of Ovid I\nhave paraphrased in English.)\n\n       \"And when I am dead and gone,\n        My corpse laid under a stone\n        My fame shall yet survive,\n        And I shall be alive,\n        In these my works for ever,\n        My glory shall persever,\" &c.\n\nAnd that of Ennius,\n\n       \"Nemo me lachrymis decoret, neque funera fletu\n        Faxit, cur? volito docta per ora virum.\"\n\n\"Let none shed tears over me, or adorn my bier with sorrow--because I am\neternally in the mouths of men.\" With many such proud strains, and foolish\nflashes too common with writers. Not so much as Democharis on the [1931]\nTopics, but he will be immortal. _Typotius de fama_, shall be famous, and\nwell he deserves, because he writ of fame; and every trivial poet must be\nrenowned,--_Plausuque petit clarescere vulgi_. \"He seeks the applause of\nthe public.\" This puffing humour it is, that hath produced so many great\ntomes, built such famous monuments, strong castles, and Mausolean tombs, to\nhave their acts eternised,--_Digito monstrari, et dicier hic est_; \"to be\npointed at with the finger, and to have it said 'there he goes,'\" to see\ntheir names inscribed, as Phryne on the walls of Thebes, _Phryne fecit_;\nthis causeth so many bloody battles,--_Et noctes cogit vigilare serenas_;\n\"and induces us to watch during calm nights.\" Long journeys, _Magnum iter\nintendo, sed dat mihi gloria vires_, \"I contemplate a monstrous journey,\nbut the love of glory strengthens me for it,\" gaining honour, a little\napplause, pride, self-love, vainglory. This is it which makes them take\nsuch pains, and break out into those ridiculous strains, this high conceit\nof themselves, to [1932]scorn all others; _ridiculo fastu et intolerando\ncontemptu_; as [1933]Palaemon the grammarian contemned Varro, _secum et\nnatas et morituras literas jactans_, and brings them to that height of\ninsolency, that they cannot endure to be contradicted, [1934]\"or hear of\nanything but their own commendation,\" which Hierom notes of such kind of\nmen. And as [1935]Austin well seconds him, \"'tis their sole study day and\nnight to be commended and applauded.\" When as indeed, in all wise men's\njudgments, _quibus cor sapit_, they are [1936]mad, empty vessels, funges,\nbeside themselves, derided, _et ut Camelus in proverbio quaerens cornua,\netiam quas habebat aures amisit_, [1937]their works are toys, as an almanac\nout of date, [1938]_authoris pereunt garrulitate sui_, they seek fame and\nimmortality, but reap dishonour and infamy, they are a common obloquy,\n_insensati_, and come far short of that which they suppose or expect.\n[1939]_O puer ut sis vitalis metuo_,\n\n        ------\"How much I dread\n        Thy days are short, some lord shall strike thee dead.\"\n\nOf so many myriads of poets, rhetoricians, philosophers, sophisters, as\n[1940]Eusebius well observes, which have written in former ages, scarce one\nof a thousand's works remains, _nomina et libri simul cum corporibus\ninterierunt_, their books and bodies are perished together. It is not as\nthey vainly think, they shall surely be admired and immortal, as one told\nPhilip of Macedon insultingly, after a victory, that his shadow was no\nlonger than before, we may say to them,\n\n       \"Nos demiramur, sed non cum deside vulgo,\n        Sed velut Harpyas, Gorgonas, et Furias.\"\n\n       \"We marvel too, not as the vulgar we,\n        But as we Gorgons, Harpies, or Furies see.\"\n\nOr if we do applaud, honour and admire, _quota pars_, how small a part, in\nrespect of the whole world, never so much as hears our names, how few take\nnotice of us, how slender a tract, as scant as Alcibiades' land in a map!\nAnd yet every man must and will be immortal, as he hopes, and extend his\nfame to our antipodes, when as half, no not a quarter of his own province\nor city, neither knows nor hears of him--but say they did, what's a city to\na kingdom, a kingdom to Europe, Europe to the world, the world itself that\nmust have an end, if compared to the least visible star in the firmament,\neighteen times bigger than it? and then if those stars be infinite, and\nevery star there be a sun, as some will, and as this sun of ours hath his\nplanets about him, all inhabited, what proportion bear we to them, and\nwhere's our glory? _Orbem terrarum victor Romanus habebat_, as he cracked\nin Petronius, all the world was under Augustus: and so in Constantine's\ntime, Eusebius brags he governed all the world, _universum mundum praeclare\nadmodum administravit,--et omnes orbis gentes Imperatori subjecti_: so of\nAlexander it is given out, the four monarchies, &c. when as neither Greeks\nnor Romans ever had the fifteenth part of the now known world, nor half of\nthat which was then described. What braggadocios are they and we then?\n_quam brevis hic de nobis sermo_, as [1941]he said, [1942]_pudebit aucti\nnominis_, how short a time, how little a while doth this fame of ours\ncontinue? Every private province, every small territory and city, when we\nhave all done, will yield as generous spirits, as brave examples in all\nrespects, as famous as ourselves, Cadwallader in Wales, Rollo in Normandy,\nRobin Hood and Little John, are as much renowned in Sherwood, as Caesar in\nRome, Alexander in Greece, or his Hephestion, [1943] _Omnis aetas omnisque\npopulus in exemplum et admirationem veniet_, every town, city, book, is\nfull of brave soldiers, senators, scholars; and though [1944]Bracyclas was\na worthy captain, a good man, and as they thought, not to be matched in\nLacedaemon, yet as his mother truly said, _plures habet Sparta Bracyda\nmeliores_, Sparta had many better men than ever he was; and howsoever thou\nadmirest thyself, thy friend, many an obscure fellow the world never took\nnotice of, had he been in place or action, would have done much better than\nhe or he, or thou thyself.\n\nAnother kind of mad men there is opposite to these, that are insensibly\nmad, and know not of it, such as contemn all praise and glory, think\nthemselves most free, when as indeed they are most mad: _calcant sed alio\nfastu_: a company of cynics, such as are monks, hermits, anchorites, that\ncontemn the world, contemn themselves, contemn all titles, honours,\noffices: and yet in that contempt are more proud than any man living\nwhatsoever. They are proud in humility, proud in that they are not proud,\n_saepe homo de vanae gloriae contemptu, vanius gloriatur_, as Austin hath\nit, _confess. lib. 10, cap. 38_, like Diogenes, _intus gloriantur_, they\nbrag inwardly, and feed themselves fat with a self-conceit of sanctity,\nwhich is no better than hypocrisy. They go in sheep's russet, many great\nmen that might maintain themselves in cloth of gold, and seem to be\ndejected, humble by their outward carriage, when as inwardly they are\nswollen full of pride, arrogancy, and self-conceit. And therefore Seneca\nadviseth his friend Lucilius, [1945]\"in his attire and gesture, outward\nactions, especially to avoid all such things as are more notable in\nthemselves: as a rugged attire, hirsute head, horrid beard, contempt of\nmoney, coarse lodging, and whatsoever leads to fame that opposite way.\"\n\nAll this madness yet proceeds from ourselves, the main engine which batters\nus is from others, we are merely passive in this business: from a company\nof parasites and flatterers, that with immoderate praise, and bombast\nepithets, glossing titles, false eulogiums, so bedaub and applaud, gild\nover many a silly and undeserving man, that they clap him quite out of his\nwits. _Res imprimis violenta est_, as Hierom notes, this common applause is\na most violent thing, _laudum placenta_, a drum, fife, and trumpet cannot\nso animate; that fattens men, erects and dejects them in an instant. [1946]\n_Palma negata macrum, donata reducit opimum_. It makes them fat and lean,\nas frost doth conies. [1947]\"And who is that mortal man that can so contain\nhimself, that if he be immoderately commended and applauded, will not be\nmoved?\" Let him be what he will, those parasites will overturn him: if he\nbe a king, he is one of the nine worthies, more than a man, a god\nforthwith,--[1948]_edictum Domini Deique nostri_: and they will sacrifice\nunto him,\n\n[1949]  ------\"divinos si tu patiaris honores,\n        Ultro ipsi dabimus meritasque sacrabimus aras.\"\n\nIf he be a soldier, then Themistocles, Epaminondas, Hector, Achilles, _duo\nfulmina belli, triumviri terrarum_, &c., and the valour of both Scipios is\ntoo little for him, he is _invictissimus, serenissimus, multis trophaeus\nornatissimus, naturae, dominus_, although he be _lepus galeatus_, indeed a\nvery coward, a milk-sop, [1950]and as he said of Xerxes, _postremus in\npugna, primus in fuga_, and such a one as never durst look his enemy in the\nface. If he be a big man, then is he a Samson, another Hercules; if he\npronounce a speech, another Tully or Demosthenes; as of Herod in the Acts,\n\"the voice of God and not of man:\" if he can make a verse, Homer, Virgil,\n&c., And then my silly weak patient takes all these eulogiums to himself;\nif he be a scholar so commended for his much reading, excellent style,\nmethod, &c., he will eviscerate himself like a spider, study to death,\n_Laudatas ostendit avis Junonia pennas_, peacock-like he will display all\nhis feathers. If he be a soldier, and so applauded, his valour extolled,\nthough it be _impar congressus_, as that of Troilus and Achilles, _Infelix\npuer_, he will combat with a giant, run first upon a breach, as another\n[1951]Philippus, he will ride into the thickest of his enemies. Commend his\nhousekeeping, and he will beggar himself; commend his temperance, he will\nstarve himself.\n\n        ------\"laudataque virtus\n        Crescit, et immensum gloria calcar habet.\"[1952]\n\nhe is mad, mad, mad, no woe with him:--_impatiens consortis erit_, he will\nover the [1953]Alps to be talked of, or to maintain his credit. Commend an\nambitious man, some proud prince or potentate, _si plus aequo laudetur_\n(saith [1954]Erasmus) _cristas erigit, exuit hominem, Deum se putat_, he\nsets up his crest, and will be no longer a man but a God.\n\n[1955]  ------\"nihil est quod credere de se\n        Non audet quum laudatur diis aequa potestas.\"[1956]\n\nHow did this work with Alexander, that would needs be Jupiter's son, and go\nlike Hercules in a lion's skin? Domitian a god, [1957](_Dominus Deus noster\nsic fieri jubet_,) like the [1958]Persian kings, whose image was adored by\nall that came into the city of Babylon. Commodus the emperor was so gulled\nby his flattering parasites, that he must be called Hercules.\n[1959]Antonius the Roman would be crowned with ivy, carried in a chariot,\nand adored for Bacchus. Cotys, king of Thrace, was married to [1960]\nMinerva, and sent three several messengers one after another, to see if she\nwere come to his bedchamber. Such a one was [1961]Jupiter Menecrates,\nMaximinus, Jovianus, Dioclesianus Herculeus, Sapor the Persian king,\nbrother of the sun and moon, and our modern Turks, that will be gods on\nearth, kings of kings, God's shadow, commanders of all that may be\ncommanded, our kings of China and Tartary in this present age. Such a one\nwas Xerxes, that would whip the sea, fetter Neptune, _stulta jactantia_,\nand send a challenge to Mount Athos; and such are many sottish princes,\nbrought into a fool's paradise by their parasites, 'tis a common humour,\nincident to all men, when they are in great places, or come to the solstice\nof honour, have done, or deserved well, to applaud and flatter themselves.\n_Stultitiam suam produnt_, &c., (saith [1962]Platerus) your very tradesmen\nif they be excellent, will crack and brag, and show their folly in excess.\nThey have good parts, and they know it, you need not tell them of it; out\nof a conceit of their worth, they go smiling to themselves, a perpetual\nmeditation of their trophies and plaudits, they run at last quite mad, and\nlose their wits. [1963]Petrarch, _lib. 1 de contemptu mundi_, confessed as\nmuch of himself, and Cardan, in his fifth book of wisdom, gives an instance\nin a smith of Milan, a fellow-citizen of his, [1964]one Galeus de Rubeis,\nthat being commended for refining of an instrument of Archimedes, for joy\nran mad. Plutarch in the life of Artaxerxes, hath such a like story of one\nChamus, a soldier, that wounded king Cyrus in battle, and \"grew thereupon\nso [1965]arrogant, that in a short space after he lost his wits.\" So many\nmen, if any new honour, office, preferment, booty, treasure, possession, or\npatrimony, _ex insperato_ fall unto them for immoderate joy, and continual\nmeditation of it, cannot sleep [1966]or tell what they say or do, they are\nso ravished on a sudden; and with vain conceits transported, there is no\nrule with them. Epaminondas, therefore, the next day after his Leuctrian\nvictory, [1967]\"came abroad all squalid and submiss,\" and gave no other\nreason to his friends of so doing, than that he perceived himself the day\nbefore, by reason of his good fortune, to be too insolent, overmuch joyed.\nThat wise and virtuous lady, [1968]Queen Katherine, Dowager of England, in\nprivate talk, upon like occasion, said, that [1969]\"she would not willingly\nendure the extremity of either fortune; but if it were so, that of\nnecessity she must undergo the one, she would be in adversity, because\ncomfort was never wanting in it, but still counsel and government were\ndefective in the other:\" they could not moderate themselves.\n\n\nSUBSECT. XV.--_Love of Learning, or overmuch study. With a Digression of\nthe misery of Scholars, and why the Muses are Melancholy_.\n\nLeonartus Fuchsius _Instit. lib. iii. sect. 1. cap. 1._ Felix Plater, _lib.\niii. de mentis alienat_. Herc. de Saxonia, _Tract. post. de melanch. cap.\n3_, speak of a [1970]peculiar fury, which comes by overmuch study.\nFernelius, _lib. 1, cap. 18_, [1971]puts study, contemplation, and\ncontinual meditation, as an especial cause of madness: and in his _86\nconsul._ cites the same words. Jo. Arculanus, _in lib. 9, Rhasis ad\nAlnansorem, cap. 16_, amongst other causes reckons up _studium vehemens_:\nso doth Levinus Lemnius, _lib. de occul. nat. mirac. lib. 1, cap. 16._\n[1972]\"Many men\" (saith he) \"come to this malady by continual [1973]study,\nand night-waking, and of all other men, scholars are most subject to it:\"\nand such Rhasis adds, [1974]\"that have commonly the finest wits.\" _Cont.\nlib. 1, tract. 9_, Marsilius Ficinus, _de sanit. tuenda, lib. 1. cap. 7_,\nputs melancholy amongst one of those five principal plagues of students,\n'tis a common Maul unto them all, and almost in some measure an inseparable\ncompanion. Varro belike for that cause calls _Tristes Philosophos et\nseveros_, severe, sad, dry, tetric, are common epithets to scholars: and\n[1975]Patritius therefore, in the institution of princes, would not have\nthem to be great students. For (as Machiavel holds) study weakens their\nbodies, dulls the spirits, abates their strength and courage; and good\nscholars are never good soldiers, which a certain Goth well perceived, for\nwhen his countrymen came into Greece, and would have burned all their\nbooks, he cried out against it, by no means they should do it, [1976]\n\"leave them that plague, which in time will consume all their vigour, and\nmartial spirits.\" The [1977]Turks abdicated Cornutus the next heir from the\nempire, because he was so much given to his book: and 'tis the common tenet\nof the world, that learning dulls and diminisheth the spirits, and so _per\nconsequens_ produceth melancholy.\n\nTwo main reasons may be given of it, why students should be more subject to\nthis malady than others. The one is, they live a sedentary, solitary life,\n_sibi et musis_, free from bodily exercise, and those ordinary disports\nwhich other men use: and many times if discontent and idleness concur with\nit, which is too frequent, they are precipitated into this gulf on a\nsudden: but the common cause is overmuch study; too much learning (as\n[1978]Festus told Paul) hath made thee mad; 'tis that other extreme which\neffects it. So did Trincavelius, _lib. 1, consil. 12 and 13_, find by his\nexperience, in two of his patients, a young baron, and another that\ncontracted this malady by too vehement study. So Forestus, _observat. l.\n10, observ. 13_, in a young divine in Louvain, that was mad, and said\n[1979]\"he had a Bible in his head:\" Marsilius Ficinus _de sanit. tuend.\nlib. 1, cap. 1, 3, 4_, and _lib. 2, cap. 16_, gives many reasons, [1980]\n\"why students dote more often than others.\" The first is their negligence;\n[1981]\"other men look to their tools, a painter will wash his pencils, a\nsmith will look to his hammer, anvil, forge; a husbandman will mend his\nplough-irons, and grind his hatchet if it be dull; a falconer or huntsman\nwill have an especial care of his hawks, hounds, horses, dogs, &c.; a\nmusician will string and unstring his lute, &c.; only scholars neglect that\ninstrument, their brain and spirits (I mean) which they daily use, and by\nwhich they range overall the world, which by much study is consumed.\"\n_Vide_ (saith Lucian) _ne funiculum nimis intendendo aliquando abrumpas_:\n\"See thou twist not the rope so hard, till at length it [1982]break.\"\nFacinus in his fourth chap. gives some other reasons; Saturn and Mercury,\nthe patrons of learning, they are both dry planets: and Origanus assigns\nthe same cause, why Mercurialists are so poor, and most part beggars; for\nthat their president Mercury had no better fortune himself. The destinies\nof old put poverty upon him as a punishment; since when, poetry and beggary\nare Gemelli, twin-born brats, inseparable companions;\n\n[1983] \"And to this day is every scholar poor;\n        Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor:\"\n\nMercury can help them to knowledge, but not to money. The second is\ncontemplation, [1984]\"which dries the brain and extinguisheth natural heat;\nfor whilst the spirits are intent to meditation above in the head, the\nstomach and liver are left destitute, and thence come black blood and\ncrudities by defect of concoction, and for want of exercise the superfluous\nvapours cannot exhale,\" &c. The same reasons are repeated by Gomesius,\n_lib. 4, cap. 1, de sale_ [1985]Nymannus _orat. de Imag._ Jo. Voschius,\n_lib. 2, cap. 5, de peste_: and something more they add, that hard students\nare commonly troubled with gouts, catarrhs, rheums, cachexia, bradiopepsia,\nbad eyes, stone and colic, [1986]crudities, oppilations, vertigo, winds,\nconsumptions, and all such diseases as come by overmuch sitting; they are\nmost part lean, dry, ill-coloured, spend their fortunes, lose their wits,\nand many times their lives, and all through immoderate pains, and\nextraordinary studies. If you will not believe the truth of this, look upon\ngreat Tostatus and Thomas Aquinas's works, and tell me whether those men\ntook pains? peruse Austin, Hierom, &c., and many thousands besides.\n\n       \"Qui cupit optatam cursu contingere metam,\n        Multa tulit, fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit.\"\n\n       \"He that desires this wished goal to gain,\n        Must sweat and freeze before he can attain,\"\n\nand labour hard for it. So did Seneca, by his own confession, _ep. 8._\n[1987]\"Not a day that I spend idle, part of the night I keep mine eyes\nopen, tired with waking, and now slumbering to their continual task.\" Hear\nTully _pro Archia Poeta_: \"whilst others loitered, and took their\npleasures, he was continually at his book,\" so they do that will be\nscholars, and that to the hazard (I say) of their healths, fortunes, wits,\nand lives. How much did Aristotle and Ptolemy spend? _unius regni precium_\nthey say, more than a king's ransom; how many crowns per annum, to perfect\narts, the one about his History of Creatures, the other on his Almagest?\nHow much time did Thebet Benchorat employ, to find out the motion of the\neighth sphere? forty years and more, some write: how many poor scholars\nhave lost their wits, or become dizzards, neglecting all worldly affairs\nand their own health, wealth, _esse_ and _bene esse_, to gain knowledge for\nwhich, after all their pains, in this world's esteem they are accounted\nridiculous and silly fools, idiots, asses, and (as oft they are) rejected,\ncontemned, derided, doting, and mad. Look for examples in Hildesheim\n_spicel. 2, de mania et delirio_: read Trincavellius, _l. 3. consil. 36, et\nc. 17._ Montanus, _consil. 233._ [1988]Garceus _de Judic. genit. cap. 33._\nMercurialis, _consil. 86, cap. 25._ Prosper [1989]Calenius in his Book _de\natra bile_; Go to Bedlam and ask. Or if they keep their wits, yet they are\nesteemed scrubs and fools by reason of their carriage: \"after seven years'\nstudy\"\n\n        ------\"statua, taciturnius exit,\n        Plerumque et risum populi quatit.\"------\n\n\"He becomes more silent than a statue, and generally excites people's\nlaughter.\" Because they cannot ride a horse, which every clown can do;\nsalute and court a gentlewoman, carve at table, cringe and make conges,\nwhich every common swasher can do, [1990]_hos populus ridet_, &c., they are\nlaughed to scorn, and accounted silly fools by our gallants. Yea, many\ntimes, such is their misery, they deserve it: [1991]a mere scholar, a mere\nass.\n\n[1992] \"Obstipo capite, et figentes lumine terram,\n        Murmura cum secum, et rabiosa silentia rodunt,\n        Atque experrecto trutinantur verba labello,\n        Aegroti veteris meditantes somnia, gigni\n        De nihilo nihilum; in nihilum nil posse reverti.\"\n\n[1993]  ------\"who do lean awry\n        Their heads, piercing the earth with a fixt eye;\n        When, by themselves, they gnaw their murmuring,\n        And furious silence, as 'twere balancing\n        Each word upon their out-stretched lip, and when\n        They meditate the dreams of old sick men,\n        As, 'Out of nothing, nothing can be brought;\n        And that which is, can ne'er be turn'd to nought.'\"\n\nThus they go commonly meditating unto themselves, thus they sit, such is\ntheir action and gesture. Fulgosus, _l. 8, c. 7_, makes mention how Th.\nAquinas supping with king Lewis of France, upon a sudden knocked his fist\nupon the table, and cried, _conclusum est contra Manichaeos_, his wits were\na wool-gathering, as they say, and his head busied about other matters,\nwhen he perceived his error, he was much [1994]abashed. Such a story there\nis of Archimedes in Vitruvius, that having found out the means to know how\nmuch gold was mingled with the silver in king Hieron's crown, ran naked\nforth of the bath and cried [Greek: heuraeka], I have found: [1995]\"and was\ncommonly so intent to his studies, that he never perceived what was done\nabout him: when the city was taken, and the soldiers now ready to rifle his\nhouse, he took no notice of it.\" St. Bernard rode all day long by the\nLemnian lake, and asked at last where he was, Marullus, _lib. 2, cap. 4._\nIt was Democritus's carriage alone that made the Abderites suppose him to\nhave been mad, and send for Hippocrates to cure him: if he had been in any\nsolemn company, he would upon all occasions fall a laughing. Theophrastus\nsaith as much of Heraclitus, for that he continually wept, and Laertius of\nMenedemus Lampsacus, because he ran like a madman, [1996]saying, \"he came\nfrom hell as a spy, to tell the devils what mortal men did.\" Your greatest\nstudents are commonly no better, silly, soft fellows in their outward\nbehaviour, absurd, ridiculous to others, and no whit experienced in worldly\nbusiness; they can measure the heavens, range over the world, teach others\nwisdom, and yet in bargains and contracts they are circumvented by every\nbase tradesman. Are not these men fools? and how should they be otherwise,\n\"but as so many sots in schools, when\" (as [1997]he well observed) \"they\nneither hear nor see such things as are commonly practised abroad?\" how\nshould they get experience, by what means? [1998]\"I knew in my time many\nscholars,\" saith Aeneas Sylvius (in an epistle of his to Gasper Scitick,\nchancellor to the emperor), \"excellent well learned, but so rude, so silly,\nthat they had no common civility, nor knew how to manage their domestic or\npublic affairs.\" \"Paglarensis was amazed, and said his farmer had surely\ncozened him, when he heard him tell that his sow had eleven pigs, and his\nass had but one foal.\" To say the best of this profession, I can give no\nother testimony of them in general, than that of Pliny of Isaeus; [1999]\"He\nis yet a scholar, than which kind of men there is nothing so simple, so\nsincere, none better, they are most part harmless, honest, upright,\ninnocent, plain-dealing men.\"\n\nNow because they are commonly subject to such hazards and inconveniences as\ndotage, madness, simplicity, &c. Jo. Voschius would have good scholars to\nbe highly rewarded, and had in some extraordinary respect above other men,\n\"to have greater [2000]privileges than the rest, that adventure themselves\nand abbreviate their lives for the public good.\" But our patrons of\nlearning are so far nowadays from respecting the muses, and giving that\nhonour to scholars, or reward which they deserve, and are allowed by those\nindulgent privileges of many noble princes, that after all their pains\ntaken in the universities, cost and charge, expenses, irksome hours,\nlaborious tasks, wearisome days, dangers, hazards, (barred interim from all\npleasures which other men have, mewed up like hawks all their lives) if\nthey chance to wade through them, they shall in the end be rejected,\ncontemned, and which is their greatest misery, driven to their shifts,\nexposed to want, poverty, and beggary. Their familiar attendants are,\n\n[2001] \"Pallentes morbi, luctus, curaeque laborque\n        Et metus, et malesuada fames, et turpis egestas,\n        Terribiles visu formae\"------\n\n       \"Grief, labour, care, pale sickness, miseries,\n        Fear, filthy poverty, hunger that cries,\n        Terrible monsters to be seen with eyes.\"\n\nIf there were nothing else to trouble them, the conceit of this alone were\nenough to make them all melancholy. Most other trades and professions,\nafter some seven years' apprenticeship, are enabled by their craft to live\nof themselves. A merchant adventures his goods at sea, and though his\nhazard be great, yet if one ship return of four, he likely makes a saving\nvoyage. An husbandman's gains are almost certain; _quibus ipse Jupiter\nnocere non potest_ (whom Jove himself can't harm) ('tis [2002]Cato's\nhyperbole, a great husband himself); only scholars methinks are most\nuncertain, unrespected, subject to all casualties, and hazards. For first,\nnot one of a many proves to be a scholar, all are not capable and docile,\n[2003]_ex omniligno non fit Mercurius_: we can make majors and officers\nevery year, but not scholars: kings can invest knights and barons, as\nSigismund the emperor confessed; universities can give degrees; and _Tu\nquod es, e populo quilibet esse potest_; but he nor they, nor all the\nworld, can give learning, make philosophers, artists, orators, poets; we\ncan soon say, as Seneca well notes, _O virum bonum, o divitem_, point at a\nrich man, a good, a happy man, a prosperous man, _sumptuose vestitum,\nCalamistratum, bene olentem, magno temporis impendio constat haec laudatio,\no virum literarum_, but 'tis not so easily performed to find out a learned\nman. Learning is not so quickly got, though they may be willing to take\npains, to that end sufficiently informed, and liberally maintained by their\npatrons and parents, yet few can compass it. Or if they be docile, yet all\nmen's wills are not answerable to their wits, they can apprehend, but will\nnot take pains; they are either seduced by bad companions, _vel in puellam\nimpingunt, vel in poculum_ (they fall in with women or wine) and so spend\ntheir time to their friends' grief and their own undoings. Or put case they\nbe studious, industrious, of ripe wits, and perhaps good capacities, then\nhow many diseases of body and mind must they encounter? No labour in the\nworld like unto study. It may be, their temperature will not endure it, but\nstriving to be excellent to know all, they lose health, wealth, wit, life\nand all. Let him yet happily escape all these hazards, _aereis intestinis_\nwith a body of brass, and is now consummate and ripe, he hath profited in\nhis studies, and proceeded with all applause: after many expenses, he is\nfit for preferment, where shall he have it? he is as far to seek it as he\nwas (after twenty years' standing) at the first day of his coming to the\nUniversity. For what course shall he take, being now capable and ready? The\nmost parable and easy, and about which many are employed, is to teach a\nschool, turn lecturer or curate, and for that he shall have falconer's\nwages, ten pound per annum, and his diet, or some small stipend, so long as\nhe can please his patron or the parish; if they approve him not (for\nusually they do but a year or two) as inconstant, as [2004]they that cried\n\"Hosanna\" one day, and \"Crucify him\" the other; serving-man-like, he must\ngo look a new master; if they do, what is his reward?\n\n[2005] \"Hoc quoque te manet ut pueros elementa docentem\n        Occupet extremis in vicis alba senectus.\"\n\n       \"At last thy snow-white age in suburb schools,\n        Shall toil in teaching boys their grammar rules.\"\n\nLike an ass, he wears out his time for provender, and can show a stump rod,\n_togam tritam et laceram_ saith [2006]Haedus, an old torn gown, an ensign\nof his infelicity, he hath his labour for his pain, a modicum to keep him\ntill he be decrepit, and that is all. _Grammaticus non est felix_, &c. If\nhe be a trencher chaplain in a gentleman's house, as it befell [2007]\nEuphormio, after some seven years' service, he may perchance have a living\nto the halves, or some small rectory with the mother of the maids at\nlength, a poor kinswoman, or a cracked chambermaid, to have and to hold\nduring the time of his life. But if he offend his good patron, or displease\nhis lady mistress in the mean time,\n\n[2008] \"Ducetur Planta velut ictus ab Hercule Cacus,\n        Poneturque foras, si quid tentaverit unquam\n        Hiscere\"------\n\nas Hercules did by Cacus, he shall be dragged forth of doors by the heels,\naway with him. If he bend his forces to some other studies, with an intent\nto be _a secretis_ to some nobleman, or in such a place with an ambassador,\nhe shall find that these persons rise like apprentices one under another,\nand in so many tradesmen's shops, when the master is dead, the foreman of\nthe shop commonly steps in his place. Now for poets, rhetoricians,\nhistorians, philosophers, [2009]mathematicians, sophisters, &c.; they are\nlike grasshoppers, sing they must in summer, and pine in the winter, for\nthere is no preferment for them. Even so they were at first, if you will\nbelieve that pleasant tale of Socrates, which he told fair Phaedrus under a\nplane-tree, at the banks of the river Iseus; about noon when it was hot,\nand the grasshoppers made a noise, he took that sweet occasion to tell him\na tale, how grasshoppers were once scholars, musicians, poets, &c., before\nthe Muses were born, and lived without meat and drink, and for that cause\nwere turned by Jupiter into grasshoppers. And may be turned again, _In\nTythoni Cicadas, aut Lyciorum ranas_, for any reward I see they are like to\nhave: or else in the mean time, I would they could live, as they did,\nwithout any viaticum, like so many [2010]manucodiatae, those Indian birds\nof paradise, as we commonly call them, those I mean that live with the air\nand dew of heaven, and need no other food; for being as they are, their\n[2011]\"rhetoric only serves them to curse their bad fortunes,\" and many of\nthem for want of means are driven to hard shifts; from grasshoppers they\nturn humble-bees and wasps, plain parasites, and make the muses, mules, to\nsatisfy their hunger-starved paunches, and get a meal's meat. To say truth,\n'tis the common fortune of most scholars, to be servile and poor, to\ncomplain pitifully, and lay open their wants to their respectless patrons,\nas [2012]Cardan doth, as [2013]Xilander and many others: and which is too\ncommon in those dedicatory epistles, for hope of gain, to lie, flatter, and\nwith hyperbolical eulogiums and commendations, to magnify and extol an\nilliterate unworthy idiot, for his excellent virtues, whom they should\nrather, as [2014]Machiavel observes, vilify, and rail at downright for his\nmost notorious villainies and vices. So they prostitute themselves as\nfiddlers, or mercenary tradesmen, to serve great men's turns for a small\nreward. They are like [2015]Indians, they have store of gold, but know not\nthe worth of it: for I am of Synesius's opinion, [2016]\"King Hieron got\nmore by Simonides' acquaintance, than Simonides did by his;\" they have\ntheir best education, good institution, sole qualification from us, and\nwhen they have done well, their honour and immortality from us: we are the\nliving tombs, registers, and as so many trumpeters of their fames: what was\nAchilles without Homer? Alexander without Arian and Curtius? who had known\nthe Caesars, but for Suetonius and Dion?\n\n[2017] \"Vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnona\n        Multi: sed omnes illachrymabiles\n        Urgentur, ignotique longa\n        Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.\"\n\n       \"Before great Agamemnon reign'd,\n          Reign'd kings as great as he, and brave,\n        Whose huge ambition's now contain'd\n          In the small compass of a grave:\"\n\n       \"In endless night, they sleep, unwept, unknown,\n        No bard they had to make all time their own.\"\n\nthey are more beholden to scholars, than scholars to them; but they\nundervalue themselves, and so by those great men are kept down. Let them\nhave that encyclopaedian, all the learning in the world; they must keep it\nto themselves, [2018]\"live in base esteem, and starve, except they will\nsubmit,\" as Budaeus well hath it, \"so many good parts, so many ensigns of\narts, virtues, be slavishly obnoxious to some illiterate potentate, and\nlive under his insolent worship, or honour, like parasites,\" _Qui tanquam\nmures alienum panem comedunt_. For to say truth, _artes hae, non sunt\nLucrativae_, as Guido Bonat that great astrologer could foresee, they be\nnot gainful arts these, _sed esurientes et famelicae_, but poor and hungry.\n\n[2019] \"Dat Galenus opes, dat Justinianus honores,\n          Sed genus et species cogitur ire pedes:\"\n\n       \"The rich physician, honour'd lawyers ride,\n        Whilst the poor scholar foots it by their side.\"\n\nPoverty is the muses' patrimony, and as that poetical divinity teacheth us,\nwhen Jupiter's daughters were each of them married to the gods, the muses\nalone were left solitary, Helicon forsaken of all suitors, and I believe it\nwas, because they had no portion.\n\n       \"Calliope longum caelebs cur vixit in aevum?\n          Nempe nihil dotis, quod numeraret, erat.\"\n\n       \"Why did Calliope live so long a maid?\n        Because she had no dowry to be paid.\"\n\nEver since all their followers are poor, forsaken and left unto themselves.\nInsomuch, that as [2020]Petronius argues, you shall likely know them by\ntheir clothes. \"There came,\" saith he, \"by chance into my company, a fellow\nnot very spruce to look on, that I could perceive by that note alone he was\na scholar, whom commonly rich men hate: I asked him what he was, he\nanswered, a poet: I demanded again why he was so ragged, he told me this\nkind of learning never made any man rich.\"\n\n[2021] \"Qui Pelago credit, magno se faenore tollit,\n        Qui pugnas et rostra petit, praecingitur auro:\n        Vilis adulator picto jacet ebrius ostro,\n        Sola pruinosis horret facundia pannis.\"\n\n       \"A merchant's gain is great, that goes to sea;\n          A soldier embossed all in gold;\n        A flatterer lies fox'd in brave array;\n          A scholar only ragged to behold.\"\n\nAll which our ordinary students, right well perceiving in the universities,\nhow unprofitable these poetical, mathematical, and philosophical studies\nare, how little respected, how few patrons; apply themselves in all haste\nto those three commodious professions of law, physic, and divinity, sharing\nthemselves between them, [2022]rejecting these arts in the mean time,\nhistory, philosophy, philology, or lightly passing them over, as pleasant\ntoys fitting only table-talk, and to furnish them with discourse. They are\nnot so behoveful: he that can tell his money hath arithmetic enough: he is\na true geometrician, can measure out a good fortune to himself; a perfect\nastrologer, that can cast the rise and fall of others, and mark their\nerrant motions to his own use. The best optics are, to reflect the beams of\nsome great man's favour and grace to shine upon him. He is a good engineer\nthat alone can make an instrument to get preferment. This was the common\ntenet and practice of Poland, as Cromerus observed not long since, in the\nfirst book of his history; their universities were generally base, not a\nphilosopher, a mathematician, an antiquary, &c., to be found of any note\namongst them, because they had no set reward or stipend, but every man\nbetook himself to divinity, _hoc solum in votis habens, opimum\nsacerdotium_, a good parsonage was their aim. This was the practice of some\nof our near neighbours, as [2023]Lipsius inveighs, \"they thrust their\nchildren to the study of law and divinity, before they be informed aright,\nor capable of such studies.\" _Scilicet omnibus artibus antistat spes lucri,\net formosior est cumulus auri, quam quicquid Graeci Latinique delirantes\nscripserunt. Ex hoc numero deinde veniunt ad gubernacula reipub. intersunt\net praesunt consiliis regum, o pater, o patria_? so he complained, and so\nmay others. For even so we find, to serve a great man, to get an office in\nsome bishop's court (to practise in some good town) or compass a benefice,\nis the mark we shoot at, as being so advantageous, the highway to\npreferment.\n\nAlthough many times, for aught I can see, these men fail as often as the\nrest in their projects, and are as usually frustrate of their hopes. For\nlet him be a doctor of the law, an excellent civilian of good worth, where\nshall he practise and expatiate? Their fields are so scant, the civil law\nwith us so contracted with prohibitions, so few causes, by reason of those\nall-devouring municipal laws, _quibus nihil illiteratius_, saith [2024]\nErasmus, an illiterate and a barbarous study, (for though they be never so\nwell learned in it, I can hardly vouchsafe them the name of scholars,\nexcept they be otherwise qualified) and so few courts are left to that\nprofession, such slender offices, and those commonly to be compassed at\nsuch dear rates, that I know not how an ingenious man should thrive amongst\nthem. Now for physicians, there are in every village so many mountebanks,\nempirics, quacksalvers, Paracelsians, as they call themselves, _Caucifici\net sanicidae_ so [2025]Clenard terms them, wizards, alchemists, poor\nvicars, cast apothecaries, physicians' men, barbers, and good wives,\nprofessing great skill, that I make great doubt how they shall be\nmaintained, or who shall be their patients. Besides, there are so many of\nboth sorts, and some of them such harpies, so covetous, so clamorous, so\nimpudent; and as [2026]he said, litigious idiots,\n\n       \"Quibus loquacis affatim arrogantiae est\n          Pentiae parum aut nihil,\n        Nec ulla mica literarii salis,\n          Crumenimulga natio:\n        Loquuteleia turba, litium strophae,\n          Maligna litigantium cohors, togati vultures,\"\n\n       \"Lavernae alumni, Agyrtae,\" &c.\n\n       \"Which have no skill but prating arrogance,\n          No learning, such a purse-milking nation:\n        Gown'd vultures, thieves, and a litigious rout\n          Of cozeners, that haunt this occupation,\"\n\nthat they cannot well tell how to live one by another, but as he jested in\nthe Comedy of Clocks, they were so many, [2027]_major pars populi arida\nreptant fame_, they are almost starved a great part of them, and ready to\ndevour their fellows, [2028]_Et noxia callidilate se corripere_, such a\nmultitude of pettifoggers and empirics, such impostors, that an honest man\nknows not in what sort to compose and behave himself in their society, to\ncarry himself with credit in so vile a rout, _scientiae nomen, tot\nsumptibus partum et vigiliis, profiteri dispudeat, postquam_, &c.\n\nLast of all to come to our divines, the most noble profession and worthy of\ndouble honour, but of all others the most distressed and miserable. If you\nwill not believe me, hear a brief of it, as it was not many years since\npublicly preached at Paul's cross, [2029]by a grave minister then, and now\na reverend bishop of this land: \"We that are bred up in learning, and\ndestinated by our parents to this end, we suffer our childhood in the\ngrammar-school, which Austin calls _magnam tyrannidem, et grave malum_, and\ncompares it to the torments of martyrdom; when we come to the university,\nif we live of the college allowance, as Phalaris objected to the Leontines,\n[Greek: pan ton endeis plaen limou kai phobou], needy of all things but\nhunger and fear, or if we be maintained but partly by our parents' cost, do\nexpend in unnecessary maintenance, books and degrees, before we come to any\nperfection, five hundred pounds, or a thousand marks. If by this price of\nthe expense of time, our bodies and spirits, our substance and patrimonies,\nwe cannot purchase those small rewards, which are ours by law, and the\nright of inheritance, a poor parsonage, or a vicarage of 50_l._ per annum,\nbut we must pay to the patron for the lease of a life (a spent and out-worn\nlife) either in annual pension, or above the rate of a copyhold, and that\nwith the hazard and loss of our souls, by simony and perjury, and the\nforfeiture of all our spiritual preferments, in _esse_ and _posse_, both\npresent and to come. What father after a while will be so improvident to\nbring up his son to his great charge, to this necessary beggary? What\nChristian will be so irreligious, to bring up his son in that course of\nlife, which by all probability and necessity, _cogit ad turpia_, enforcing\nto sin, will entangle him in simony and perjury, when as the poet said,\n_Invitatus ad haec aliquis de ponte negabit_: a beggar's brat taken from\nthe bridge where he sits a begging, if he knew the inconvenience, had cause\nto refuse it.\" This being thus, have not we fished fair all this while,\nthat are initiate divines, to find no better fruits of our labours, [2030]\n_hoc est cur palles, cur quis non prandeat hoc est_? do we macerate\nourselves for this? Is it for this we rise so early all the year long?\n[2031]\"Leaping\" (as he saith) \"out of our beds, when we hear the bell ring,\nas if we had heard a thunderclap.\" If this be all the respect, reward and\nhonour we shall have, [2032]_frange leves calamos, et scinde Thalia\nlibellos_: let us give over our books, and betake ourselves to some other\ncourse of life; to what end should we study? [2033]_Quid me litterulas\nstulti docuere parentes_, what did our parents mean to make us scholars, to\nbe as far to seek of preferment after twenty years' study, as we were at\nfirst: why do we take such pains? _Quid tantum insanis juvat impallescere\nchartis_? If there be no more hope of reward, no better encouragement, I\nsay again, _Frange leves calamos, et scinde Thalia libellos_; let's turn\nsoldiers, sell our books, and buy swords, guns, and pikes, or stop bottles\nwith them, turn our philosopher's gowns, as Cleanthes once did, into\nmillers' coats, leave all and rather betake ourselves to any other course\nof life, than to continue longer in this misery. [2034]_Praestat\ndentiscalpia radere, quam literariis monumentis magnatum favorem\nemendicare_.\n\nYea, but methinks I hear some man except at these words, that though this\nbe true which I have said of the estate of scholars, and especially of\ndivines, that it is miserable and distressed at this time, that the church\nsuffers shipwreck of her goods, and that they have just cause to complain;\nthere is a fault, but whence proceeds it? If the cause were justly\nexamined, it would be retorted upon ourselves, if we were cited at that\ntribunal of truth, we should be found guilty, and not able to excuse it\nThat there is a fault among us, I confess, and were there not a buyer,\nthere would not be a seller; but to him that will consider better of it, it\nwill more than manifestly appear, that the fountain of these miseries\nproceeds from these griping patrons. In accusing them, I do not altogether\nexcuse us; both are faulty, they and we: yet in my judgment, theirs is the\ngreater fault, more apparent causes and much to be condemned. For my part,\nif it be not with me as I would, or as it should, I do ascribe the cause,\nas [2035]Cardan did in the like case; _meo infortunio potius quam illorum\nsceleri_, to [2036]mine own infelicity rather than their naughtiness:\nalthough I have been baffled in my time by some of them, and have as just\ncause to complain as another: or rather indeed to mine own negligence; for\nI was ever like that Alexander in [2037]Plutarch, Crassus his tutor in\nphilosophy, who, though he lived many years familiarly with rich Crassus,\nwas even as poor when from, (which many wondered at) as when he came first\nto him; he never asked, the other never gave him anything; when he\ntravelled with Crassus he borrowed a hat of him, at his return restored it\nagain. I have had some such noble friends' acquaintance and scholars, but\nmost part (common courtesies and ordinary respects excepted) they and I\nparted as we met, they gave me as much as I requested, and that was--And as\nAlexander ab Alexandro _Genial. dier. l. 6. c. 16._ made answer to\nHieronymus Massainus, that wondered, _quum plures ignavos et ignobiles ad\ndignitates et sacerdotia promotos quotidie videret_, when other men rose,\nstill he was in the same state, _eodem tenore et fortuna cui mercedem\nlaborum studiorumque deberi putaret_, whom he thought to deserve as well as\nthe rest. He made answer, that he was content with his present estate, was\nnot ambitious, and although _objurgabundus suam segnitiem accusaret, cum\nobscurae sortis homines ad sacerdotia et pontificatus evectos_, &c., he\nchid him for his backwardness, yet he was still the same: and for my part\n(though I be not worthy perhaps to carry Alexander's books) yet by some\noverweening and well-wishing friends, the like speeches have been used to\nme; but I replied still with Alexander, that I had enough, and more\nperadventure than I deserved; and with Libanius Sophista, that rather chose\n(when honours and offices by the emperor were offered unto him) to be\n_talis Sophista, quam tails Magistratus_. I had as lief be still Democritus\njunior, and _privus privatus, si mihi jam daretur optio, quam talis\nfortasse Doctor, talis Dominus.--Sed quorsum haec_? For the rest 'tis on\nboth sides _facinus detestandum_, to buy and sell livings, to detain from\nthe church, that which God's and men's laws have bestowed on it; but in\nthem most, and that from the covetousness and ignorance of such as are\ninterested in this business; I name covetousness in the first place, as the\nroot of all these mischiefs, which, Achan-like, compels them to commit\nsacrilege, and to make simoniacal compacts, (and what not) to their own\nends, [2038]that kindles God's wrath, brings a plague, vengeance, and a\nheavy visitation upon themselves and others. Some out of that insatiable\ndesire of filthy lucre, to be enriched, care not how they come by it _per\nfas et nefas_, hook or crook, so they have it. And others when they have\nwith riot and prodigality embezzled their estates, to recover themselves,\nmake a prey of the church, robbing it, as [2039]Julian the apostate did,\nspoil parsons of their revenues (in keeping half back, [2040]as a great man\namongst us observes:) \"and that maintenance on which they should live:\" by\nmeans whereof, barbarism is increased, and a great decay of Christian\nprofessors: for who will apply himself to these divine studies, his son, or\nfriend, when after great pains taken, they shall have nothing whereupon to\nlive? But with what event do they these things?\n\n[2041] \"Opesque totis viribus venamini\n        At inde messis accidit miserrima.\"\n\nThey toil and moil, but what reap they? They are commonly unfortunate\nfamilies that use it, accursed in their progeny, and, as common experience\nevinceth, accursed themselves in all their proceedings. \"With what face\"\n(as [2042]he quotes out of Aust.) \"can they expect a blessing or\ninheritance from Christ in heaven, that defraud Christ of his inheritance\nhere on earth?\" I would all our simoniacal patrons, and such as detain\ntithes, would read those judicious tracts of Sir Henry Spelman, and Sir\nJames Sempill, knights; those late elaborate and learned treatises of Dr.\nTilslye, and Mr. Montague, which they have written of that subject. But\nthough they should read, it would be to small purpose, _clames licet et\nmare coelo Confundas_; thunder, lighten, preach hell and damnation, tell\nthem 'tis a sin, they will not believe it; denounce and terrify, they have\n[2043]cauterised consciences, they do not attend, as the enchanted adder,\nthey stop their ears. Call them base, irreligious, profane, barbarous,\npagans, atheists, epicures, (as some of them surely are) with the bawd in\nPlautus, _Euge, optime_, they cry and applaud themselves with that miser,\n[2044]_simul ac nummos contemplor in arca_: say what you will, _quocunque\nmodo rem_: as a dog barks at the moon, to no purpose are your sayings: Take\nyour heaven, let them have money. A base, profane, epicurean, hypocritical\nrout: for my part, let them pretend what zeal they will, counterfeit\nreligion, blear the world's eyes, bombast themselves, and stuff out their\ngreatness with church spoils, shine like so many peacocks; so cold is my\ncharity, so defective in this behalf, that I shall never think better of\nthem, than that they are rotten at core, their bones are full of epicurean\nhypocrisy, and atheistical marrow, they are worse than heathens. For as\nDionysius Halicarnassaeus observes, _Antiq. Rom. lib. 7._ [2045]_Primum\nlocum_, &c. \"Greeks and Barbarians observe all religious rites, and dare\nnot break them for fear of offending their gods;\" but our simoniacal\ncontractors, our senseless Achans, our stupefied patrons, fear neither God\nnor devil, they have evasions for it, it is no sin, or not due _jure\ndivino_, or if a sin, no great sin, &c. And though they be daily punished\nfor it, and they do manifestly perceive, that as he said, frost and fraud\ncome to foul ends; yet as [2046]Chrysostom follows it _Nulla ex poena sit\ncorrectio, et quasi adversis malitia hominum provocetur, crescit quotidie\nquod puniatur_: they are rather worse than better,--_iram atque animos a\ncrimine sumunt_, and the more they are corrected, the more they offend: but\nlet them take their course, [2047]_Rode caper vites_, go on still as they\nbegin, 'tis no sin, let them rejoice secure, God's vengeance will overtake\nthem in the end, and these ill-gotten goods, as an eagle's feathers, [2048]\nwill consume the rest of their substance; it is [2049]_aurum Tholosanum_,\nand will produce no better effects. [2050]\"Let them lay it up safe, and\nmake their conveyances never so close, lock and shut door,\" saith\nChrysostom, \"yet fraud and covetousness, two most violent thieves are still\nincluded, and a little gain evil gotten will subvert the rest of their\ngoods.\" The eagle in Aesop, seeing a piece of flesh now ready to be\nsacrificed, swept it away with her claws, and carried it to her nest; but\nthere was a burning coal stuck to it by chance, which unawares consumed her\nyoung ones, nest, and all together. Let our simoniacal church-chopping\npatrons, and sacrilegious harpies, look for no better success.\n\nA second cause is ignorance, and from thence contempt, _successit odium in\nliteras ab ignorantia vulgi_; which [2051]Junius well perceived: this\nhatred and contempt of learning proceeds out of [2052]ignorance; as they\nare themselves barbarous, idiots, dull, illiterate, and proud, so they\nesteem of others. _Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt Flacce Marones_: Let there\nbe bountiful patrons, and there will be painful scholars in all sciences.\nBut when they contemn learning, and think themselves sufficiently\nqualified, if they can write and read, scramble at a piece of evidence, or\nhave so much Latin as that emperor had, [2053]_qui nescit dissimulare,\nnescit vivere_, they are unfit to do their country service, to perform or\nundertake any action or employment, which may tend to the good of a\ncommonwealth, except it be to fight, or to do country justice, with common\nsense, which every yeoman can likewise do. And so they bring up their\nchildren, rude as they are themselves, unqualified, untaught, uncivil most\npart. [2054]_Quis e nostra juventute legitime instituitur literis? Quis\noratores aut Philosophos tangit? quis historiam legit, illam rerum\nagendarum quasi animam? praecipitant parentes vota sua_, &c. 'twas Lipsius'\ncomplaint to his illiterate countrymen, it may be ours. Now shall these men\njudge of a scholar's worth, that have no worth, that know not what belongs\nto a student's labours, that cannot distinguish between a true scholar and\na drone? or him that by reason of a voluble tongue, a strong voice, a\npleasing tone, and some trivially polyanthean helps, steals and gleans a\nfew notes from other men's harvests, and so makes a fairer show, than he\nthat is truly learned indeed: that thinks it no more to preach, than to\nspeak, [2055]\"or to run away with an empty cart;\" as a grave man said: and\nthereupon vilify us, and our pains; scorn us, and all learning. [2056]\nBecause they are rich, and have other means to live, they think it concerns\nthem not to know, or to trouble themselves with it; a fitter task for\nyounger brothers, or poor men's sons, to be pen and inkhorn men, pedantical\nslaves, and no whit beseeming the calling of a gentleman, as Frenchmen and\nGermans commonly do, neglect therefore all human learning, what have they\nto do with it? Let mariners learn astronomy; merchants, factors study\narithmetic; surveyors get them geometry; spectacle-makers optics;\nland-leapers geography; town-clerks rhetoric, what should he do with a\nspade, that hath no ground to dig; or they with learning, that have no use\nof it? thus they reason, and are not ashamed to let mariners, apprentices,\nand the basest servants, be better qualified than themselves. In former\ntimes, kings, princes, and emperors, were the only scholars, excellent in\nall faculties. Julius Caesar mended the year, and writ his own\nCommentaries,\n\n[2057]  ------\"media inter prealia semper,\n        Stellarum coelique plagis, superisque vacavit.\"\n\n[2058]Antonius, Adrian, Nero, Seve. Jul. &c. [2059]Michael the emperor, and\nIsacius, were so much given to their studies, that no base fellow would\ntake so much pains: Orion, Perseus, Alphonsus, Ptolomeus, famous\nastronomers; Sabor, Mithridates, Lysimachus, admired physicians: Plato's\nkings all: Evax, that Arabian prince, a most expert jeweller, and an\nexquisite philosopher; the kings of Egypt were priests of old, chosen and\nfrom thence,--_Idem rex hominum, Phoebique sacerdos_: but those heroical\ntimes are past; the Muses are now banished in this bastard age, _ad sordida\ntuguriola_, to meaner persons, and confined alone almost to universities.\nIn those days, scholars were highly beloved, [2060]honoured, esteemed; as\nold Ennius by Scipio Africanus, Virgil by Augustus; Horace by Meceanas:\nprinces' companions; dear to them, as Anacreon to Polycrates; Philoxenus to\nDionysius, and highly rewarded. Alexander sent Xenocrates the philosopher\nfifty talents, because he was poor, _visu rerum, aut eruditione praestantes\nviri, mensis olim regum adhibiti_, as Philostratus relates of Adrian and\nLampridius of Alexander Severus: famous clerks came to these princes'\ncourts, _velut in Lycaeum_, as to a university, and were admitted to their\ntables, _quasi divum epulis accumbentes_; Archilaus, that Macedonian king,\nwould not willingly sup without Euripides, (amongst the rest he drank to\nhim at supper one night, and gave him a cup of gold for his pains)\n_delectatus poetae suavi sermone_; and it was fit it should be so; because\nas [2061]Plato in his Protagoras well saith, a good philosopher as much\nexcels other men, as a great king doth the commons of his country; and\nagain, [2062]_quoniam illis nihil deest, et minime egere solent, et\ndisciplinas quas profitentur, soli a contemptu vindicare possunt_, they\nneeded not to beg so basely, as they compel [2063]scholars in our times to\ncomplain of poverty, or crouch to a rich chuff for a meal's meat, but could\nvindicate themselves, and those arts which they professed. Now they would\nand cannot: for it is held by some of them, as an axiom, that to keep them\npoor, will make them study; they must be dieted, as horses to a race, not\npampered, [2064]_Alendos volunt, non saginandos, ne melioris mentis\nflammula extinguatur_; a fat bird will not sing, a fat dog cannot hunt, and\nso by this depression of theirs [2065]some want means, others will, all\nwant [2066]encouragement, as being forsaken almost; and generally\ncontemned. 'Tis an old saying, _Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt Flacce\nMarones_, and 'tis a true saying still. Yet oftentimes I may not deny it\nthe main fault is in ourselves. Our academics too frequently offend in\nneglecting patrons, as [2067]Erasmus well taxeth, or making ill choice of\nthem; _negligimus oblatos aut amplectimur parum aptos_, or if we get a good\none, _non studemus mutuis officiis favorem ejus alere_, we do not ply and\nfollow him as we should. _Idem mihi accidit Adolescenti_ (saith Erasmus)\nacknowledging his fault, _et gravissime peccavi_, and so may [2068]I say\nmyself, I have offended in this, and so peradventure have many others. We\ndid not _spondere magnatum favoribus, qui caeperunt nos amplecti_, apply\nourselves with that readiness we should: idleness, love of liberty,\n_immodicus amor libertatis effecit ut diu cum perfidis amicis_, as he\nconfesseth, _et pertinaci pauperate colluctarer_, bashfulness, melancholy,\ntimorousness, cause many of us to be too backward and remiss. So some\noffend in one extreme, but too many on the other, we are most part too\nforward, too solicitous, too ambitious, too impudent; we commonly complain\n_deesse Maecenates_, of want of encouragement, want of means, when as the\ntrue defect is in our own want of worth, our insufficiency: did Maecenas\ntake notice of Horace or Virgil till they had shown themselves first? or\nhad Bavius and Mevius any patrons? _Egregium specimen dent_, saith Erasmus,\nlet them approve themselves worthy first, sufficiently qualified for\nlearning and manners, before they presume or impudently intrude and put\nthemselves on great men as too many do, with such base flattery,\nparasitical colloguing, such hyperbolical elogies they do usually insinuate\nthat it is a shame to hear and see. _Immodicae laudes conciliant invidiam,\npotius quam laudem_, and vain commendations derogate from truth, and we\nthink in conclusion, _non melius de laudato, pejus de laudante_, ill of\nboth, the commender and commended. So we offend, but the main fault is in\ntheir harshness, defect of patrons. How beloved of old, and how much\nrespected was Plato to Dionysius? How dear to Alexander was Aristotle,\nDemeratus to Philip, Solon to Croesus, Auexarcus and Trebatius to Augustus,\nCassius to Vespasian, Plutarch to Trajan, Seneca to Nero, Simonides to\nHieron? how honoured?\n\n[2069] \"Sed haec prius fuere, nunc recondita\n        Senent quiete,\"\n\nthose days are gone; _Et spes, et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum_:\n[2070] as he said of old, we may truly say now, he is our amulet, our\n[2071]sun, our sole comfort and refuge, our Ptolemy, our common Maecenas,\n_Jacobus munificus, Jacobus pacificus, mysta Musarum, Rex Platonicus:\nGrande decus, columenque nostrum_: a famous scholar himself, and the sole\npatron, pillar, and sustainer of learning: but his worth in this kind is so\nwell known, that as Paterculus of Cato, _Jam ipsum laudare nefas sit_: and\nwhich [2072] Pliny to Trajan. _Seria te carmina, honorque aeternus\nannalium, non haec brevis et pudenda praedicatio colet_. But he is now\ngone, the sun of ours set, and yet no night follows, _Sol occubuit, nox\nnulla sequuta est_. We have such another in his room, [2073]_aureus alter.\nAvulsus, simili frondescit virga metallo_, and long may he reign and\nflourish amongst us.\n\nLet me not be malicious, and lie against my genius, I may not deny, but\nthat we have a sprinkling of our gentry, here and there one, excellently\nwell learned, like those Fuggeri in Germany; Dubartus, Du Plessis, Sadael,\nin France; Picus Mirandula, Schottus, Barotius, in Italy; _Apparent rari\nnantes in gurgite vasto_. But they are but few in respect of the multitude,\nthe major part (and some again excepted, that are indifferent) are wholly\nbent for hawks and hounds, and carried away many times with intemperate\nlust, gaming and drinking. If they read a book at any time (_si quod est\ninterim otii a venatu, poculis, alea, scortis_) 'tis an English Chronicle,\nSt. Huon of Bordeaux, Amadis de Gaul, &c., a play-book, or some pamphlet of\nnews, and that at such seasons only, when they cannot stir abroad, to drive\naway time, [2074]their sole discourse is dogs, hawks, horses, and what\nnews? If some one have been a traveller in Italy, or as far as the\nemperor's court, wintered in Orleans, and can court his mistress in broken\nFrench, wear his clothes neatly in the newest fashion, sing some choice\noutlandish tunes, discourse of lords, ladies, towns, palaces, and cities,\nhe is complete and to be admired: [2075]otherwise he and they are much at\none; no difference between the master and the man, but worshipful titles;\nwink and choose betwixt him that sits down (clothes excepted) and him that\nholds the trencher behind him: yet these men must be our patrons, our\ngovernors too sometimes, statesmen, magistrates, noble, great, and wise by\ninheritance.\n\nMistake me not (I say again) _Vos o Patritius sanguis_, you that are worthy\nsenators, gentlemen, I honour your names and persons, and with all\nsubmissiveness, prostrate myself to your censure and service. There are\namongst you, I do ingenuously confess, many well-deserving patrons, and\ntrue patriots, of my knowledge, besides many hundreds which I never saw, no\ndoubt, or heard of, pillars of our commonwealth, [2076]whose worth, bounty,\nlearning, forwardness, true zeal in religion, and good esteem of all\nscholars, ought to be consecrated to all posterity; but of your rank, there\nare a debauched, corrupt, covetous, illiterate crew again, no better than\nstocks, _merum pecus (testor Deum, non mihi videri dignos ingenui hominis\nappellatione)_ barbarous Thracians, _et quis ille thrax qui hoc neget_? a\nsordid, profane, pernicious company, irreligious, impudent and stupid, I\nknow not what epithets to give them, enemies to learning, confounders of\nthe church, and the ruin of a commonwealth; patrons they are by right of\ninheritance, and put in trust freely to dispose of such livings to the\nchurch's good; but (hard taskmasters they prove) they take away their\nstraw, and compel them to make their number of brick: they commonly respect\ntheir own ends, commodity is the steer of all their actions, and him they\npresent in conclusion, as a man of greatest gifts, that will give most; no\npenny, [2077]no paternoster, as the saying is. _Nisi preces auro fulcias,\namplius irritas: ut Cerberus offa_, their attendants and officers must be\nbribed, feed, and made, as Cerberus is with a sop by him that goes to hell.\nIt was an old saying, _Omnia Romae venalia_ (all things are venal at Rome,)\n'tis a rag of Popery, which will never be rooted out, there is no hope, no\ngood to be done without money. A clerk may offer himself, approve his\n[2078]worth, learning, honesty, religion, zeal, they will commend him for\nit; but [2079]_probitas laudatur et alget_. If he be a man of extraordinary\nparts, they will flock afar off to hear him, as they did in Apuleius, to\nsee Psyche: _multi mortales confluebant ad videndum saeculi decus, speculum\ngloriosum, laudatur ab omnibus, spectatur ob omnibus, nec quisquam non rex,\nnon regius, cupidus ejus nuptiarium petitor accedit; mirantur quidem\ndivinam formam omnes, sed ut simulacrum fabre politum mirantur_; many\nmortal men came to see fair Psyche the glory of her age, they did admire\nher, commend, desire her for her divine beauty, and gaze upon her; but as\non a picture; none would marry her, _quod indotato_, fair Psyche had no\nmoney. [2080]So they do by learning;\n\n[2081]  ------\"didicit jam dives avarus\n        Tantum admirari, tantum laudare disertos,\n        Ut pueri Junonis avem\"------\n\n       \"Your rich men have now learn'd of latter days\n          T'admire, commend, and come together\n        To hear and see a worthy scholar speak,\n          As children do a peacock's feather.\"\n\nHe shall have all the good words that may be given, [2082]a proper man, and\n'tis pity he hath no preferment, all good wishes, but inexorable, indurate\nas he is, he will not prefer him, though it be in his power, because he is\n_indotatus_, he hath no money. Or if he do give him entertainment, let him\nbe never so well qualified, plead affinity, consanguinity, sufficiency, he\nshall serve seven years, as Jacob did for Rachel, before he shall have it.\n[2083]If he will enter at first, he must get in at that Simoniacal gate,\ncome off soundly, and put in good security to perform all covenants, else\nhe will not deal with, or admit him. But if some poor scholar, some parson\nchaff, will offer himself; some trencher chaplain, that will take it to the\nhalves, thirds, or accepts of what he will give, he is welcome; be\nconformable, preach as he will have him, he likes him before a million of\nothers; for the host is always best cheap: and then as Hierom said to\nCromatius, _patella dignum operculum_, such a patron, such a clerk; the\ncure is well supplied, and all parties pleased. So that is still verified\nin our age, which [2084]Chrysostom complained of in his time, _Qui\nopulentiores sunt, in ordinem parasitorum cogunt eos, et ipsos tanquam\ncanes ad mensas suas enutriunt, eorumque impudentes. Venires iniquarum\ncoenarum reliquiis differtiunt, iisdem pro arbitro abulentes_: Rich men\nkeep these lecturers, and fawning parasites, like so many dogs at their\ntables, and filling their hungry guts with the offals of their meat, they\nabuse them at their pleasure, and make them say what they propose.\n[2085]\"As children do by a bird or a butterfly in a string, pull in and let\nhim out as they list, do they by their trencher chaplains, prescribe,\ncommand their wits, let in and out as to them it seems best.\" If the patron\nbe precise, so must his chaplain be; if he be papistical, his clerk must be\nso too, or else be turned out. These are those clerks which serve the turn,\nwhom they commonly entertain, and present to church livings, whilst in the\nmeantime we that are University men, like so many hidebound calves in a\npasture, tarry out our time, wither away as a flower ungathered in a\ngarden, and are never used; or as so many candles, illuminate ourselves\nalone, obscuring one another's light, and are not discerned here at all,\nthe least of which, translated to a dark room, or to some country benefice,\nwhere it might shine apart, would give a fair light, and be seen over all.\nWhilst we lie waiting here as those sick men did at the Pool of [2086]\nBethesda, till the Angel stirred the water, expecting a good hour, they\nstep between, and beguile us of our preferment. I have not yet said, if\nafter long expectation, much expense, travel, earnest suit of ourselves and\nfriends, we obtain a small benefice at last; our misery begins afresh, we\nare suddenly encountered with the flesh, world, and devil, with a new\nonset; we change a quiet life for an ocean of troubles, we come to a\nruinous house, which before it be habitable, must be necessarily to our\ngreat damage repaired; we are compelled to sue for dilapidations, or else\nsued ourselves, and scarce yet settled, we are called upon for our\npredecessor's arrearages; first-fruits, tenths, subsidies, are instantly to\nbe paid, benevolence, procurations, &c., and which is most to be feared, we\nlight upon a cracked title, as it befell Clenard of Brabant, for his\nrectory, and charge of his _Beginae_; he was no sooner inducted, but\ninstantly sued, _cepimusque_ [2087](saith he) _strenue litigare, et\nimplacabili bello confligere_: at length after ten years' suit, as long as\nTroy's siege, when he had tired himself, and spent his money, he was fain\nto leave all for quietness' sake, and give it up to his adversary. Or else\nwe are insulted over, and trampled on by domineering officers, fleeced by\nthose greedy harpies to get more fees; we stand in fear of some precedent\nlapse; we fall amongst refractory, seditious sectaries, peevish puritans,\nperverse papists, a lascivious rout of atheistical Epicures, that will not\nbe reformed, or some litigious people (those wild beasts of Ephesus must be\nfought with) that will not pay their dues without much repining, or\ncompelled by long suit; _Laici clericis oppido infesti_, an old axiom, all\nthey think well gotten that is had from the church, and by such uncivil,\nharsh dealings, they make their poor minister weary of his place, if not\nhis life; and put case they be quiet honest men, make the best of it, as\noften it falls out, from a polite and terse academic, he must turn rustic,\nrude, melancholise alone, learn to forget, or else, as many do, become\nmaltsters, graziers, chapmen, &c. (now banished from the academy, all\ncommerce of the muses, and confined to a country village, as Ovid was from\nRome to Pontus), and daily converse with a company of idiots and clowns.\n\nNos interim quod, attinet (nec enim immunes ab hac noxa sumus) idem realus\nmanet, idem nobis, et si non multo gravius, crimen objici potest: nostra\nenim culpa sit, nostra incuria, nostra avaritia, quod tam frequentes,\nfoedaeque fiant in Ecclesia nundinationes, (templum est vaenale, deusque)\ntot sordes invehantur, tanta grassetur impietas, tanta nequitia, tam\ninsanus miseriarum Euripus, et turbarum aestuarium, nostro inquam, omnium\n(Academicorum imprimis) vitio sit.

IV.\n\nSUBSECT. I--_Non-necessary, remote, outward, adventitious, or accidental\ncauses: as first from the Nurse_.\n\nOf those remote, outward, ambient, necessary causes, I have sufficiently\ndiscoursed in the precedent member, the non-necessary follow; of which,\nsaith [2104]Fuchsius, no art can be made, by reason of their uncertainty,\ncasualty, and multitude; so called \"not necessary\" because according to\n[2105]Fernelius, \"they may be avoided, and used without necessity.\" Many of\nthese accidental causes, which I shall entreat of here, might have well\nbeen reduced to the former, because they cannot be avoided, but fatally\nhappen to us, though accidentally, and unawares, at some time or other; the\nrest are contingent and inevitable, and more properly inserted in this rank\nof causes. To reckon up all is a thing impossible; of some therefore most\nremarkable of these contingent causes which produce melancholy, I will\nbriefly speak and in their order.\n\nFrom a child's nativity, the first ill accident that can likely befall him\nin this kind is a bad nurse, by whose means alone he may be tainted with\nthis [2106]malady from his cradle, Aulus Gellius _l. 12. c. 1._ brings in\nPhavorinus, that eloquent philosopher, proving this at large, [2107] \"that\nthere is the same virtue and property in the milk as in the seed, and not\nin men alone, but in all other creatures; he gives instance in a kid and\nlamb, if either of them suck of the other's milk, the lamb of the goat's,\nor the kid of the ewe's, the wool of the one will be hard, and the hair of\nthe other soft.\" Giraldus Cambrensis _Itinerar. Cambriae, l. 1. c. 2._\nconfirms this by a notable example which happened in his time. A sow-pig by\nchance sucked a brach, and when she was grown [2108]\"would miraculously\nhunt all manner of deer, and that as well, or rather better, than any\nordinary hound.\" His conclusion is, [2109]\"that men and beasts participate\nof her nature and conditions by whose milk they are fed.\" Phavorinus urges\nit farther, and demonstrates it more evidently, that if a nurse be\n[2110]\"misshapen, unchaste, dishonest, impudent, [2111]cruel, or the like,\nthe child that sucks upon her breast will be so too;\" all other affections\nof the mind and diseases are almost engrafted, as it were, and imprinted\ninto the temperature of the infant, by the nurse's milk; as pox, leprosy,\nmelancholy, &c. Cato for some such reason would make his servants' children\nsuck upon his wife's breast, because by that means they would love him and\nhis the better, and in all likelihood agree with them. A more evident\nexample that the minds are altered by milk cannot be given, than that of\n[2112]Dion, which he relates of Caligula's cruelty; it could neither be\nimputed to father nor mother, but to his cruel nurse alone, that anointed\nher paps with blood still when he sucked, which made him such a murderer,\nand to express her cruelty to a hair: and that of Tiberius, who was a\ncommon drunkard, because his nurse was such a one. _Et si delira fuerit_\n([2113]one observes) _infantulum delirum faciet_, if she be a fool or dolt,\nthe child she nurseth will take after her, or otherwise be misaffected;\nwhich Franciscus Barbarus _l. 2. c. ult. de re uxoria_ proves at full, and\nAnt. Guivarra, _lib. 2. de Marco Aurelio_: the child will surely\nparticipate. For bodily sickness there is no doubt to be made. Titus,\nVespasian's son, was therefore sickly, because the nurse was so,\nLampridius. And if we may believe physicians, many times children catch the\npox from a bad nurse, Botaldus _cap. 61. de lue vener._ Besides evil\nattendance, negligence, and many gross inconveniences, which are incident\nto nurses, much danger may so come to the child. [2114]For these causes\nAristotle _Polit. lib. 7. c. 17._ Phavorinus and Marcus Aurelius would not\nhave a child put to nurse at all, but every mother to bring up her own, of\nwhat condition soever she be; for a sound and able mother to put out her\nchild to nurse, is _naturae intemperies_, so [2115]Guatso calls it, 'tis\nfit therefore she should be nurse herself; the mother will be more careful,\nloving, and attendant, than any servile woman, or such hired creatures;\nthis all the world acknowledgeth, _convenientissimum est_ (as Rod. a Castro\n_de nat. mulierum. lib. 4. c. 12._ in many words confesseth) _matrem ipsam\nlactare infantem_, \"It is most fit that the mother should suckle her own\ninfant\"--who denies that it should be so?--and which some women most\ncuriously observe; amongst the rest, [2116]that queen of France, a Spaniard\nby birth, that was so precise and zealous in this behalf, that when in her\nabsence a strange nurse had suckled her child, she was never quiet till she\nhad made the infant vomit it up again. But she was too jealous. If it be\nso, as many times it is, they must be put forth, the mother be not fit or\nwell able to be a nurse, I would then advise such mothers, as\n[2117]Plutarch doth in his book _de liberis educandis_ and [2118]S. Hierom,\n_li. 2. epist. 27. Laetae de institut. fil. Magninus part 2. Reg. sanit.\ncap. 7._ and the said Rodericus, that they make choice of a sound woman, of\na good complexion, honest, free from bodily diseases, if it be possible,\nall passions and perturbations of the mind, as sorrow, fear, grief,\n[2119]folly, melancholy. For such passions corrupt the milk, and alter the\ntemperature of the child, which now being [2120] _Udum et molle lutum_, \"a\nmoist and soft clay,\" is easily seasoned and perverted. And if such a nurse\nmay be found out, that will be diligent and careful withal, let Phavorinus\nand M. Aurelius plead how they can against it, I had rather accept of her\nin some cases than the mother herself, and which Bonacialus the physician,\nNic. Biesius the politician, _lib. 4. de repub. cap. 8._ approves,\n[2121]\"Some nurses are much to be preferred to some mothers.\" For why may\nnot the mother be naught, a peevish drunken flirt, a waspish choleric slut,\na crazed piece, a fool (as many mothers are), unsound as soon as the nurse?\nThere is more choice of nurses than mothers; and therefore except the\nmother be most virtuous, staid, a woman of excellent good parts, and of a\nsound complexion, I would have all children in such cases committed to\ndiscreet strangers. And 'tis the only way; as by marriage they are\nengrafted to other families to alter the breed, or if anything be amiss in\nthe mother, as Ludovicus Mercatus contends, _Tom. 2. lib. de morb. haered._\nto prevent diseases and future maladies, to correct and qualify the child's\nill-disposed temperature, which he had from his parents. This is an\nexcellent remedy, if good choice be made of such a nurse.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Education a Cause of Melancholy_.\n\nEducation, of these accidental causes of melancholy, may justly challenge\nthe next place, for if a man escape a bad nurse, he may be undone by evil\nbringing up. [2122]Jason Pratensis puts this of education for a principal\ncause; bad parents, stepmothers, tutors, masters, teachers, too rigorous,\ntoo severe, too remiss or indulgent on the other side, are often fountains\nand furtherers of this disease. Parents and such as have the tuition and\noversight of children, offend many times in that they are too stern, always\nthreatening, chiding, brawling, whipping, or striking; by means of which\ntheir poor children are so disheartened and cowed, that they never after\nhave any courage, a merry hour in their lives, or take pleasure in\nanything. There is a great moderation to be had in such things, as matters\nof so great moment to the making or marring of a child. Some fright their\nchildren with beggars, bugbears, and hobgoblins, if they cry, or be\notherwise unruly: but they are much to blame in it, many times, saith\nLavater, _de spectris, part. 1, cap. 5._ _ex metu in morbos graves incidunt\net noctu dormientes clamant_, for fear they fall into many diseases, and\ncry out in their sleep, and are much the worse for it all their lives:\nthese things ought not at all, or to be sparingly done, and upon just\noccasion. Tyrannical, impatient, hair-brain schoolmasters, _aridi\nmagistri_, so [2123]Fabius terms them, _Ajaces flagelliferi_, are in this\nkind as bad as hangmen and executioners, they make many children endure a\nmartyrdom all the while they are at school, with bad diet, if they board in\ntheir houses, too much severity and ill-usage, they quite pervert their\ntemperature of body and mind: still chiding, railing, frowning, lashing,\ntasking, keeping, that they are _fracti animis_, moped many times, weary of\ntheir lives, [2124]_nimia severitate deficiunt et desperant_, and think no\nslavery in the world (as once I did myself) like to that of a grammar\nscholar. _Praeceptorum ineptiis discruciantur ingenia puerorum_, [2125]\nsaith Erasmus, they tremble at his voice, looks, coming in. St. Austin, in\nthe first book of his _confess. et 4 ca._ calls this schooling _meliculosam\nnecessitatem_, and elsewhere a martyrdom, and confesseth of himself, how\ncruelly he was tortured in mind for learning Greek, _nulla verba noveram,\net saevis terroribus et poenis, ut nossem, instabatur mihi vehementer_, I\nknow nothing, and with cruel terrors and punishment I was daily compelled.\n[2126]Beza complains in like case of a rigorous schoolmaster in Paris, that\nmade him by his continual thunder and threats once in a mind to drown\nhimself, had he not met by the way with an uncle of his that vindicated him\nfrom that misery for the time, by taking him to his house. Trincavellius,\n_lib. 1. consil. 16._ had a patient nineteen years of age, extremely\nmelancholy, _ob nimium studium, Tarvitii et praeceptoris minas_, by reason\nof overmuch study, and his [2127]tutor's threats. Many masters are\nhard-hearted, and bitter to their servants, and by that means do so deject,\nwith terrible speeches and hard usage so crucify them, that they become\ndesperate, and can never be recalled.\n\nOthers again, in that opposite extreme, do as great harm by their too much\nremissness, they give them no bringing up, no calling to busy themselves\nabout, or to live in, teach them no trade, or set them in any good course;\nby means of which their servants, children, scholars, are carried away with\nthat stream of drunkenness, idleness, gaming, and many such irregular\ncourses, that in the end they rue it, curse their parents, and mischief\nthemselves. Too much indulgence causeth the like, [2128]_inepta patris\nlenitas et facilitas prava_, when as Mitio-like, with too much liberty and\ntoo great allowance, they feed their children's humours, let them revel,\nwench, riot, swagger, and do what they will themselves, and then punish\nthem with a noise of musicians;\n\n[2129] \"Obsonet, potet, oleat unguenta de meo;\n        Amat? dabitur a me argentum ubi erit commodum.\n        Fores effregit? restituentur: descidit\n        Vestem? resarcietur.--Faciat quod lubet,\n        Sumat, consumat, perdat, decretum est pati.\"\n\nBut as Demeo told him, _tu illum corrumpi sinis_, your lenity will be his\nundoing, _praevidere videor jam diem, illum, quum hic egens profugiet\naliquo militatum_, I foresee his ruin. So parents often err, many fond\nmothers especially, dote so much upon their children, like [2130]Aesop's\nape, till in the end they crush them to death, _Corporum nutrices animarum\nnovercae_, pampering up their bodies to the undoing of their souls: they\nwill not let them be [2131]corrected or controlled, but still soothed up in\neverything they do, that in conclusion \"they bring sorrow, shame, heaviness\nto their parents\" (Ecclus. cap. xxx. 8, 9), \"become wanton, stubborn,\nwilful, and disobedient;\" rude, untaught, headstrong, incorrigible, and\ngraceless; \"they love them so foolishly,\" saith [2132]Cardan, \"that they\nrather seem to hate them, bringing them not up to virtue but injury, not to\nlearning but to riot, not to sober life and conversation, but to all\npleasure and licentious behaviour.\" Who is he of so little experience that\nknows not this of Fabius to be true? [2133]\"Education is another nature,\naltering the mind and will, and I would to God\" (saith he) \"we ourselves\ndid not spoil our children's manners, by our overmuch cockering and nice\neducation, and weaken the strength of their bodies and minds, that causeth\ncustom, custom nature,\" &c. For these causes Plutarch in his book _de lib.\neduc._ and Hierom. _epist. lib. 1. epist. 17. to Laeta de institut.\nfiliae_, gives a most especial charge to all parents, and many good\ncautions about bringing up of children, that they be not committed to\nindiscreet, passionate, bedlam tutors, light, giddy-headed, or covetous\npersons, and spare for no cost, that they may be well nurtured and taught,\nit being a matter of so great consequence. For such parents as do\notherwise, Plutarch esteems of them [2134]\"that are more careful of their\nshoes than of their feet,\" that rate their wealth above their children. And\nhe, saith [2135]Cardan, \"that leaves his son to a covetous schoolmaster to\nbe informed, or to a close Abbey to fast and learn wisdom together, doth no\nother, than that he be a learned fool, or a sickly wise man.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Terrors and Affrights, Causes of Melancholy_.\n\nTully, in the fourth of his Tusculans, distinguishes these terrors which\narise from the apprehension of some terrible object heard or seen, from\nother fears, and so doth Patritius _lib. 5. Tit. 4. de regis institut._ Of\nall fears they are most pernicious and violent, and so suddenly alter the\nwhole temperature of the body, move the soul and spirits, strike such a\ndeep impression, that the parties can never be recovered, causing more\ngrievous and fiercer melancholy, as Felix Plater, _c. 3. de mentis\nalienat_. [2136]speaks out of his experience, than any inward cause\nwhatsoever: \"and imprints itself so forcibly in the spirits, brain,\nhumours, that if all the mass of blood were let out of the body, it could\nhardly be extracted. This horrible kind of melancholy\" (for so he terms it)\n\"had been often brought before him, and troubles and affrights commonly men\nand women, young and old of all sorts.\" [2137]Hercules de Saxonia calls\nthis kind of melancholy (_ab agitatione spirituum_) by a peculiar name, it\ncomes from the agitation, motion, contraction, dilatation of spirits, not\nfrom any distemperature of humours, and produceth strong effects. This\nterror is most usually caused, as [2138]Plutarch will have, \"from some\nimminent danger, when a terrible object is at hand,\" heard, seen, or\nconceived, [2139]\"truly appearing, or in a [2140]dream:\" and many times the\nmore sudden the accident, it is the more violent.\n\n[2141] \"Stat terror animis, et cor attonitum salit,\n        Pavidumque trepidis palpitat venis jecur.\"\n\n       \"Their soul's affright, their heart amazed quakes,\n        The trembling liver pants i' th' veins, and aches.\"\n\nArthemedorus the grammarian lost his wits by the unexpected sight of a\ncrocodile, Laurentius _7. de melan_. [2142]The massacre at Lyons, 1572, in\nthe reign of Charles IX., was so terrible and fearful, that many ran mad,\nsome died, great-bellied women were brought to bed before their time,\ngenerally all affrighted aghast. Many lose their wits [2143]\"by the sudden\nsight of some spectrum or devil, a thing very common in all ages,\" saith\nLavater _part 1. cap. 9._ as Orestes did at the sight of the Furies, which\nappeared to him in black (as [2144]Pausanias records). The Greeks call them\n[Greek: mormolucheia], which so terrify their souls, or if they be but\naffrighted by some counterfeit devils in jest,\n\n[2145]  ------\"ut pueri trepidant, atque omnia caecis\n        In tenebris metuunt\"------\n\nas children in the dark conceive hobgoblins, and are so afraid, they are\nthe worse for it all their lives. Some by sudden fires, earthquakes,\ninundations, or any such dismal objects: Themiscon the physician fell into\na hydrophobia, by seeing one sick of that disease: (Dioscorides _l. 6. c.\n33._) or by the sight of a monster, a carcase, they are disquieted many\nmonths following, and cannot endure the room where a corpse hath been, for\na world would not be alone with a dead man, or lie in that bed many years\nafter in which a man hath died. At [2146]Basil many little children in the\nspringtime went to gather flowers in a meadow at the town's end, where a\nmalefactor hung in gibbets; all gazing at it, one by chance flung a stone,\nand made it stir, by which accident, the children affrighted ran away; one\nslower than the rest, looking back, and seeing the stirred carcase wag\ntowards her, cried out it came after, and was so terribly affrighted, that\nfor many days she could not rest, eat, or sleep, she could not be pacified,\nbut melancholy, died. [2147]In the same town another child, beyond the\nRhine, saw a grave opened, and upon the sight of a carcase, was so troubled\nin mind that she could not be comforted, but a little after departed, and\nwas buried by it. Platerus _observat. l. 1_, a gentlewoman of the same city\nsaw a fat hog cut up, when the entrails were opened, and a noisome savour\noffended her nose, she much misliked, and would not longer abide: a\nphysician in presence, told her, as that hog, so was she, full of filthy\nexcrements, and aggravated the matter by some other loathsome instances,\ninsomuch, this nice gentlewoman apprehended it so deeply, that she fell\nforthwith a-vomiting, was so mightily distempered in mind and body, that\nwith all his art and persuasions, for some months after, he could not\nrestore her to herself again, she could not forget it, or remove the object\nout of her sight, _Idem_. Many cannot endure to see a wound opened, but\nthey are offended: a man executed, or labour of any fearful disease, as\npossession, apoplexies, one bewitched; [2148]or if they read by chance of\nsome terrible thing, the symptoms alone of such a disease, or that which\nthey dislike, they are instantly troubled in mind, aghast, ready to apply\nit to themselves, they are as much disquieted as if they had seen it, or\nwere so affected themselves. _Hecatas sibi videntur somniare_, they dream\nand continually think of it. As lamentable effects are caused by such\nterrible objects heard, read, or seen, _auditus maximos motus in corpore\nfacit_, as [2149]Plutarch holds, no sense makes greater alteration of body\nand mind: sudden speech sometimes, unexpected news, be they good or bad,\n_praevisa minus oratio_, will move as much, _animum obruere, et de sede sua\ndejicere_, as a [2150]philosopher observes, will take away our sleep and\nappetite, disturb and quite overturn us. Let them bear witness that have\nheard those tragical alarms, outcries, hideous noises, which are many times\nsuddenly heard in the dead of the night by irruption of enemies and\naccidental fires, &c., those [2151]panic fears, which often drive men out\nof their wits, bereave them of sense, understanding and all, some for a\ntime, some for their whole lives, they never recover it. The [2152]\nMidianites were so affrighted by Gideon's soldiers, they breaking but every\none a pitcher; and [2153]Hannibal's army by such a panic fear was\ndiscomfited at the walls of Rome. Augusta Livia hearing a few tragical\nverses recited out of Virgil, _Tu Marcellus eris_, &c., fell down dead in a\nswoon. Edinus king of Denmark, by a sudden sound which he heard, [2154]\n\"was turned into fury with all his men,\" Cranzius, _l. 5, Dan. hist._ and\nAlexander ab Alexandro _l. 3. c. 5._ Amatus Lusitanus had a patient, that\nby reason of bad tidings became epilepticus, _cen. 2. cura 90_, Cardan\n_subtil. l. 18_, saw one that lost his wits by mistaking of an echo. If one\nsense alone can cause such violent commotions of the mind, what may we\nthink when hearing, sight, and those other senses are all troubled at once?\nas by some earthquakes, thunder, lightning, tempests, &c. At Bologna in\nItaly, _anno_ 1504, there was such a fearful earthquake about eleven\no'clock in the night (as [2155]Beroaldus in his book _de terrae motu_, hath\ncommended to posterity) that all the city trembled, the people thought the\nworld was at an end, _actum de mortalibus_, such a fearful noise, it made\nsuch a detestable smell, the inhabitants were infinitely affrighted, and\nsome ran mad. _Audi rem atrocem, et annalibus memorandam_ (mine author\nadds), hear a strange story, and worthy to be chronicled: I had a servant\nat the same time called Fulco Argelanus, a bold and proper man, so\ngrievously terrified with it, that he [2156]was first melancholy, after\ndoted, at last mad, and made away himself. At [2157]Fuscinum in Japona\n\"there was such an earthquake, and darkness on a sudden, that many men were\noffended with headache, many overwhelmed with sorrow and melancholy. At\nMeacum whole streets and goodly palaces were overturned at the same time,\nand there was such a hideous noise withal, like thunder, and filthy smell,\nthat their hair stared for fear, and their hearts quaked, men and beasts\nwere incredibly terrified. In Sacai, another city, the same earthquake was\nso terrible unto them, that many were bereft of their senses; and others by\nthat horrible spectacle so much amazed, that they knew not what they did.\"\nBlasius a Christian, the reporter of the news, was so affrighted for his\npart, that though it were two months after, he was scarce his own man,\nneither could he drive the remembrance of it out of his mind. Many times,\nsome years following, they will tremble afresh at the [2158]remembrance or\nconceit of such a terrible object, even all their lives long, if mention be\nmade of it. Cornelius Agrippa relates out of Gulielmus Parisiensis, a story\nof one, that after a distasteful purge which a physician had prescribed\nunto him, was so much moved, [2159]\"that at the very sight of physic he\nwould be distempered,\" though he never so much as smelled to it, the box of\nphysic long after would give him a purge; nay, the very remembrance of it\ndid effect it; [2160]\"like travellers and seamen,\" saith Plutarch, \"that\nwhen they have been sanded, or dashed on a rock, for ever after fear not\nthat mischance only, but all such dangers whatsoever.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Scoffs, Calumnies, bitter Jests, how they cause Melancholy_.\n\nIt is an old saying, [2161]\"A blow with a word strikes deeper than a blow\nwith a sword:\" and many men are as much galled with a calumny, a scurrilous\nand bitter jest, a libel, a pasquil, satire, apologue, epigram, stage-play\nor the like, as with any misfortune whatsoever. Princes and potentates,\nthat are otherwise happy, and have all at command, secure and free, _quibus\npotentia sceleris impunitatem fecit_, are grievously vexed with these\npasquilling libels, and satires: they fear a railing [2162]Aretine, more\nthan an enemy in the field, which made most princes of his time (as some\nrelate) \"allow him a liberal pension, that he should not tax them in his\nsatires.\" [2163]The Gods had their Momus, Homer his Zoilus, Achilles his\nThersites, Philip his Demades: the Caesars themselves in Rome were commonly\ntaunted. There was never wanting a Petronius, a Lucian in those times, nor\nwill be a Rabelais, an Euphormio, a Boccalinus in ours. Adrian the sixth\npope [2164]was so highly offended, and grievously vexed with pasquillers at\nRome, he gave command that his statue should be demolished and burned, the\nashes flung into the river Tiber, and had done it forthwith, had not\nLudovicus Suessanus, a facete companion, dissuaded him to the contrary, by\ntelling him, that pasquil's ashes would turn to frogs in the bottom of the\nriver, and croak worse and louder than before,--_genus irritabile vatum_,\nand therefore [2165]Socrates in Plato adviseth all his friends, \"that\nrespect their credits, to stand in awe of poets, for they are terrible\nfellows, can praise and dispraise as they see cause.\" _Hinc quam sit\ncalamus saevior ense patet_. The prophet David complains, Psalm cxxiii. 4.\n\"that his soul was full of the mocking of the wealthy, and of the\ndespitefulness of the proud,\" and Psalm lv. 4. \"for the voice of the\nwicked, &c., and their hate: his heart trembled within him, and the terrors\nof death came upon him; fear and horrible fear,\" &c., and Psal. lxix. 20.\n\"Rebuke hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.\" Who hath not\nlike cause to complain, and is not so troubled, that shall fall into the\nmouths of such men? for many are of so [2166]petulant a spleen; and have\nthat figure Sarcasmus so often in their mouths, so bitter, so foolish, as\n[2167]Balthazar Castilio notes of them, that \"they cannot speak, but they\nmust bite;\" they had rather lose a friend than a jest; and what company\nsoever they come in, they will be scoffing, insulting over their inferiors,\nespecially over such as any way depend upon them, humouring, misusing, or\nputting gulleries on some or other till they have made by their humouring\nor gulling [2168]_ex stulto insanum_, a mope or a noddy, and all to make\nthemselves merry:\n\n[2169]  ------\"dummodo risum\n        Excutiat sibi; non hic cuiquam parcit amico;\"\n\nFriends, neuters, enemies, all are as one, to make a fool a madman, is\ntheir sport, and they have no greater felicity than to scoff and deride\nothers; they must sacrifice to the god of laughter, with them in [2170]\nApuleius, once a day, or else they shall be melancholy themselves; they\ncare not how they grind and misuse others, so they may exhilarate their own\npersons. Their wits indeed serve them to that sole purpose, to make sport,\nto break a scurrile jest, which is _levissimus ingenii fructus_, the froth\nof wit, as [2171]Tully holds, and for this they are often applauded, in all\nother discourse, dry, barren, stramineous, dull and heavy, here lies their\ngenius, in this they alone excel, please themselves and others. Leo\nDecimus, that scoffing pope, as Jovius hath registered in the Fourth book\nof his life, took an extraordinary delight in humouring of silly fellows,\nand to put gulleries upon them, [2172]by commending some, persuading others\nto this or that: he made _ex stolidis stultissimos, et maxime ridiculos, ex\nstultis insanos_; soft fellows, stark noddies; and such as were foolish,\nquite mad before he left them. One memorable example he recites there, of\nTarascomus of Parma, a musician that was so humoured by Leo Decimus, and\nBibiena his second in this business, that he thought himself to be a man of\nmost excellent skill, (who was indeed a ninny) they [2173]\"made him set\nfoolish songs, and invent new ridiculous precepts, which they did highly\ncommend,\" as to tie his arm that played on the lute, to make him strike a\nsweeter stroke, [2174]\"and to pull down the arras hangings, because the\nvoice would be clearer, by reason of the reverberation of the wall.\" In the\nlike manner they persuaded one Baraballius of Caieta, that he was as good a\npoet as Petrarch; would have him to be made a laureate poet, and invite all\nhis friends to his instalment; and had so possessed the poor man with a\nconceit of his excellent poetry, that when some of his more discreet\nfriends told him of his folly, he was very angry with them, and said\n[2175]\"they envied his honour, and prosperity:\" it was strange (saith\nJovius) to see an old man of 60 years, a venerable and grave old man, so\ngulled. But what cannot such scoffers do, especially if they find a soft\ncreature, on whom they may work? nay, to say truth, who is so wise, or so\ndiscreet, that may not be humoured in this kind, especially if some\nexcellent wits shall set upon him; he that mads others, if he were so\nhumoured, would be as mad himself, as much grieved and tormented; he might\ncry with him in the comedy, _Proh Jupiter tu homo me, adigas ad insaniam_.\nFor all is in these things as they are taken; if he be a silly soul, and do\nnot perceive it, 'tis well, he may haply make others sport, and be no whit\ntroubled himself; but if he be apprehensive of his folly, and take it to\nheart, then it torments him worse than any lash: a bitter jest, a slander,\na calumny, pierceth deeper than any loss, danger, bodily pain, or injury\nwhatsoever; _leviter enim volat_, (it flies swiftly) as Bernard of an\narrow, _sed graviter vulnerat_, (but wounds deeply), especially if it shall\nproceed from a virulent tongue, \"it cuts\" (saith David) \"like a two-edged\nsword. They shoot bitter words as arrows,\" Psal. lxiv. 5. \"And they smote\nwith their tongues,\" Jer. xviii. 18, and that so hard, that they leave an\nincurable wound behind them. Many men are undone by this means, moped, and\nso dejected, that they are never to be recovered; and of all other men\nliving, those which are actually melancholy, or inclined to it, are most\nsensible, (as being suspicious, choleric, apt to mistake) and impatient of\nan injury in that kind: they aggravate, and so meditate continually of it,\nthat it is a perpetual corrosive, not to be removed, till time wear it out.\nAlthough they peradventure that so scoff, do it alone in mirth and\nmerriment, and hold it _optimum aliena frui insania_, an excellent thing to\nenjoy another man's madness; yet they must know, that it is a mortal sin\n(as [2176]Thomas holds) and as the prophet [2177]David denounceth, \"they\nthat use it, shall never dwell in God's tabernacle.\"\n\nSuch scurrilous jests, flouts, and sarcasms, therefore, ought not at all to\nbe used; especially to our betters, to those that are in misery, or any way\ndistressed: for to such, _aerumnarum incrementa sunt_, they multiply grief,\nand as [2178]he perceived, _In multis pudor, in multis iracundia_, &c.,\nmany are ashamed, many vexed, angered, and there is no greater cause or\nfurtherer of melancholy. Martin Cromerus, in the Sixth book of his history,\nhath a pretty story to this purpose, of Vladislaus, the second king of\nPoland, and Peter Dunnius, earl of Shrine; they had been hunting late, and\nwere enforced to lodge in a poor cottage. When they went to bed, Vladislaus\ntold the earl in jest, that his wife lay softer with the abbot of Shrine;\nhe not able to contain, replied, _Et tua cum Dabesso_, and yours with\nDabessus, a gallant young gentleman in the court, whom Christina the queen\nloved. _Tetigit id dictum Principis animum_, these words of his so galled\nthe prince, that he was long after _tristis et cogitabundus_, very sad and\nmelancholy for many months; but they were the earl's utter undoing: for\nwhen Christina heard of it, she persecuted him to death. Sophia the\nempress, Justinian's wife, broke a bitter jest upon Narsetes the eunuch, a\nfamous captain then disquieted for an overthrow which he lately had: that\nhe was fitter for a distaff and to keep women company, than to wield a\nsword, or to be general of an army: but it cost her dear, for he so far\ndistasted it, that he went forthwith to the adverse part, much troubled in\nhis thoughts, caused the Lombards to rebel, and thence procured many\nmiseries to the commonwealth. Tiberius the emperor withheld a legacy from\nthe people of Rome, which his predecessor Augustus had lately given, and\nperceiving a fellow round a dead corse in the ear, would needs know\nwherefore he did so; the fellow replied, that he wished the departed soul\nto signify to Augustus, the commons of Rome were yet unpaid: for this\nbitter jest the emperor caused him forthwith to be slain, and carry the\nnews himself. For this reason, all those that otherwise approve of jests in\nsome cases, and facete companions, (as who doth not?) let them laugh and be\nmerry, _rumpantur et illa Codro_, 'tis laudable and fit, those yet will by\nno means admit them in their companies, that are any way inclined to this\nmalady: _non jocandum cum iis qui miseri sunt, et aerumnosi_, no jesting\nwith a discontented person. 'Tis Castilio's caveat, [2179]Jo. Pontanus, and\n[2180]Galateus, and every good man's.\n\n       \"Play with me, but hurt me not:\n        Jest with me, but shame me not.\"\n\nComitas is a virtue between rusticity and scurrility, two extremes, as\naffability is between flattery and contention, it must not exceed; but be\nstill accompanied with that [2181][Greek: ablabeia] or innocency, _quae\nnemini nocet, omnem injuriae, oblationem abhorrens_, hurts no man, abhors\nall offer of injury. Though a man be liable to such a jest or obloquy, have\nbeen overseen, or committed a foul fact, yet it is no good manners or\nhumanity, to upbraid, to hit him in the teeth with his offence, or to scoff\nat such a one; 'tis an old axiom, _turpis in reum omnis exprobratio_.[2182]\nI speak not of such as generally tax vice, Barclay, Gentilis, Erasmus,\nAgrippa, Fishcartus, &c., the Varronists and Lucians of our time,\nsatirists, epigrammists, comedians, apologists, &c., but such as personate,\nrail, scoff, calumniate, perstringe by name, or in presence offend;\n\n[2183] \"Ludit qui stolida procacitate\n        Non est Sestius ille sed caballus:\"\n\n'Tis horse-play this, and those jests (as he [2184]saith) \"are no better\nthan injuries,\" biting jests, _mordentes et aculeati_, they are poisoned\njests, leave a sting behind them, and ought not to be used.\n\n[2185] \"Set not thy foot to make the blind to fall;\n          Nor wilfully offend thy weaker brother:\n        Nor wound the dead with thy tongue's bitter gall,\n          Neither rejoice thou in the fall of other.\"\n\nIf these rules could be kept, we should have much more ease and quietness\nthan we have, less melancholy, whereas on the contrary, we study to misuse\neach other, how to sting and gall, like two fighting boors, bending all our\nforce and wit, friends, fortune, to crucify [2186]one another's souls; by\nmeans of which, there is little content and charity, much virulency,\nhatred, malice, and disquietness among us.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Loss of Liberty, Servitude, Imprisonment, how they cause\nMelancholy_.\n\nTo this catalogue of causes, I may well annex loss of liberty, servitude,\nor imprisonment, which to some persons is as great a torture as any of the\nrest. Though they have all things convenient, sumptuous houses to their\nuse, fair walks and gardens, delicious bowers, galleries, good fare and\ndiet, and all things correspondent, yet they are not content, because they\nare confined, may not come and go at their pleasure, have and do what they\nwill, but live [2187]_aliena quadra_, at another man's table and command.\nAs it is [2188]in meats so it is in all other things, places, societies,\nsports; let them be never so pleasant, commodious, wholesome, so good; yet\n_omnium rerum est satietas_, there is a loathing satiety of all things. The\nchildren of Israel were tired with manna, it is irksome to them so to live,\nas to a bird in his cage, or a dog in his kennel, they are weary of it.\nThey are happy, it is true, and have all things, to another man's judgment,\nthat heart can wish, or that they themselves can desire, _bona si sua\nnorint_: yet they loathe it, and are tired with the present: _Est natura\nhominum novitatis avida_; men's nature is still desirous of news, variety,\ndelights; and our wandering affections are so irregular in this kind, that\nthey must change, though it must be to the worst. Bachelors must be\nmarried, and married men would be bachelors; they do not love their own\nwives, though otherwise fair, wise, virtuous, and well qualified, because\nthey are theirs; our present estate is still the worst, we cannot endure\none course of life long, _et quod modo voverat, odit_, one calling long,\n_esse in honore juvat, mox displicet_; one place long, [2189]_Romae Tibur\namo, ventosus Tybure Romam_, that which we earnestly sought, we now\ncontemn. _Hoc quosdam agit ad mortem_, (saith [2190]Seneca) _quod proposita\nsaepe mutando in eadem revolvuntur, et non relinquunt novitati locum:\nFastidio caepit esse vita, et ipsus mundus, et subit illud rapidissimarum\ndeliciarum, Quousque eadem_? this alone kills many a man, that they are\ntied to the same still, as a horse in a mill, a dog in a wheel, they run\nround, without alteration or news, their life groweth odious, the world\nloathsome, and that which crosseth their furious delights, what? still the\nsame? Marcus Aurelius and Solomon, that had experience of all worldly\ndelights and pleasure, confessed as much of themselves; what they most\ndesired, was tedious at last, and that their lust could never be satisfied,\nall was vanity and affliction of mind.\n\nNow if it be death itself, another hell, to be glutted with one kind of\nsport, dieted with one dish, tied to one place; though they have all things\notherwise as they can desire, and are in heaven to another man's opinion,\nwhat misery and discontent shall they have, that live in slavery, or in\nprison itself? _Quod tristius morte, in servitute vivendum_, as Hermolaus\ntold Alexander in [2191]Curtius, worse than death is bondage: [2192]_hoc\nanimo scito omnes fortes, ut mortem servituti anteponant_, All brave men at\narms (Tully holds) are so affected. [2193]_Equidem ego is sum, qui\nservitutem extremum omnium malorum esse arbitror_: I am he (saith Boterus)\nthat account servitude the extremity of misery. And what calamity do they\nendure, that live with those hard taskmasters, in gold mines (like those\n30,000 [2194]Indian slaves at Potosi, in Peru), tin-mines, lead-mines,\nstone-quarries, coal-pits, like so many mouldwarps under ground, condemned\nto the galleys, to perpetual drudgery, hunger, thirst, and stripes, without\nall hope of delivery? How are those women in Turkey affected, that most\npart of the year come not abroad; those Italian and Spanish dames, that are\nmewed up like hawks, and locked up by their jealous husbands? how tedious\nis it to them that live in stoves and caves half a year together? as in\nIceland, Muscovy, or under the [2195]pole itself, where they have six\nmonths' perpetual night. Nay, what misery and discontent do they endure,\nthat are in prison? They want all those six non-natural things at once,\ngood air, good diet, exercise, company, sleep, rest, ease, &c., that are\nbound in chains all day long, suffer hunger, and (as [2196]Lucian describes\nit) \"must abide that filthy stink, and rattling of chains, howlings,\npitiful outcries, that prisoners usually make; these things are not only\ntroublesome, but intolerable.\" They lie nastily among toads and frogs in a\ndark dungeon, in their own dung, in pain of body, in pain of soul, as\nJoseph did, Psal. cv. 18, \"they hurt his feet in the stocks, the iron\nentered his soul.\" They live solitary, alone, sequestered from all company\nbut heart-eating melancholy; and for want of meat, must eat that bread of\naffliction, prey upon themselves. Well might [2197]Arculanus put long\nimprisonment for a cause, especially to such as have lived jovially, in all\nsensuality and lust, upon a sudden are estranged and debarred from all\nmanner of pleasures: as were Huniades, Edward, and Richard II., Valerian\nthe Emperor, Bajazet the Turk. If it be irksome to miss our ordinary\ncompanions and repast for once a day, or an hour, what shall it be to lose\nthem for ever? If it be so great a delight to live at liberty, and to enjoy\nthat variety of objects the world affords; what misery and discontent must\nit needs bring to him, that shall now be cast headlong into that Spanish\ninquisition, to fall from heaven to hell, to be cubbed up upon a sudden,\nhow shall he be perplexed, what shall become of him? [2198] Robert Duke of\nNormandy being imprisoned by his youngest brother Henry I., _ab illo die\ninconsolabili dolore in carcere contabuit_, saith Matthew Paris, from that\nday forward pined away with grief. [2199]Jugurtha that generous captain,\n\"brought to Rome in triumph, and after imprisoned, through anguish of his\nsoul, and melancholy, died.\" [2200]Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, the second\nman from King Stephen (he that built that famous castle of [2201]Devizes in\nWiltshire,) was so tortured in prison with hunger, and all those calamities\naccompanying such men, [2202]_ut vivere noluerit, mori nescierit_, he would\nnot live, and could not die, between fear of death, and torments of life.\nFrancis King of France was taken prisoner by Charles V., _ad mortem fere\nmelancholicus_, saith Guicciardini, melancholy almost to death, and that in\nan instant. But this is as clear as the sun, and needs no further\nillustration.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Poverty and Want, Causes of Melancholy_.\n\nPoverty and want are so violent oppugners, so unwelcome guests, so much\nabhorred of all men, that I may not omit to speak of them apart. Poverty,\nalthough (if considered aright, to a wise, understanding, truly regenerate,\nand contented man) it be _donum Dei_, a blessed estate, the way to heaven,\nas [2203]Chrysostom calls it, God's gift, the mother of modesty, and much\nto be preferred before riches (as shall be shown in his [2204]place), yet\nas it is esteemed in the world's censure, it is a most odious calling, vile\nand base, a severe torture, _summum scelus_, a most intolerable burden; we\n[2205]shun it all, _cane pejus et angue_ (worse than a dog or a snake), we\nabhor the name of it, [2206]_Paupertas fugitur, totoque arcessitur orbe_,\nas being the fountain of all other miseries, cares, woes, labours, and\ngrievances whatsoever. To avoid which, we will take any pains,--_extremos\ncurrit mercator ad Indos_, we will leave no haven, no coast, no creek of\nthe world unsearched, though it be to the hazard of our lives, we will dive\nto the bottom of the sea, to the bowels of the earth, [2207]five, six,\nseven, eight, nine hundred fathom deep, through all five zones, and both\nextremes of heat and cold: we will turn parasites and slaves, prostitute\nourselves, swear and lie, damn our bodies and souls, forsake God, abjure\nreligion, steal, rob, murder, rather than endure this insufferable yoke of\npoverty, which doth so tyrannise, crucify, and generally depress us.\n\nFor look into the world, and you shall see men most part esteemed according\nto their means, and happy as they are rich: [2208]_Ubique tanti quisque\nquantum habuit fuit_. If he be likely to thrive, and in the way of\npreferment, who but he? In the vulgar opinion, if a man be wealthy, no\nmatter how he gets it, of what parentage, how qualified, how virtuously\nendowed, or villainously inclined; let him be a bawd, a gripe, an usurer, a\nvillain, a pagan, a barbarian, a wretch, [2209]Lucian's tyrant, \"on whom\nyou may look with less security than on the sun;\" so that he be rich (and\nliberal withal) he shall be honoured, admired, adored, reverenced, and\nhighly [2210]magnified. \"The rich is had in reputation because of his\ngoods,\" Eccl. x. 31. He shall be befriended: \"for riches gather many\nfriends,\" Prov. xix. 4,--_multos numerabit amicos_, all [2211]happiness\nebbs and flows with his money. He shall be accounted a gracious lord, a\nMecaenas, a benefactor, a wise, discreet, a proper, a valiant, a fortunate\nman, of a generous spirit, _Pullus Jovis, et gallinae, filius albae_: a\nhopeful, a good man, a virtuous, honest man. _Quando ego ie Junonium\npuerum, et matris partum vere aureum_, as [2212]Tully said of Octavianus,\nwhile he was adopted Caesar, and an heir [2213]apparent of so great a\nmonarchy, he was a golden child. All [2214]honour, offices, applause, grand\ntitles, and turgent epithets are put upon him, _omnes omnia bona dicere_;\nall men's eyes are upon him, God bless his good worship, his honour;\n[2215]every man speaks well of him, every man presents him, seeks and sues\nto him for his love, favour, and protection, to serve him, belong unto him,\nevery man riseth to him, as to Themistocles in the Olympics, if he speak,\nas of Herod, _Vox Dei, non hominis_, the voice of God, not of man. All the\ngraces, Veneres, pleasures, elegances attend him, [2216] golden fortune\naccompanies and lodgeth with him; and as to those Roman emperors, is placed\nin his chamber.\n\n[2217]  ------\"Secura naviget aura,\n        Fortunamque suo temperet arbitrio:\"\n\nhe may sail as he will himself, and temper his estate at his pleasure,\njovial days, splendour and magnificence, sweet music, dainty fare, the good\nthings, and fat of the land, fine clothes, rich attires, soft beds, down\npillows are at his command, all the world labours for him, thousands of\nartificers are his slaves to drudge for him, run, ride, and post for him:\n[2218]Divines (for _Pythia Philippisat_) lawyers, physicians, philosophers,\nscholars are his, wholly devote to his service. Every man seeks his\n[2219]acquaintance, his kindred, to match with him, though he be an oaf, a\nninny, a monster, a goose-cap, _uxorem ducat Danaen_, [2220]when, and whom\nhe will, _hunc optant generum Rex et Regina_--he is an excellent\n[2221]match for my son, my daughter, my niece, &c. _Quicquid calcaverit\nhic, Rosa fiet_, let him go whither he will, trumpets sound, bells ring,\n&c., all happiness attends him, every man is willing to entertain him, he\nsups in [2222]Apollo wheresoever he comes; what preparation is made for his\n[2223]entertainment? fish and fowl, spices and perfumes, all that sea and\nland affords. What cookery, masking, mirth to exhilarate his person?\n\n[2224] \"Da Trebio, pone ad Trebium, vis frater ab illia\n        Ilibus?\"------\n\nWhat dish will your good worship eat of?\n\n[2225]  ------\"dulcia poma,\n        Et quoscunque feret cultus tibi fundus honores,\n        Ante Larem, gustet venerabilior Lare dives.\"\n\n       \"Sweet apples, and whate'er thy fields afford,\n        Before thy Gods be serv'd, let serve thy Lord.\"\n\nWhat sport will your honour have? hawking, hunting, fishing, fowling,\nbulls, bears, cards, dice, cocks, players, tumblers, fiddlers, jesters,\n&c., they are at your good worship's command. Fair houses, gardens,\norchards, terraces, galleries, cabinets, pleasant walks, delightsome\nplaces, they are at hand: [2226]_in aureis lac, vinum in argenteis,\nadolescentulae ad nutum speciosae_, wine, wenches, &c. a Turkish paradise,\na heaven upon earth. Though he be a silly soft fellow, and scarce have\ncommon sense, yet if he be borne to fortunes (as I have said) [2227]_jure\nhaereditario sapere jubetur_, he must have honour and office in his course:\n[2228]_Nemo nisi dives honore dignus_ (Ambros. _offic. 21._) none so worthy\nas himself: he shall have it, _atque esto quicquid Servius aut Labeo_. Get\nmoney enough and command [2229]kingdoms, provinces, armies, hearts, hands,\nand affections; thou shalt have popes, patriarchs to be thy chaplains and\nparasites: thou shalt have (Tamerlane-like) kings to draw thy coach, queens\nto be thy laundresses, emperors thy footstools, build more towns and cities\nthan great Alexander, Babel towers, pyramids and Mausolean tombs, &c.\ncommand heaven and earth, and tell the world it is thy vassal, _auro emitur\ndiadema, argento caelum panditur, denarius philosophum conducit, nummus jus\ncogit, obolus literatum pascit, metallum sanitatem conciliat, aes amicos\nconglutinat_. [2230]And therefore not without good cause, John de Medicis,\nthat rich Florentine, when he lay upon his death-bed, calling his sons,\nCosmo and Laurence, before him, amongst other sober sayings, repeated this,\n_animo quieto digredior, quod vos sanos et divites post me relinquam_, \"It\ndoth me good to think yet, though I be dying, that I shall leave you, my\nchildren, sound and rich:\" for wealth sways all. It is not with us, as\namongst those Lacedaemonian senators of Lycurgus in Plutarch, \"He preferred\nthat deserved best, was most virtuous and worthy of the place, [2231]not\nswiftness, or strength, or wealth, or friends carried it in those days:\"\nbut _inter optimos optimus, inter temperantes temperantissimus_, the most\ntemperate and best. We have no aristocracies but in contemplation, all\noligarchies, wherein a few rich men domineer, do what they list, and are\nprivileged by their greatness. [2232]They may freely trespass, and do as\nthey please, no man dare accuse them, no not so much as mutter against\nthem, there is no notice taken of it, they may securely do it, live after\ntheir own laws, and for their money get pardons, indulgences, redeem their\nsouls from purgatory and hell itself,--_clausum possidet arca Jovem_. Let\nthem be epicures, or atheists, libertines, Machiavellians, (as they often\nare) [2233]_Et quamvis perjuris erit, sine gente, cruentus_, they may go\nto heaven through the eye of a needle, if they will themselves, they may be\ncanonised for saints, they shall be [2234]honourably interred in Mausolean\ntombs, commended by poets, registered in histories, have temples and\nstatues erected to their names,--_e manibus illis--nascentur violae_.--If\nhe be bountiful in his life, and liberal at his death, he shall have one to\nswear, as he did by Claudius the Emperor in Tacitus, he saw his soul go to\nheaven, and be miserably lamented at his funeral. _Ambubalarum collegia,\n&c. Trimalcionis topanta_ in Petronius _recta in caelum abiit_, went right\nto heaven: a, base quean, [2235]\"thou wouldst have scorned once in thy\nmisery to have a penny from her;\" and why? _modio nummos metiit_, she\nmeasured her money by the bushel. These prerogatives do not usually belong\nto rich men, but to such as are most part seeming rich, let him have but a\ngood [2236]outside, he carries it, and shall be adored for a god, as\n[2237]Cyrus was amongst the Persians, _ob splendidum apparatum_, for his\ngay attires; now most men are esteemed according to their clothes. In our\ngullish times, whom you peradventure in modesty would give place to, as\nbeing deceived by his habit, and presuming him some great worshipful man,\nbelieve it, if you shall examine his estate, he will likely be proved a\nserving man of no great note, my lady's tailor, his lordship's barber, or\nsome such gull, a Fastidius Brisk, Sir Petronel Flash, a mere outside. Only\nthis respect is given him, that wheresoever he comes, he may call for what\nhe will, and take place by reason of his outward habit.\n\nBut on the contrary, if he be poor, Prov. xv. 15, \"all his days are\nmiserable,\" he is under hatches, dejected, rejected and forsaken, poor in\npurse, poor in spirit; [2238]_prout res nobis fluit, ita et animus se\nhabet_; [2239]money gives life and soul. Though he be honest, wise,\nlearned, well-deserving, noble by birth, and of excellent good parts; yet\nin that he is poor, unlikely to rise, come to honour, office, or good\nmeans, he is contemned, neglected, _frustra sapit, inter literas esurit,\namicus molestus_. [2240]\"If he speak, what babbler is this?\" Ecclus, his\nnobility without wealth, is [2241]_projecta vilior alga_, and he not\nesteemed: _nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis_, if once poor, we are\nmetamorphosed in an instant, base slaves, villains, and vile drudges;\n[2242]for to be poor, is to be a knave, a fool, a wretch, a wicked, an\nodious fellow, a common eyesore, say poor and say all; they are born to\nlabour, to misery, to carry burdens like juments, _pistum stercus comedere_\nwith Ulysses' companions, and as Chremilus objected in Aristophanes, [2243]\n_salem lingere_, lick salt, to empty jakes, fay channels, [2244]carry out\ndirt and dunghills, sweep chimneys, rub horse-heels, &c. I say nothing of\nTurks, galley-slaves, which are bought [2245]and sold like juments, or\nthose African Negroes, or poor [2246]Indian drudges, _qui indies hinc inde\ndeferendis oneribus occumbunt, nam quod apud nos boves et asini vehunt,\ntrahunt_, &c. [2247]_Id omne misellis Indis_, they are ugly to behold, and\nthough erst spruce, now rusty and squalid, because poor, [2248]_immundas\nfortunas aquum est squalorem sequi_, it is ordinarily so. [2249]\"Others eat\nto live, but they live to drudge,\" [2250]_servilis et misera gens nihil\nrecusare audet_, a servile generation, that dare refuse no\ntask.--[2251]_Heus tu Dromo, cape hoc flabellum, ventulum hinc facito dum\nlavamus_, sirrah blow wind upon us while we wash, and bid your fellow get\nhim up betimes in the morning, be it fair or foul, he shall run fifty miles\nafoot tomorrow, to carry me a letter to my mistress, _Socia ad pistrinam_,\nSocia shall tarry at home and grind malt all day long, Tristan thresh. Thus\nare they commanded, being indeed some of them as so many footstools for\nrich men to tread on, blocks for them to get on horseback, or as\n[2252]\"walls for them to piss on.\" They are commonly such people, rude,\nsilly, superstitious idiots, nasty, unclean, lousy, poor, dejected,\nslavishly humble: and as [2253]Leo Afer observes of the commonalty of\nAfrica, _natura viliores sunt, nec apud suos duces majore in precio quam si\ncanes essent_: [2254]base by nature, and no more esteemed than dogs,\n_miseram, laboriosam, calamitosam vitam agunt, et inopem, infelicem,\nrudiores asinis, ut e brutis plane natos dicas_: no learning, no knowledge,\nno civility, scarce common, sense, nought but barbarism amongst them,\n_belluino more vivunt, neque calceos gestant, neque vestes_, like rogues\nand vagabonds, they go barefooted and barelegged, the soles of their feet\nbeing as hard as horse-hoofs, as [2255]Radzivilus observed at Damietta in\nEgypt, leading a laborious, miserable, wretched, unhappy life, [2256]\"like\nbeasts and juments, if not worse:\" (for a [2257]Spaniard in Incatan, sold\nthree Indian boys for a cheese, and a hundred Negro slaves for a horse)\ntheir discourse is scurrility, their _summum bonum_, a pot of ale. There is\nnot any slavery which these villains will not undergo, _inter illos\nplerique latrinas evacuant, alii culinariam curant, alii stabularios agunt,\nurinatores et id genus similia exercent_, &c. like those people that dwell\nin the [2258]Alps, chimney-sweepers, jakes-farmers, dirt-daubers, vagrant\nrogues, they labour hard some, and yet cannot get clothes to put on, or\nbread to eat. For what can filthy poverty give else, but [2259]beggary,\nfulsome nastiness, squalor, contempt, drudgery, labour, ugliness, hunger\nand thirst; _pediculorum, et pulicum numerum_? as [2260] he well followed\nit in Aristophanes, fleas and lice, _pro pallio vestem laceram, et pro\npulvinari lapidem bene magnum ad caput_, rags for his raiment, and a stone\nfor his pillow, _pro cathedra, ruptae caput urnae_, he sits in a broken\npitcher, or on a block for a chair, _et malvae, ramos pro panibus comedit_,\nhe drinks water, and lives on wort leaves, pulse, like a hog, or scraps\nlike a dog, _ut nunc nobis vita afficitur, quis non putabit insaniam esse,\ninfelicitatemque_? as Chremilus concludes his speech, as we poor men live\nnowadays, who will not take our life to be [2261] infelicity, misery, and\nmadness?\n\nIf they be of little better condition than those base villains,\nhunger-starved beggars, wandering rogues, those ordinary slaves, and\nday-labouring drudges; yet they are commonly so preyed upon by [2262]\npolling officers for breaking the laws, by their tyrannising landlords, so\nflayed and fleeced by perpetual [2263]exactions, that though they do\ndrudge, fare hard, and starve their genius, they cannot live in [2264]some\ncountries; but what they have is instantly taken from them, the very care\nthey take to live, to be drudges, to maintain their poor families, their\ntrouble and anxiety \"takes away their sleep,\" Sirac. xxxi. 1, it makes them\nweary of their lives: when they have taken all pains, done their utmost and\nhonest endeavours, if they be cast behind by sickness, or overtaken with\nyears, no man pities them, hard-hearted and merciless, uncharitable as they\nare, they leave them so distressed, to beg, steal, murmur, and [2265]\nrebel, or else starve. The feeling and fear of this misery compelled those\nold Romans, whom Menenius Agrippa pacified, to resist their governors:\noutlaws, and rebels in most places, to take up seditious arms, and in all\nages hath caused uproars, murmurings, seditions, rebellions, thefts,\nmurders, mutinies, jars and contentions in every commonwealth: grudging,\nrepining, complaining, discontent in each private family, because they want\nmeans to live according to their callings, bring up their children, it\nbreaks their hearts, they cannot do as they would. No greater misery than\nfor a lord to have a knight's living, a gentleman a yeoman's, not to be\nable to live as his birth and place require. Poverty and want are generally\ncorrosives to all kinds of men, especially to such as have been in good and\nflourishing estate, are suddenly distressed, [2266]nobly born, liberally\nbrought up, and, by some disaster and casualty miserably dejected. For the\nrest, as they have base fortunes, so have they base minds correspondent,\nlike beetles, _e stercore orti, e stercore victus, in stercore delicium_,\nas they were obscurely born and bred, so they delight in obscenity; they\nare not thoroughly touched with it. _Angustas animas angusto in pectore\nversant_. [2267]Yet, that which is no small cause of their torments, if\nonce they come to be in distress, they are forsaken of their fellows, most\npart neglected, and left unto themselves; as poor [2268]Terence in Rome was\nby Scipio, Laelius, and Furius, his great and noble friends.\n\n       \"Nil Publius Scipio profuit, nil ei Laelius, nil Furius,\n        Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime,\n        Horum ille opera ne domum quident habuit conductitiam.\"[2269]\n\n'Tis generally so, _Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris_, he is left cold\nand comfortless, _nullas ad amissas ibit amicus opes_, all flee from him as\nfrom a rotten wall, now ready to fall on their heads. Prov. xix. 1.\n\"Poverty separates them from their [2270]neighbours.\"\n\n[2271] \"Dum fortuna favet vultum servatis amici,\n        Cum cecidit, turpi vertitis ora fuga.\"\n\n       \"Whilst fortune favour'd, friends, you smil'd on me,\n        But when she fled, a friend I could not see.\"\n\nWhich is worse yet, if he be poor [2272]every man contemns him, insults\nover him, oppresseth him, scoffs at, aggravates his misery.\n\n[2273] \"Quum caepit quassata domus subsidere, partes\n        In proclinatas omne recumbit onus.\"\n\n       \"When once the tottering house begins to shrink,\n        Thither comes all the weight by an instinct.\"\n\nNay they are odious to their own brethren, and dearest friends, Pro. xix.\n7. \"His brethren hate him if he be poor,\" [2274]_omnes vicini oderunt_,\n\"his neighbours hate him,\" Pro. xiv. 20, [2275]_omnes me noti ac ignoti\ndeserunt_, as he complained in the comedy, friends and strangers, all\nforsake me. Which is most grievous, poverty makes men ridiculous, _Nil\nhabet infelix paupertas durius in se, quam quod ridiculos homines facit_,\nthey must endure [2276]jests, taunts, flouts, blows of their betters, and\ntake all in good part to get a meal's meat: [2277]_magnum pauperies\nopprobrium, jubet quidvis et facere et pati_. He must turn parasite,\njester, fool, _cum desipientibus desipere_; saith [2278]Euripides, slave,\nvillain, drudge to get a poor living, apply himself to each man's humours,\nto win and please, &c., and be buffeted when he hath all done, as Ulysses\nwas by Melanthius [2279]in Homer, be reviled, baffled, insulted over, for\n[2280]_potentiorum stultitia perferenda est_, and may not so much as mutter\nagainst it. He must turn rogue and villain; for as the saying is,\n_Necessitas cogit ad turpia_, poverty alone makes men thieves, rebels,\nmurderers, traitors, assassins, \"because of poverty we have sinned,\"\nEcclus. xxvii. 1, swear and forswear, bear false witness, lie, dissemble,\nanything, as I say, to advantage themselves, and to relieve their\nnecessities: [2281] _Culpae scelerisque magistra est_, when a man is driven\nto his shifts, what will he not do?\n\n[2282]  ------\"si miserum fortuna Sinonem\n        Finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.\"\n\nhe will betray his father, prince, and country, turn Turk, forsake\nreligion, abjure God and all, _nulla tam horrenda proditio, quam illi lucri\ncausa_ (saith [2283]Leo Afer) _perpetrare nolint_. [2284]Plato, therefore,\ncalls poverty, \"thievish, sacrilegious, filthy, wicked, and mischievous:\"\nand well he might. For it makes many an upright man otherwise, had he not\nbeen in want, to take bribes, to be corrupt, to do against his conscience,\nto sell his tongue, heart, hand, &c., to be churlish, hard, unmerciful,\nuncivil, to use indirect means to help his present estate. It makes princes\nto exact upon their subjects, great men tyrannise, landlords oppress,\njustice mercenary, lawyers vultures, physicians harpies, friends\nimportunate, tradesmen liars, honest men thieves, devout assassins, great\nmen to prostitute their wives, daughters, and themselves, middle sort to\nrepine, commons to mutiny, all to grudge, murmur, and complain. A great\ntemptation to all mischief, it compels some miserable wretches to\ncounterfeit several diseases, to dismember, make themselves blind, lame, to\nhave a more plausible cause to beg, and lose their limbs to recover their\npresent wants. Jodocus Damhoderius, a lawyer of Bruges, _praxi rerum\ncriminal. c. 112._ hath some notable examples of such counterfeit cranks,\nand every village almost will yield abundant testimonies amongst us; we\nhave dummerers, Abraham men, &c. And that which is the extent of misery, it\nenforceth them through anguish and wearisomeness of their lives, to make\naway themselves; they had rather be hanged, drowned, &c., than to live\nwithout means.\n\n[2285] \"In mare caetiferum, ne te premat aspera egestas,\n        Desili, et a celsis corrue Cerne jugis.\"\n\n       \"Much better 'tis to break thy neck,\n          Or drown thyself i' the sea,\n        Than suffer irksome poverty;\n          Go make thyself away.\"\n\nA Sybarite of old, as I find it registered in [2286]Athenaeus, supping in\nPhiditiis in Sparta, and observing their hard fare, said it was no marvel\nif the Lacedaemonians were valiant men; \"for his part, he would rather run\nupon a sword point (and so would any man in his wits,) than live with such\nbase diet, or lead so wretched a life.\" [2287]In Japonia, 'tis a common\nthing to stifle their children if they be poor, or to make an abortion,\nwhich Aristotle commends. In that civil commonwealth of China, [2288]the\nmother strangles her child, if she be not able to bring it up, and had\nrather lose, than sell it, or have it endure such misery as poor men do.\nArnobius, _lib. 7, adversus gentes_, [2289]Lactantius, _lib. 5. cap. 9._\nobjects as much to those ancient Greeks and Romans, \"they did expose their\nchildren to wild beasts, strangle, or knock out their brains against a\nstone, in such cases.\" If we may give credit to [2290]Munster, amongst us\nChristians in Lithuania, they voluntarily mancipate and sell themselves,\ntheir wives and children to rich men, to avoid hunger and beggary; [2291]\nmany make away themselves in this extremity. Apicius the Roman, when he\ncast up his accounts, and found but 100,000 crowns left, murdered himself\nfor fear he should be famished to death. P. Forestus, in his medicinal\nobservations, hath a memorable example of two brothers of Louvain that,\nbeing destitute of means, became both melancholy, and in a discontented\nhumour massacred themselves. Another of a merchant, learned, wise otherwise\nand discreet, but out of a deep apprehension he had of a loss at seas,\nwould not be persuaded but as [2292]Ventidius in the poet, he should die a\nbeggar. In a word, thus much I may conclude of poor men, that though they\nhave good [2293]parts they cannot show or make use of them: [2294]_ab\ninopia ad virtutem obsepta est via_, 'tis hard for a poor man to [2295]\nrise, _haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat res angusta domi_.\n[2296]\"The wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.\"\nEccles. vi. 19. His works are rejected, contemned, for the baseness and\nobscurity of the author, though laudable and good in themselves, they will\nnot likely take.\n\n       \"Nulla placere diu, neque vivere carmina possunt,\n        Quae scribuntur atquae potoribus.\"------\n\n\"No verses can please men or live long that are written by water-drinkers.\"\nPoor men cannot please, their actions, counsels, consultations, projects,\nare vilified in the world's esteem, _amittunt consilium in re_, which\nGnatho long since observed. [2297]_Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam nec soleas\nfecit_, a wise man never cobbled shoes; as he said of old, but how doth he\nprove it? I am sure we find it otherwise in our days, [2298] _pruinosis\nhorret facundia pannis_. Homer himself must beg if he want means, and as by\nreport sometimes he did [2299]\"go from door to door, and sing ballads, with\na company of boys about him.\" This common misery of theirs must needs\ndistract, make them discontent and melancholy, as ordinarily they are,\nwayward, peevish, like a weary traveller, for [2300] _Fames et mora bilem\nin nares conciunt_, still murmuring and repining: _Ob inopiam morosi sunt,\nquibus est male_, as Plutarch quotes out of Euripides, and that comical\npoet well seconds,\n\n[2301] \"Omnes quibus res sunt minus secundae, nescio quomodo\n        Suspitiosi, ad contumeliam omnia accipiunt magis,\n        Propter suam impotentiam se credunt negligi.\"\n\n\"If they be in adversity, they are more suspicious and apt to mistake: they\nthink themselves scorned by reason of their misery:\" and therefore many\ngenerous spirits in such cases withdraw themselves from all company, as\nthat comedian [2302]Terence is said to have done; when he perceived himself\nto be forsaken and poor, he voluntarily banished himself to Stymphalus, a\nbase town in Arcadia, and there miserably died.\n\n[2303]  ------\"ad summam inopiam redactus,\n        Itaque e conspectu omnium abiit Graeciae in terram ultimam.\"\n\nNeither is it without cause, for we see men commonly respected according to\ntheir means, ([2304]_an dives sit omnes quaerunt, nemo an bonus_) and\nvilified if they be in bad clothes. [2305]Philophaemen the orator was set\nto cut wood, because he was so homely attired, [2306]Terentius was placed\nat the lower end of Cecilius' table, because of his homely outside. [2307]\nDante, that famous Italian poet, by reason his clothes were but mean, could\nnot be admitted to sit down at a feast. Gnatho scorned his old familiar\nfriend because of his apparel, [2308]_Hominem video pannis, annisque\nobsitum, hic ego illum contempsi prae me_. King Persius overcome sent a\nletter to [2309]Paulus Aemilius, the Roman general; Persius P. Consuli. S.\nbut he scorned him any answer, _tacite exprobrans fortunam suam_ (saith\nmine author) upbraiding him with a present fortune. [2310]Carolus Pugnax,\nthat great duke of Burgundy, made H. Holland, late duke of Exeter, exiled,\nrun after his horse like a lackey, and would take no notice of him: [2311]\n'tis the common fashion of the world. So that such men as are poor may\njustly be discontent, melancholy, and complain of their present misery, and\nall may pray with [2312]Solomon, \"Give me, O Lord, neither riches nor\npoverty; feed me with food convenient for me.\"\n\nSUBSECT. VII.--_A heap of other Accidents causing Melancholy, Death of\nFriends, Losses, &c._\n\nIn this labyrinth of accidental causes, the farther I wander, the more\nintricate I find the passage, _multae ambages_, and new causes as so many\nby-paths offer themselves to be discussed: to search out all, were an\nHerculean work, and fitter for Theseus: I will follow mine intended thread;\nand point only at some few of the chiefest.\n\n_Death of Friends_.] Amongst which, loss and death of friends may challenge\na first place, _multi tristantur_, as [2313]Vives well observes, _post\ndelicias, convivia, dies festos_, many are melancholy after a feast,\nholiday, merry meeting, or some pleasing sport, if they be solitary by\nchance, left alone to themselves, without employment, sport, or want their\nordinary companions, some at the departure of friends only whom they shall\nshortly see again, weep and howl, and look after them as a cow lows after\nher calf, or a child takes on that goes to school after holidays. _Ut me\nlevarat tuus adventus, sic discessus afflixit_, (which [2314]Tully writ to\nAtticus) thy coming was not so welcome to me, as thy departure was harsh.\nMontanus, _consil. 132._ makes mention of a country woman that parting with\nher friends and native place, became grievously melancholy for many years;\nand Trallianus of another, so caused for the absence of her husband: which\nis an ordinary passion amongst our good wives, if their husband tarry out a\nday longer than his appointed time, or break his hour, they take on\npresently with sighs and tears, he is either robbed, or dead, some\nmischance or other is surely befallen him, they cannot eat, drink, sleep,\nor be quiet in mind, till they see him again. If parting of friends,\nabsence alone can work such violent effects, what shall death do, when they\nmust eternally be separated, never in this world to meet again? This is so\ngrievous a torment for the time, that it takes away their appetite, desire\nof life, extinguisheth all delights, it causeth deep sighs and groans,\ntears, exclamations,\n\n        (O dulce germen matris, o sanguis meus,\n        Eheu tepentes, &c.--o flos tener.)[2315]\n\nhowling, roaring, many bitter pangs, [2316]_lamentis gemituque et faemineo\nululatu Tecta fremunt_) and by frequent meditation extends so far\nsometimes, [2317]\"they think they see their dead friends continually in\ntheir eyes,\" _observantes imagines_, as Conciliator confesseth he saw his\nmother's ghost presenting herself still before him. _Quod nimis miseri\nvolunt, hoc facile credunt_, still, still, still, that good father, that\ngood son, that good wife, that dear friend runs in their minds: _Totus\nanimus hac una cogitatione defixus est_, all the year long, as [2318]Pliny\ncomplains to Romanus, \"methinks I see Virginius, I hear Virginius, I talk\nwith Virginius,\" &c.\n\n[2319] \"Te sine, vae misero mihi, lilia nigra videntur,\n        Pallentesque rosae, nec dulce rubens hyacinthus,\n        Nullos nec myrtus, noc laurus spirat odores.\"\n\nThey that are most staid and patient, are so furiously carried headlong by\nthe passion of sorrow in this case, that brave discreet men otherwise,\noftentimes forget themselves, and weep like children many months together,\n[2320]_as if that they to water would_, and will not be comforted. They are\ngone, they are gone; what shall I do?\n\n       \"Abstulit atra dies et funere mersit acerbo,\n        Quis dabit in lachrymas fontem mihi? quis satis altos\n        Accendet gemitus, et acerbo verba dolori?\n        Exhaurit pietas oculos, et hiantia frangit\n        Pectora, nec plenos avido sinit edere questus,\n        Magna adeo jactura premit,\" &c.\n\n       \"Fountains of tears who gives, who lends me groans,\n        Deep sighs sufficient to express my moans?\n        Mine eyes are dry, my breast in pieces torn,\n        My loss so great, I cannot enough mourn.\"\n\nSo Stroza Filius, that elegant Italian poet, in his Epicedium, bewails his\nfather's death, he could moderate his passions in other matters, (as he\nconfesseth) but not in this, lie yields wholly to sorrow,\n\n       \"Nunc fateor do terga malis, mens illa fatiscit,\n        Indomitus quondam vigor et constantia mentis.\"\n\nHow doth [2321]Quintilian complain for the loss of his son, to despair\nalmost: Cardan lament his only child in his book _de libris propriis_, and\nelsewhere in many of his tracts, [2322]St. Ambrose his brother's death? _an\nego possum non cogitare de te, aut sine lachrymis cogitare? O amari dies, o\nflebiles noctes_, &c. \"Can I ever cease to think of thee, and to think with\nsorrow? O bitter days, O nights of sorrow,\" &c. Gregory Nazianzen, that\nnoble Pulcheria! _O decorem, &c. flos recens, pullulans_, &c. Alexander, a\nman of most invincible courage, after Hephestion's death, as Curtius\nrelates, _triduum jacuit ad moriendum obstinatus_, lay three days together\nupon the ground, obstinate, to die with him, and would neither eat, drink,\nnor sleep. The woman that communed with Esdras (_lib. 2. cap. 10._) when\nher son fell down dead. \"fled into the field, and would not return into the\ncity, but there resolved to remain, neither to eat nor drink, but mourn and\nfast until she died.\" \"Rachel wept for her children, and would not be\ncomforted because they were not.\" Matt. ii. 18. So did Adrian the emperor\nbewail his Antinous; Hercules, Hylas; Orpheus, Eurydice; David, Absalom; (O\nmy dear son Absalom) Austin his mother Monica, Niobe her children, insomuch\nthat the [2323]poets feigned her to be turned into a stone, as being\nstupefied through the extremity of grief. [2324]_Aegeas, signo lugubri\nfilii consternatus, in mare se praecipitatem dedit_, impatient of sorrow\nfor his son's death, drowned, himself. Our late physicians are full of such\nexamples. Montanus _consil. 242._ [2325]had a patient troubled with this\ninfirmity, by reason of her husband's death, many years together.\nTrincavellius, _l. 1. c. 14._ hath such another, almost in despair, after\nhis [2326]mother's departure, _ut se ferme praecipitatem daret_; and ready\nthrough distraction to make away himself: and in his Fifteenth counsel,\ntells a story of one fifty years of age, \"that grew desperate upon his\nmother's death;\" and cured by Fallopius, fell many years after into a\nrelapse, by the sudden death of a daughter which he had, and could never\nafter be recovered. The fury of this passion is so violent sometimes, that\nit daunts whole kingdoms and cities. Vespasian's death was pitifully\nlamented all over the Roman empire, _totus orbis lugebat_, saith Aurelius\nVictor. Alexander commanded the battlements of houses to be pulled down,\nmules and horses to have their manes shorn off, and many common soldiers to\nbe slain, to accompany his dear Hephestion's death; which is now practised\namongst the Tartars, when [2327]a great Cham dieth, ten or twelve thousand\nmust be slain, men and horses, all they meet; and among those the\n[2328]Pagan Indians, their wives and servants voluntarily die with them.\nLeo Decimus was so much bewailed in Rome after his departure, that as\nJovius gives out, [2329]_communis salus, publica hilaritas_, the common\nsafety of all good fellowship, peace, mirth, and plenty died with him,\n_tanquam eodem sepulchro cum Leone condita lugebantur_: for it was a golden\nage whilst he lived, [2330]but after his decease an iron season succeeded,\n_barbara vis et foeda vastitas, et dira malorum omnium incommoda_, wars,\nplagues, vastity, discontent. When Augustus Caesar died, saith Paterculus,\n_orbis ruinam timueramus_, we were all afraid, as if heaven had fallen upon\nour heads. [2331]Budaeus records, how that, at Lewis the Twelfth his death,\n_tam subita mutatio, ut qui prius digito coelum attingere videbantur, nunc\nhumi derepente serpere, sideratos esse diceres_, they that were erst in\nheaven, upon a sudden, as if they had been planet-strucken, lay grovelling\non the ground;\n\n[2332] \"Concussis cecidere animis, seu frondibus ingens\n        Sylva dolet lapsis\"------\n\nthey looked like cropped trees. [2333]At Nancy in Lorraine, when Claudia\nValesia, Henry the Second French king's sister, and the duke's wife\ndeceased, the temples for forty days were all shut up, no prayers nor\nmasses, but in that room where she was. The senators all seen in black,\n\"and for a twelvemonth's space throughout the city, they were forbid to\nsing or dance.\"\n\n[2334] \"Non ulli pastos illis egre diebus\n        Frigida (Daphne) boves ad flumina, nulla nec amnem\n        Libavit quadrupes, nec graminis attigit herbam.\"\n\n       \"The swains forgot their sheep, nor near the brink\n        Of running waters brought their herds to drink;\n        The thirsty cattle, of themselves, abstained\n        From water, and their grassy fare disdain'd.\"\n\nHow were we affected here in England for our Titus, _deliciae, humani\ngeneris_, Prince Henry's immature death, as if all our dearest friends'\nlives had exhaled with his? [2335]Scanderbeg's death was not so much\nlamented in Epirus. In a word, as [2336]he saith of Edward the First at the\nnews of Edward of Caernarvon his son's birth, _immortaliter gavisus_, he\nwas immortally glad, may we say on the contrary of friends' deaths,\n_immortaliter gementes_, we are diverse of us as so many turtles, eternally\ndejected with it.\n\nThere is another sorrow, which arises from the loss of temporal goods and\nfortunes, which equally afflicts, and may go hand in hand with the\npreceding; loss of time, loss of honour, office, of good name, of labour,\nfrustrate hopes, will much torment; but in my judgment, there is no torture\nlike unto it, or that sooner procureth this malady and mischief:\n\n[2337] \"Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veris:\"\n\n       \"Lost money is bewailed with grief sincere.\"\n\nit wrings true tears from our eyes, many sighs, much sorrow from our\nhearts, and often causes habitual melancholy itself, Guianerius _tract. 15.\n5._ repeats this for an especial cause: [2338]\"Loss of friends, and loss of\ngoods, make many men melancholy, as I have often seen by continual\nmeditation of such things.\" The same causes Arnoldus Villanovanus\ninculcates, _Breviar. l. 1. c. 18._ _ex rerum amissione, damno, amicorum\nmorte_, &c. Want alone will make a man mad, to be _Sans argent_ will cause\na deep and grievous melancholy. Many persons are affected like [2339]\nIrishmen in this behalf, who if they have a good scimitar, had rather have\na blow on their arm, than their weapon hurt: they will sooner lose their\nlife, than their goods: and the grief that cometh hence, continueth long\n(saith [2340]Plater) \"and out of many dispositions, procureth an habit.\"\n[2341]Montanus and Frisemelica cured a young man of 22 years of age, that\nso became melancholy, _ab amissam pecuniam_, for a sum of money which he\nhad unhappily lost. Sckenkius hath such another story of one melancholy,\nbecause he overshot himself, and spent his stock in unnecessary building.\n[2342]Roger that rich bishop of Salisbury, _exutus opibus et castris a Rege\nStephano_, spoiled of his goods by king Stephen, _vi doloris absorptus,\natque in amentiam versus, indecentia fecit_, through grief ran mad, spoke\nand did he knew not what. Nothing so familiar, as for men in such cases,\nthrough anguish of mind to make away themselves. A poor fellow went to hang\nhimself, (which Ausonius hath elegantly expressed in a neat [2343]Epigram)\nbut finding by chance a pot of money, flung away the rope, and went merrily\nhome, but he that hid the gold, when he missed it, hanged himself with that\nrope which the other man had left, in a discontented humour.\n\n       \"At qui condiderat, postquam non reperit aurum,\n        Aptavit collo, quem reperit laqueum.\"\n\nSuch feral accidents can want and penury produce. Be it by suretyship,\nshipwreck, fire, spoil and pillage of soldiers, or what loss soever, it\nboots not, it will work the like effect, the same desolation in provinces\nand cities, as well as private persons. The Romans were miserably dejected\nafter the battle of Cannae, the men amazed for fear, the stupid women tore\ntheir hair and cried. The Hungarians, when their king Ladislaus and bravest\nsoldiers were slain by the Turks, _Luctus publicus_, &c. The Venetians when\ntheir forces were overcome by the French king Lewis, the French and Spanish\nkings, pope, emperor, all conspired against them, at Cambray, the French\nherald denounced open war in the senate: _Lauredane Venetorum dux_, &c.,\nand they had lost Padua, Brixia, Verona, Forum Julii, their territories in\nthe continent, and had now nothing left, but the city of Venice itself, _et\nurbi quoque ipsi_ (saith [2344]Bembus) _timendum putarent_, and the loss of\nthat was likewise to be feared, _tantus repente dolor omnes tenuit, ut\nnunquam, alias_, &c., they were pitifully plunged, never before in such\nlamentable distress. _Anno_ 1527, when Rome was sacked by Burbonius, the\ncommon soldiers made such spoil, that fair [2345]churches were turned to\nstables, old monuments and books made horse-litter, or burned like straw;\nrelics, costly pictures defaced; altars demolished, rich hangings, carpets,\n&c., trampled in the dirt. [2346]Their wives and loveliest daughters\nconstuprated by every base cullion, as Sejanus' daughter was by the hangman\nin public, before their fathers and husbands' faces. Noblemen's children,\nand of the wealthiest citizens, reserved for princes' beds, were prostitute\nto every common soldier, and kept for concubines; senators and cardinals\nthemselves dragged along the streets, and put to exquisite torments, to\nconfess where their money was hid; the rest, murdered on heaps, lay\nstinking in the streets; infants' brains dashed out before their mothers'\neyes. A lamentable sight it was to see so goodly a city so suddenly\ndefaced, rich citizens sent a begging to Venice, Naples, Ancona, &c., that\nerst lived in all manner of delights. [2347]\"Those proud palaces that even\nnow vaunted their tops up to heaven, were dejected as low as hell in an\ninstant.\" Whom will not such misery make discontent? Terence the poet\ndrowned himself (some say) for the loss of his comedies, which suffered\nshipwreck. When a poor man hath made many hungry meals, got together a\nsmall sum, which he loseth in an instant; a scholar spent many an hour's\nstudy to no purpose, his labours lost, &c., how should it otherwise be? I\nmay conclude with Gregory, _temporalium amor, quantum afficit, cum haeret\npossessio, tantum quum subtrahitur, urit dolor_; riches do not so much\nexhilarate us with their possession, as they torment us with their loss.\n\nNext to sorrow still I may annex such accidents as procure fear; for\nbesides those terrors which I have [2348]before touched, and many other\nfears (which are infinite) there is a superstitious fear, one of the three\ngreat causes of fear in Aristotle, commonly caused by prodigies and dismal\naccidents, which much trouble many of us, (_Nescio quid animus mihi\npraesagit mali._) As if a hare cross the way at our going forth, or a mouse\ngnaw our clothes: if they bleed three drops at nose, the salt falls towards\nthem, a black spot appear in their nails, &c., with many such, which Delrio\n_Tom. 2. l. 3. sect. 4._ Austin Niphus in his book _de Auguriis._ Polydore\nVirg. _l. 3. de Prodigas_. Sarisburiensis _Polycrat. l. 1. c. 13._ discuss\nat large. They are so much affected, that with the very strength of\nimagination, fear, and the devil's craft, [2349]\"they pull those\nmisfortunes they suspect, upon their own heads, and that which they fear,\nshall come upon them,\" as Solomon fortelleth, Prov. x. 24. and Isaiah\ndenounceth, lxvi. 4. which if [2350]\"they could neglect and contemn, would\nnot come to pass,\" _Eorum vires nostra resident opinione, ut morbi gravitas\n?grotantium cogitatione_, they are intended and remitted, as our opinion is\nfixed, more or less. _N. N. dat poenas_, saith [2351]Crato of such a one,\n_utinam non attraheret_: he is punished, and is the cause of it [2352]\nhimself:\n\n[2353]_Dum fata fugimus fata stulti incurrimus_, the thing that I feared,\nsaith Job, is fallen upon me.\n\nAs much we may say of them that are troubled with their fortunes; or ill\ndestinies foreseen: _multos angit praecientia malorum_: The foreknowledge\nof what shall come to pass, crucifies many men: foretold by astrologers, or\nwizards, _iratum ob coelum_, be it ill accident, or death itself: which\noften falls out by God's permission; _quia daemonem timent_ (saith\nChrysostom) _Deus ideo permittit accidere_. Severus, Adrian, Domitian, can\ntestify as much, of whose fear and suspicion, Sueton, Herodian, and the\nrest of those writers, tell strange stories in this behalf. [2354]Montanus\n_consil. 31._ hath one example of a young man, exceeding melancholy upon\nthis occasion. Such fears have still tormented mortal men in all ages, by\nreason of those lying oracles, and juggling priests. [2355]There was a\nfountain in Greece, near Ceres' temple in Achaia, where the event of such\ndiseases was to be known; \"A glass let down by a thread,\" &c. Amongst those\nCyanean rocks at the springs of Lycia, was the oracle of Thrixeus Apollo,\n\"where all fortunes were foretold, sickness, health, or what they would\nbesides:\" so common people have been always deluded with future events. At\nthis day, _Metus futurorum maxime torquet Sinas_, this foolish fear,\nmightily crucifies them in China: as [2356]Matthew Riccius the Jesuit\ninformeth us, in his commentaries of those countries, of all nations they\nare most superstitious, and much tormented in this kind, attributing so\nmuch to their divinators, _ut ipse metus fidem faciat_, that fear itself\nand conceit, cause it to [2357]fall out: If he foretell sickness such a\nday, that very time they will be sick, _vi metus afflicti in aegritudinem\ncadunt_; and many times die as it is foretold. A true saying, _Timor\nmortis, morte pejor_, the fear of death is worse than death itself, and the\nmemory of that sad hour, to some fortunate and rich men, \"is as bitter as\ngall,\" Eccl. xli. 1. _Inquietam nobis vitam facit mortis metus_, a worse\nplague cannot happen to a man, than to be so troubled in his mind; 'tis\n_triste divortium_, a heavy separation, to leave their goods, with so much\nlabour got, pleasures of the world, which they have so deliciously enjoyed,\nfriends and companions whom they so dearly loved, all at once. Axicchus the\nphilosopher was bold and courageous all his life, and gave good precepts\n_de contemnenda morte_, and against the vanity of the world, to others; but\nbeing now ready to die himself, he was mightily dejected, _hac luce\nprivabor? his orbabor bonis_? [2358]he lamented like a child, &c. And\nthough Socrates himself was there to comfort him, _ubi pristina virtutum\njactatio O Axioche_? \"where is all your boasted virtue now, my friend?\" yet\nhe was very timorous and impatient of death, much troubled in his mind,\n_Imbellis pavor et impatientia_, &c. \"O Clotho,\" Megapetus the tyrant in\nLucian exclaims, now ready to depart, \"let me live a while longer. [2359]I\nwill give thee a thousand talents of gold, and two boles besides, which I\ntook from Cleocritus, worth a hundred talents apiece.\" \"Woe's me,\" [2360]\nsaith another, \"what goodly manors shall I leave! what fertile fields! what\na fine house! what pretty children! how many servants! who shall gather my\ngrapes, my corn? Must I now die so well settled? Leave all, so richly and\nwell provided? Woe's me, what shall I do?\" [2361]_Animula vagula, blandula,\nqua nunc abibis in loca_?\n\nTo these tortures of fear and sorrow, may well be annexed curiosity, that\nirksome, that tyrannising care, _nimia solicitudo_, [2362]\"superfluous\nindustry about unprofitable things, and their qualities,\" as Thomas defines\nit: an itching humour or a kind of longing to see that which is not to be\nseen, to do that which ought not to be done, to know that [2363]secret\nwhich should not be known, to eat of the forbidden fruit. We commonly\nmolest and tire ourselves about things unfit and unnecessary, as Martha\ntroubled herself to little purpose. Be it in religion, humanity, magic,\nphilosophy, policy, any action or study, 'tis a needless trouble, a mere\ntorment. For what else is school divinity, how many doth it puzzle? what\nfruitless questions about the Trinity, resurrection, election,\npredestination, reprobation, hell-fire, &c., how many shall be saved,\ndamned? What else is all superstition, but an endless observation of idle\nceremonies, traditions? What is most of our philosophy but a labyrinth of\nopinions, idle questions, propositions, metaphysical terms? Socrates,\ntherefore, held all philosophers, cavillers, and mad men, _circa subtilia\nCavillatores pro insanis habuit, palam eos arguens_, saith [2364]Eusebius,\nbecause they commonly sought after such things _quae nec percipi a nobis\nneque comprehendi posset_, or put case they did understand, yet they were\naltogether unprofitable. For what matter is it for us to know how high the\nPleiades are, how far distant Perseus and Cassiopeia from us, how deep the\nsea, &c., we are neither wiser, as he follows it, nor modester, nor better,\nnor richer, nor stronger for the knowledge of it. _Quod supra nos nihil ad,\nnos_, I may say the same of those genethliacal studies, what is astrology\nbut vain elections, predictions? all magic, but a troublesome error, a\npernicious foppery? physic, but intricate rules and prescriptions?\nphilology, but vain criticisms? logic, needless sophisms? metaphysics\nthemselves, but intricate subtleties, and fruitless abstractions? alchemy,\nbut a bundle of errors? to what end are such great tomes? why do we spend\nso many years in their studies? Much better to know nothing at all, as\nthose barbarous Indians are wholly ignorant, than as some of us, to be so\nsore vexed about unprofitable toys: _stultus labor est ineptiarum_, to\nbuild a house without pins, make a rope of sand, to what end? _cui bono_?\nHe studies on, but as the boy told St. Austin, when I have laved the sea\ndry, thou shalt understand the mystery of the Trinity. He makes\nobservations, keeps times and seasons; and as [2365]Conradus the emperor\nwould not touch his new bride, till an astrologer had told him a masculine\nhour, but with what success? He travels into Europe, Africa, Asia,\nsearcheth every creek, sea, city, mountain, gulf, to what end? See one\npromontory (said Socrates of old), one mountain, one sea, one river, and\nsee all. An alchemist spends his fortunes to find out the philosopher's\nstone forsooth, cure all diseases, make men long-lived, victorious,\nfortunate, invisible, and beggars himself, misled by those seducing\nimpostors (which he shall never attain) to make gold; an antiquary consumes\nhis treasure and time to scrape up a company of old coins, statues, rules,\nedicts, manuscripts, &c., he must know what was done of old in Athens,\nRome, what lodging, diet, houses they had, and have all the present news at\nfirst, though never so remote, before all others, what projects, counsels,\nconsultations, &c., _quid Juno in aurem insusurret Jovi_, what's now\ndecreed in France, what in Italy: who was he, whence comes he, which way,\nwhither goes he, &c. Aristotle must find out the motion of Euripus; Pliny\nmust needs see Vesuvius, but how sped they? One loseth goods, another his\nlife; Pyrrhus will conquer Africa first, and then Asia: he will be a sole\nmonarch, a second immortal, a third rich; a fourth commands. [2366]\n_Turbine magno spes solicitae in urbibus errant_; we run, ride, take\nindefatigable pains, all up early, down late, striving to get that which we\nhad better be without, (Ardelion's busybodies as we are) it were much\nfitter for us to be quiet, sit still, and take our ease. His sole study is\nfor words, that they be--_Lepidae lexeis compostae, ut tesserulae omnes_,\nnot a syllable misplaced, to set out a stramineous subject: as thine is\nabout apparel, to follow the fashion, to be terse and polite, 'tis thy sole\nbusiness: both with like profit. His only delight is building, he spends\nhimself to get curious pictures, intricate models and plots, another is\nwholly ceremonious about titles, degrees, inscriptions: a third is\nover-solicitous about his diet, he must have such and such exquisite\nsauces, meat so dressed, so far-fetched, _peregrini aeris volucres_, so\ncooked, &c., something to provoke thirst, something anon to quench his\nthirst. Thus he redeems his appetite with extraordinary charge to his\npurse, is seldom pleased with any meal, whilst a trivial stomach useth all\nwith delight and is never offended. Another must have roses in winter,\n_alieni temporis flores_, snow-water in summer, fruits before they can be\nor are usually ripe, artificial gardens and fishponds on the tops of\nhouses, all things opposite to the vulgar sort, intricate and rare, or else\nthey are nothing worth. So busy, nice, curious wits, make that\ninsupportable in all vocations, trades, actions, employments, which to\nduller apprehensions is not offensive, earnestly seeking that which others\nso scornfully neglect. Thus through our foolish curiosity do we macerate\nourselves, tire our souls, and run headlong, through our indiscretion,\nperverse will, and want of government, into many needless cares, and\ntroubles, vain expenses, tedious journeys, painful hours; and when all is\ndone, _quorsum haec? cui bono_? to what end?\n\n[2367] \"Nescire velle quae Magister maximus\n        Docere non vult, erudita inscitia est.\"\n\n_Unfortunate marriage_.] Amongst these passions and irksome accidents,\nunfortunate marriage may be ranked: a condition of life appointed by God\nhimself in Paradise, an honourable and happy estate, and as great a\nfelicity as can befall a man in this world, [2368]if the parties can agree\nas they ought, and live as [2369]Seneca lived with his Paulina; but if they\nbe unequally matched, or at discord, a greater misery cannot be expected,\nto have a scold, a slut, a harlot, a fool, a fury or a fiend, there can be\nno such plague. Eccles. xxvi. 14, \"He that hath her is as if he held a\nscorpion,\" &c. xxvi. 25, \"a wicked wife makes a sorry countenance, a heavy\nheart, and he had rather dwell with a lion than keep house with such a\nwife.\" Her [2370]properties Jovianus Pontanus hath described at large,\n_Ant. dial. Tom. 2_, under the name of Euphorbia. Or if they be not equal\nin years, the like mischief happens. Cecilius in _Agellius lib. 2. cap.\n23_, complains much of an old wife, _dum ejus morti inhio, egomet mortuus\nvivo inter vivos_, whilst I gape after her death, I live a dead man amongst\nthe living, or if they dislike upon any occasion,\n\n[2371] \"Judge who that are unfortunately wed\n        What 'tis to come into a loathed bed.\"\n\nThe same inconvenience befalls women.\n\n[2372] \"At vos o duri miseram lugete parentes,\n        Si ferro aut laqueo laeva hac me exsolvere sorte\n        Sustineo:\"------\n\n       \"Hard hearted parents both lament my fate,\n        If self I kill or hang, to ease my state.\"\n\n[2373]A young gentlewoman in Basil was married, saith Felix Plater,\n_observat. l. 1_, to an ancient man against her will, whom she could not\naffect; she was continually melancholy, and pined away for grief; and\nthough her husband did all he could possibly to give her content, in a\ndiscontented humour at length she hanged herself. Many other stories he\nrelates in this kind. Thus men are plagued with women; they again with men,\nwhen they are of divers humours and conditions; he a spendthrift, she\nsparing; one honest, the other dishonest, &c. Parents many times disquiet\ntheir children, and they their parents. [2374]\"A foolish son is an\nheaviness to his mother.\" _Injusta noverca_: a stepmother often vexeth a\nwhole family, is matter of repentance, exercise of patience, fuel of\ndissension, which made Cato's son expostulate with his father, why he\nshould offer to marry his client Solinius' daughter, a young wench, _Cujus\ncausa novercam induceret_; what offence had he done, that he should marry\nagain?\n\nUnkind, unnatural friends, evil neighbours, bad servants, debts and\ndebates, &c., 'twas Chilon's sentence, _comes aeris alieni et litis est\nmiseria_, misery and usury do commonly together; suretyship is the bane of\nmany families, _Sponde, praesto noxa est_: \"he shall be sore vexed that is\nsurety for a stranger,\" Prov. xi. 15, \"and he that hateth suretyship is\nsure.\" Contention, brawling, lawsuits, falling out of neighbours and\nfriends.--_discordia demens_ (Virg. _Aen. 6_,) are equal to the first,\ngrieve many a man, and vex his soul. _Nihil sane miserabilius eorum\nmentibus_, (as [2375]Boter holds) \"nothing so miserable as such men, full\nof cares, griefs, anxieties, as if they were stabbed with a sharp sword,\nfear, suspicion, desperation, sorrow, are their ordinary companions.\" Our\nWelshmen are noted by some of their [2376]own writers, to consume one\nanother in this kind; but whosoever they are that use it, these are their\ncommon symptoms, especially if they be convict or overcome, [2377]cast in a\nsuit. Arius put out of a bishopric by Eustathius, turned heretic, and lived\nafter discontented all his life. [2378]Every repulse is of like nature;\n_heu quanta de spe decidi_! Disgrace, infamy, detraction, will almost\neffect as much, and that a long time after. Hipponax, a satirical poet, so\nvilified and lashed two painters in his iambics, _ut ambo laqueo se\nsuffocarent_, [2379]Pliny saith, both hanged themselves. All oppositions,\ndangers, perplexities, discontents, [2380]to live in any suspense, are of\nthe same rank: _potes hoc sub casu ducere somnos_? Who can be secure in\nsuch cases? Ill-bestowed benefits, ingratitude, unthankful friends, much\ndisquiet and molest some. Unkind speeches trouble as many; uncivil carriage\nor dogged answers, weak women above the rest, if they proceed from their\nsurly husbands, are as bitter as gall, and not to be digested. A glassman's\nwife in Basil became melancholy because her husband said he would marry\nagain if she died. \"No cut to unkindness,\" as the saying is, a frown and\nhard speech, ill respect, a browbeating, or bad look, especially to\ncourtiers, or such as attend upon great persons, is present death:\n_Ingenium vultu statque caditque suo_, they ebb and flow with their\nmasters' favours. Some persons are at their wits' ends, if by chance they\novershoot themselves, in their ordinary speeches, or actions, which may\nafter turn to their disadvantage or disgrace, or have any secret disclosed.\nRonseus _epist. miscel. 2_, reports of a gentlewoman 25 years old, that\nfalling foul with one of her gossips, was upbraided with a secret infirmity\n(no matter what) in public, and so much grieved with it, that she did\nthereupon _solitudines quaerere omnes ab se ablegare, ac tandem in\ngravissimam incidens melancholiam, contabescere_, forsake all company,\nquite moped, and in a melancholy humour pine away. Others are as much\ntortured to see themselves rejected, contemned, scorned, disabled, defamed,\ndetracted, undervalued, or [2381]\"left behind their fellows.\" Lucian brings\nin Aetamacles, a philosopher in his _Lapith. convivio_, much discontented\nthat he was not invited amongst the rest, expostulating the matter, in a\nlong epistle, with Aristenetus their host. Praetextatus, a robed gentleman\nin Plutarch, would not sit down at a feast, because he might not sit\nhighest, but went his ways all in a chafe. We see the common quarrelings,\nthat are ordinary with us, for taking of the wall, precedency, and the\nlike, which though toys in themselves, and things of no moment, yet they\ncause many distempers, much heart-burning amongst us. Nothing pierceth\ndeeper than a contempt or disgrace, [2382]especially if they be generous\nspirits, scarce anything affects them more than to be despised or vilified.\nCrato, _consil. 16, l. 2_, exemplifies it, and common experience confirms\nit. Of the same nature is oppression, Ecclus. 77, \"surely oppression makes\na man mad,\" loss of liberty, which made Brutus venture his life, Cato kill\nhimself, and [2383]Tully complain, _Omnem hilaritatem in perpetuum amisi_,\nmine heart's broken, I shall never look up, or be merry again, [2384]_haec\njactura intolerabilis_, to some parties 'tis a most intolerable loss.\nBanishment a great misery, as Tyrteus describes it in an epigram of his,\n\n       \"Nam miserum est patria amissa, laribusque vagari\n          Mendicum, et timida voce rogare cibos:\n        Omnibus invisus, quocunque accesserit exul\n          Semper erit, semper spretus egensque jacet,\" &c.\n\n       \"A miserable thing 'tis so to wander,\n          And like a beggar for to whine at door,\n        Contemn'd of all the world, an exile is,\n          Hated, rejected, needy still and poor.\"\n\nPolynices in his conference with Jocasta in [2385]Euripides, reckons up\nfive miseries of a banished man, the least of which alone were enough to\ndeject some pusillanimous creatures. Oftentimes a too great feeling of our\nown infirmities or imperfections of body or mind, will shrivel us up; as if\nwe be long sick:\n\n       \"O beata sanitas, te praesente, amaenum\n        Ver florit gratiis, absque te nemo beatus:\"\n\nO blessed health! \"thou art above all gold and treasure,\" Ecclus. xxx. 15,\nthe poor man's riches, the rich man's bliss, without thee there can be no\nhappiness: or visited with some loathsome disease, offensive to others, or\ntroublesome to ourselves; as a stinking breath, deformity of our limbs,\ncrookedness, loss of an eye, leg, hand, paleness, leanness, redness,\nbaldness, loss or want of hair, &c., _hic ubi fluere caepit, diros ictus\ncordi infert_, saith [2386]Synesius, he himself troubled not a little _ob\ncomae defectum_, the loss of hair alone, strikes a cruel stroke to the\nheart. Acco, an old woman, seeing by chance her face in a true glass (for\nshe used false flattering glasses belike at other times, as most\ngentlewomen do,) _animi dolore in insaniam delapsa est_, (Caelius\nRhodiginus _l. 17, c. 2_,) ran mad. [2387]Brotheus, the son of Vulcan,\nbecause he was ridiculous for his imperfections, flung himself into the\nfire. Lais of Corinth, now grown old, gave up her glass to Venus, for she\ncould hot abide to look upon it. [2388]_Qualis sum nolo, qualis eram\nnequeo_. Generally to fair nice pieces, old age and foul linen are two most\nodious things, a torment of torments, they may not abide the thought of it,\n\n[2389]  ------\"o deorum\n        Quisquis haec audis, utinam inter errem\n                Nuda leones,\"\n\n       \"Antequam turpis macies decentes\n        Occupet malas, teneraeque succus\n        Defluat praedae, speciosa quaerro\n                Pascere tigres.\"\n\n       \"Hear me, some gracious heavenly power,\n        Let lions dire this naked corse devour.\n        My cheeks ere hollow wrinkles seize.\n        Ere yet their rosy bloom decays:\n        While youth yet rolls its vital flood,\n        Let tigers friendly riot in my blood.\"\n\nTo be foul, ugly, and deformed, much better be buried alive. Some are fair\nbut barren, and that galls them. \"Hannah wept sore, did not eat, and was\ntroubled in spirit, and all for her barrenness,\" 1 Sam. 1. and Gen. 30.\nRachel said \"in the anguish of her soul, give me a child, or I shall die:\"\nanother hath too many: one was never married, and that's his hell, another\nis, and that's his plague. Some are troubled in that they are obscure;\nothers by being traduced, slandered, abused, disgraced, vilified, or any\nway injured: _minime miror eos_ (as he said) _qui insanire occipiunt ex\ninjuria_, I marvel not at all if offences make men mad. Seventeen\nparticular causes of anger and offence Aristotle reckons them up, which for\nbrevity's sake I must omit. No tidings troubles one; ill reports, rumours,\nbad tidings or news, hard hap, ill success, cast in a suit, vain hopes, or\nhope deferred, another: expectation, _adeo omnibus in rebus molesta semper\nest expectatio_, as [2390]Polybius observes; one is too eminent, another\ntoo base born, and that alone tortures him as much as the rest: one is out\nof action, company, employment; another overcome and tormented with worldly\ncares, and onerous business. But what [2391]tongue can suffice to speak of\nall?\n\nMany men catch this malady by eating certain meats, herbs, roots, at\nunawares; as henbane, nightshade, cicuta, mandrakes, &c. [2392]A company of\nyoung men at Agrigentum in Sicily, came into a tavern; where after they had\nfreely taken their liquor, whether it were the wine itself, or something\nmixed with it 'tis not yet known, [2393]but upon a sudden they began to be\nso troubled in their brains, and their phantasy so crazed, that they\nthought they were in a ship at sea, and now ready to be cast away by reason\nof a tempest. Wherefore to avoid shipwreck and present drowning, they flung\nall the goods in the house out at the windows into the street, or into the\nsea, as they supposed; thus they continued mad a pretty season, and being\nbrought before the magistrate to give an account of this their fact, they\ntold him (not yet recovered of their madness) that what was done they did\nfor fear of death, and to avoid imminent danger: the spectators were all\namazed at this their stupidity, and gazed on them still, whilst one of the\nancientest of the company, in a grave tone, excused himself to the\nmagistrate upon his knees, _O viri Tritones, ego in imo jacui_, I beseech\nyour deities, &c. for I was in the bottom of the ship all the while:\nanother besought them as so many sea gods to be good unto them, and if ever\nhe and his fellows came to land again, [2394]he would build an altar to\ntheir service. The magistrate could not sufficiently laugh at this their\nmadness, bid them sleep it out, and so went his ways. Many such accidents\nfrequently happen, upon these unknown occasions. Some are so caused by\nphilters, wandering in the sun, biting of a mad dog, a blow on the head,\nstinging with that kind of spider called tarantula, an ordinary thing if we\nmay believe Skeuck. _l. 6. de Venenis_, in Calabria and Apulia in Italy,\nCardan, _subtil. l. 9._ Scaliger _exercitat. 185._ Their symptoms are\nmerrily described by Jovianus Pontanus, _Ant. dial._ how they dance\naltogether, and are cured by music. [2395]Cardan speaks of certain stones,\nif they be carried about one, which will cause melancholy and madness; he\ncalls them unhappy, as an [2396]_adamant, selenites_, &c. \"which dry up the\nbody, increase cares, diminish sleep:\" Ctesias in Persicis, makes mention\nof a well in those parts, of which if any man drink, [2397]\"he is mad for\n24 hours.\" Some lose their wits by terrible objects (as elsewhere I have\nmore [2398]copiously dilated) and life itself many times, as Hippolitus\naffrighted by Neptune's seahorses, Athemas by Juno's furies: but these\nrelations are common in all writers.\n\n[2399] \"Hic alias poteram, et plures subnectere causas,\n        Sed jumenta vocant, et Sol inclinat, Eundum est.\"\n\n       \"Many such causes, much more could I say,\n        But that for provender my cattle stay:\n        The sun declines, and I must needs away.\"\n\nThese causes if they be considered, and come alone, I do easily yield, can\ndo little of themselves, seldom, or apart (an old oak is not felled at a\nblow) though many times they are all sufficient every one: yet if they\nconcur, as often they do, _vis unita fortior; et quae non obsunt singula,\nmulta nocent_, they may batter a strong constitution; as [2400]Austin said,\n\"many grains and small sands sink a ship, many small drops make a flood,\"\n&c., often reiterated; many dispositions produce an habit.\n\n\nMEMB. V.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Continent, inward, antecedent, next causes and how the body\nworks on the mind_.\n\nAs a purlieu hunter, I have hitherto beaten about the circuit of the forest\nof this microcosm, and followed only those outward adventitious causes. I\nwill now break into the inner rooms, and rip up the antecedent immediate\ncauses which are there to be found. For as the distraction of the mind,\namongst other outward causes and perturbations, alters the temperature of\nthe body, so the distraction and distemper of the body will cause a\ndistemperature of the soul, and 'tis hard to decide which of these two do\nmore harm to the other. Plato, Cyprian, and some others, as I have formerly\nsaid, lay the greatest fault upon the soul, excusing the body; others again\naccusing the body, excuse the soul, as a principal agent. Their reasons\nare, because [2401]\"the manners do follow the temperature of the body,\" as\nGalen proves in his book of that subject, Prosper Calenius _de Atra bile_,\nJason Pratensis _c. de Mania_, Lemnius _l. 4. c. 16._ and many others. And\nthat which Gualter hath commented, _hom. 10. in epist. Johannis_, is most\ntrue, concupiscence and originals in, inclinations, and bad humours, are\n[2402]radical in every one of us, causing these perturbations, affections,\nand several distempers, offering many times violence unto the soul. \"Every\nman is tempted by his own concupiscence (James i. 14), the spirit is\nwilling but the flesh is weak, and rebelleth against the spirit,\" as our\n[2403]apostle teacheth us: that methinks the soul hath the better plea\nagainst the body, which so forcibly inclines us, that we cannot resist,\n_Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantum sufficimus_. How the body being\nmaterial, worketh upon the immaterial soul, by mediation of humours and\nspirits, which participate of both, and ill-disposed organs, Cornelius\nAgrippa hath discoursed _lib. 1. de occult. Philos. cap. 63, 64, 65._\nLevinus Lemnius _lib. 1. de occult. nat. mir. cap. 12. et 16. et 21.\ninstitut. ad opt. vit_. Perkins _lib. 1. Cases of Cons. cap. 12._ T. Bright\n_c. 10, 11, 12._ \"in his treatise of melancholy,\" for as, [2404] anger,\nfear, sorrow, obtrectation, emulation, &c. _si mentis intimos recessus\noccuparint_, saith [2405]Lemnius, _corpori quoque infesta sunt, et illi\nteterrimos morbos inferunt_, cause grievous diseases in the body, so bodily\ndiseases affect the soul by consent. Now the chiefest causes proceed from\nthe [2406]heart, humours, spirits: as they are purer, or impurer, so is the\nmind, and equally suffers, as a lute out of tune, if one string or one\norgan be distempered, all the rest miscarry, [2407]_corpus onustum\nhesternis vitiis, animum quoque praegravat una_. The body is _domicilium\nanimae_, her house, abode, and stay; and as a torch gives a better light, a\nsweeter smell, according to the matter it is made of; so doth our soul\nperform all her actions, better or worse, as her organs are disposed; or as\nwine savours of the cask wherein it is kept; the soul receives a tincture\nfrom the body, through which it works. We see this in old men, children,\nEuropeans; Asians, hot and cold climes; sanguine are merry, melancholy sad,\nphlegmatic dull, by reason of abundance of those humours, and they cannot\nresist such passions which are inflicted by them. For in this infirmity of\nhuman nature, as Melancthon declares, the understanding is so tied to, and\ncaptivated by his inferior senses, that without their help he cannot\nexercise his functions, and the will being weakened, hath but a small power\nto restrain those outward parts, but suffers herself to be overruled by\nthem; that I must needs conclude with Lemnius, _spiritus et humores maximum\nnocumentum obtinent_, spirits and humours do most harm in [2408]troubling\nthe soul. How should a man choose but be choleric and angry, that hath his\nbody so clogged with abundance of gross humours? or melancholy, that is so\ninwardly disposed? That thence comes then this malady, madness, apoplexies,\nlethargies, &c. it may not be denied.\n\nNow this body of ours is most part distempered by some precedent diseases,\nwhich molest his inward organs and instruments, and so _per consequens_\ncause melancholy, according to the consent of the most approved physicians.\n[2409]\"This humour\" (as Avicenna _l. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. c. 18._ Arnoldus\n_breviar. l. 1. c. 18._ Jacchinus _comment. in 9 Rhasis, c. 15._ Montaltus,\n_c. 10._ Nicholas Piso _c. de Melan._ &c. suppose) \"is begotten by the\ndistemperature of some inward part, innate, or left after some\ninflammation, or else included in the blood after an [2410]ague, or some\nother malignant disease.\" This opinion of theirs concurs with that of\nGalen, _l. 3. c. 6. de locis affect_. Guianerius gives an instance in one\nso caused by a quartan ague, and Montanus _consil. 32._ in a young man of\ntwenty-eight years of age, so distempered after a quartan, which had\nmolested him five years together; Hildesheim _spicel. 2. de Mania_, relates\nof a Dutch baron, grievously tormented with melancholy after a long\n[2411]ague: Galen, _l. de atra bile, c. 4._ puts the plague a cause.\nBotaldus in his book _de lue vener. c. 2._ the French pox for a cause,\nothers, frenzy, epilepsy, apoplexy, because those diseases do often\ndegenerate into this. Of suppression of haemorrhoids, haemorrhagia, or\nbleeding at the nose, menstruous retentions, (although they deserve a\nlarger explication, as being the sole cause of a proper kind of melancholy,\nin more ancient maids, nuns and widows, handled apart by Rodericus a\nCastro, and Mercatus, as I have elsewhere signified,) or any other\nevacuation stopped, I have already spoken. Only this I will add, that this\nmelancholy which shall be caused by such infirmities, deserves to be pitied\nof all men, and to be respected with a more tender compassion, according to\nLaurentius, as coming from a more inevitable cause.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Distemperature of particular Parts, causes_.\n\nThere is almost no part of the body, which being distempered, doth not\ncause this malady, as the brain and his parts, heart, liver, spleen,\nstomach, matrix or womb, pylorus, mirach, mesentery, hypochondries,\nmesaraic veins; and in a word, saith [2412]Arculanus, \"there is no part\nwhich causeth not melancholy, either because it is adust, or doth not expel\nthe superfluity of the nutriment.\" Savanarola _Pract. major. rubric. 11.\nTract. 6. cap. 1._ is of the same opinion, that melancholy is engendered in\neach particular part, and [2413]Crato _in consil. 17. lib. 2._ Gordonius,\nwho is _instar omnium, lib. med. partic. 2. cap. 19._ confirms as much,\nputting the [2414]\"matter of melancholy, sometimes in the stomach, liver,\nheart, brain, spleen, mirach, hypochondries, when as the melancholy humour\nresides there, or the liver is not well cleansed from melancholy blood.\"\n\nThe brain is a familiar and frequent cause, too hot, or too cold, [2415]\n\"through adust blood so caused,\" as Mercurialis will have it, \"within or\nwithout the head,\" the brain itself being distempered. Those are most apt\nto this disease, [2416]\"that have a hot heart and moist brain,\" which\nMontaltus _cap. 11. de Melanch._ approves out of Halyabbas, Rhasis, and\nAvicenna. Mercurialis _consil. 11._ assigns the coldness of the brain a\ncause, and Salustius Salvianus _med. lect. l. 2. c. 1._ [2417]will have it\n\"arise from a cold and dry distemperature of the brain.\" Piso, Benedictus\nVictorius Faventinus, will have it proceed from a [2418]\"hot distemperature\nof the brain;\" and [2419]Montaltus _cap. 10._ from the brain's heat,\nscorching the blood. The brain is still distempered by himself, or by\nconsent: by himself or his proper affection, as Faventinus calls it,\n[2420]\"or by vapours which arise from the other parts, and fume up into the\nhead, altering the animal facilities.\"\n\nHildesheim _spicel. 2. de Mania_, thinks it may be caused from a [2421]\n\"distemperature of the heart; sometimes hot; sometimes cold.\" A hot liver,\nand a cold stomach, are put for usual causes of melancholy: Mercurialis\n_consil. 11. et consil. 6. consil. 86._ assigns a hot liver and cold\nstomach for ordinary causes. [2422]Monavius, in an epistle of his to Crato\nin Scoltzius, is of opinion, that hypochondriacal melancholy may proceed\nfrom a cold liver; the question is there discussed. Most agree that a hot\nliver is in fault; [2423]\"the liver is the shop of humours, and especially\ncauseth melancholy by his hot and dry distemperature.\" [2424]\"The stomach\nand mesaraic veins do often concur, by reason of their obstructions, and\nthence their heat cannot be avoided, and many times the matter is so adust\nand inflamed in those parts, that it degenerates into hypochondriacal\nmelancholy.\" Guianerius _c. 2. Tract. 15._ holds the mesaraic veins to be a\nsufficient [2425]cause alone. The spleen concurs to this malady, by all\ntheir consents, and suppression of haemorrhoids, _dum non expurget alter a\ncausa lien_, saith Montaltus, if it be [2426]\"too cold and dry, and do not\npurge the other parts as it ought,\" _consil. 23._ Montanus puts the [2427]\n\"spleen stopped\" for a great cause. [2428]Christophorus a Vega reports of\nhis knowledge, that he hath known melancholy caused from putrefied blood in\nthose seed-veins and womb; [2429]\"Arculanus, from that menstruous blood\nturned into melancholy, and seed too long detained (as I have already\ndeclared) by putrefaction or adustion.\"\n\nThe mesenterium, or midriff, diaphragma, is a cause which the [2430]Greeks\ncalled [Greek: phrenas]: because by his inflammation, the mind is much\ntroubled with convulsions and dotage. All these, most part, offend by\ninflammation, corrupting humours and spirits, in this non-natural\nmelancholy: for from these are engendered fuliginous and black spirits. And\nfor that reason [2431]Montaltus _cap. 10. de causis melan._ will have \"the\nefficient cause of melancholy to be hot and dry, not a cold and dry\ndistemperature, as some hold, from the heat of the brain, roasting the\nblood, immoderate heat of the liver and bowels, and inflammation of the\npylorus. And so much the rather, because that,\" as Galen holds, \"all spices\ninflame the blood, solitariness, waking, agues, study, meditation, all\nwhich heat: and therefore he concludes that this distemperature causing\nadventitious melancholy is not cold and dry, but hot and dry.\" But of this\nI have sufficiently treated in the matter of melancholy, and hold that this\nmay be true in non-natural melancholy, which produceth madness, but not in\nthat natural, which is more cold, and being immoderate, produceth a gentle\ndotage. [2432]Which opinion Geraldus de Solo maintains in his comment upon\nRhasis.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Causes of Head-Melancholy_.\n\nAfter a tedious discourse of the general causes of melancholy, I am now\nreturned at last to treat in brief of the three particular species, and\nsuch causes as properly appertain unto them. Although these causes\npromiscuously concur to each and every particular kind, and commonly\nproduce their effects in that part which is most ill-disposed, and least\nable to resist, and so cause all three species, yet many of them are proper\nto some one kind, and seldom found in the rest. As for example,\nhead-melancholy is commonly caused by a cold or hot distemperature of the\nbrain, according to Laurentius _cap. 5 de melan_. but as [2433]Hercules de\nSaxonia contends, from that agitation or distemperature of the animal\nspirits alone. Salust. Salvianus, before mentioned, _lib. 2. cap. 3. de re\nmed._ will have it proceed from cold: but that I take of natural\nmelancholy, such as are fools and dote: for as Galen writes _lib. 4. de\npuls. 8._ and Avicenna, [2434]\"a cold and moist brain is an inseparable\ncompanion of folly.\" But this adventitious melancholy which is here meant,\nis caused of a hot and dry distemperature, as [2435]Damascen the Arabian\n_lib. 3. cap. 22._ thinks, and most writers: Altomarus and Piso call it\n[2436]\"an innate burning intemperateness, turning blood and choler into\nmelancholy.\" Both these opinions may stand good, as Bruel maintains, and\nCapivaccius, _si cerebrum sit calidius_, [2437]\"if the brain be hot, the\nanimal spirits will be hot, and thence comes madness; if cold, folly.\"\nDavid Crusius _Theat. morb. Hermet. lib. 2. cap. 6. de atra bile_, grants\nmelancholy to be a disease of an inflamed brain, but cold notwithstanding\nof itself: _calida per accidens, frigida per se_, hot by accident only; I\nam of Capivaccius' mind for my part. Now this humour, according to\nSalvianus, is sometimes in the substance of the brain, sometimes contained\nin the membranes and tunicles that cover the brain, sometimes in the\npassages of the ventricles of the brain, or veins of those ventricles. It\nfollows many times [2438]\"frenzy, long diseases, agues, long abode in hot\nplaces, or under the sun, a blow on the head,\" as Rhasis informeth us: Piso\nadds solitariness, waking, inflammations of the head, proceeding most part\n[2439]from much use of spices, hot wines, hot meats: all which Montanus\nreckons up _consil. 22._ for a melancholy Jew; and Heurnius repeats _cap.\n12. de Mania_: hot baths, garlic, onions, saith Guianerius, bad air,\ncorrupt, much [2440]waking, &c., retention of seed or abundance, stopping\nof haemorrhagia, the midriff misaffected; and according to Trallianus _l.\n1. 16._ immoderate cares, troubles, griefs, discontent, study, meditation,\nand, in a word, the abuse of all those six non-natural things. Hercules de\nSaxonia, _cap. 16. lib. 1._ will have it caused from a [2441]cautery, or\nboil dried up, or an issue. Amatus Lusitanus _cent. 2. cura. 67._ gives\ninstance in a fellow that had a hole in his arm, [2442]\"after that was\nhealed, ran mad, and when the wound was open, he was cured again.\"\nTrincavellius _consil. 13. lib. 1._ hath an example of a melancholy man so\ncaused by overmuch continuance in the sun, frequent use of venery, and\nimmoderate exercise: and in his _cons. 49. lib. 3._ from a [2443]headpiece\noverheated, which caused head-melancholy. Prosper Calenus brings in\nCardinal Caesius for a pattern of such as are so melancholy by long study;\nbut examples are infinite.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Causes of Hypochondriacal, or Windy Melancholy_.\n\nIn repeating of these causes, I must _crambem bis coctam apponere_, say\nthat again which I have formerly said, in applying them to their proper\nspecies. Hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy, is that which the Arabians\ncall mirachial, and is in my judgment the most grievous and frequent,\nthough Bruel and Laurentius make it least dangerous, and not so hard to be\nknown or cured. His causes are inward or outward. Inward from divers parts\nor organs, as midriff, spleen, stomach, liver, pylorus, womb, diaphragma,\nmesaraic veins, stopping of issues, &c. Montaltus _cap. 15._ out of Galen\nrecites, [2444]\"heat and obstruction of those mesaraic veins, as an\nimmediate cause, by which means the passage of the chilus to the liver is\ndetained, stopped or corrupted, and turned into rumbling and wind.\"\nMontanus, _consil. 233_, hath an evident demonstration, Trincavelius\nanother, _lib. 1, cap. 1_, and Plater a third, _observat. lib. 1_, for a\ndoctor of the law visited with this infirmity, from the said obstruction\nand heat of these mesaraic veins, and bowels; _quoniam inter ventriculum et\njecur venae effervescunt_, the veins are inflamed about the liver and\nstomach. Sometimes those other parts are together misaffected; and concur\nto the production of this malady: a hot liver and cold stomach, or cold\nbelly: look for instances in Hollerius, Victor Trincavelius, _consil. 35,\nl. 3_, Hildesheim _Spicel. 2, fol. 132_, Solenander _consil. 9, pro cive\nLugdunensi_, Montanus _consil. 229_, for the Earl of Montfort in Germany,\n1549, and Frisimelica in the 233 consultation of the said Montanus. I.\nCaesar Claudinus gives instance of a cold stomach and over-hot liver,\nalmost in every consultation, _con. 89_, for a certain count; and _con.\n106_, for a Polonian baron, by reason of heat the blood is inflamed, and\ngross vapours sent to the heart and brain. Mercurialis subscribes to them,\n_cons. 89_, [2445]\"the stomach being misaffected,\" which he calls the king\nof the belly, because if he be distempered, all the rest suffer with him,\nas being deprived of their nutriment, or fed with bad nourishment, by means\nof which come crudities, obstructions, wind, rumbling, griping, &c.\nHercules de Saxonia, besides heat, will have the weakness of the liver and\nhis obstruction a cause, _facultatem debilem jecinoris_, which he calls the\nmineral of melancholy. Laurentius assigns this reason, because the liver\nover-hot draws the meat undigested out of the stomach, and burneth the\nhumours. Montanus, _cons. 244_, proves that sometimes a cold liver may be a\ncause. Laurentius _c. 12_, Trincavelius _lib. 12, consil._, and Gualter\nBruel, seems to lay the greatest fault upon the spleen, that doth not his\nduty in purging the liver as he ought, being too great, or too little, in\ndrawing too much blood sometimes to it, and not expelling it, as P.\nCnemiandrus in a [2446]consultation of his noted _tumorem lienis_, he names\nit, and the fountain of melancholy. Diocles supposed the ground of this\nkind of melancholy to proceed from the inflammation of the pylorus, which\nis the nether mouth of the ventricle. Others assign the mesenterium or\nmidriff distempered by heat, the womb misaffected, stopping of\nhaemorrhoids, with many such. All which Laurentius, _cap. 12_, reduceth to\nthree, mesentery, liver, and spleen, from whence he denominates hepatic,\nsplenetic, and mesaraic melancholy. Outward causes, are bad diet, care,\ngriefs, discontents, and in a word all those six non-natural things, as\nMontanus found by his experience, _consil. 244._ Solenander _consil. 9_,\nfor a citizen of Lyons, in France, gives his reader to understand, that he\nknew this mischief procured by a medicine of cantharides, which an\nunskilful physician ministered his patient to drink _ad venerem\nexcitandam_. But most commonly fear, grief, and some sudden commotion, or\nperturbation of the mind, begin it, in such bodies especially as are\nill-disposed. Melancthon, _tract. 14, cap. 2, de anima_, will have it as\ncommon to men, as the mother to women, upon some grievous trouble, dislike,\npassion, or discontent. For as Camerarius records in his life, Melancthon\nhimself was much troubled with it, and therefore could speak out of\nexperience. Montanus, _consil. 22, pro delirante Judaeo_, confirms it,\n[2447]grievous symptoms of the mind brought him to it. Randolotius relates\nof himself, that being one day very intent to write out a physician's\nnotes, molested by an occasion, he fell into a hypochondriacal fit, to\navoid which he drank the decoction of wormwood, and was freed.\n[2448]Melancthon \"(being the disease is so troublesome and frequent) holds\nit a most necessary and profitable study, for every man to know the\naccidents of it, and a dangerous thing to be ignorant,\" and would therefore\nhave all men in some sort to understand the causes, symptoms, and cures of\nit.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Causes of Melancholy from the whole Body_.\n\nAs before, the cause of this kind of melancholy is inward or outward.\nInward, [2449]\"when the liver is apt to engender such a humour, or the\nspleen weak by nature, and not able to discharge his office.\" A melancholy\ntemperature, retention of haemorrhoids, monthly issues, bleeding at nose,\nlong diseases, agues, and all those six non-natural things increase it. But\nespecially [2450]bad diet, as Piso thinks, pulse, salt meat, shellfish,\ncheese, black wine, &c. Mercurialis out of Averroes and Avicenna condemns\nall herbs: Galen, _lib. 3, de loc. affect. cap. 7_, especially cabbage. So\nlikewise fear, sorrow, discontents, &c., but of these before. And thus in\nbrief you have had the general and particular causes of melancholy.\n\nNow go and brag of thy present happiness, whosoever thou art, brag of thy\ntemperature, of thy good parts, insult, triumph, and boast; thou seest in\nwhat a brittle state thou art, how soon thou mayst be dejected, how many\nseveral ways, by bad diet, bad air, a small loss, a little sorrow or\ndiscontent, an ague, &c.; how many sudden accidents may procure thy ruin,\nwhat a small tenure of happiness thou hast in this life, how weak and silly\na creature thou art. \"Humble thyself, therefore, under the mighty hand of\nGod,\" 1 Peter, v. 6, know thyself, acknowledge thy present misery, and make\nright use of it. _Qui stat videat ne cadat._ Thou dost now flourish, and\nhast _bona animi, corporis, et fortunae_, goods of body, mind, and fortune,\n_nescis quid serus secum vesper ferat_, thou knowest not what storms and\ntempests the late evening may bring with it. Be not secure then, \"be sober\nand watch,\" [2451]_fortunam reverenter habe_, if fortunate and rich; if\nsick and poor, moderate thyself. I have said.\n\n\nSECT. III. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Symptoms, or Signs of Melancholy in the Body_.\n\nParrhasius, a painter of Athens, amongst those Olynthian captives Philip of\nMacedon brought home to sell, [2452]bought one very old man; and when he\nhad him at Athens, put him to extreme torture and torment, the better by\nhis example to express the pains and passions of his Prometheus, whom he\nwas then about to paint. I need not be so barbarous, inhuman, curious, or\ncruel, for this purpose to torture any poor melancholy man, their symptoms\nare plain, obvious and familiar, there needs no such accurate observation\nor far-fetched object, they delineate themselves, they voluntarily betray\nthemselves, they are too frequent in all places, I meet them still as I go,\nthey cannot conceal it, their grievances are too well known, I need not\nseek far to describe them.\n\nSymptoms therefore are either [2453]universal or particular, saith\nGordonius, _lib. med. cap. 19, part. 2_, to persons, to species; \"some\nsigns are secret, some manifest, some in the body, some in the mind, and\ndiversely vary, according to the inward or outward causes,\" Capivaccius: or\nfrom stars, according to Jovianus Pontanus, _de reb. caelest. lib. 10, cap.\n13_, and celestial influences, or from the humours diversely mixed,\nFicinus, _lib. 1, cap. 4, de sanit. tuenda_: as they are hot, cold,\nnatural, unnatural, intended, or remitted, so will Aetius have\n_melancholica deliria multiformia_, diversity of melancholy signs.\nLaurentius ascribes them to their several temperatures, delights, natures,\ninclinations, continuance of time, as they are simple or mixed with other\ndiseases, as the causes are divers, so must the signs be, almost infinite,\nAltomarus _cap. 7, art. med._ And as wine produceth divers effects, or that\nherb Tortocolla in [2454]Laurentius, \"which makes some laugh, some weep,\nsome sleep, some dance, some sing, some howl, some drink,\" &c. so doth this\nour melancholy humour work several signs in several parties.\n\nBut to confine them, these general symptoms may be reduced to those of the\nbody or the mind. Those usual signs appearing in the bodies of such as are\nmelancholy, be these cold and dry, or they are hot and dry, as the humour\nis more or less adust. From [2455]these first qualities arise many other\nsecond, as that of [2456]colour, black, swarthy, pale, ruddy, &c., some are\n_impense rubri_, as Montaltus _cap. 16_ observes out of Galen, _lib. 3, de\nlocis affectis_, very red and high coloured. Hippocrates in his book\n[2457]_de insania et melan._ reckons up these signs, that they are [2458]\n\"lean, withered, hollow-eyed, look old, wrinkled, harsh, much troubled with\nwind, and a griping in their bellies, or bellyache, belch often, dry\nbellies and hard, dejected looks, flaggy beards, singing of the ears,\nvertigo, light-headed, little or no sleep, and that interrupt, terrible and\nfearful dreams,\" [2459]_Anna soror, quae, me suspensam insomnia terrent_?\nThe same symptoms are repeated by Melanelius in his book of melancholy\ncollected out of Galen, Ruffus, Aetius, by Rhasis, Gordonius, and all the\njuniors, [2460]\"continual, sharp, and stinking belchings, as if their meat\nin their stomachs were putrefied, or that they had eaten fish, dry bellies,\nabsurd and interrupt dreams, and many fantastical visions about their eyes,\nvertiginous, apt to tremble, and prone to venery.\" [2461]Some add\npalpitation of the heart, cold sweat, as usual symptoms, and a leaping in\nmany parts of the body, _saltum in multis corporis partibus_, a kind of\nitching, saith Laurentius, on the superficies of the skin, like a\nflea-biting sometimes. [2462]Montaltus _cap. 21._ puts fixed eyes and much\ntwinkling of their eyes for a sign, and so doth Avicenna, _oculos habentes\npalpitantes, trauli, vehementer rubicundi_, &c., _lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4.\ncap. 18._ They stut most part, which he took out of Hippocrates' aphorisms.\n[2463]Rhasis makes \"headache and a binding heaviness for a principal\ntoken, much leaping of wind about the skin, as well as stutting, or\ntripping in speech, &c., hollow eyes, gross veins, and broad lips.\" To some\ntoo, if they be far gone, mimical gestures are too familiar, laughing,\ngrinning, fleering, murmuring, talking to themselves, with strange mouths\nand faces, inarticulate voices, exclamations, &c. And although they be\ncommonly lean, hirsute, uncheerful in countenance, withered, and not so\npleasant to behold, by reason of those continual fears, griefs, and\nvexations, dull, heavy, lazy, restless, unapt to go about any business; yet\ntheir memories are most part good, they have happy wits, and excellent\napprehensions. Their hot and dry brains make them they cannot sleep,\n_Ingentes habent et crebras vigilias_ (Arteus) mighty and often watchings,\nsometimes waking for a month, a year together. [2464]Hercules de Saxonia\nfaithfully averreth, that he hath heard his mother swear, she slept not for\nseven months together: Trincavelius, _Tom. 2. cons. 16._ speaks of one that\nwaked 50 days, and Skenkius hath examples of two years, and all without\noffence. In natural actions their appetite is greater than their\nconcoction, _multa appetunt pauca digerunt_ as Rhasis hath it, they covet\nto eat, but cannot digest. And although they [2465]\"do eat much, yet they\nare lean, ill-liking,\" saith Areteus, \"withered and hard, much troubled\nwith costiveness,\" crudities, oppilations, spitting, belching, &c. Their\npulse is rare and slow, except it be of the [2466]Carotides, which is very\nstrong; but that varies according to their intended passions or\nperturbations, as Struthius hath proved at large, _Spigmaticae. artis l. 4.\nc. 13._ To say truth, in such chronic diseases the pulse is not much to be\nrespected, there being so much superstition in it, as [2467]Crato notes,\nand so many differences in Galen, that he dares say they may not be\nobserved, or understood of any man.\n\nTheir urine is most part pale, and low coloured, _urina pauca acris,\nbiliosa_ (Areteus), not much in quantity; but this, in my judgment, is all\nout as uncertain as the other, varying so often according to several\npersons, habits, and other occasions not to be respected in chronic\ndiseases. [2468]\"Their melancholy excrements in some very much, in others\nlittle, as the spleen plays his part,\" and thence proceeds wind,\npalpitation of the heart, short breath, plenty of humidity in the stomach,\nheaviness of heart and heartache, and intolerable stupidity and dullness of\nspirits. Their excrements or stool hard, black to some and little. If the\nheart, brain, liver, spleen, be misaffected, as usually they are, many\ninconveniences proceed from them, many diseases accompany, as incubus,\n[2469]apoplexy, epilepsy, vertigo, those frequent wakings and terrible\ndreams, [2470]intempestive laughing, weeping, sighing, sobbing,\nbashfulness, blushing, trembling, sweating, swooning, &c. [2471]All their\nsenses are troubled, they think they see, hear, smell, and touch that which\nthey do not, as shall be proved in the following discourse.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Symptoms or Signs in the Mind_.\n\n_Fear_.] Arculanus _in 9. Rhasis ad Almansor. cap. 16._ will have these\nsymptoms to be infinite, as indeed they are, varying according to the\nparties, \"for scarce is there one of a thousand that dotes alike,\" [2472]\nLaurentius _c. 16._ Some few of greater note I will point at; and amongst\nthe rest, fear and sorrow, which as they are frequent causes, so if they\npersevere long, according to Hippocrates [2473]and Galen's aphorisms, they\nare most assured signs, inseparable companions, and characters of\nmelancholy; of present melancholy and habituated, saith Montaltus _cap.\n11._ and common to them all, as the said Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and\nall Neoterics hold. But as hounds many times run away with a false cry,\nnever perceiving themselves to be at a fault, so do they. For Diocles of\nold, (whom Galen confutes,) and amongst the juniors, [2474]Hercules de\nSaxonia, with Lod. Mercatus _cap. 17. l. 1. de melan._, takes just\nexceptions, at this aphorism of Hippocrates, 'tis not always true, or so\ngenerally to be understood, \"fear and sorrow are no common symptoms to all\nmelancholy; upon more serious consideration, I find some\" (saith he) \"that\nare not so at all. Some indeed are sad, and not fearful; some fearful and\nnot sad; some neither fearful nor sad; some both.\" Four kinds he excepts,\nfanatical persons, such as were Cassandra, Nanto, Nicostrata, Mopsus,\nProteus, the sibyls, whom [2475]Aristotle confesseth to have been deeply\nmelancholy. Baptista Porta seconds him, _Physiog. lib. 1, cap. 8_, they\nwere _atra bile perciti_: demoniacal persons, and such as speak strange\nlanguages, are of this rank: some poets, such as laugh always, and think\nthemselves kings, cardinals, &c., sanguine they are, pleasantly disposed\nmost part, and so continue. [2476]Baptista Portia confines fear and sorrow\nto them that are cold; but lovers, Sibyls, enthusiasts, he wholly excludes.\nSo that I think I may truly conclude, they are not always sad and fearful,\nbut usually so: and that [2477]without a cause, _timent de non timendis_,\n(Gordonius,) _quaeque momenti non sunt_, \"although not all alike\" (saith\nAltomarus), [2478]\"yet all likely fear,\" [2479]\"some with an extraordinary\nand a mighty fear,\" Areteus. [2480]\"Many fear death, and yet in a contrary\nhumour, make away themselves,\" Galen, _lib. 3. de loc. affec. cap. 7._ Some\nare afraid that heaven will fall on their heads: some they are damned, or\nshall be. [2481]\"They are troubled with scruples of consciences,\ndistrusting God's mercies, think they shall go certainly to hell, the devil\nwill have them, and make great lamentation,\" Jason Pratensis. Fear of\ndevils, death, that they shall be so sick, of some such or such disease,\nready to tremble at every object, they shall die themselves forthwith, or\nthat some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly dead; imminent\ndanger, loss, disgrace still torment others, &c.; that they are all glass,\nand therefore will suffer no man to come near them: that they are all cork,\nas light as feathers; others as heavy as lead; some are afraid their heads\nwill fall off their shoulders, that they have frogs in their bellies, &c.\n[2482]Montanus _consil. 23_, speaks of one \"that durst not walk alone from\nhome, for fear he should swoon or die.\" A second [2483]\"fears every man he\nmeets will rob him, quarrel with him, or kill him.\" A third dares not\nventure to walk alone, for fear he should meet the devil, a thief, be sick;\nfears all old women as witches, and every black dog or cat he sees he\nsuspecteth to be a devil, every person comes near him is maleficiated,\nevery creature, all intend to hurt him, seek his ruin; another dares not go\nover a bridge, come near a pool, rock, steep hill, lie in a chamber where\ncross beams are, for fear he be tempted to hang, drown, or precipitate\nhimself. If he be in a silent auditory, as at a sermon, he is afraid he\nshall speak aloud at unawares, something indecent, unfit to be said. If he\nbe locked in a close room, he is afraid of being stifled for want of air,\nand still carries biscuit, aquavitae, or some strong waters about him, for\nfear of deliquiums, or being sick; or if he be in a throng, middle of a\nchurch, multitude, where he may not well get out, though he sit at ease, he\nis so misaffected. He will freely promise, undertake any business\nbeforehand, but when it comes to be performed, he dare not adventure, but\nfears an infinite number of dangers, disasters, &c. Some are [2484] \"afraid\nto be burned, or that the [2485]ground will sink under them, or\n[2486]swallow them quick, or that the king will call them in question for\nsome fact they never did (Rhasis _cont._) and that they shall surely be\nexecuted.\" The terror of such a death troubles them, and they fear as much\nand are equally tormented in mind, [2487]\"as they that have committed a\nmurder, and are pensive without a cause, as if they were now presently to\nbe put to death.\" Plater, _cap. 3. de mentis alienat._ They are afraid of\nsome loss, danger, that they shall surely lose their lives, goods, and all\nthey have, but why they know not. Trincavelius, _consil. 13. lib. 1._ had a\npatient that would needs make away himself, for fear of being hanged, and\ncould not be persuaded for three years together, but that he had killed a\nman. Plater, _observat. lib. 1._ hath two other examples of such as feared\nto be executed without a cause. If they come in a place where a robbery,\ntheft, or any such offence hath been done, they presently fear they are\nsuspected, and many times betray themselves without a cause. Lewis XI., the\nFrench king, suspected every man a traitor that came about him, durst trust\nno officer. _Alii formidolosi omnium, alii quorundam_ (Fracatorius _lib. 2.\nde Intellect._) [2488]\"some fear all alike, some certain men, and cannot\nendure their companies, are sick in them, or if they be from home.\" Some\nsuspect [2489]treason still, others \"are afraid of their [2490]dearest and\nnearest friends.\" (_Melanelius e Galeno, Ruffo, Aetio_,) and dare not be\nalone in the dark for fear of hobgoblins and devils: he suspects everything\nhe hears or sees to be a devil, or enchanted, and imagineth a thousand\nchimeras and visions, which to his thinking he certainly sees, bugbears,\ntalks with black men, ghosts, goblins, &c., [2491]_Omnes se terrent aurae,\nsonus excitat omnis._ Another through bashfulness, suspicion, and\ntimorousness will not be seen abroad, [2492]\"loves darkness as life, and\ncannot endure the light,\" or to sit in lightsome places, his hat still in\nhis eyes, he will neither see nor be seen by his goodwill, Hippocrates,\n_lib. de Insania et Melancholia_. He dare not come in company for fear he\nshould be misused, disgraced, overshoot himself in gesture or speeches, or\nbe sick; he thinks every man observes him, aims at him, derides him, owes\nhim malice. Most part [2493]\"they are afraid they are bewitched, possessed,\nor poisoned by their enemies, and sometimes they suspect their nearest\nfriends: he thinks something speaks or talks within him, and he belcheth of\nthe poison.\" Christophorus a Vega, _lib. 2. cap. 1._ had a patient so\ntroubled, that by no persuasion or physic he could be reclaimed. Some are\nafraid that they shall have every fearful disease they see others have,\nhear of, or read, and dare not therefore hear or read of any such subject,\nno not of melancholy itself, lest by applying to themselves that which they\nhear or read, they should aggravate and increase it. If they see one\npossessed, bewitched, an epileptic paroxysm, a man shaking with the palsy,\nor giddy-headed, reeling or standing in a dangerous place, &c., for many\ndays after it runs in their minds, they are afraid they shall be so too,\nthey are in like danger, as Perkins _c. 12. sc. 12._ well observes in his\nCases of Conscience and many times by violence of imagination they produce\nit. They cannot endure to see any terrible object, as a monster, a man\nexecuted, a carcase, hear the devil named, or any tragical relation seen,\nbut they quake for fear, _Hecatas somniare sibi videntur_ (Lucian) they\ndream of hobgoblins, and may not get it out of their minds a long time\nafter: they apply (as I have said) all they hear, see, read, to themselves;\nas [2494]Felix Plater notes of some young physicians, that study to cure\ndiseases, catch them themselves, will be sick, and appropriate all symptoms\nthey find related of others, to their own persons. And therefore (_quod\niterum moneo, licet nauseam paret lectori, malo decem potius verba, decies\nrepetita licet abundare, quam unum desiderari_) I would advise him that is\nactually melancholy not to read this tract of Symptoms, lest he disquiet or\nmake himself for a time worse, and more melancholy than he was before.\nGenerally of them all take this, _de inanibus semper conqueruntur et\ntiment_, saith Aretius; they complain of toys, and fear [2495]without a\ncause, and still think their melancholy to be most grievous, none so bad as\nthey are, though it be nothing in respect, yet never any man sure was so\ntroubled, or in this sort. As really tormented and perplexed, in as great\nan agony for toys and trifles (such things as they will after laugh at\nthemselves) as if they were most material and essential matters indeed,\nworthy to be feared, and will not be satisfied. Pacify them for one, they\nare instantly troubled with some other fear; always afraid of something\nwhich they foolishly imagine or conceive to themselves, which never\nperadventure was, never can be, never likely will be; troubled in mind upon\nevery small occasion, unquiet, still complaining, grieving, vexing,\nsuspecting, grudging, discontent, and cannot be freed so long as melancholy\ncontinues. Or if their minds be more quiet for the present, and they free\nfrom foreign fears, outward accidents, yet their bodies are out of tune,\nthey suspect some part or other to be amiss, now their head aches, heart,\nstomach, spleen, &c. is misaffected, they shall surely have this or that\ndisease; still troubled in body, mind, or both, and through wind, corrupt\nfantasy, some accidental distemper, continually molested. Yet for all this,\nas [2496]Jacchinus notes, \"in all other things they are wise, staid,\ndiscreet, and do nothing unbeseeming their dignity, person, or place, this\nfoolish, ridiculous, and childish fear excepted;\" which so much, so\ncontinually tortures and crucifies their souls, like a barking dog that\nalways bawls, but seldom bites, this fear ever molesteth, and so long as\nmelancholy lasteth, cannot be avoided.\n\nSorrow is that other character, and inseparable companion, as individual as\nSaint Cosmus and Damian, _fidus Achates_, as all writers witness, a common\nsymptom, a continual, and still without any evident cause, [2497]_moerent\nomnes, et si roges eos reddere causam, non possunt_: grieving still, but\nwhy they cannot tell: _Agelasti, moesti, cogitabundi_, they look as if they\nhad newly come forth of Trophonius' den. And though they laugh many times,\nand seem to be extraordinary merry (as they will by fits), yet extreme\nlumpish again in an instant, dull and heavy, _semel et simul_, merry and\nsad, but most part sad: [2498]_Si qua placent, abeunt; inimica tenacius\nhaerent_: sorrow sticks by them still continually, gnawing as the vulture\ndid [2499]Titius' bowels, and they cannot avoid it. No sooner are their\neyes open, but after terrible and troublesome dreams their heavy hearts\nbegin to sigh: they are still fretting, chafing, sighing, grieving,\ncomplaining, finding faults, repining, grudging, weeping,\n_Heautontimorumenoi_, vexing themselves, [2500]disquieted in mind, with\nrestless, unquiet thoughts, discontent, either for their own, other men's\nor public affairs, such as concern them not; things past, present, or to\ncome, the remembrance of some disgrace, loss, injury, abuses, &c. troubles\nthem now being idle afresh, as if it were new done; they are afflicted\notherwise for some danger, loss, want, shame, misery, that will certainly\ncome, as they suspect and mistrust. Lugubris Ate frowns upon them, insomuch\nthat Areteus well calls it _angorem animi_, a vexation of the mind, a\nperpetual agony. They can hardly be pleased, or eased, though in other\nmen's opinion most happy, go, tarry, run, ride, [2501]--_post equitem sedet\natra cura_: they cannot avoid this feral plague, let them come in what\ncompany they will, [2502]_haeret leteri lethalis arundo_, as to a deer that\nis struck, whether he run, go, rest with the herd, or alone, this grief\nremains: irresolution, inconstancy, vanity of mind, their fear, torture,\ncare, jealousy, suspicion, &c., continues, and they cannot be relieved. So\n[2503]he complained in the poet,\n\n       \"Domum revertor moestus, atque animo fere\n        Perturbato, atque incerto prae aegritudine,\n        Assido, accurrunt servi: succos detrahunt,\n        Video alios festinare, lectos sternere,\n        Coenam apparare, pro se quisque sedulo\n        Faciebant, quo illam mihi lenirent miseriam.\"\n\n\"He came home sorrowful, and troubled in his mind, his servants did all\nthey possibly could to please him; one pulled off his socks, another made\nready his bed, a third his supper, all did their utmost endeavours to ease\nhis grief, and exhilarate his person, he was profoundly melancholy, he had\nlost his son, _illud angebat_, that was his Cordolium, his pain, his agony\nwhich could not be removed.\"\n\n_Taedium vitae._] Hence it proceeds many times, that they are weary of\ntheir lives, and feral thoughts to offer violence to their own persons come\ninto their minds, _taedium vitae_ is a common symptom, _tarda fluunt,\ningrataque tempora_, they are soon tired with all things; they will now\ntarry, now be gone; now in bed they will rise, now up, then go to bed, now\npleased, then again displeased; now they like, by and by dislike all, weary\nof all, _sequitur nunc vivendi, nunc moriendi cupido_, saith Aurelianus,\n_lib. 1. cap. 6_, but most part [2504]_vitam damnant_, discontent,\ndisquieted, perplexed upon every light, or no occasion, object: often\ntempted, I say, to make away themselves: [2505]_Vivere nolunt, mori\nnesciunt_: they cannot die, they will not live: they complain, weep,\nlament, and think they lead a most miserable life, never was any man so\nbad, or so before, every poor man they see is most fortunate in respect of\nthem, every beggar that comes to the door is happier than they are, they\ncould be contented to change lives with them, especially if they be alone,\nidle, and parted from their ordinary company, molested, displeased, or\nprovoked: grief, fear, agony, discontent, wearisomeness, laziness,\nsuspicion, or some such passion forcibly seizeth on them. Yet by and by\nwhen they come in company again, which they like, or be pleased, _suam\nsententiam rursus damnant, et vitae solatia delectantur_, as Octavius\nHoratianus observes, _lib. 2. cap. 5_, they condemn their former mislike,\nand are well pleased to live. And so they continue, till with some fresh\ndiscontent they be molested again, and then they are weary of their lives,\nweary of all, they will die, and show rather a necessity to live, than a\ndesire. Claudius the emperor, as [2506] Sueton describes him, had a spice\nof this disease, for when he was tormented with the pain of his stomach, he\nhad a conceit to make away himself. Julius Caesar Claudinus, _consil. 84._\nhad a Polonian to his patient, so affected, that through [2507]fear and\nsorrow, with which he was still disquieted, hated his own life, wished for\ndeath every moment, and to be freed of his misery. Mercurialis another, and\nanother that was often minded to despatch himself, and so continued for\nmany years.\n\n_Suspicion, Jealousy._] Suspicion, and jealousy, are general symptoms: they\nare commonly distrustful, apt to mistake, and amplify, _facile\nirascibiles_, [2508]testy, pettish, peevish, and ready to snarl upon every\n[2509]small occasion, _cum amicissimis_, and without a cause, _datum vel\nnon datum_, it will be _scandalum acceptum_. If they speak in jest, he\ntakes it in good earnest. If they be not saluted, invited, consulted with,\ncalled to counsel, &c., or that any respect, small compliment, or ceremony\nbe omitted, they think themselves neglected, and contemned; for a time that\ntortures them. If two talk together, discourse, whisper, jest, or tell a\ntale in general, he thinks presently they mean him, applies all to himself,\n_de se putat omnia dici_. Or if they talk with him, he is ready to\nmisconstrue every word they speak, and interpret it to the worst; he cannot\nendure any man to look steadily on him, speak to him almost, laugh, jest,\nor be familiar, or hem, or point, cough, or spit, or make a noise\nsometimes, &c. [2510]He thinks they laugh or point at him, or do it in\ndisgrace of him, circumvent him, contemn him; every man looks at him, he is\npale, red, sweats for fear and anger, lest somebody should observe him. He\nworks upon it, and long after this false conceit of an abuse troubles him.\nMontanus _consil. 22._ gives instance in a melancholy Jew, that was\n_Iracundior Adria_, so waspish and suspicious, _tam facile iratus_, that no\nman could tell how to carry himself in his company.\n\n_Inconstancy._] Inconstant they are in all their actions, vertiginous,\nrestless, unapt to resolve of any business, they will and will not,\npersuaded to and fro upon every small occasion, or word spoken: and yet if\nonce they be resolved, obstinate, hard to be reconciled. If they abhor,\ndislike, or distaste, once settled, though to the better by odds, by no\ncounsel, or persuasion, to be removed. Yet in most things wavering,\nirresolute, unable to deliberate, through fear, _faciunt, et mox facti\npoenitent (Areteus) avari, et paulo post prodigi_. Now prodigal, and then\ncovetous, they do, and by-and-by repent them of that which they have done,\nso that both ways they are troubled, whether they do or do not, want or\nhave, hit or miss, disquieted of all hands, soon weary, and still seeking\nchange, restless, I say, fickle, fugitive, they may not abide to tarry in\none place long.\n\n[2511] \"Romae rus optans, absentem rusticus urbem\n        Tollit ad astra\"------\n\nno company long, or to persevere in any action or business.\n\n[2512] \"Et similis regum pueris, pappare minutum\n        Poscit, et iratus mammae lallare recusat,\"\n\neftsoons pleased, and anon displeased, as a man that's bitten with fleas,\nor that cannot sleep turns to and fro in his bed, their restless minds are\ntossed and vary, they have no patience to read out a book, to play out a\ngame or two, walk a mile, sit an hour, &c., erected and dejected in an\ninstant; animated to undertake, and upon a word spoken again discouraged.\n\n_Passionate._] Extreme passionate, _Quicquid volunt valde volunt_; and what\nthey desire, they do most furiously seek; anxious ever, and very\nsolicitous, distrustful, and timorous, envious, malicious, profuse one\nwhile, sparing another, but most part covetous, muttering, repining,\ndiscontent, and still complaining, grudging, peevish, _injuriarum tenaces_,\nprone to revenge, soon troubled, and most violent in all their\nimaginations, not affable in speech, or apt to vulgar compliment, but\nsurly, dull, sad, austere; _cogitabundi_ still, very intent, and as [2513]\nAlbertus Durer paints melancholy, like a sad woman leaning on her arm with\nfixed looks, neglected habit, &c., held therefore by some proud, soft,\nsottish, or half-mad, as the Abderites esteemed of Democritus: and yet of a\ndeep reach, excellent apprehension, judicious, wise, and witty: for I am of\nthat [2514]nobleman's mind, \"Melancholy advanceth men's conceits, more than\nany humour whatsoever,\" improves their meditations more than any strong\ndrink or sack. They are of profound judgment in some things, although in\nothers _non recte judicant inquieti_, saith Fracastorius, _lib. 2. de\nIntell_. And as Arculanus, _c. 16. in 9. Rhasis_, terms it, _Judicium\nplerumque perversum, corrupti, cum judicant honesta inhonesta, et amicitiam\nhabent pro inimicitia_: they count honesty dishonesty, friends as enemies,\nthey will abuse their best friends, and dare not offend their enemies.\nCowards most part _et ad inferendam injuriam timidissimi_, saith Cardan,\n_lib. 8. cap. 4. de rerum varietate_: loath to offend, and if they chance\nto overshoot themselves in word or deed: or any small business or\ncircumstance be omitted, forgotten, they are miserably tormented, and frame\na thousand dangers and inconveniences to themselves, _ex musca elephantem_,\nif once they conceit it: overjoyed with every good rumour, tale, or\nprosperous event, transported beyond themselves: with every small cross\nagain, bad news, misconceived injury, loss, danger, afflicted beyond\nmeasure, in great agony, perplexed, dejected, astonished, impatient,\nutterly undone: fearful, suspicious of all. Yet again, many of them\ndesperate harebrains, rash, careless, fit to be assassinates, as being void\nof all fear and sorrow, according to [2515]Hercules de Saxonia, \"Most\naudacious, and such as dare walk alone in the night, through deserts and\ndangerous places, fearing none.\"\n\n_Amorous_.] \"They are prone to love,\" and [2516]easy to be taken; _Propensi\nad amorem et excandescentiam_ (Montaltus _cap. 21._) quickly enamoured, and\ndote upon all, love one dearly, till they see another, and then dote on\nher, _Et hanc, et hanc, et illam, et omnes_, the present moves most, and\nthe last commonly they love best. Yet some again _Anterotes_, cannot endure\nthe sight of a woman, abhor the sex, as that same melancholy [2517]duke of\nMuscovy, that was instantly sick, if he came but in sight of them; and that\n[2518]Anchorite, that fell into a cold palsy, when a woman was brought\nbefore him.\n\n_Humorous_.] Humorous they are beyond all measure, sometimes profusely\nlaughing, extraordinarily merry, and then again weeping without a cause,\n(which is familiar with many gentlewomen,) groaning, sighing, pensive, sad,\nalmost distracted, _multa absurda fingunt, et a ratione aliena_ (saith\n[2519]Frambesarius), they feign many absurdities, vain, void of reason: one\nsupposeth himself to be a dog, cock, bear, horse, glass, butter, &c. He is\na giant, a dwarf, as strong as an hundred men, a lord, duke, prince, &c.\nAnd if he be told he hath a stinking breath, a great nose, that he is sick,\nor inclined to such or such a disease, he believes it eftsoons, and\nperadventure by force of imagination will work it out. Many of them are\nimmovable, and fixed in their conceits, others vary upon every object,\nheard or seen. If they see a stage-play, they run upon that a week after;\nif they hear music, or see dancing, they have nought but bagpipes in their\nbrain: if they see a combat, they are all for arms. [2520]If abused, an\nabuse troubles them long after; if crossed, that cross, &c. Restless in\ntheir thoughts and actions, continually meditating, _Velut aegri somnia,\nvanae finguntur species_; more like dreams, than men awake, they fain a\ncompany of antic, fantastical conceits, they have most frivolous thoughts,\nimpossible to be effected; and sometimes think verily they hear and see\npresent before their eyes such phantasms or goblins, they fear, suspect, or\nconceive, they still talk with, and follow them. In fine, _cogitationes\nsomniantibus similes, id vigilant, quod alii somniant cogitabundi_, still,\nsaith Avicenna, they wake, as others dream, and such for the most part are\ntheir imaginations and conceits, [2521]absurd, vain, foolish toys, yet they\nare [2522]most curious and solicitous, continual, _et supra modum_, Rhasis\n_cont. lib. 1. cap. 9._ _praemeditantur de aliqua re_. As serious in a toy,\nas if it were a most necessary business, of great moment, importance, and\nstill, still, still thinking of it: _saeviunt in se_, macerating\nthemselves. Though they do talk with you, and seem to be otherwise\nemployed, and to your thinking very intent and busy, still that toy runs in\ntheir mind, that fear, that suspicion, that abuse, that jealousy, that\nagony, that vexation, that cross, that castle in the air, that crotchet,\nthat whimsy, that fiction, that pleasant waking dream, whatsoever it is.\n_Nec interrogant_ (saith [2523]Fracastorius) _nec interrogatis recte\nrespondent_. They do not much heed what you say, their mind is on another\nmatter; ask what you will, they do not attend, or much intend that business\nthey are about, but forget themselves what they are saying, doing, or\nshould otherwise say or do, whither they are going, distracted with their\nown melancholy thoughts. One laughs upon a sudden, another smiles to\nhimself, a third frowns, calls, his lips go still, he acts with his hand as\nhe walks, &c. 'Tis proper to all melancholy men, saith [2524]Mercurialis,\n_con. 11._ \"What conceit they have once entertained, to be most intent,\nviolent, and continually about it.\" _Invitas occurrit_, do what they may\nthey cannot be rid of it, against their wills they must think of it a\nthousand times over, _Perpetuo molestantur nec oblivisci possunt_, they are\ncontinually troubled with it, in company, out of company; at meat, at\nexercise, at all times and places, [2525]_non desinunt ea, quae, minime\nvolunt, cogitare_, if it be offensive especially, they cannot forget it,\nthey may not rest or sleep for it, but still tormenting themselves,\n_Sysiphi saxum volvunt sibi ipsis_, as [2526]Brunner observes, _Perpetua\ncalamitas et miserabile flagellum_.\n\n_Bashfulness._] [2527]Crato, [2528]Laurentius, and Fernelius, put\nbashfulness for an ordinary symptom, _sabrusticus pudor_, or _vitiosus\npudor_, is a thing which much haunts and torments them. If they have been\nmisused, derided, disgraced, chidden, &c., or by any perturbation of mind,\nmisaffected, it so far troubles them, that they become quite moped many\ntimes, and so disheartened, dejected, they dare not come abroad, into\nstrange companies especially, or manage their ordinary affairs, so\nchildish, timorous, and bashful, they can look no man in the face; some are\nmore disquieted in this kind, some less, longer some, others shorter, by\nfits, &c., though some on the other side (according to [2529]Fracastorius)\nbe _inverecundi et pertinaces_, impudent and peevish. But most part they\nare very shamefaced, and that makes them with Pet. Blesensis, Christopher\nUrswick, and many such, to refuse honours, offices, and preferments, which\nsometimes fall into their mouths, they cannot speak, or put forth\nthemselves as others can, _timor hos, pudor impedit illos_, timorousness\nand bashfulness hinder their proceedings, they are contented with their\npresent estate, unwilling to undertake any office, and therefore never\nlikely to rise. For that cause they seldom visit their friends, except some\nfamiliars: _pauciloqui_, of few words, and oftentimes wholly silent. [2530]\nFrambeserius, a Frenchman, had two such patients, _omnino taciturnos_,\ntheir friends could not get them to speak: Rodericus a Fonseca _consult.\ntom. 2. 85. consil._ gives instance in a young man, of twenty-seven years\nof age, that was frequently silent, bashful, moped, solitary, that would\nnot eat his meat, or sleep, and yet again by fits apt to be angry, &c.\n\n_Solitariness._] Most part they are, as Plater notes, _desides, taciturni,\naegre impulsi, nec nisi coacti procedunt_, &c. they will scarce be\ncompelled to do that which concerns them, though it be for their good, so\ndiffident, so dull, of small or no compliment, unsociable, hard to be\nacquainted with, especially of strangers; they had rather write their minds\nthan speak, and above all things love solitariness. _Ob voluptatem, an ob\ntimorem soli sunt_? Are they so solitary for pleasure (one asks,) or pain?\nfor both; yet I rather think for fear and sorrow, &c.\n\n[2531] \"Hinc metuunt cupiuntque, dolent fugiuntque, nec auras\n        Respiciunt, clausi tenebris, et carcere caeco.\"\n\n       \"Hence 'tis they grieve and fear, avoiding light,\n        And shut themselves in prison dark from sight.\"\n\nAs Bellerophon in [2532]Homer,\n\n       \"Qui miser in sylvis moerens errabat opacis,\n        Ipse suum cor edens, hominum vestigia vitans.\"\n\n       \"That wandered in the woods sad all alone,\n        Forsaking men's society, making great moan.\"\n\nThey delight in floods and waters, desert places, to walk alone in\norchards, gardens, private walks, back lanes, averse from company, as\nDiogenes in his tub, or Timon Misanthropus [2533], they abhor all\ncompanions at last, even their nearest acquaintances and most familiar\nfriends, for they have a conceit (I say) every man observes them, will\nderide, laugh to scorn, or misuse them, confining themselves therefore\nwholly to their private houses or chambers, _fugiunt homines sine causa_\n(saith Rhasis) _et odio habent_, _cont. l. 1. c. 9._ they will diet\nthemselves, feed and live alone. It was one of the chiefest reasons why the\ncitizens of Abdera suspected Democritus to be melancholy and mad, because\nthat, as Hippocrates related in his Epistle to Philopaemenes, [2534]\"he\nforsook the city, lived in groves and hollow trees, upon a green bank by a\nbrook side, or confluence of waters all day long, and all night.\" _Quae\nquidem_ (saith he) _plurimum atra bile vexatis et melancholicis eveniunt,\ndeserta frequentant, hominumque congressum aversantur_; [2535]which is an\nordinary thing with melancholy men. The Egyptians therefore in their\nhieroglyphics expressed a melancholy man by a hare sitting in her form, as\nbeing a most timorous and solitary creature, Pierius _Hieroglyph. l. 12._\nBut this, and all precedent symptoms, are more or less apparent, as the\nhumour is intended or remitted, hardly perceived in some, or not all, most\nmanifest in others. Childish in some, terrible in others; to be derided in\none, pitied or admired in another; to him by fits, to a second continuate:\nand howsoever these symptoms be common and incident to all persons, yet\nthey are the more remarkable, frequent, furious and violent in melancholy\nmen. To speak in a word, there is nothing so vain, absurd, ridiculous,\nextravagant, impossible, incredible, so monstrous a chimera, so prodigious\nand strange, [2536]such as painters and poets durst not attempt, which they\nwill not really fear, feign, suspect and imagine unto themselves: and that\nwhich [2537]Lod. Vives said in a jest of a silly country fellow, that\nkilled his ass for drinking up the moon, _ut lunam mundo redderet_, you may\ntruly say of them in earnest; they will act, conceive all extremes,\ncontrarieties, and contradictions, and that in infinite varieties.\n_Melancholici plane incredibilia sibi persuadent, ut vix omnibus saeculis\nduo reperti sint, qui idem imaginati sint (Erastus de Lamiis)_, scarce two\nof two thousand that concur in the same symptoms. The tower of Babel never\nyielded such confusion of tongues, as the chaos of melancholy doth variety\nof symptoms. There is in all melancholy _similitudo dissimilis_, like men's\nfaces, a disagreeing likeness still; and as in a river we swim in the same\nplace, though not in the same numerical water; as the same instrument\naffords several lessons, so the same disease yields diversity of symptoms.\nWhich howsoever they be diverse, intricate, and hard to be confined, I will\nadventure yet in such a vast confusion and generality to bring them into\nsome order; and so descend to particulars.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Particular Symptoms from the influence of Stars, parts of\nthe Body, and Humours_.\n\nSome men have peculiar symptoms, according to their temperament and crisis,\nwhich they had from the stars and those celestial influences, variety of\nwits and dispositions, as Anthony Zara contends, _Anat. ingen. sect. 1.\nmemb. 11, 12, 13, 14._ _plurimum irritant influentiae, caelestes, unde\ncientur animi aegritudines et morbi corporum_. [2538]One saith, diverse\ndiseases of the body and mind proceed from their influences, [2539]as I\nhave already proved out of Ptolemy, Pontanus, Lemnius, Cardan, and others\nas they are principal significators of manners, diseases, mutually\nirradiated, or lords of the geniture, &c. Ptolomeus in his centiloquy,\nHermes, or whosoever else the author of that tract, attributes all these\nsymptoms, which are in melancholy men, to celestial influences: which\nopinion Mercurialis _de affect, lib. cap. 10._ rejects; but, as I say,\n[2540]Jovianus Pontanus and others stiffly defend. That some are solitary,\ndull, heavy, churlish; some again blithe, buxom, light, and merry, they\nascribe wholly to the stars. As if Saturn be predominant in his nativity,\nand cause melancholy in his temperature, then [2541]he shall be very\naustere, sullen, churlish, black of colour, profound in his cogitations,\nfull of cares, miseries, and discontents, sad and fearful, always silent,\nsolitary, still delighting in husbandry, in woods, orchards, gardens,\nrivers, ponds, pools, dark walks and close: _Cogitationes sunt velle\naedificare, velle arbores plantare, agros colere_, &c. To catch birds,\nfishes, &c. still contriving and musing of such matters. If Jupiter\ndomineers, they are more ambitious, still meditating of kingdoms,\nmagistracies, offices, honours, or that they are princes, potentates, and\nhow they would carry themselves, &c. If Mars, they are all for wars, brave\ncombats, monomachies, testy, choleric, harebrain, rash, furious, and\nviolent in their actions. They will feign themselves victors, commanders,\nare passionate and satirical in their speeches, great braggers, ruddy of\ncolour. And though they be poor in show, vile and base, yet like Telephus\nand Peleus in the [2542]poet, _Ampullas jactant et sesquipedalia verba_,\n\"forget their swelling and gigantic words,\" their mouths are full of\nmyriads, and tetrarchs at their tongues' end. If the sun, they will be\nlords, emperors, in conceit at least, and monarchs, give offices, honours,\n&c. If Venus, they are still courting of their mistresses, and most apt to\nlove, amorously given, they seem to hear music, plays, see fine pictures,\ndancers, merriments, and the like. Ever in love, and dote on all they see.\nMercurialists are solitary, much in contemplation, subtle, poets,\nphilosophers, and musing most part about such matters. If the moon have a\nhand, they are all for peregrinations, sea voyages, much affected with\ntravels, to discourse, read, meditate of such things; wandering in their\nthoughts, diverse, much delighting in waters, to fish, fowl, &c.\n\nBut the most immediate symptoms proceed from the temperature itself, and\nthe organical parts, as head, liver, spleen, mesaraic veins, heart, womb,\nstomach, &c., and most especially from distemperature of spirits (which, as\n[2543]Hercules de Saxonia contends, are wholly immaterial), or from the\nfour humours in those seats, whether they be hot or cold, natural,\nunnatural, innate or adventitious, intended or remitted, simple or mixed,\ntheir diverse mixtures, and several adustions, combinations, which may be\nas diversely varied, as those [2544]four first qualities in [2545] Clavius,\nand produce as many several symptoms and monstrous fictions as wine doth\neffect, which as Andreas Bachius observes, _lib. 3. de vino, cap. 20._ are\ninfinite. Of greater note be these.\n\nIf it be natural melancholy, as Lod. Mercatus, _lib. 1. cap. 17. de melan._\nT. Bright. _c. 16._ hath largely described, either of the spleen, or of the\nveins, faulty by excess of quantity, or thickness of substance, it is a\ncold and dry humour, as Montanus affirms, _consil. 26_ the parties are sad,\ntimorous and fearful. Prosper Calenus, in his book _de atra bile_, will\nhave them to be more stupid than ordinary, cold, heavy, solitary, sluggish.\n_Si multam atram bilem et frigidam habent_. Hercules de Saxonia, _c. 19. l.\n7._ [2546]\"holds these that are naturally melancholy, to be of a leaden\ncolour or black,\" and so doth Guianerius, _c. 3. tract. 15._ and such as\nthink themselves dead many times, or that they see, talk with black men,\ndead men, spirits and goblins frequently, if it be in excess. These\nsymptoms vary according to the mixture of those four humours adust, which\nis unnatural melancholy. For as Trallianus hath written, _cap. 16. l. 7._\n[2547]\"There is not one cause of this melancholy, nor one humour which\nbegets, but divers diversely intermixed, from whence proceeds this variety\nof symptoms:\" and those varying again as they are hot or cold. [2548]\"Cold\nmelancholy\" (saith Benedic. Vittorius Faventinus _pract. mag._) \"is a cause\nof dotage, and more mild symptoms, if hot or more adust, of more violent\npassions, and furies.\" Fracastorius, _l. 2. de intellect._ will have us to\nconsider well of it, [2549]\"with what kind of melancholy every one is\ntroubled, for it much avails to know it; one is enraged by fervent heat,\nanother is possessed by sad and cold; one is fearful, shamefaced; the other\nimpudent and bold;\" as Ajax, _Arma rapit superosque furens inpraelia\nposcit_: quite mad or tending to madness. _Nunc hos, nunc impetit illos._\nBellerophon on the other side, _solis errat male sanus in agris_, wanders\nalone in the woods; one despairs, weeps, and is weary of his life, another\nlaughs, &c. All which variety is produced from the several degrees of heat\nand cold, which [2550]Hercules de Saxonia will have wholly proceed from the\ndistemperature of spirits alone, animal especially, and those immaterial,\nthe next and immediate causes of melancholy, as they are hot, cold, dry,\nmoist, and from their agitation proceeds that diversity of symptoms, which\nhe reckons up, in the [2551]thirteenth chap. of his Tract of Melancholy,\nand that largely through every part. Others will have them come from the\ndiverse adustion of the four humours, which in this unnatural melancholy,\nby corruption of blood, adust choler, or melancholy natural, [2552]\"by\nexcessive distemper of heat turned, in comparison of the natural, into a\nsharp lye by force of adustion, cause, according to the diversity of their\nmatter, diverse and strange symptoms,\" which T. Bright reckons up in his\nfollowing chapter. So doth [2553]Arculanus, according to the four principal\nhumours adust, and many others.\n\nFor example, if it proceed from phlegm, (which is seldom and not so\nfrequently as the rest) [2554]it stirs up dull symptoms, and a kind of\nstupidity, or impassionate hurt: they are sleepy, saith [2555]Savanarola,\ndull, slow, cold, blockish, ass-like, _Asininam melancholiam_, [2556]\nMelancthon calls it, \"they are much given to weeping, and delight in\nwaters, ponds, pools, rivers, fishing, fowling,\" &c. (Arnoldus _breviar. 1.\ncap. 18._) They are [2557]pale of colour, slothful, apt to sleep, heavy;\n[2558]much troubled with headache, continual meditation, and muttering to\nthemselves; they dream of waters, [2559]that they are in danger of\ndrowning, and fear such things, Rhasis. They are fatter than others that\nare melancholy, of a muddy complexion, apter to spit, [2560] sleep, more\ntroubled with rheum than the rest, and have their eyes still fixed on the\nground. Such a patient had Hercules de Saxonia, a widow in Venice, that was\nfat and very sleepy still; Christophorus a Vega another affected in the\nsame sort. If it be inveterate or violent, the symptoms are more evident,\nthey plainly denote and are ridiculous to others, in all their gestures,\nactions, speeches; imagining impossibilities, as he in Christophorus a\nVega, that thought he was a tun of wine, [2561]and that Siennois, that\nresolved within himself not to piss, for fear he should drown all the town.\n\nIf it proceed from blood adust, or that there be a mixture of blood in it,\n[2562]\"such are commonly ruddy of complexion, and high-coloured,\" according\nto Salust. Salvianus, and Hercules de Saxonia. And as Savanarola, Vittorius\nFaventinus Emper. farther adds, [2563]\"the veins of their eyes be red, as\nwell as their faces.\" They are much inclined to laughter, witty and merry,\nconceited in discourse, pleasant, if they be not far gone, much given to\nmusic, dancing, and to be in women's company. They meditate wholly on such\nthings, and think [2564]\"they see or hear plays, dancing, and suchlike\nsports\" (free from all fear and sorrow, as [2565]Hercules de Saxonia\nsupposeth.) If they be more strongly possessed with this kind of\nmelancholy, Arnoldus adds, _Breviar. lib. 1. cap. 18._ Like him of Argos in\nthe Poet, that sate laughing [2566]all day long, as if he had been at a\ntheatre. Such another is mentioned by [2567]Aristotle, living at Abydos, a\ntown of Asia Minor, that would sit after the same fashion, as if he had\nbeen upon a stage, and sometimes act himself; now clap his hands, and\nlaugh, as if he had been well pleased with the sight. Wolfius relates of a\ncountry fellow called Brunsellius, subject to this humour, [2568]\"that\nbeing by chance at a sermon, saw a woman fall off from a form half asleep,\nat which object most of the company laughed, but he for his part was so\nmuch moved, that for three whole days after he did nothing but laugh, by\nwhich means he was much weakened, and worse a long time following.\" Such a\none was old Sophocles, and Democritus himself had _hilare delirium_, much\nin this vein. Laurentius _cap. 3. de melan._ thinks this kind of\nmelancholy, which is a little adust with some mixture of blood, to be that\nwhich Aristotle meant, when he said melancholy men of all others are most\nwitty, which causeth many times a divine ravishment, and a kind of\n_enthusiasmus_, which stirreth them up to be excellent philosophers, poets,\nprophets, &c. Mercurialis, _consil. 110._ gives instance in a young man his\npatient, sanguine melancholy, [2569]\"of a great wit, and excellently\nlearned.\"\n\nIf it arise from choler adust, they are bold and impudent, and of a more\nharebrain disposition, apt to quarrel, and think of such things, battles,\ncombats, and their manhood, furious; impatient in discourse, stiff,\nirrefragable and prodigious in their tenets; and if they be moved, most\nviolent, outrageous, [2570]ready to disgrace, provoke any, to kill\nthemselves and others; Arnoldus adds, stark mad by fits, [2571]\"they sleep\nlittle, their urine is subtle and fiery.\" (Guianerius.) \"In their fits you\nshall hear them speak all manner of languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,\nthat never were taught or knew them before.\" Apponensis in _com. in Pro.\nsec. 30._ speaks of a mad woman that spake excellent good Latin: and Rhasis\nknew another, that could prophecy in her fit, and foretell things truly to\ncome. [2572]Guianerius had a patient could make Latin verses when the moon\nwas combust, otherwise illiterate. Avicenna and some of his adherents will\nhave these symptoms, when they happen, to proceed from the devil, and that\nthey are rather _demoniaci_, possessed, than mad or melancholy, or both\ntogether, as Jason Pratensis thinks, _Immiscent se mali genii_, &c. but\nmost ascribe it to the humour, which opinion Montaltus _cap. 21._ stiffly\nmaintains, confuting Avicenna and the rest, referring it wholly to the\nquality and disposition of the humour and subject. Cardan _de rerum var.\nlib. 8. cap. 10._ holds these men of all others fit to be assassins, bold,\nhardy, fierce, and adventurous, to undertake anything by reason of their\ncholer adust. [2573]\"This humour, saith he, prepares them to endure death\nitself, and all manner of torments with invincible courage, and 'tis a\nwonder to see with what alacrity they will undergo such tortures,\" _ut\nsupra naturam res videatur_: he ascribes this generosity, fury, or rather\nstupidity, to this adustion of choler and melancholy: but I take these\nrather to be mad or desperate, than properly melancholy; for commonly this\nhumour so adust and hot, degenerates into madness.\n\nIf it come from melancholy itself adust, those men, saith Avicenna, [2574]\n\"are usually sad and solitary, and that continually, and in excess, more\nthan ordinarily suspicious more fearful, and have long, sore, and most\ncorrupt imaginations;\" cold and black, bashful, and so solitary, that as\n[2575]Arnoldus writes, \"they will endure no company, they dream of graves\nstill, and dead men, and think themselves bewitched or dead:\" if it be\nextreme, they think they hear hideous noises, see and talk [2576]\"with\nblack men, and converse familiarly with devils, and such strange chimeras\nand visions,\" (Gordonius) or that they are possessed by them, that somebody\ntalks to them, or within them. _Tales melancholici plerumque daemoniaci_,\nMontaltus _consil. 26. ex Avicenna_. Valescus de Taranta had such a woman\nin cure, [2577]\"that thought she had to do with the devil:\" and Gentilis\nFulgosus _quaest. 55._ writes that he had a melancholy friend, that [2578]\n\"had a black man in the likeness of a soldier\" still following him\nwheresoever he was. Laurentius _cap. 7._ hath many stories of such as have\nthought themselves bewitched by their enemies; and some that would eat no\nmeat as being dead. [2579]_Anno_ 1550 an advocate of Paris fell into such a\nmelancholy fit, that he believed verily he was dead, he could not be\npersuaded otherwise, or to eat or drink, till a kinsman of his, a scholar\nof Bourges, did eat before him dressed like a corse. The story, saith\nSerres, was acted in a comedy before Charles the Ninth. Some think they are\nbeasts, wolves, hogs, and cry like dogs, foxes, bray like asses, and low\nlike kine, as King Praetus' daughters. [2580]Hildesheim _spicel. 2. de\nmania_, hath an example of a Dutch baron so affected, and Trincavelius\n_lib. 1. consil. 11._ another of a nobleman in his country, [2581]\"that\nthought he was certainly a beast, and would imitate most of their voices,\"\nwith many such symptoms, which may properly be reduced to this kind.\n\nIf it proceed from the several combinations of these four humours, or\nspirits, Herc. de Saxon. adds hot, cold, dry, moist, dark, confused,\nsettled, constringed, as it participates of matter, or is without matter,\nthe symptoms are likewise mixed. One thinks himself a giant, another a\ndwarf. One is heavy as lead, another is as light as a feather. Marcellus\nDonatus _l. 2. cap. 41._ makes mention out of Seneca, of one Seneccio, a\nrich man, [2582]\"that thought himself and everything else he had, great:\ngreat wife, great horses, could not abide little things, but would have\ngreat pots to drink in, great hose, and great shoes bigger than his feet.\"\nLike her in [2583]Trallianus, that supposed she \"could shake all the world\nwith her finger,\" and was afraid to clinch her hand together, lest she\nshould crush the world like an apple in pieces: or him in Galen, that\nthought he was [2584]Atlas, and sustained heaven with his shoulders.\nAnother thinks himself so little, that he can creep into a mouse-hole: one\nfears heaven will fall on his head: a second is a cock; and such a one,\n[2585]Guianerius saith he saw at Padua, that would clap his hands together\nand crow. [2586]Another thinks he is a nightingale, and therefore sings all\nthe night long; another he is all glass, a pitcher, and will therefore let\nnobody come near him, and such a one [2587]Laurentius gives out upon his\ncredit, that he knew in France. Christophorus a Vega _cap. 3. lib. 14._\nSkenkius and Marcellus Donatus _l. 2. cap. 1._ have many such examples, and\none amongst the rest of a baker in Ferrara that thought he was composed of\nbutter, and durst not sit in the sun, or come near the fire for fear of\nbeing melted: of another that thought he was a case of leather, stuffed\nwith wind. Some laugh, weep; some are mad, some dejected, moped, in much\nagony, some by fits, others continuate, &c. Some have a corrupt ear, they\nthink they hear music, or some hideous noise as their phantasy conceives,\ncorrupt eyes, some smelling, some one sense, some another. [2588]Lewis the\nEleventh had a conceit everything did stink about him, all the odoriferous\nperfumes they could get, would not ease him, but still he smelled a filthy\nstink. A melancholy French poet in [2589]Laurentius, being sick of a fever,\nand troubled with waking, by his physicians was appointed to use _unguentum\npopuleum_ to anoint his temples; but he so distasted the smell of it, that\nfor many years after, all that came near him he imagined to scent of it,\nand would let no man talk with him but aloof off, or wear any new clothes,\nbecause he thought still they smelled of it; in all other things wise and\ndiscreet, he would talk sensibly, save only in this. A gentleman in\nLimousin, saith Anthony Verdeur, was persuaded he had but one leg,\naffrighted by a wild boar, that by chance struck him on the leg; he could\nnot be satisfied his leg was sound (in all other things well) until two\nFranciscans by chance coming that way, fully removed him from the conceit.\n_Sed abunde fabularum audivimus_,--enough of story-telling.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Symptoms from Education, Custom, continuance of Time, our\nCondition, mixed with other Diseases, by Fits, Inclination, &c._\n\nAnother great occasion of the variety of these symptoms proceeds from\ncustom, discipline, education, and several inclinations, [2590]\"this humour\nwill imprint in melancholy men the objects most answerable to their\ncondition of life, and ordinary actions, and dispose men according to their\nseveral studies and callings.\" If an ambitious man become melancholy, he\nforthwith thinks he is a king, an emperor, a monarch, and walks alone,\npleasing himself with a vain hope of some future preferment, or present as\nhe supposeth, and withal acts a lord's part, takes upon him to be some\nstatesman or magnifico, makes conges, gives entertainment, looks big, &c.\nFrancisco Sansovino records of a melancholy man in Cremona, that would not\nbe induced to believe but that he was pope, gave pardons, made cardinals,\n&c. [2591]Christophorus a Vega makes mention of another of his\nacquaintance, that thought he was a king, driven from his kingdom, and was\nvery anxious to recover his estate. A covetous person is still conversant\nabout purchasing of lands and tenements, plotting in his mind how to\ncompass such and such manors, as if he were already lord of, and able to go\nthrough with it; all he sees is his, _re_ or _spe_, he hath devoured it in\nhope, or else in conceit esteems it his own: like him in [2592]Athenaeus,\nthat thought all the ships in the haven to be his own. A lascivious\n_inamorato_ plots all the day long to please his mistress, acts and struts,\nand carries himself as if she were in presence, still dreaming of her, as\nPamphilus of his Glycerium, or as some do in their morning sleep. [2593]\nMarcellus Donatus knew such a gentlewoman in Mantua, called Elionora\nMeliorina, that constantly believed she was married to a king, and [2594]\n\"would kneel down and talk with him, as if he had been there present with\nhis associates; and if she had found by chance a piece of glass in a\nmuck-hill or in the street, she would say that it was a jewel sent from her\nlord and husband.\" If devout and religious, he is all for fasting, prayer,\nceremonies, alms, interpretations, visions, prophecies, revelations, [2595]\nhe is inspired by the Holy Ghost, full of the spirit: one while he is\nsaved, another while damned, or still troubled in mind for his sins, the\ndevil will surely have him, &c. more of these in the third partition of\nlove-melancholy. [2596]A scholar's mind is busied about his studies, he\napplauds himself for that he hath done, or hopes to do, one while fearing\nto be out in his next exercise, another while contemning all censures;\nenvies one, emulates another; or else with indefatigable pains and\nmeditation, consumes himself. So of the rest, all which vary according to\nthe more remiss and violent impression of the object, or as the humour\nitself is intended or remitted. For some are so gently melancholy, that in\nall their carriage, and to the outward apprehension of others it can hardly\nbe discerned, yet to them an intolerable burden, and not to be endured.\n[2597]_Quaedam occulta quaedam manifesta_, some signs are manifest and\nobvious to all at all times, some to few, or seldom, or hardly perceived;\nlet them keep their own council, none will take notice or suspect them.\n\"They do not express in outward show their depraved imaginations,\" as\n[2598]Hercules de Saxonia observes, \"but conceal them wholly to themselves,\nand are very wise men, as I have often seen; some fear, some do not fear at\nall, as such as think themselves kings or dead, some have more signs, some\nfewer, some great, some less,\" some vex, fret, still fear, grieve, lament,\nsuspect, laugh, sing, weep, chafe, &c. by fits (as I have said) or more\nduring and permanent. Some dote in one thing, are most childish, and\nridiculous, and to be wondered at in that, and yet for all other matters\nmost discreet and wise. To some it is in disposition, to another in habit;\nand as they write of heat and cold, we may say of this humour, one is\n_melancholicus ad octo_, a second two degrees less, a third halfway. 'Tis\nsuperparticular, _sesquialtera, sesquitertia_, and _superbipartiens\ntertias, quintas Melancholiae_, &c. all those geometrical proportions are\ntoo little to express it. [2599]\"It comes to many by fits, and goes; to\nothers it is continuate:\" many (saith [2600]Faventinus) \"in spring and fall\nonly are molested,\" some once a year, as that Roman [2601] Galen speaks of:\n[2602]one, at the conjunction of the moon alone, or some unfortunate\naspects, at such and such set hours and times, like the sea-tides, to some\nwomen when they be with child, as [2603]Plater notes, never otherwise: to\nothers 'tis settled and fixed; to one led about and variable still by that\n_ignis fatuus_ of phantasy, like an _arthritis_ or running gout, 'tis here\nand there, and in every joint, always molesting some part or other; or if\nthe body be free, in a myriad of forms exercising the mind. A second once\nperadventure in his life hath a most grievous fit, once in seven years,\nonce in five years, even to the extremity of madness, death, or dotage, and\nthat upon, some feral accident or perturbation, terrible object, and for a\ntime, never perhaps so before, never after. A third is moved upon all such\ntroublesome objects, cross fortune, disaster, and violent passions,\notherwise free, once troubled in three or four years. A fourth, if things\nbe to his mind, or he in action, well pleased, in good company, is most\njocund, and of a good complexion: if idle, or alone, a la mort, or carried\naway wholly with pleasant dreams and phantasies, but if once crossed and\ndispleased,\n\n       \"Pectore concipiet nil nisi triste suo;\"\n\n       \"He will imagine naught save sadness in his heart;\"\n\nhis countenance is altered on a sudden, his heart heavy, irksome thoughts\ncrucify his soul, and in an instant he is moped or weary of his life, he\nwill kill himself. A fifth complains in his youth, a sixth in his middle\nage, the last in his old age.\n\nGenerally thus much we may conclude of melancholy; that it is [2604]most\npleasant at first, I say, _mentis gratissimus error_, [2605]a most\ndelightsome humour, to be alone, dwell alone, walk alone, meditate, lie in\nbed whole days, dreaming awake as it were, and frame a thousand fantastical\nimaginations unto themselves. They are never better pleased than when they\nare so doing, they are in paradise for the time, and cannot well endure to\nbe interrupt; with him in the poet, [2606]_pol me occidistis amici, non\nservastis ait_? you have undone him, he complains, if you trouble him: tell\nhim what inconvenience will follow, what will be the event, all is one,\n_canis ad vomitum_, [2607]'tis so pleasant he cannot refrain. He may thus\ncontinue peradventure many years by reason of a strong temperature, or some\nmixture of business, which may divert his cogitations: but at the last\n_laesa imaginatio_, his phantasy is crazed, and now habituated to such\ntoys, cannot but work still like a fate, the scene alters upon a sudden,\nfear and sorrow supplant those pleasing thoughts, suspicion, discontent,\nand perpetual anxiety succeed in their places; so by little and little, by\nthat shoeing-horn of idleness, and voluntary solitariness, melancholy this\nferal fiend is drawn on, [2608]_et quantum vertice ad auras Aethereas,\ntantum radice in Tartara tendit_, \"extending up, by its branches, so far\ntowards Heaven, as, by its roots, it does down towards Tartarus;\" it was\nnot so delicious at first, as now it is bitter and harsh; a cankered soul\nmacerated with cares and discontents, _taedium vitae_, impatience, agony,\ninconstancy, irresolution, precipitate them unto unspeakable miseries. They\ncannot endure company, light, or life itself, some unfit for action, and\nthe like. [2609]Their bodies are lean and dried up, withered, ugly, their\nlooks harsh, very dull, and their souls tormented, as they are more or less\nentangled, as the humour hath been intended, or according to the\ncontinuance of time they have been troubled.\n\nTo discern all which symptoms the better, [2610]Rhasis the Arabian makes\nthree degrees of them. The first is, _falsa cogitatio_, false conceits and\nidle thoughts: to misconstrue and amplify, aggravating everything they\nconceive or fear; the second is, _falso cogitata loqui_, to talk to\nthemselves, or to use inarticulate incondite voices, speeches, obsolete\ngestures, and plainly to utter their minds and conceits of their hearts, by\ntheir words and actions, as to laugh, weep, to be silent, not to sleep, eat\ntheir meat, &c.: the third is to put in practice [2611]that which they\nthink or speak. Savanarola, _Rub. 11. tract. 8. cap. 1. de aegritudine_,\nconfirms as much, [2612]\"when he begins to express that in words, which he\nconceives in his heart, or talks idly, or goes from one thing to another,\"\nwhich [2613]Gordonius calls _nec caput habentia, nec caudam_, (\"having\nneither head nor tail,\") he is in the middle way: [2614] \"but when he\nbegins to act it likewise, and to put his fopperies in execution, he is\nthen in the extent of melancholy, or madness itself.\" This progress of\nmelancholy you shall easily observe in them that have been so affected,\nthey go smiling to themselves at first, at length they laugh out; at first\nsolitary, at last they can endure no company: or if they do, they are now\ndizzards, past sense and shame, quite moped, they care not what they say or\ndo, all their actions, words, gestures, are furious or ridiculous. At first\nhis mind is troubled, he doth not attend what is said, if you tell him a\ntale, he cries at last, what said you? but in the end he mutters to\nhimself, as old women do many times, or old men when they sit alone, upon a\nsudden they laugh, whoop, halloo, or run away, and swear they see or hear\nplayers, [2615]devils, hobgoblins, ghosts, strike, or strut, &c., grow\nhumorous in the end; like him in the poet, _saepe ducentos, saepe decem\nservos_, (\"at one time followed by two hundred servants, at another only by\nten\") he will dress himself, and undress, careless at last, grows\ninsensible, stupid, or mad. [2616]He howls like a wolf, barks like a dog,\nand raves like Ajax and Orestes, hears music and outcries, which no man\nelse hears. As [2617]he did whom Amatus Lusitanus mentioneth _cent. 3,\ncura. 55_, or that woman in [2618]Springer, that spake many languages, and\nsaid she was possessed: that farmer in [2619]Prosper Calenius, that\ndisputed and discoursed learnedly in philosophy and astronomy, with\nAlexander Achilles his master, at Bologna, in Italy. But of these I have\nalready spoken.\n\nWho can sufficiently speak of these symptoms, or prescribe rules to\ncomprehend them? as Echo to the painter in Ausonius, _vane quid affectas_,\n&c., foolish fellow; what wilt? if you must needs paint me, paint a voice,\n_et similem si vis pingere, pinge sonum_; if you will describe melancholy,\ndescribe a fantastical conceit, a corrupt imagination, vain thoughts and\ndifferent, which who can do? The four and twenty letters make no more\nvariety of words in diverse languages, than melancholy conceits produce\ndiversity of symptoms in several persons. They are irregular, obscure,\nvarious, so infinite, Proteus himself is not so diverse, you may as well\nmake the moon a new coat, as a true character of a melancholy man; as soon\nfind the motion of a bird in the air, as the heart of man, a melancholy\nman. They are so confused, I say, diverse, intermixed with other diseases.\nAs the species be confounded (which [2620]I have showed) so are the\nsymptoms; sometimes with headache, cachexia, dropsy, stone; as you may\nperceive by those several examples and illustrations, collected by [2621]\nHildesheim _spicel. 2._ Mercurialis _consil. 118. cap. 6 and 11._ with\nheadache, epilepsy, priapismus. Trincavelius _consil. 12. lib. 1. consil.\n49._ with gout: _caninus appetitus_. Montanus _consil. 26, &c. 23, 234,\n249_, with falling-sickness, headache, vertigo, lycanthropia, &c. J. Caesar\nClaudinus _consult. 4. consult. 89 and 116._ with gout, agues,\nhaemorrhoids, stone, &c., who can distinguish these melancholy symptoms so\nintermixed with others, or apply them to their several kinds, confine them\ninto method? 'Tis hard I confess, yet I have disposed of them as I could,\nand will descend to particularise them according to their species. For\nhitherto I have expatiated in more general lists or terms, speaking\npromiscuously of such ordinary signs, which occur amongst writers. Not that\nthey are all to be found in one man, for that were to paint a monster or\nchimera, not a man: but some in one, some in another, and that successively\nor at several times.\n\nWhich I have been the more curious to express and report; not to upbraid\nany miserable man, or by way of derision, (I rather pity them,) but the\nbetter to discern, to apply remedies unto them; and to show that the best\nand soundest of us all is in great danger; how much we ought to fear our\nown fickle estates, remember our miseries and vanities, examine and\nhumiliate ourselves, seek to God, and call to Him for mercy, that needs not\nlook for any rods to scourge ourselves, since we carry them in our bowels,\nand that our souls are in a miserable captivity, if the light of grace and\nheavenly truth doth not shine continually upon us: and by our discretion to\nmoderate ourselves, to be more circumspect and wary in the midst of these\ndangers.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Symptoms of Head-Melancholy_.\n\n\"If [2622]no symptoms appear about the stomach, nor the blood be\nmisaffected, and fear and sorrow continue, it is to be thought the brain\nitself is troubled, by reason of a melancholy juice bred in it, or\notherwise conveyed into it, and that evil juice is from the distemperature\nof the part, or left after some inflammation,\" thus far Piso. But this is\nnot always true, for blood and hypochondries both are often affected even\nin head-melancholy. [2623]Hercules de Saxonia differs here from the common\ncurrent of writers, putting peculiar signs of head-melancholy, from the\nsole distemperature of spirits in the brain, as they are hot, cold, dry,\nmoist, \"all without matter from the motion alone, and tenebrosity of\nspirits;\" of melancholy which proceeds from humours by adustion, he treats\napart, with their several symptoms and cures. The common signs, if it be by\nessence in the head, \"are ruddiness of face, high sanguine complexion, most\npart _rubore saturato_,\" [2624]one calls it, a bluish, and sometimes full\nof pimples, with red eyes. Avicenna _l. 3, Fen. 2, Tract. 4, c. 18._\nDuretus and others out of Galen, _de affect. l. 3, c. 6._ [2625]Hercules de\nSaxonia to this of redness of face, adds \"heaviness of the head, fixed and\nhollow eyes.\" [2626]\"If it proceed from dryness of the brain, then their\nheads will be light, vertiginous, and they most apt to wake, and to\ncontinue whole months together without sleep. Few excrements in their eyes\nand nostrils, and often bald by reason of excess of dryness,\" Montaltus\nadds, _c. 17._ If it proceed from moisture: dullness, drowsiness, headache\nfollows; and as Salust. Salvianus, _c. 1, l. 2_, out of his own experience\nfound, epileptical, with a multitude of humours in the head. They are very\nbashful, if ruddy, apt to blush, and to be red upon all occasions,\n_praesertim si metus accesserit_. But the chiefest symptom to discern this\nspecies, as I have said, is this, that there be no notable signs in the\nstomach, hypochondries, or elsewhere, _digna_, as [2627] Montaltus terms\nthem, or of greater note, because oftentimes the passions of the stomach\nconcur with them. Wind is common to all three species, and is not excluded,\nonly that of the hypochondries is [2628]more windy than the rest, saith\nHollerius. Aetius _tetrab. l. 2, sc. 2, c. 9 and 10_, maintains the same,\n[2629]if there be more signs, and more evident in the head than elsewhere,\nthe brain is primarily affected, and prescribes head-melancholy to be cured\nby meats amongst the rest, void of wind, and good juice, not excluding\nwind, or corrupt blood, even in head-melancholy itself: but these species\nare often confounded, and so are their symptoms, as I have already proved.\nThe symptoms of the mind are superfluous and continual cogitations;\n[2630]\"for when the head is heated, it scorcheth the blood, and from thence\nproceed melancholy fumes, which trouble the mind,\" Avicenna. They are very\ncholeric, and soon hot, solitary, sad, often silent, watchful, discontent,\nMontaltus, _cap. 24._ If anything trouble them, they cannot sleep, but fret\nthemselves still, till another object mitigate, or time wear it out. They\nhave grievous passions, and immoderate perturbations of the mind, fear,\nsorrow, &c., yet not so continuate, but that they are sometimes merry, apt\nto profuse laughter, which is more to be wondered at, and that by the\nauthority of [2631]Galen himself, by reason of mixture of blood, _praerubri\njocosis delectantur, et irrisores plerumque sunt_, if they be ruddy, they\nare delighted in jests, and oftentimes scoffers themselves, conceited: and\nas Rodericus a Vega comments on that place of Galen, merry, witty, of a\npleasant disposition, and yet grievously melancholy anon after: _omnia\ndiscunt sine doctore_, saith Aretus, they learn without a teacher: and as\n[2632]Laurentius supposeth, those feral passions and symptoms of such as\nthink themselves glass, pitchers, feathers, &c., speak strange languages,\n_a colore cerebri_ (if it be in excess) from the brain's distempered heat.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Symptoms of windy Hypochondriacal Melancholy_.\n\n\"In this hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy, the symptoms are so\nambiguous,\" saith [2633]Crato in a counsel of his for a noblewoman, \"that\nthe most exquisite physicians cannot determine of the part affected.\"\nMatthew Flaccius, consulted about a noble matron, confessed as much, that\nin this malady he with Hollerius, Fracastorius, Falopius, and others, being\nto give their sentence of a party labouring of hypochondriacal melancholy,\ncould not find out by the symptoms which part was most especially affected;\nsome said the womb, some heart, some stomach, &c., and therefore Crato,\n_consil. 24. lib. 1._ boldly avers, that in this diversity of symptoms,\nwhich commonly accompany this disease, [2634]\"no physician can truly say\nwhat part is affected.\" Galen _lib. 3. de loc. affect._, reckons up these\nordinary symptoms, which all the Neoterics repeat of Diocles; only this\nfault he finds with him, that he puts not fear and sorrow amongst the other\nsigns. Trincavelius excuseth Diocles, _lib. 3. consil. 35._ because that\noftentimes in a strong head and constitution, a generous spirit, and a\nvaliant, these symptoms appear not, by reason of his valour and courage.\n[2635]Hercules de Saxonia (to whom I subscribe) is of the same mind (which\nI have before touched) that fear and sorrow are not general symptoms; some\nfear and are not sad; some be sad and fear not; some neither fear nor\ngrieve. The rest are these, beside fear and sorrow, [2636]\"sharp belchings,\nfulsome crudities, heat in the bowels, wind and rumbling in the guts,\nvehement gripings, pain in the belly and stomach sometimes, after meat that\nis hard of concoction, much watering of the stomach, and moist spittle,\ncold sweat, _importunus sudor_, unseasonable sweat all over the body,\" as\nOctavius Horatianus _lib. 2. cap. 5._ calls it; \"cold joints, indigestion,\n[2637]they cannot endure their own fulsome belchings, continual wind about\ntheir hypochondries, heat and griping in their bowels, _praecordia sursum\nconvelluntur_, midriff and bowels are pulled up, the veins about their eyes\nlook red, and swell from vapours and wind.\" Their ears sing now and then,\nvertigo and giddiness come by fits, turbulent dreams, dryness, leanness,\napt they are to sweat upon all occasions, of all colours and complexions.\nMany of them are high-coloured especially after meals, which symptom\nCardinal Caecius was much troubled with, and of which he complained to\nProsper Calenus his physician, he could not eat, or drink a cup of wine,\nbut he was as red in the face as if he had been at a mayor's feast. That\nsymptom alone vexeth many. [2638]Some again are black, pale, ruddy,\nsometimes their shoulders and shoulder blades ache, there is a leaping all\nover their bodies, sudden trembling, a palpitation of the heart, and that\n_cardiaca passio_, grief in the mouth of the stomach, which maketh the\npatient think his heart itself acheth, and sometimes suffocation,\n_difficultas anhelitus_, short breath, hard wind, strong pulse, swooning.\nMontanus _consil. 55._ Trincavelius _lib. 3. consil. 36. et 37._ Fernelius\n_cons. 43._ Frambesarius _consult. lib. 1. consil. 17._ Hildesheim,\nClaudinus, &c., give instance of every particular. The peculiar symptoms\nwhich properly belong to each part be these. If it proceed from the\nstomach, saith [2639]Savanarola, 'tis full of pain wind. Guianerius adds,\nvertigo, nausea, much spitting, &c. If from the mirach, a swelling and wind\nin the hypochondries, a loathing, and appetite to vomit, pulling upward. If\nfrom the heart, aching and trembling of it, much heaviness. If from the\nliver, there is usually a pain in the right hypochondry. If from the\nspleen, hardness and grief in the left hypochondry, a rumbling, much\nappetite and small digestion, Avicenna. If from the mesaraic veins and\nliver on the other side, little or no appetite, Herc. de Saxonia. If from\nthe hypochondries, a rumbling inflation, concoction is hindered, often\nbelching, &c. And from these crudities, windy vapours ascend up to the\nbrain which trouble the imagination, and cause fear, sorrow, dullness,\nheaviness, many terrible conceits and chimeras, as Lemnius well observes,\n_l. 1. c. 16._ \"as [2640]a black and thick cloud covers the sun, and\nintercepts his beams and light, so doth this melancholy vapour obnubilate\nthe mind, enforce it to many absurd thoughts and imaginations,\" and compel\ngood, wise, honest, discreet men (arising to the brain from the [2641]\nlower parts, \"as smoke out of a chimney\") to dote, speak, and do that which\nbecomes them not, their persons, callings, wisdoms. One by reason of those\nascending vapours and gripings, rumbling beneath, will not be persuaded but\nthat he hath a serpent in his guts, a viper, another frogs. Trallianus\nrelates a story of a woman, that imagined she had swallowed an eel, or a\nserpent, and Felix Platerus, _observat. lib. 1._ hath a most memorable\nexample of a countryman of his, that by chance, falling into a pit where\nfrogs and frogs' spawn was, and a little of that water swallowed, began to\nsuspect that he had likewise swallowed frogs' spawn, and with that conceit\nand fear, his phantasy wrought so far, that he verily thought he had young\nlive frogs in his belly, _qui vivebant ex alimento suo_, that lived by his\nnourishment, and was so certainly persuaded of it, that for many years\nafterwards he could not be rectified in his conceit: He studied physic\nseven years together to cure himself, travelled into Italy, France and\nGermany to confer with the best physicians about it, and A.D. 1609, asked\nhis counsel amongst the rest; he told him it was wind, his conceit, &c.,\nbut _mordicus contradicere, et ore, et scriptis probare nitebatur_: no\nsaying would serve, it was no wind, but real frogs: \"and do you not hear\nthem croak?\" Platerus would have deceived him, by putting live frog's into\nhis excrements; but he, being a physician himself, would not be deceived,\n_vir prudens alias, et doctus_ a wise and learned man otherwise, a doctor\nof physic, and after seven years' dotage in this kind, _a phantasia\nliberatus est_, he was cured. Laurentius and Goulart have many such\nexamples, if you be desirous to read them. One commodity above the rest\nwhich are melancholy, these windy flatuous have, _lucidia intervalla_,\ntheir symptoms and pains are not usually so continuate as the rest, but\ncome by fits, fear and sorrow, and the rest: yet in another they exceed all\nothers; and that is, [2642]they are luxurious, incontinent, and prone to\nvenery, by reason of wind, _et facile amant, et quamlibet fere amant_.\n(Jason Pratensis) [2643]Rhasis is of opinion, that Venus doth many of them\nmuch good; the other symptoms of the mind be common with the rest.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Symptoms of Melancholy abounding in the whole body_.\n\nTheir bodies that are affected with this universal melancholy are most part\nblack, [2644]\"the melancholy juice is redundant all over,\" hirsute they\nare, and lean, they have broad veins, their blood is gross and thick [2645]\n\"Their spleen is weak,\" and a liver apt to engender the humour; they have\nkept bad diet, or have had some evacuation stopped, as haemorrhoids, or\nmonths in women, which [2646]Trallianus, in the cure, would have carefully\nto be inquired, and withal to observe of what complexion the party is of,\nblack or red. For as Forrestus and Hollerius contend, if [2647]they be\nblack, it proceeds from abundance of natural melancholy; if it proceed from\ncares, agony, discontents, diet, exercise, &c., they may be as well of any\nother colour: red, yellow, pale, as black, and yet their whole blood\ncorrupt: _praerubri colore saepe sunt tales, saepe flavi_, (saith [2648]\nMontaltus _cap. 22._) The best way to discern this species, is to let them\nbleed, if the blood be corrupt, thick and black, and they withal free from\nthose hypochondriacal symptoms, and not so grievously troubled with them,\nor those of the head, it argues they are melancholy, _a toto corpore_. The\nfumes which arise from this corrupt blood, disturb the mind, and make them\nfearful and sorrowful, heavy hearted, as the rest, dejected, discontented,\nsolitary, silent, weary of their lives, dull and heavy, or merry, &c., and\nif far gone, that which Apuleius wished to his enemy, by way of\nimprecation, is true in them; [2649]\"Dead men's bones, hobgoblins, ghosts\nare ever in their minds, and meet them still in every turn: all the\nbugbears of the night, and terrors, fairy-babes of tombs, and graves are\nbefore their eyes, and in their thoughts, as to women and children, if they\nbe in the dark alone.\" If they hear, or read, or see any tragical object,\nit sticks by them, they are afraid of death, and yet weary of their lives,\nin their discontented humours they quarrel with all the world, bitterly\ninveigh, tax satirically, and because they cannot otherwise vent their\npassions or redress what is amiss, as they mean, they will by violent death\nat last be revenged on themselves.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Symptoms of Maids, Nuns, and Widows' Melancholy_.\n\nBecause Lodovicus Mercatus in his second book _de mulier. affect. cap. 4._\nand Rodericus a Castro _de morb. mulier. cap. 3. lib. 2._ two famous\nphysicians in Spain, Daniel Sennertus of Wittenberg _lib. 1. part 2. cap.\n13._ with others, have vouchsafed in their works not long since published,\nto write two just treatises _de Melancholia virginum, Monialium et\nViduarum_, as a particular species of melancholy (which I have already\nspecified) distinct from the rest; [2650](for it much differs from that\nwhich commonly befalls men and other women, as having one only cause proper\nto women alone) I may not omit in this general survey of melancholy\nsymptoms, to set down the particular signs of such parties so misaffected.\n\nThe causes are assigned out of Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Moschion, and those\nold _Gynaeciorum Scriptores_, of this feral malady, in more ancient maids,\nwidows, and barren women, _ob septum transversum violatum_, saith Mercatus,\nby reason of the midriff or _Diaphragma_, heart and brain offended with\nthose vicious vapours which come from menstruous blood, _inflammationem\narteriae circa dorsum_, Rodericus adds, an inflammation of the back, which\nwith the rest is offended by [2651]that fuliginous exhalation of corrupt\nseed, troubling the brain, heart and mind; the brain, I say, not in\nessence, but by consent, _Universa enim hujus affectus causa ab utero\npendet, et a sanguinis menstrui malitia_, for in a word, the whole malady\nproceeds from that inflammation, putridity, black smoky vapours, &c., from\nthence comes care, sorrow, and anxiety, obfuscation of spirits, agony,\ndesperation, and the like, which are intended or remitted; _si amatorius\naccesserit ardor_, or any other violent object or perturbation of mind.\nThis melancholy may happen to widows, with much care and sorrow, as\nfrequently it doth, by reason of a sudden alteration of their accustomed\ncourse of life, &c. To such as lie in childbed _ob suppressam\npurgationem_; but to nuns and more ancient maids, and some barren women for\nthe causes abovesaid, 'tis more familiar, _crebrius his quam reliquis\naccidit, inquit Rodericus_, the rest are not altogether excluded.\n\nOut of these causes Rodericus defines it with Areteus, to be _angorem\nanimi_, a vexation of the mind, a sudden sorrow from a small, light, or no\noccasion, [2652]with a kind of still dotage and grief of some part or\nother, head, heart, breasts, sides, back, belly, &c., with much\nsolitariness, weeping, distraction, &c., from which they are sometimes\nsuddenly delivered, because it comes and goes by fits, and is not so\npermanent as other melancholy.\n\nBut to leave this brief description, the most ordinary symptoms be these,\n_pulsatio juxta dorsum_, a beating about the back, which is almost\nperpetual, the skin is many times rough, squalid, especially, as Areteus\nobserves, about the arms, knees, and knuckles. The midriff and\nheart-strings do burn and beat very fearfully, and when this vapour or fume\nis stirred, flieth upward, the heart itself beats, is sore grieved, and\nfaints, _fauces siccitate praecluduntur, ut difficulter possit ab uteri\nstrangulatione decerni_, like fits of the mother, _Alvus plerisque nil\nreddit, aliis exiguum, acre, biliosum, lotium flavum_. They complain many\ntimes, saith Mercatus, of a great pain in their heads, about their hearts,\nand hypochondries, and so likewise in their breasts, which are often sore,\nsometimes ready to swoon, their faces are inflamed, and red, they are dry,\nthirsty, suddenly hot, much troubled with wind, cannot sleep, &c. And from\nhence proceed _ferina deliramenta_, a brutish kind of dotage, troublesome\nsleep, terrible dreams in the night, _subrusticus pudor et verecundia\nignava_, a foolish kind of bashfulness to some, perverse conceits and\nopinions, [2653]dejection of mind, much discontent, preposterous judgment.\nThey are apt to loath, dislike, disdain, to be weary of every object, &c.,\neach thing almost is tedious to them, they pine away, void of counsel, apt\nto weep, and tremble, timorous, fearful, sad, and out of all hope of better\nfortunes. They take delight in nothing for the time, but love to be alone\nand solitary, though that do them more harm: and thus they are affected so\nlong as this vapour lasteth; but by-and-by, as pleasant and merry as ever\nthey were in their lives, they sing, discourse, and laugh in any good\ncompany, upon all occasions, and so by fits it takes them now and then,\nexcept the malady be inveterate, and then 'tis more frequent, vehement, and\ncontinuate. Many of them cannot tell how to express themselves in words, or\nhow it holds them, what ails them, you cannot understand them, or well tell\nwhat to make of their sayings; so far gone sometimes, so stupefied and\ndistracted, they think themselves bewitched, they are in despair, _aptae ad\nfletum, desperationem, dolores mammis et hypocondriis_. Mercatus therefore\nadds, now their breasts, now their hypochondries, belly and sides, then\ntheir heart and head aches, now heat, then wind, now this, now that\noffends, they are weary of all; [2654]and yet will not, cannot again tell\nhow, where or what offends them, though they be in great pain, agony, and\nfrequently complain, grieving, sighing, weeping, and discontented still,\n_sine causa manifesta_, most part, yet I say they will complain, grudge,\nlament, and not be persuaded, but that they are troubled with an evil\nspirit, which is frequent in Germany, saith Rodericus, amongst the common\nsort: and to such as are most grievously affected, (for he makes three\ndegrees of this disease in women,) they are in despair, surely forespoken\nor bewitched, and in extremity of their dotage, (weary of their lives,)\nsome of them will attempt to make away themselves. Some think they see\nvisions, confer with spirits and devils, they shall surely be damned, are\nafraid of some treachery, imminent danger, and the like, they will not\nspeak, make answer to any question, but are almost distracted, mad, or\nstupid for the time, and by fits: and thus it holds them, as they are more\nor less affected, and as the inner humour is intended or remitted, or by\noutward objects and perturbations aggravated, solitariness, idleness, &c.\n\nMany other maladies there are incident to young women, out of that one and\nonly cause above specified, many feral diseases. I will not so much as\nmention their names, melancholy alone is the subject of my present\ndiscourse, from which I will not swerve. The several cures of this\ninfirmity, concerning diet, which must be very sparing, phlebotomy, physic,\ninternal, external remedies, are at large in great variety in [2655]\nRodericus a Castro, Sennertus, and Mercatus, which whoso will, as occasion\nserves, may make use of. But the best and surest remedy of all, is to see\nthem well placed, and married to good husbands in due time, _hinc illae,\nlachrymae_, that is the primary cause, and this the ready cure, to give\nthem content to their desires. I write not this to patronise any wanton,\nidle flirt, lascivious or light housewives, which are too forward many\ntimes, unruly, and apt to cast away themselves on him that comes next,\nwithout all care, counsel, circumspection, and judgment. If religion, good\ndiscipline, honest education, wholesome exhortation, fair promises, fame\nand loss of good name cannot inhibit and deter such, (which to chaste and\nsober maids cannot choose but avail much,) labour and exercise, strict\ndiet, rigour and threats may more opportunely be used, and are able of\nthemselves to qualify and divert an ill-disposed temperament. For seldom\nshould you see an hired servant, a poor handmaid, though ancient, that is\nkept hard to her work, and bodily labour, a coarse country wench troubled\nin this kind, but noble virgins, nice gentlewomen, such as are solitary and\nidle, live at ease, lead a life out of action and employment, that fare\nwell, in great houses and jovial companies, ill-disposed peradventure of\nthemselves, and not willing to make any resistance, discontented otherwise,\nof weak judgment, able bodies, and subject to passions, (_grandiores\nvirgines_, saith Mercatus, _steriles et viduae plerumque melancholicae_,)\nsuch for the most part are misaffected, and prone to this disease. I do not\nso much pity them that may otherwise be eased, but those alone that out of\na strong temperament, innate constitution, are violently carried away with\nthis torrent of inward humours, and though very modest of themselves,\nsober, religious, virtuous, and well given, (as many so distressed maids\nare,) yet cannot make resistance, these grievances will appear, this malady\nwill take place, and now manifestly show itself, and may not otherwise be\nhelped. But where am I? Into what subject have I rushed? What have I to do\nwith nuns, maids, virgins, widows? I am a bachelor myself, and lead a\nmonastic life in a college, _nae ego sane ineptus qui haec dixerim_,) I\nconfess 'tis an indecorum, and as Pallas a virgin blushed, when Jupiter by\nchance spake of love matters in her presence, and turned away her face; _me\nreprimam_ though my subject necessarily require it, I will say no more.\n\nAnd yet I must and will say something more, add a word or two _in gratiam\nvirginum et viduarum_, in favour of all such distressed parties, in\ncommiseration of their present estate. And as I cannot choose but condole\ntheir mishap that labour of this infirmity, and are destitute of help in\nthis case, so must I needs inveigh against them that are in fault, more\nthan manifest causes, and as bitterly tax those tyrannising\npseudopoliticians, superstitious orders, rash vows, hard-hearted parents,\nguardians, unnatural friends, allies, (call them how you will,) those\ncareless and stupid overseers, that out of worldly respects, covetousness,\nsupine negligence, their own private ends (_cum sibi sit interim bene_) can\nso severely reject, stubbornly neglect, and impiously contemn, without all\nremorse and pity, the tears, sighs, groans, and grievous miseries of such\npoor souls committed to their charge. How odious and abominable are those\nsuperstitious and rash vows of Popish monasteries, so to bind and enforce\nmen and women to vow virginity, to lead a single life, against the laws of\nnature, opposite to religion, policy, and humanity, so to starve, to offer\nviolence, to suppress the vigour of youth, by rigorous statutes, severe\nlaws, vain persuasions, to debar them of that to which by their innate\ntemperature they are so furiously inclined, urgently carried, and sometimes\nprecipitated, even irresistibly led, to the prejudice of their soul's\nhealth, and good estate of body and mind: and all for base and private\nrespects, to maintain their gross superstition, to enrich themselves and\ntheir territories as they falsely suppose, by hindering some marriages,\nthat the world be not full of beggars, and their parishes pestered with\norphans; stupid politicians; _haeccine fieri flagilia_? ought these things\nso to be carried? better marry than burn, saith the Apostle, but they are\notherwise persuaded. They will by all means quench their neighbour's house\nif it be on fire, but that fire of lust which breaks out into such\nlamentable flames, they will not take notice of, their own bowels\noftentimes, flesh and blood shall so rage and burn, and they will not see\nit: _miserum est_, saith Austin, _seipsum non miserescere_, and they are\nmiserable in the meantime that cannot pity themselves, the common good of\nall, and _per consequens_ their own estates. For let them but consider what\nfearful maladies, feral diseases, gross inconveniences, come to both sexes\nby this enforced temperance, it troubles me to think of, much more to\nrelate those frequent abortions and murdering of infants in their nunneries\n(read [2656]Kemnisius and others), and notorious fornications, those\nSpintrias, Tribadas, Ambubeias, &c., those rapes, incests, adulteries,\nmastuprations, sodomies, buggeries of monks and friars. See Bale's\nvisitation of abbeys, [2657]Mercurialis, Rodericus a Castro, Peter\nForestus, and divers physicians; I know their ordinary apologies and\nexcuses for these things, _sed viderint Politici, Medici, Theologi_, I\nshall more opportunely meet with them [2658]elsewhere.\n\n[2659] \"Illius viduae, aut patronum Virginis hujus,\n        Ne me forte putes, verbum non amplius addam.\"\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Immediate cause of these precedent Symptoms_.\n\nTo give some satisfaction to melancholy men that are troubled with these\nsymptoms, a better means in my judgment cannot be taken, than to show them\nthe causes whence they proceed; not from devils as they suppose, or that\nthey are bewitched or forsaken of God, hear or see, &c. as many of them\nthink, but from natural and inward causes, that so knowing them, they may\nbetter avoid the effects, or at least endure them with more patience. The\nmost grievous and common symptoms are fear and sorrow, and that without a\ncause to the wisest and discreetest men, in this malady not to be avoided.\nThe reason why they are so, Aetius discusseth at large, _Tetrabib. 2. 2._\nin his first problem out of Galen, _lib. 2. de causis sympt. 1._ For Galen\nimputeth all to the cold that is black, and thinks that the spirits being\ndarkened, and the substance of the brain cloudy and dark, all the objects\nthereof appear terrible, and the [2660]mind itself, by those dark, obscure,\ngross fumes, ascending from black humours, is in continual darkness, fear,\nand sorrow; divers terrible monstrous fictions in a thousand shapes and\napparitions occur, with violent passions, by which the brain and fantasy\nare troubled and eclipsed. [2661]Fracastorius, _lib. 2. de intellect_,\n\"will have cold to be the cause of fear and sorrow; for such as are cold\nare ill-disposed to mirth, dull, and heavy, by nature solitary, silent; and\nnot for any inward darkness (as physicians think) for many melancholy men\ndare boldly be, continue, and walk in the dark, and delight in it:\" _solum\nfrigidi timidi_: if they be hot, they are merry; and the more hot, the more\nfurious, and void of fear, as we see in madmen; but this reason holds not,\nfor then no melancholy, proceeding from choler adust, should fear.\n[2662]Averroes scoffs at Galen for his reasons, and brings five arguments\nto repel them: so doth Herc. de Saxonia, _Tract. de Melanch. cap. 3._\nassigning other causes, which are copiously censured and confuted by\nAelianus Montaltus, _cap. 5 and 6._ Lod. Mercatus _de Inter. morb. cur.\nlib. 1. cap. 17._ Altomarus, _cap. 7. de mel._ Guianerius, _tract. 15. c.\n1._ Bright _cap. 37._ Laurentius, _cap. 5._ Valesius, _med. cont. lib. 5,\ncon. 1._ [2663]\"Distemperature,\" they conclude, \"makes black juice,\nblackness obscures the spirits, the spirits obscured, cause fear and\nsorrow.\" Laurentius, _cap. 13._ supposeth these black fumes offend\nspecially the diaphragma or midriff, and so _per consequens_ the mind,\nwhich is obscured as [2664]the sun by a cloud. To this opinion of Galen,\nalmost all the Greeks and Arabians subscribe, the Latins new and old,\n_internae, tenebrae offuscant animum, ut externae nocent pueris_, as\nchildren are affrighted in the dark, so are melancholy men at all times,\n[2665]as having the inward cause with them, and still carrying it about.\nWhich black vapours, whether they proceed from the black blood about the\nheart, as T. W. Jes. thinks in his treatise of the passions of the mind, or\nstomach, spleen, midriff, or all the misaffected parts together, it boots\nnot, they keep the mind in a perpetual dungeon, and oppress it with\ncontinual fears, anxieties, sorrows, &c. It is an ordinary thing for such\nas are sound to laugh at this dejected pusillanimity, and those other\nsymptoms of melancholy, to make themselves merry with them, and to wonder\nat such, as toys and trifles, which may be resisted and withstood, if they\nwill themselves: but let him that so wonders, consider with himself, that\nif a man should tell him on a sudden, some of his especial friends were\ndead, could he choose but grieve? Or set him upon a steep rock, where he\nshould be in danger to be precipitated, could he be secure? His heart would\ntremble for fear, and his head be giddy. P. Byaras, _Tract. de pest._ gives\ninstance (as I have said) [2666]\"and put case\" (saith he) \"in one that\nwalks upon a plank, if it lie on the ground, he can safely do it: but if\nthe same plank be laid over some deep water, instead of a bridge, he is\nvehemently moved, and 'tis nothing but his imagination, _forma cadendi\nimpressa_, to which his other members and faculties obey.\" Yea, but you\ninfer, that such men have a just cause to fear, a true object of fear; so\nhave melancholy men an inward cause, a perpetual fume and darkness, causing\nfear, grief, suspicion, which they carry with them, an object which cannot\nbe removed; but sticks as close, and is as inseparable as a shadow to a\nbody, and who can expel or overrun his shadow? Remove heat of the liver, a\ncold stomach, weak spleen: remove those adust humours and vapours arising\nfrom them, black blood from the heart, all outward perturbations, take away\nthe cause, and then bid them not grieve nor fear, or be heavy, dull,\nlumpish, otherwise counsel can do little good; you may as well bid him that\nis sick of an ague not to be a dry; or him that is wounded not to feel\npain.\n\nSuspicion follows fear and sorrow at heels, arising out of the same\nfountain, so thinks [2667]Fracastorius, \"that fear is the cause of\nsuspicion, and still they suspect some treachery, or some secret\nmachination to be framed against them, still they distrust.\" Restlessness\nproceeds from the same spring, variety of fumes make them like and dislike.\nSolitariness, avoiding of light, that they are weary of their lives, hate\nthe world, arise from the same causes, for their spirits and humours are\nopposite to light, fear makes them avoid company, and absent themselves,\nlest they should be misused, hissed at, or overshoot themselves, which\nstill they suspect. They are prone to venery by reason of wind. Angry,\nwaspish, and fretting still, out of abundance of choler, which causeth\nfearful dreams and violent perturbations to them, both sleeping and waking:\nThat they suppose they have no heads, fly, sink, they are pots, glasses,\n&c. is wind in their heads. [2668]Herc. de Saxonia doth ascribe this to the\nseveral motions in the animal spirits, \"their dilation, contraction,\nconfusion, alteration, tenebrosity, hot or cold distemperature,\" excluding\nall material humours. [2669]Fracastorius \"accounts it a thing worthy of\ninquisition, why they should entertain such false conceits, as that they\nhave horns, great noses, that they are birds, beasts,\" &c., why they should\nthink themselves kings, lords, cardinals. For the first, [2670]\nFracastorius gives two reasons: \"One is the disposition of the body; the\nother, the occasion of the fantasy,\" as if their eyes be purblind, their\nears sing, by reason of some cold and rheum, &c. To the second, Laurentius\nanswers, the imagination inwardly or outwardly moved, represents to the\nunderstanding, not enticements only, to favour the passion or dislike, but\na very intensive pleasure follows the passion or displeasure, and the will\nand reason are captivated by delighting in it.\n\nWhy students and lovers are so often melancholy and mad, the philosopher of\n[2671]Conimbra assigns this reason, \"because by a vehement and continual\nmeditation of that wherewith they are affected, they fetch up the spirits\ninto the brain, and with the heat brought with them, they incend it beyond\nmeasure: and the cells of the inner senses dissolve their temperature,\nwhich being dissolved, they cannot perform their offices as they ought.\"\n\nWhy melancholy men are witty, which Aristotle hath long since maintained in\nhis problems; and that [2672]all learned men, famous philosophers, and\nlawgivers, _ad unum fere omnes melancholici_, have still been melancholy,\nis a problem much controverted. Jason Pratensis will have it understood of\nnatural melancholy, which opinion Melancthon inclines to, in his book _de\nAnima_, and Marcilius Ficinus _de san. tuend. lib. 1. cap. 5._ but not\nsimple, for that makes men stupid, heavy, dull, being cold and dry,\nfearful, fools, and solitary, but mixed with the other humours, phlegm only\nexcepted; and they not adust, [2673]but so mixed as that blood he half,\nwith little or no adustion, that they be neither too hot nor too cold.\nAponensis, cited by Melancthon, thinks it proceeds from melancholy adust,\nexcluding all natural melancholy as too cold. Laurentius condemns his\ntenet, because adustion of humours makes men mad, as lime burns when water\nis cast on it. It must be mixed with blood, and somewhat adust, and so that\nold aphorism of Aristotle may be verified, _Nullum magnum ingenium sine\nmixtura dementiae_, no excellent wit without a mixture of madness.\nFracastorius shall decide the controversy, [2674]\"phlegmatic are dull:\nsanguine lively, pleasant, acceptable, and merry, but not witty; choleric\nare too swift in motion, and furious, impatient of contemplation, deceitful\nwits: melancholy men have the most excellent wits, but not all; this humour\nmay be hot or cold, thick, or thin; if too hot, they are furious and mad:\nif too cold, dull, stupid, timorous, and sad: if temperate, excellent,\nrather inclining to that extreme of heat, than cold.\" This sentence of his\nwill agree with that of Heraclitus, a dry light makes a wise mind,\ntemperate heat and dryness are the chief causes of a good wit; therefore,\nsaith Aelian, an elephant is the wisest of all brute beasts, because his\nbrain is driest, _et ob atrae, bilis capiam_: this reason Cardan approves,\n_subtil. l. 12._ Jo. Baptista Silvaticus, a physician of Milan, in his\nfirst controversy, hath copiously handled this question: Rulandus in his\nproblems, Caelius Rhodiginus, _lib. 17._ Valleriola _6to. narrat. med._\nHerc. de Saxonia, _Tract. posth. de mel. cap. 3._ Lodovicus Mercatus, _de\ninter. morb. cur. lib. cap. 17._ Baptista Porta, _Physiog. lib. 1. c. 13._\nand many others.\n\nWeeping, sighing, laughing, itching, trembling, sweating, blushing, hearing\nand seeing strange noises, visions, wind, crudity, are motions of the body,\ndepending upon these precedent motions of the mind: neither are tears,\naffections, but actions (as Scaliger holds) [2675]\"the voice of such as are\nafraid, trembles, because the heart is shaken\" (_Conimb. prob. 6. sec. 3.\nde som._) why they stutter or falter in their speech, Mercurialis and\nMontaltus, _cap. 17._ give like reasons out of Hippocrates, [2676]\"dryness,\nwhich makes the nerves of the tongue torpid.\" Fast speaking (which is a\nsymptom of some few) Aetius will have caused [2677] \"from abundance of\nwind, and swiftness of imagination:\" [2678]\"baldness comes from excess of\ndryness,\" hirsuteness from a dry temperature. The cause of much waking in a\ndry brain, continual meditation, discontent, fears and cares, that suffer\nnot the mind to be at rest, incontinency is from wind, and a hot liver,\nMontanus, _cons. 26._ Rumbling in the guts is caused from wind, and wind\nfrom ill concoction, weakness of natural heat, or a distempered heat and\ncold; [2679]Palpitation of the heart from vapours, heaviness and aching\nfrom the same cause. That the belly is hard, wind is a cause, and of that\nleaping in many parts. Redness of the face, and itching, as if they were\nflea-bitten, or stung with pismires, from a sharp subtle wind. [2680]Cold\nsweat from vapours arising from the hypochondries, which pitch upon the\nskin; leanness for want of good nourishment. Why their appetite is so\ngreat, [2681]Aetius answers: _Os ventris frigescit_, cold in those inner\nparts, cold belly, and hot liver, causeth crudity, and intention proceeds\nfrom perturbations, [2682]our souls for want of spirits cannot attend\nexactly to so many intentive operations, being exhaust, and overswayed by\npassion, she cannot consider the reasons which may dissuade her from such\naffections.\n\n[2683]Bashfulness and blushing, is a passion proper to men alone, and is\nnot only caused for [2684]some shame and ignominy, or that they are guilty\nunto themselves of some foul fact committed, but as [2685]Fracastorius well\ndetermines, _ob defectum proprium, et timorem_, \"from fear, and a conceit\nof our defects; the face labours and is troubled at his presence that sees\nour defects, and nature willing to help, sends thither heat, heat draws the\nsubtlest blood, and so we blush. They that are bold, arrogant, and\ncareless, seldom or never blush, but such as are fearful.\" Anthonius\nLodovicus, in his book _de pudore_, will have this subtle blood to arise in\nthe face, not so much for the reverence of our betters in presence,\n[2686]\"but for joy and pleasure, or if anything at unawares shall pass from\nus, a sudden accident, occurse, or meeting:\" (which Disarius in [2687]\nMacrobius confirms) any object heard or seen, for blind men never blush, as\nDandinus observes, the night and darkness make men impudent. Or that we be\nstaid before our betters, or in company we like not, or if anything molest\nand offend us, _erubescentia_ turns to _rubor_, blushing to a continuate\nredness. [2688]Sometimes the extremity of the ears tingle, and are red,\nsometimes the whole face, _Etsi nihil vitiosum commiseris_, as Lodovicus\nholds: though Aristotle is of opinion, _omnis pudor ex vitio commisso_, all\nshame for some offence. But we find otherwise, it may as well proceed\n[2689]from fear, from force and inexperience, (so [2690]Dandinus holds) as\nvice; a hot liver, saith Duretus (_notis in Hollerium_:) \"from a hot brain,\nfrom wind, the lungs heated, or after drinking of wine, strong drink,\nperturbations,\" &c.\n\nLaughter what it is, saith [2691]Tully, \"how caused, where, and so suddenly\nbreaks out, that desirous to stay it, we cannot, how it comes to possess\nand stir our face, veins, eyes, countenance, mouth, sides, let Democritus\ndetermine.\" The cause that it often affects melancholy men so much, is\ngiven by Gomesius, _lib. 3. de sale genial. cap. 18._ abundance of pleasant\nvapours, which, in sanguine melancholy especially, break from the heart,\n[2692]\"and tickle the midriff, because it is transverse and full of nerves:\nby which titillation the sense being moved, and arteries distended, or\npulled, the spirits from thence move and possess the sides, veins,\ncountenance, eyes.\" See more in Jossius _de risu et fletu_, Vives _3 de\nAnima_. Tears, as Scaliger defines, proceed from grief and pity, [2693]\"or\nfrom the heating of a moist brain, for a dry cannot weep.\"\n\nThat they see and hear so many phantasms, chimeras, noises, visions, &c. as\nFienus hath discoursed at large in his book of imagination, and [2694]\nLavater _de spectris, part. 1. cap. 2. 3. 4._ their corrupt phantasy makes\nthem see and hear that which indeed is neither heard nor seen, _Qui multum\njejunant, aut noctes ducunt insomnes_, they that much fast, or want sleep,\nas melancholy or sick men commonly do, see visions, or such as are\nweak-sighted, very timorous by nature, mad, distracted, or earnestly seek.\n_Sabini quod volunt somniant_, as the saying is, they dream of that they\ndesire. Like Sarmiento the Spaniard, who when he was sent to discover the\nstraits of Magellan, and confine places, by the Prorex of Peru, standing on\nthe top of a hill, _Amaenissimam planitiem despicere sibi visus fuit,\naedificia magnifica, quamplurimos Pagos, alias Turres, splendida Templa_,\nand brave cities, built like ours in Europe, not, saith mine [2695]author,\nthat there was any such thing, but that he was _vanissimus et nimis\ncredulus_, and would fain have had it so. Or as [2696]Lod. Mercatus proves,\nby reason of inward vapours, and humours from blood, choler, &c. diversely\nmixed, they apprehend and see outwardly, as they suppose, divers images,\nwhich indeed are not. As they that drink wine think all runs round, when it\nis in their own brain; so is it with these men, the fault and cause is\ninward, as Galen affirms, [2697]mad men and such as are near death, _quas\nextra se videre putant Imagines, intra oculos habent_, 'tis in their brain,\nwhich seems to be before them; the brain as a concave glass reflects solid\nbodies. _Senes etiam decrepiti cerebrum habent concavum et aridum, ut\nimaginentur se videre_ (saith [2698]Boissardus) _quae non sunt_, old men\nare too frequently mistaken and dote in like case: or as he that looketh\nthrough a piece of red glass, judgeth everything he sees to be red; corrupt\nvapours mounting from the body to the head, and distilling again from\nthence to the eyes, when they have mingled themselves with the watery\ncrystal which receiveth the shadows of things to be seen, make all things\nappear of the same colour, which remains in the humour that overspreads our\nsight, as to melancholy men all is black, to phlegmatic all white, &c. Or\nelse as before the organs corrupt by a corrupt phantasy, as Lemnius, _lib.\n1. cap. 16._ well quotes, [2699]\"cause a great agitation of spirits, and\nhumours, which wander to and fro in all the creeks of the brain, and cause\nsuch apparitions before their eyes.\" One thinks he reads something written\nin the moon, as Pythagoras is said to have done of old, another smells\nbrimstone, hears Cerberus bark: Orestes now mad supposed he saw the furies\ntormenting him, and his mother still ready to run upon him,\n\n[2700] \"O mater obsecro noli me persequi\n        His furiis, aspectu anguineis, horribilibus,\n        Ecce ecce me invadunt, in me jam ruunt;\"\n\nbut Electra told him thus raving in his mad fit, he saw no such sights at\nall, it was but his crazed imagination.\n\n[2701] \"Quiesce, quiesce miser in linteis tuis,\n        Non cernis etenim quae videre te putas.\"\n\nSo Pentheus (in Bacchis Euripidis) saw two suns, two Thebes, his brain\nalone was troubled. Sickness is an ordinary cause of such sights. Cardan,\n_subtil. 8._ _Mens aegra laboribus et jejuniis fracta, facit eos videre,\naudire_, &c. And, Osiander beheld strange visions, and Alexander ab\nAlexandro both, in their sickness, which he relates _de rerum varietat.\nlib. 8. cap. 44._ Albategnius that noble Arabian, on his death-bed, saw a\nship ascending and descending, which Fracastorius records of his friend\nBaptista Tirrianus. Weak sight and a vain persuasion withal, may effect as\nmuch, and second causes concurring, as an oar in water makes a refraction,\nand seems bigger, bended double, &c. The thickness of the air may cause\nsuch effects, or any object not well-discerned in the dark, fear and\nphantasy will suspect to be a ghost, a devil, &c. [2702]_Quod nimis miseri\ntiment, hoc facile credunt_, we are apt to believe, and mistake in such\ncases. Marcellus Donatus, _lib. 2. cap. 1._ brings in a story out of\nAristotle, of one Antepharon which likely saw, wheresoever he was, his own\nimage in the air, as in a glass. Vitellio, _lib. 10. perspect._ hath such\nanother instance of a familiar acquaintance of his, that after the want of\nthree or four nights sleep, as he was riding by a river side, saw another\nriding with him, and using all such gestures as he did, but when more light\nappeared, it vanished. Eremites and anchorites have frequently such absurd\nvisions, revelations by reason of much fasting, and bad diet, many are\ndeceived by legerdemain, as Scot hath well showed in his book of the\ndiscovery of witchcraft, and Cardan, _subtil. 18._ suffites, perfumes,\nsuffumigations, mixed candles, perspective glasses, and such natural\ncauses, make men look as if they were dead, or with horse-heads,\nbull's-horns, and such like brutish shapes, the room full of snakes,\nadders, dark, light, green, red, of all colours, as you may perceive in\nBaptista Porta, Alexis, Albertus, and others, glow-worms, fire-drakes,\nmeteors, _Ignis fatuus_, which Plinius, _lib. 2. cap. 37._ calls Castor and\nPollux, with many such that appear in moorish grounds, about churchyards,\nmoist valleys, or where battles have been fought, the causes of which read\nin Goclenius, Velouris, Fickius, &c. such fears are often done, to frighten\nchildren with squibs, rotten wood, &c. to make folks look as if they were\ndead, [2703]_solito majores_, bigger, lesser, fairer, fouler, _ut astantes\nsine capitibus videantur; aut toti igniti, aut forma daemonum, accipe pilos\ncanis nigri_, &c. saith Albertus; and so 'tis ordinary to see strange\nuncouth sights by catoptrics: who knows not that if in a dark room, the\nlight be admitted at one only little hole, and a paper or glass put upon\nit, the sun shining, will represent on the opposite wall all such objects\nas are illuminated by his rays? with concave and cylinder glasses, we may\nreflect any shape of men, devils, antics, (as magicians most part do, to\ngull a silly spectator in a dark room), we will ourselves, and that hanging\nin the air, when 'tis nothing but such an horrible image as [2704]Agrippa\ndemonstrates, placed in another room. Roger Bacon of old is said to have\nrepresented his own image walking in the air by this art, though no such\nthing appear in his perspectives. But most part it is in the brain that\ndeceives them, although I may not deny, but that oftentimes the devil\ndeludes them, takes his opportunity to suggest, and represent vain objects\nto melancholy men, and such as are ill affected. To these you may add the\nknavish impostures of jugglers, exorcists, mass-priests, and mountebanks,\nof whom Roger Bacon speaks, &c. _de miraculis naturae et artis. cap. 1._\n[2705]they can counterfeit the voices of all birds and brute beasts almost,\nall tones and tunes of men, and speak within their throats, as if they\nspoke afar off, that they make their auditors believe they hear spirits,\nand are thence much astonished and affrighted with it. Besides, those\nartificial devices to overhear their confessions, like that whispering\nplace of Gloucester [2706]with us, or like the duke's place at Mantua in\nItaly, where the sound is reverberated by a concave wall; a reason of which\nBlancanus in his Echometria gives, and mathematically demonstrates.\n\nSo that the hearing is as frequently deluded as the sight, from the same\ncauses almost, as he that hears bells, will make them sound what he list.\n\"As the fool thinketh, so the bell clinketh.\" Theophilus in Galen thought\nhe heard music, from vapours which made his ears sound, &c. Some are\ndeceived by echoes, some by roaring of waters, or concaves and\nreverberation of air in the ground, hollow places and walls. [2707]At\nCadurcum, in Aquitaine, words and sentences are repeated by a strange echo\nto the full, or whatsoever you shall play upon a musical instrument, more\ndistinctly and louder, than they are spoken at first. Some echoes repeat a\nthing spoken seven times, as at Olympus, in Macedonia, as Pliny relates,\n_lib. 36. cap. 15._ Some twelve times, as at Charenton, a village near\nParis, in France. At Delphos, in Greece, heretofore was a miraculous echo,\nand so in many other places. Cardan, _subtil. l. 18_, hath wonderful\nstories of such as have been deluded by these echoes. Blancanus the Jesuit,\nin his Echometria, hath variety of examples, and gives his reader full\nsatisfaction of all such sounds by way of demonstration. [2708]At Barrey,\nan isle in the Severn mouth, they seem to hear a smith's forge; so at\nLipari, and those sulphureous isles, and many such like, which Olaus speaks\nof in the continent of Scandia, and those northern countries. Cardan _de\nrerum var. l. 15, c. 84_, mentioneth a woman, that still supposed she heard\nthe devil call her, and speaking to her, she was a painter's wife in Milan:\nand many such illusions and voices, which proceed most part from a corrupt\nimagination.\n\nWhence it comes to pass, that they prophesy, speak several languages, talk\nof astronomy, and other unknown sciences to them (of which they have been\never ignorant): [2709]I have in brief touched, only this I will here add,\nthat Arculanus, _Bodin. lib. 3, cap. 6, daemon._ and some others, [2710]\nhold as a manifest token that such persons are possessed with the devil; so\ndoth [2711]Hercules de Saxonia, and Apponensis, and fit only to be cured by\na priest. But [2712]Guianerius, [2713]Montaltus, Pomporiatius of Padua, and\nLemnius _lib. 2. cap. 2_, refer it wholly to the ill-disposition of the\n[2714]humour, and that out of the authority of Aristotle _prob. 30. 1_,\nbecause such symptoms are cured by purging; and as by the striking of a\nflint fire is enforced, so by the vehement motion of spirits, they do\n_elicere voces inauditas_, compel strange speeches to be spoken: another\nargument he hath from Plato's _reminiscentia_, which all out as likely as\nthat which [2715]Marsilius Ficinus speaks of his friend Pierleonus; by a\ndivine kind of infusion he understood the secrets of nature, and tenets of\nGrecian and barbarian philosophers, before ever he heard of, saw, or read\ntheir works: but in this I should rather hold with Avicenna and his\nassociates, that such symptoms proceed from evil spirits, which take all\nopportunities of humours decayed, or otherwise to pervert the soul of man:\nand besides, the humour itself is _balneum diaboli_, the devil's bath; and\nas Agrippa proves, doth entice him to seize upon them.\n\n\nSECT. IV. MEMB. I.\n_Prognostics of Melancholy_.\n\nPrognostics, or signs of things to come, are either good or bad. If this\nmalady be not hereditary, and taken at the beginning, there is good hope of\ncure, _recens curationem non habet difficilem_, saith Avicenna, _l. 3, Fen.\n1, Tract. 4, c. 18._ That which is with laughter, of all others is most\nsecure, gentle, and remiss, Hercules de Saxonia. [2716]\"If that evacuation\nof haemorrhoids, or _varices_, which they call the water between the skin,\nshall happen to a melancholy man, his misery is ended,\" Hippocrates _Aphor.\n6, 11._ Galen _l. 6, de morbis vulgar. com. 8_, confirms the same; and to\nthis aphorism of Hippocrates, all the Arabians, new and old Latins\nsubscribe; Montaltus _c. 25_, Hercules de Saxonia, Mercurialis, Vittorius\nFaventinus, &c. Skenkius, _l. 1, observat. med. c. de Mania_, illustrates\nthis aphorism, with an example of one Daniel Federer a coppersmith that was\nlong melancholy, and in the end mad about the 27th year of his age, these\n_varices_ or water began to arise in his thighs, and he was freed from his\nmadness. Marius the Roman was so cured, some, say, though with great pain.\nSkenkius hath some other instances of women that have been helped by\nflowing of their mouths, which before were stopped. That the opening of the\nhaemorrhoids will do as much for men, all physicians jointly signify, so\nthey be voluntary, some say, and not by compulsion. All melancholy are\nbetter after a quartan; [2717]Jobertus saith, scarce any man hath that ague\ntwice; but whether it free him from this malady, 'tis a question; for many\nphysicians ascribe all long agues for especial causes, and a quartan ague\namongst the rest. [2718]Rhasis _cont. lib. 1, tract. 9._ \"When melancholy\ngets out at the superficies of the skin, or settles breaking out in scabs,\nleprosy, morphew, or is purged by stools, or by the urine, or that the\nspleen is enlarged, and those _varices_ appear, the disease is dissolved.\"\nGuianerius, _cap. 5, tract. 15_, adds dropsy, jaundice, dysentery, leprosy,\nas good signs, to these scabs, morphews, and breaking out, and proves it\nout of the 6th of Hippocrates' Aphorisms.\n\nEvil prognostics on the other part. _Inveterata melancholia incurabilis_,\nif it be inveterate, it is [2719]incurable, a common axiom, _aut\ndifficulter curabilis_ as they say that make the best, hardly cured. This\nGalen witnesseth, _l. 3, de loc. affect. cap. 6_, [2720]\"be it in whom it\nwill, or from what cause soever, it is ever long, wayward, tedious, and\nhard to be cured, if once it be habituated.\" As Lucian said of the gout,\nshe was [2721]\"the queen of diseases, and inexorable,\" may we say of\nmelancholy. Yet Paracelsus will have all diseases whatsoever curable, and\nlaughs at them which think otherwise, as T. Erastus _par. 3_, objects to\nhim; although in another place, hereditary diseases he accounts incurable,\nand by no art to be removed. [2722]Hildesheim _spicel. 2, de mel._ holds it\nless dangerous if only [2723]\"imagination be hurt, and not reason,\"\n[2724]\"the gentlest is from blood. Worse from choler adust, but the worst\nof all from melancholy putrefied.\" [2725]Bruel esteems hypochondriacal\nleast dangerous, and the other two species (opposite to Galen) hardest to\nbe cured. [2726]The cure is hard in man, but much more difficult in women.\nAnd both men and women must take notice of that saying of Montanus _consil.\n230, pro Abate Italo_, [2727]\"This malady doth commonly accompany them to\ntheir grave; physicians may ease, and it may lie hid for a time, but they\ncannot quite cure it, but it will return again more violent and sharp than\nat first, and that upon every small occasion or error:\" as in Mercury's\nweather-beaten statue, that was once all over gilt, the open parts were\nclean, yet there was _in fimbriis aurum_, in the chinks a remnant of gold:\nthere will be some relics of melancholy left in the purest bodies (if once\ntainted) not so easily to be rooted out. [2728] Oftentimes it degenerates\ninto epilepsy, apoplexy, convulsions, and blindness: by the authority of\nHippocrates and Galen, [2729]all aver, if once it possess the ventricles of\nthe brain, Frambesarius, and Salust. Salvianus adds, if it get into the\noptic nerves, blindness. Mercurialis, _consil. 20_, had a woman to his\npatient, that from melancholy became epileptic and blind. [2730]If it come\nfrom a cold cause, or so continue cold, or increase, epilepsy; convulsions\nfollow, and blindness, or else in the end they are moped, sottish, and in\nall their actions, speeches, and gestures, ridiculous. [2731]If it come\nfrom a hot cause, they are more furious, and boisterous, and in conclusion\nmad. _Calescentem melancholiam saepius sequitur mania_. [2732]If it heat\nand increase, that is the common event, [2733]_per circuitus, aut semper\ninsanit_, he is mad by fits, or altogether. For as [2734]Sennertus contends\nout of Crato, there is _seminarius ignis_ in this humour, the very seeds of\nfire. If it come from melancholy natural adust, and in excess, they are\noften demoniacal, Montanus.\n\n[2735]Seldom this malady procures death, except (which is the greatest,\nmost grievous calamity, and the misery of all miseries,) they make away\nthemselves, which is a frequent thing, and familiar amongst them. 'Tis\n[2736]Hippocrates' observation, Galen's sentence, _Etsi mortem timent,\ntamen plerumque sibi ipsis mortem consciscunt_, _l. 3. de locis affec. cap.\n7._ The doom of all physicians. 'Tis [2737]Rabbi Moses' Aphorism, the\nprognosticon of Avicenna, Rhasis, Aetius, Gordonius, Valescus, Altomarus,\nSalust. Salvianus, Capivaccius, Mercatus, Hercules de Saxonia, Piso, Bruel,\nFuchsius, all, &c.\n\n[2738] \"Et saepe usque adeo mortis formidine vitae\n        Percipit infelix odium lucisque videndae,\n        Ut sibi consciscat maerenti pectore lethum.\"\n\n       \"And so far forth death's terror doth affright,\n        He makes away himself, and hates the light\n        To make an end of fear and grief of heart,\n        He voluntary dies to ease his smart.\"\n\nIn such sort doth the torture and extremity of his misery torment him, that\nhe can take no pleasure in his life, but is in a manner enforced to offer\nviolence unto himself, to be freed from his present insufferable pains. So\nsome (saith [2739]Fracastorius) \"in fury, but most in despair, sorrow,\nfear, and out of the anguish and vexation of their souls, offer violence to\nthemselves: for their life is unhappy and miserable. They can take no rest\nin the night, nor sleep, or if they do slumber, fearful dreams astonish\nthem.\" In the daytime they are affrighted still by some terrible object,\nand torn in pieces with suspicion, fear, sorrow, discontents, cares, shame,\nanguish, &c. as so many wild horses, that they cannot be quiet an hour, a\nminute of time, but even against their wills they are intent, and still\nthinking of it, they cannot forget it, it grinds their souls day and night,\nthey are perpetually tormented, a burden to themselves, as Job was, they\ncan neither eat, drink or sleep. Psal. cvii. 18. \"Their soul abhorreth all\nmeat, and they are brought to death's door, [2740]being bound in misery and\niron:\" they [2741]curse their stars with Job, [2742]\"and day of their\nbirth, and wish for death:\" for as Pineda and most interpreters hold, Job\nwas even melancholy to despair, and almost [2743]madness itself; they\nmurmur many times against the world, friends, allies, all mankind, even\nagainst God himself in the bitterness of their passion, [2744]_vivere\nnolunt, mori nesciunt_, live they will not, die they cannot. And in the\nmidst of these squalid, ugly, and such irksome days, they seek at last,\nfinding no comfort, [2745]no remedy in this wretched life, to be eased of\nall by death. _Omnia appetunt bonum_, all creatures seek the best, and for\ntheir good as they hope, _sub specie_, in show at least, _vel quia mori\npulchrum putant_ (saith [2746]Hippocrates) _vel quia putant inde se\nmajoribus malis liberari_, to be freed as they wish. Though many times, as\nAesop's fishes, they leap from the frying-pan into the fire itself, yet\nthey hope to be eased by this means: and therefore (saith Felix\n[2747]Platerus) \"after many tedious days at last, either by drowning,\nhanging, or some such fearful end,\" they precipitate or make away\nthemselves: \"many lamentable examples are daily seen amongst us:\" _alius\nante, fores se laqueo suspendit_ (as Seneca notes), _alius se praecipitavit\na tecto, ne dominum stomachantem audiret, alius ne reduceretur a fuga\nferrum redegit in viscera_, \"one hangs himself before his own\ndoor,--another throws himself from the house-top, to avoid his master's\nanger,--a third, to escape expulsion, plunges a dagger into his heart,\"--so\nmany causes there are--_His amor exitio est, furor his_--love, grief,\nanger, madness, and shame, &c. 'Tis a common calamity, [2748]a fatal end to\nthis disease, they are condemned to a violent death, by a jury of\nphysicians, furiously disposed, carried headlong by their tyrannising\nwills, enforced by miseries, and there remains no more to such persons, if\nthat heavenly Physician, by his assisting grace and mercy alone do not\nprevent, (for no human persuasion or art can help) but to be their own\nbutchers, and execute themselves. Socrates his _cicuta_, Lucretia's dagger,\nTimon's halter, are yet to be had; Cato's knife, and Nero's sword are left\nbehind them, as so many fatal engines, bequeathed to posterity, and will be\nused to the world's end, by such distressed souls: so intolerable,\ninsufferable, grievous, and violent is their pain, [2749]so unspeakable and\ncontinuate. One day of grief is an hundred years, as Cardan observes: 'Tis\n_carnificina hominum, angor animi_, as well saith Areteus, a plague of the\nsoul, the cramp and convulsion of the soul, an epitome of hell; and if\nthere be a hell upon earth, it is to be found in a melancholy man's heart.\n\n       \"For that deep torture may be call'd an hell,\n        When more is felt, than one hath power to tell.\"\n\nYea, that which scoffing Lucian said of the gout in jest, I may truly\naffirm of melancholy in earnest.\n\n[2750] \"O triste nomen! o diis odibile\n        Melancholia lacrymosa, Cocyti filia,\n        Tu Tartari specubus opacis edita\n        Erinnys, utero quam Megara suo tulit,\n        Et ab uberibus aluit, cuique parvidae\n        Amarulentum in os lac Alecto dedit,\n        Omnes abominabilem te daemones\n        Produxere in lucem, exitio mortalium. _Et paulo post_\n        Non Jupiter ferit tale telum fulminis,\n        Non ulla sic procella saevit aequoris,\n        Non impetuosi tanta vis est turbinis.\n        An asperos sustineo morsus Cerberi?\n        Num virus Echidnae membra mea depascitur?\n        Aut tunica sanie tincta Nessi sanguinis?\n        Illacrymabile et immedicabile malum hoc.\"\n\n       \"O sad and odious name! a name so fell,\n        Is this of melancholy, brat of hell.\n        There born in hellish darkness doth it dwell,\n        The Furies brought it up, Megara's teat,\n        Alecto gave it bitter milk to eat.\n        And all conspir'd a bane to mortal men,\n        To bring this devil out of that black den.\n        Jupiter's thunderbolt, not storm at sea,\n        Nor whirlwind doth our hearts so much dismay.\n        What? am I bit by that fierce Cerberus?\n        Or stung by [2751]serpent so pestiferous?\n        Or put on shirt that's dipt in Nessus' blood?\n        My pain's past cure; physic can do no good.\"\n\nNo torture of body like unto it, _Siculi non invenere tyranni majus\ntormentum_, no strappadoes, hot irons, Phalaris' bulls,\n\n[2752] \"Nec ira deum tantum, nec tela, nec hostis,\n        Quantum sola noces animis illapsa.\"\n\n       \"Jove's wrath, nor devils can\n        Do so much harm to th' soul of man.\"\n\nAll fears, griefs, suspicions, discontents, imbonites, insuavities are\nswallowed up, and drowned in this Euripus, this Irish sea, this ocean of\nmisery, as so many small brooks; 'tis _coagulum omnium aerumnarum_: which\n[2753]Ammianus applied to his distressed Palladins. I say of our melancholy\nman, he is the cream of human adversity, the [2754] quintessence, and\nupshot; all other diseases whatsoever, are but flea-bitings to melancholy\nin extent: 'Tis the pith of them all, [2755] _Hospitium est calamitatis;\nquid verbis opus est_?\n\n       \"Quamcunque malam rem quaeris, illic reperies:\"\n\n       \"What need more words? 'tis calamities inn,\n        Where seek for any mischief, 'tis within;\"\n\nand a melancholy man is that true Prometheus, which is bound to Caucasus;\nthe true Titius, whose bowels are still by a vulture devoured (as poets\nfeign) for so doth [2756]Lilius Geraldus interpret it, of anxieties, and\nthose griping cares, and so ought it to be understood. In all other\nmaladies, we seek for help, if a leg or an arm ache, through any\ndistemperature or wound, or that we have an ordinary disease, above all\nthings whatsoever, we desire help and health, a present recovery, if by any\nmeans possible it may be procured; we will freely part with all our other\nfortunes, substance, endure any misery, drink bitter potions, swallow those\ndistasteful pills, suffer our joints to be seared, to be cut off, anything\nfor future health: so sweet, so dear, so precious above all other things in\nthis world is life: 'tis that we chiefly desire, long life and happy days,\n[2757]_multos da Jupiter annos_, increase of years all men wish; but to a\nmelancholy man, nothing so tedious, nothing so odious; that which they so\ncarefully seek to preserve [2758]he abhors, he alone; so intolerable are\nhis pains; some make a question, _graviores morbi corporis an animi_,\nwhether the diseases of the body or mind be more grievous, but there is no\ncomparison, no doubt to be made of it, _multo enim saevior longeque est\natrocior animi, quam corporis cruciatus_ (Lem. _l. 1. c. 12._) the diseases\nof the mind are far more grievous.--_Totum hic pro vulnere corpus_, body\nand soul is misaffected here, but the soul especially. So Cardan testifies\n_de rerum var. lib. 8. 40._ [2759]Maximus Tyrius a Platonist, and Plutarch,\nhave made just volumes to prove it. [2760]_Dies adimit aegritudinem\nhominibus_, in other diseases there is some hope likely, but these unhappy\nmen are born to misery, past all hope of recovery, incurably sick, the\nlonger they live the worse they are, and death alone must ease them.\n\nAnother doubt is made by some philosophers, whether it be lawful for a man\nin such extremity of pain and grief, to make away himself: and how these\nmen that so do are to be censured. The Platonists approve of it, that it is\nlawful in such cases, and upon a necessity; Plotinus _l. de beatitud. c.\n7._ and Socrates himself defends it, in Plato's Phaedon, \"if any man labour\nof an incurable disease, he may despatch himself, if it be to his good.\"\nEpicurus and his followers, the cynics and stoics in general affirm it,\nEpictetus and [2761]Seneca amongst the rest, _quamcunque veram esse viam ad\nlibertatem_, any way is allowable that leads to liberty, [2762]\"let us give\nGod thanks, that no man is compelled to live against his will;\" [2763]\n_quid ad hominem claustra, career, custodia? liberum ostium habet_, death\nis always ready and at hand. _Vides illum praecipitem locum, illud flumen_,\ndost thou see that steep place, that river, that pit, that tree, there's\nliberty at hand, _effugia servitutis et doloris sunt_, as that Laconian lad\ncast himself headlong (_non serviam aiebat puer_) to be freed of his\nmisery: every vein in thy body, if these be _nimis operosi exitus_, will\nset thee free, _quid tua refert finem facias an accipias_? there's no\nnecessity for a man to live in misery. _Malum est necessitati vivere; sed\nin necessitate vivere, necessitas nulla est. Ignavus qui sine causa\nmoritur, et stultus qui cum dolore vivit_. _Idem epi. 58._ Wherefore hath\nour mother the earth brought out poisons, saith [2764]Pliny, in so great a\nquantity, but that men in distress might make away themselves? which kings\nof old had ever in a readiness, _ad incerta fortunae venenum sub custode\npromptum_, Livy writes, and executioners always at hand. Speusippes being\nsick was met by Diogenes, and carried on his slaves' shoulders, he made his\nmoan to the philosopher; but I pity thee not, quoth Diogenes, _qui cum\ntalis vivere sustines_, thou mayst be freed when thou wilt, meaning by\ndeath. [2765]Seneca therefore commends Cato, Dido, and Lucretia, for their\ngenerous courage in so doing, and others that voluntarily die, to avoid a\ngreater mischief, to free themselves from misery, to save their honour, or\nvindicate their good name, as Cleopatra did, as Sophonisba, Syphax's wife\ndid, Hannibal did, as Junius Brutus, as Vibius Virus, and those Campanian\nsenators in Livy (_Dec. 3. lib. 6._) to escape the Roman tyranny, that\npoisoned themselves. Themistocles drank bull's blood, rather than he would\nfight against his country, and Demosthenes chose rather to drink poison,\nPublius Crassi _filius_, Censorius and Plancus, those heroical Romans to\nmake away themselves, than to fall into their enemies' hands. How many\nmyriads besides in all ages might I remember, _qui sibi lethum Insontes\npepperere manu_, &c. [2766]Rhasis in the Maccabees is magnified for it,\nSamson's death approved. So did Saul and Jonas sin, and many worthy men and\nwomen, _quorum memoria celebratur in Ecclesia_, saith [2767]Leminchus, for\nkilling themselves to save their chastity and honour, when Rome was taken,\nas Austin instances, _l. 1. de Civit. Dei, cap. 16._ Jerome vindicateth the\nsame in _Ionam_ and Ambrose, _l. 3. de virginitate_ commendeth Pelagia for\nso doing. Eusebius, _lib. 8. cap. 15._ admires a Roman matron for the same\nfact to save herself from the lust of Maxentius the Tyrant. Adelhelmus,\nabbot of Malmesbury, calls them _Beatas virgines quae sic_, &c. Titus\nPomponius Atticus, that wise, discreet, renowned Roman senator, Tully's\ndear friend, when he had been long sick, as he supposed, of an incurable\ndisease, _vitamque produceret ad augendos dolores, sine spe salutis_, was\nresolved voluntarily by famine to despatch himself to be rid of his pain;\nand when as Agrippa, and the rest of his weeping friends earnestly besought\nhim, _osculantes obsecrarent ne id quod natura cogeret, ipse acceleraret_,\nnot to offer violence to himself, \"with a settled resolution he desired\nagain they would approve of his good intent, and not seek to dehort him\nfrom it:\" and so constantly died, _precesque eorum taciturna sua\nobstinatione depressit_. Even so did Corellius Rufus, another grave\nsenator, by the relation of Plinius Secundus, _epist. lib. 1. epist. 12._\nfamish himself to death; _pedibus correptus cum incredibiles cruciatus et\nindignissima tormenta pateretur, a cibis omnino abstinuit_; [2768]neither\nhe nor Hispilla his wife could divert him, but _destinatus mori obstinate\nmagis_, &c. die he would, and die he did. So did Lycurgus, Aristotle, Zeno,\nChrysippus, Empedocles, with myriads, &c. In wars for a man to run rashly\nupon imminent danger, and present death, is accounted valour and\nmagnanimity, [2769]to be the cause of his own, and many a thousand's ruin\nbesides, to commit wilful murder in a manner, of himself and others, is a\nglorious thing, and he shall be crowned for it. The [2770] Massegatae in\nformer times, [2771]Barbiccians, and I know not what nations besides, did\nstifle their old men, after seventy years, to free them from those\ngrievances incident to that age. So did the inhabitants of the island of\nChoa, because their air was pure and good, and the people generally long\nlived, _antevertebant fatum suum, priusquam manci forent, aut imbecillitas\naccederet, papavere vel cicuta_, with poppy or hemlock they prevented\ndeath. Sir Thomas More in his Utopia commends voluntary death, if he be\n_sibi aut aliis molestus_, troublesome to himself or others, ([2772]\n\"especially if to live be a torment to him,) let him free himself with his\nown hands from this tedious life, as from a prison, or suffer himself to be\nfreed by others.\" [2773]And 'tis the same tenet which Laertius relates of\nZeno, of old, _Juste sapiens sibi mortem consciscit, si in acerbis\ndoloribus versetur, membrorum mutilatione aut morbis aegre curandis_, and\nwhich Plato _9. de legibus_ approves, if old age, poverty, ignominy, &c.\noppress, and which Fabius expresseth in effect. (_Praefat. 7. Institut_.)\n_Nemo nisi sua culpa diu dolet_. It is an ordinary thing in China, (saith\nMat. Riccius the Jesuit,) [2774]\"if they be in despair of better fortunes,\nor tired and tortured with misery, to bereave themselves of life, and many\ntimes, to spite their enemies the more, to hang at their door.\" Tacitus the\nhistorian, Plutarch the philosopher, much approve a voluntary departure,\nand Aust. _de civ. Dei, l. 1. c. 29._ defends a violent death, so that it\nbe undertaken in a good cause, _nemo sic mortuus, qui non fuerat_\n_aliquando moriturus_; _quid autem interest, quo mortis genere vita ista\nfiniatur, quando ille cui finitur, iterum mori non cogitur_? &c. [2775]no\nman so voluntarily dies, but _volens nolens_, he must die at last, and our\nlife is subject to innumerable casualties, who knows when they may happen,\n_utrum satius est unam perpeti moriendo, an omnes timere vivendo_, [2776]\nrather suffer one, than fear all. \"Death is better than a bitter life,\"\nEccl. xxx. 17. [2777]and a harder choice to live in fear, than by once\ndying, to be freed from all. Theombrotus Ambraciotes persuaded I know not\nhow many hundreds of his auditors, by a luculent oration he made of the\nmiseries of this, and happiness of that other life, to precipitate\nthemselves. And having read Plato's divine tract _de anima_, for example's\nsake led the way first. That neat epigram of Callimachus will tell you as\nmuch,\n\n[2778] \"Jamque vale Soli cum diceret Ambrociotes,\n          In Stygios fertur desiluisse lacus,\n        Morte nihil dignum passus: sed forte Platonis\n          Divini eximum de nece legit opus.\"\n\n[2779]Calenus and his Indians hated of old to die a natural death: the\nCircumcellians and Donatists, loathing life, compelled others to make them\naway, with many such: [2780]but these are false and pagan positions,\nprofane stoical paradoxes, wicked examples, it boots not what heathen\nphilosophers determine in this kind, they are impious, abominable, and upon\na wrong ground. \"No evil is to be done that good may come of it;\" _reclamat\nChristus, reclamat Scriptura_, God, and all good men are [2781]against it:\nHe that stabs another, can kill his body; but he that stabs himself, kills\nhis own soul. [2782]_Male meretur, qui dat mendico, quod edat_; _nam et\nillud quod dat, perit_; _et illi producit vitam ad miseriam_: he that gives\na beggar an alms (as that comical poet said) doth ill, because he doth but\nprolong his miseries. But Lactantius _l. 6. c. 7. de vero cultu_, calls it\na detestable opinion, and fully confutes it, _lib. 3. de sap. cap. 18._ and\nS. Austin, _epist. 52. ad Macedonium, cap. 61. ad Dulcitium Tribunum_: so\ndoth Hierom to Marcella of Blesilla's death, _Non recipio tales animas_,\n&c., he calls such men _martyres stultae Philosophiae_: so doth Cyprian _de\nduplici martyrio; Si qui sic moriantur, aut infirmitas, aut ambitio, aut\ndementia cogit eos_; 'tis mere madness so to do, [2783]_furore est ne\nmoriare mori_. To this effect writes Arist. _3. Ethic._ Lipsius _Manuduc.\nad Stoicam Philosophiaem lib. 3. dissertat. 23._ but it needs no\nconfutation. This only let me add, that in some cases, those [2784]hard\ncensures of such as offer violence to their own persons, or in some\ndesperate fit to others, which sometimes they do, by stabbing, slashing,\n&c. are to be mitigated, as in such as are mad, beside themselves for the\ntime, or found to have been long melancholy, and that in extremity, they\nknow not what they do, deprived of reason, judgment, all, [2785]as a ship\nthat is void of a pilot, must needs impinge upon the next rock or sands,\nand suffer shipwreck. [2786]P. Forestus hath a story of two melancholy\nbrethren, that made away themselves, and for so foul a fact, were\naccordingly censured to be infamously buried, as in such cases they use: to\nterrify others, as it did the Milesian virgins of old; but upon farther\nexamination of their misery and madness, the censure was [2787]revoked, and\nthey were solemnly interred, as Saul was by David, 2 Sam. ii. 4. and Seneca\nwell adviseth, _Irascere interfectori, sed miserere interfecti_; be justly\noffended with him as he was a murderer, but pity him now as a dead man.\nThus of their goods and bodies we can dispose; but what shall become of\ntheir souls, God alone can tell; his mercy may come _inter pontem et\nfontem, inter gladium et jugulum_, betwixt the bridge and the brook, the\nknife and the throat. _Quod cuiquam contigit, quivis potest_: Who knows how\nhe may be tempted? It is his case, it may be thine: [2788]_Quae sua sors\nhodie est, eras fore vestra potest._ We ought not to be so rash and\nrigorous in our censures, as some are; charity will judge and hope the\nbest: God be merciful unto us all.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SYNOPSIS OF THE SECOND PARTITION.\n\nCure of melancholy is either\n\n  _Sect 1._ General to all, which contains\n\n      Unlawful means forbidden,\n\n          _Memb. 1._ From the devil, magicians, witches, &c., by charms,\n            spells, incantations, &c.\n\n              _Quest. 1._ Whether they can cure this, or other such like\n                diseases?\n              _Quest. 2._ Whether, if they can so cure, it be lawful to\n                seek to them for help?\n\n      or Lawful means, which are\n\n          _Memb. 2._ Immediately from God, _a Jove principium_ by prayer\n            &c.\n              _Memb. 3.

Of these\ncures some be lawful, some again unlawful, which though frequent, familiar,\nand often used, yet justly censured, and to be controverted. As first,\nwhether by these diabolical means, which are commonly practised by the\ndevil and his ministers, sorcerers, witches, magicians, &c., by spells,\ncabilistical words, charms, characters, images, amulets, ligatures,\nphilters, incantations, &c., this disease and the like may be cured? and if\nthey may, whether it be lawful to make use of them, those magnetical cures,\nor for our good to seek after such means in any case? The first, whether\nthey can do any such cures, is questioned amongst many writers, some\naffirming, some denying. Valesius, _cont. med. lib. 5. cap. 6. Malleus\nMaleficar_, Heurnius, _lib. 3. pract. med. cap. 28._ Caelius _lib. 16. c.\n16._ Delrio _Tom. 3._ Wierus _lib. 2. de praestig. daem._ Libanius Lavater\n_de spect. part. 2. cap. 7._ Holbrenner the Lutheran in Pistorium, Polydore\nVirg. _l. 1. de prodig._ Tandlerus, Lemnius, (Hippocrates and Avicenna\namongst the rest) deny that spirits or devils have any power over us, and\nrefer all with Pomponatius of Padua to natural causes and humours. Of the\nother opinion are Bodinus _Daemonamantiae, lib. 3, cap. 2._ Arnoldus,\nMarcellus Empyricus, I. Pistorius, Paracelsus _Apodix. Magic._ Agrippa\n_lib. 2. de occult. Philos. cap. 36. 69. 71. 72. et l. 3, c. 23, et 10._\nMarcilius Ficinus _de vit. coelit. compar. cap. 13. 15. 18. 21. &c._\nGaleottus _de promiscua doct. cap. 24._ Jovianus Pontanus _Tom. 2. Plin.\nlib. 28, c. 2._ Strabo, _lib. 15._ Geog. Leo Suavius: Goclenius _de ung.\narmar._ Oswoldus Crollius, Ernestus Burgravius, Dr. Flud, &c. Cardan _de\nsubt._ brings many proofs out of Ars Notoria, and Solomon's decayed works,\nold Hermes, Artefius, Costaben Luca, Picatrix, &c. that such cures may be\ndone. They can make fire it shall not burn, fetch back thieves or stolen\ngoods, show their absent faces in a glass, make serpents lie still, stanch\nblood, salve gouts, epilepsies, biting of mad dogs, toothache, melancholy,\n_et omnia mundi mala_, make men immortal, young again as the [2791]Spanish\nmarquis is said to have done by one of his slaves, and some, which jugglers\nin [2792]China maintain still (as Tragaltius writes) that they can do by\ntheir extraordinary skill in physic, and some of our modern chemists by\ntheir strange limbecks, by their spells, philosopher's stones and charms.\n[2793]\"Many doubt,\" saith Nicholas Taurellus, \"whether the devil can cure\nsuch diseases he hath not made, and some flatly deny it, howsoever common\nexperience confirms to our astonishment, that magicians can work such\nfeats, and that the devil without impediment can penetrate through all the\nparts of our bodies, and cure such maladies by means to us unknown.\" Daneus\nin his tract _de Sortiariis_ subscribes to this of Taurellus; Erastus _de\nlamiis_, maintaineth as much, and so do most divines, out of their\nexcellent knowledge and long experience they can commit [2794]_agentes cum\npatientibus, colligere semina rerum, eaque materiae applicare_, as Austin\ninfers _de Civ. Dei et de Trinit. lib. 3. cap. 7. et 8._ they can work\nstupendous and admirable conclusions; we see the effects only, but not the\ncauses of them. Nothing so familiar as to hear of such cures. Sorcerers are\ntoo common; cunning men, wizards, and white-witches, as they call them, in\nevery village, which if they be sought unto, will help almost all\ninfirmities of body and mind, _Servatores_ in Latin, and they have commonly\nSt. Catherine's wheel printed in the roof of their mouth, or in some other\npart about them, _resistunt incantatorum praestigiis_ ([2795]Boissardus\nwrites) _morbos a sagis motos propulsant_ &c., that to doubt of it any\nlonger, [2796]\"or not to believe, were to run into that other sceptical\nextreme of incredulity,\" saith Taurellus. Leo Suavius in his comment upon\nParacelsus seems to make it an art, which ought to be approved; Pistorius\nand others stiffly maintain the use of charms, words, characters, &c. _Ars\nvera est, sed pauci artifices reperiuntur_; the art is true, but there be\nbut a few that have skill in it. Marcellius Donatus _lib. 2. de hist, mir.\ncap. 1._ proves out of Josephus' eight books of antiquities, that\n[2797]\"Solomon so cured all the diseases of the mind by spells, charms, and\ndrove away devils, and that Eleazer did as much before Vespasian.\" Langius\nin his _med. epist._ holds Jupiter Menecrates, that did so many stupendous\ncures in his time, to have used this art, and that he was no other than a\nmagician. Many famous cures are daily done in this kind, the devil is an\nexpert physician, as Godelman calls him, _lib. 1. cap. 18._ and God permits\noftentimes these witches and magicians to produce such effects, as Lavater\n_cap. 3. lib. 8. part. 3. cap. 1._ Polid. Virg. _lib. 1. de prodigiis_,\nDelrio and others admit. Such cures may be done, and as Paracels. _Tom. 4.\nde morb. ament._ stiffly maintains, [2798]\"they cannot otherwise be cured\nbut by spells, seals, and spiritual physic.\" [2799]Arnoldus, _lib. de\nsigillis_, sets down the making of them, so doth Rulandus and many others.\n\n_Hoc posito_, they can effect such cures, the main question is, whether it\nbe lawful in a desperate case to crave their help, or ask a wizard's\nadvice. 'Tis a common practice of some men to go first to a witch, and then\nto a physician, if one cannot the other shall, _Flectere si nequeant\nsuperos Acheronta movebunt_. [2800]\"It matters not,\" saith Paracelsus,\n\"whether it be God or the devil, angels, or unclean spirits cure him, so\nthat he be eased.\" If a man fall into a ditch, as he prosecutes it, what\nmatter is it whether a friend or an enemy help him out? and if I be\ntroubled with such a malady, what care I whether the devil himself, or any\nof his ministers by God's permission, redeem me? He calls a [2801]\nmagician, God's minister and his vicar, applying that of _vos estis dii_\nprofanely to them, for which he is lashed by T. Erastus _part. 1. fol. 45._\nAnd elsewhere he encourageth his patients to have a good faith, [2802] \"a\nstrong imagination, and they shall find the effects: let divines say to the\ncontrary what they will.\" He proves and contends that many diseases cannot\notherwise be cured. _Incantatione orti incantatione curari debent_; if they\nbe caused by incantation, [2803]they must be cured by incantation.\nConstantinus _lib. 4._ approves of such remedies: Bartolus the lawyer,\nPeter Aerodius _rerum Judic. lib. 3. tit. 7._ Salicetus Godefridus, with\nothers of that sect, allow of them; _modo sint ad sanitatem quae a magis\nfiunt, secus non_, so they be for the parties good, or not at all. But\nthese men are confuted by Remigius, Bodinus, _daem. lib. 3. cap 2._\nGodelmanus _lib. 1. cap. 8_, Wierus, Delrio _lib. 6. quaest. 2. tom. 3.\nmag. inquis._ Erastus _de Lamiis_; all our [2804]divines, schoolmen, and\nsuch as write cases of conscience are against it, the scripture itself\nabsolutely forbids it as a mortal sin, Levit. cap. xviii. xix. xx. Deut.\nxviii. &c. Rom. viii. 19. \"Evil is not to be done, that good may come of\nit.\" Much better it were for such patients that are so troubled, to endure\na little misery in this life, than to hazard their souls' health for ever,\nand as Delrio counselleth, [2805]\"much better die, than be so cured.\" Some\ntake upon them to expel devils by natural remedies, and magical exorcisms,\nwhich they seem to approve out of the practice of the primitive church, as\nthat above cited of Josephus, Eleazer, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Austin.\nEusebius makes mention of such, and magic itself hath been publicly\nprofessed in some universities, as of old in Salamanca in Spain, and Krakow\nin Poland: but condemned anno 1318, by the chancellor and university of\n[2806]Paris. Our pontifical writers retain many of these adjurations and\nforms of exorcisms still in the church; besides those in baptism used, they\nexorcise meats, and such as are possessed, as they hold, in Christ's name.\nRead Hieron. Mengus _cap. 3._ Pet. Tyreus, _part. 3. cap. 8._ What\nexorcisms they prescribe, besides those ordinary means of [2807]\"fire\nsuffumigations, lights, cutting the air with swords,\" _cap. 57._ herbs,\nodours: of which Tostatus treats, _2. Reg. cap. 16. quaest. 43_, you shall\nfind many vain and frivolous superstitious forms of exorcisms among them,\nnot to be tolerated, or endured.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n_Lawful Cures, first from God_.\n\nBeing so clearly evinced, as it is, all unlawful cures are to be refused,\nit remains to treat of such as are to be admitted, and those are commonly\nsuch which God hath appointed, [2808]by virtue of stones, herbs, plants,\nmeats, and the like, which are prepared and applied to our use, by art and\nindustry of physicians, who are the dispensers of such treasures for our\ngood, and to be [2809]\"honoured for necessities' sake,\" God's intermediate\nministers, to whom in our infirmities we are to seek for help. Yet not so\nthat we rely too much, or wholly upon them: _a Jove principium_, we must\nfirst begin with [2810]prayer, and then use physic; not one without the\nother, but both together. To pray alone, and reject ordinary means, is to\ndo like him in Aesop, that when his cart was stalled, lay flat on his back,\nand cried aloud help Hercules, but that was to little purpose, except as\nhis friend advised him, _rotis tute ipse annitaris_, he whipped his horses\nwithal, and put his shoulder to the wheel. God works by means, as Christ\ncured the blind man with clay and spittle: _Orandum est ut sit mens sana in\ncorpore sano_. As we must pray for health of body and mind, so we must use\nour utmost endeavours to preserve and continue it. Some kind of devils are\nnot cast out but by fasting and prayer, and both necessarily required, not\none without the other. For all the physic we can use, art, excellent\nindustry, is to no purpose without calling upon God, _nil juvat immensos\nCratero promittere montes_: it is in vain to seek for help, run, ride,\nexcept God bless us.\n\n[2811]  ------\"non Siculi dapes\n        Dulcem elaborabunt saporem.\n        Non animum cytheraeve cantus.\"\n\n[2812] \"Non domus et fundus, non aeris acervus et auri\n        Aegroto possunt domino deducere febres.\"\n\n[2813] \"With house, with land, with money, and with gold,\n        The master's fever will not be controll'd.\"\n\nWe must use our prayer and physic both together: and so no doubt but our\nprayers will be available, and our physic take effect. 'Tis that Hezekiah\npractised, 2 King. xx. Luke the Evangelist: and which we are enjoined,\nColoss. iv. not the patient only, but the physician himself. Hippocrates, a\nheathen, required this in a good practitioner, and so did Galen, _lib. de\nPlat. et Hipp. dog. lib. 9. cap. 15._ and in that tract of his, _an mores\nsequantur temp. cor. ca. 11._. 'tis a rule which he doth inculcate, [2814]\nand many others. Hyperius in his first book _de sacr. script. lect._\nspeaking of that happiness and good success which all physicians desire and\nhope for in their cures, [2815]\"tells them that it is not to be expected,\nexcept with a true faith they call upon God, and teach their patients to do\nthe like.\" The council of Lateran, _Canon 22._ decreed they should do so:\nthe fathers of the church have still advised as much: whatsoever thou\ntakest in hand (saith [2816]Gregory) \"let God be of thy counsel, consult\nwith him; that healeth those that are broken in heart, (Psal. cxlvii. 3.)\nand bindeth up their sores.\" Otherwise as the prophet Jeremiah, cap. xlvi.\n11. denounced to Egypt, In vain shalt thou use many medicines, for thou\nshalt have no health. It is the same counsel which [2817]Comineus that\npolitic historiographer gives to all Christian princes, upon occasion of\nthat unhappy overthrow of Charles Duke of Burgundy, by means of which he\nwas extremely melancholy, and sick to death: insomuch that neither physic\nnor persuasion could do him any good, perceiving his preposterous error\nbelike, adviseth all great men in such cases, [2818]\"to pray first to God\nwith all submission and penitency, to confess their sins, and then to use\nphysic.\" The very same fault it was, which the prophet reprehends in Asa\nking of Judah, that he relied more on physic than on God, and by all means\nwould have him to amend it. And 'tis a fit caution to be observed of all\nother sorts of men. The prophet David was so observant of this precept,\nthat in his greatest misery and vexation of mind, he put this rule first in\npractice. Psal. lxxvii. 3. \"When I am in heaviness, I will think on God.\"\nPsal. lxxxvi. 4. \"Comfort the soul of thy servant, for unto thee I lift up\nmy soul:\" and verse 7. \"In the day of trouble will I call upon thee, for\nthou hearest me.\" Psal. liv. 1. \"Save me, O God, by thy name,\" &c. Psal.\nlxxxii. Psal. xx. And 'tis the common practice of all good men, Psal. cvii.\n13. \"when their heart was humbled with heaviness, they cried to the Lord in\ntheir troubles, and he delivered them from their distress.\" And they have\nfound good success in so doing, as David confesseth, Psal. xxx. 12. \"Thou\nhast turned my mourning into joy, thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded\nme with gladness.\" Therefore he adviseth all others to do the like, Psal.\nxxxi. 24. \"All ye that trust in the Lord, be strong, and he shall establish\nyour heart.\" It is reported by [2819]Suidas, speaking of Hezekiah, that\nthere was a great book of old, of King Solomon's writing, which contained\nmedicines for all manner of diseases, and lay open still as they came into\nthe temple: but Hezekiah king of Jerusalem, caused it to be taken away,\nbecause it made the people secure, to neglect their duty in calling and\nrelying upon God, out of a confidence on those remedies. [2820]Minutius\nthat worthy consul of Rome in an oration he made to his soldiers, was much\noffended with them, and taxed their ignorance, that in their misery called\nmore on him than upon God. A general fault it is all over the world, and\nMinutius's speech concerns us all, we rely more on physic, and seek oftener\nto physicians, than to God himself. As much faulty are they that prescribe,\nas they that ask, respecting wholly their gain, and trusting more to their\nordinary receipts and medicines many times, than to him that made them. I\nwould wish all patients in this behalf, in the midst of their melancholy,\nto remember that of Siracides, Ecc. i. 11. and 12. \"The fear of the Lord is\nglory and gladness, and rejoicing. The fear of the Lord maketh a merry\nheart, and giveth gladness, and joy, and long life:\" and all such as\nprescribe physic, to begin _in nomine Dei_, as [2821]Mesue did, to imitate\nLaelius a Fonte Eugubinus, that in all his consultations, still concludes\nwith a prayer for the good success of his business; and to remember that of\nCreto one of their predecessors, _fuge avaritiam, et sine oratione et\ninvocations Dei nihil facias_ avoid covetousness, and do nothing without\ninvocation upon God.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Whether it be lawful to seek to Saints for Aid in this Disease_.\n\nThat we must pray to God, no man doubts; but whether we should pray to\nsaints in such cases, or whether they can do us any good, it may be\nlawfully controverted. Whether their images, shrines, relics, consecrated\nthings, holy water, medals, benedictions, those divine amulets, holy\nexorcisms, and the sign of the cross, be available in this disease? The\npapists on the one side stiffly maintain how many melancholy, mad,\ndemoniacal persons are daily cured at St. Anthony's Church in Padua, at St.\nVitus' in Germany, by our Lady of Loretto in Italy, our Lady of Sichem in\nthe Low Countries: [2822]_Quae et caecis lumen, aegris salutem, mortuis\nvitam, claudis gressum reddit, omnes morbos corporis, animi, curat, et in\nipsos daemones imperium exercet_; she cures halt, lame, blind, all diseases\nof body and mind, and commands the devil himself, saith Lipsius.\n\"twenty-five thousand in a day come thither,\" [2823]_quis nisi numen in\nillum locum sic induxit_; who brought them? _in auribus, in oculis omnium\ngesta, novae novitia_; new news lately done, our eyes and ears are full of\nher cures, and who can relate them all? They have a proper saint almost for\nevery peculiar infirmity: for poison, gouts, agues, Petronella: St. Romanus\nfor such as are possessed; Valentine for the falling sickness; St. Vitus\nfor madmen, &c. and as of old [2824]Pliny reckons up Gods for all diseases,\n(_Febri fanum dicalum est_) Lilius Giraldus repeats many of her ceremonies:\nall affections of the mind were heretofore accounted gods, [2825]love, and\nsorrow, virtue, honour, liberty, contumely, impudency, had their temples,\ntempests, seasons, _Crepitus Ventris, dea Vacuna, dea Cloacina_, there was\na goddess of idleness, a goddess of the draught, or jakes, Prema, Premunda,\nPriapus, bawdy gods, and gods for all [2826] offices. Varro reckons up\n30,000 gods: Lucian makes Podagra the gout a goddess, and assigns her\npriests and ministers: and melancholy comes not behind; for as Austin\nmentioneth, _lib. 4. de Civit. Dei, cap. 9._ there was of old _Angerona\ndea_, and she had her chapel and feasts, to whom (saith [2827]Macrobius)\nthey did offer sacrifice yearly, that she might be pacified as well as the\nrest. 'Tis no new thing, you see this of papists; and in my judgment, that\nold doting Lipsius might have fitter dedicated his [2828]pen after all his\nlabours, to this our goddess of melancholy, than to his _Virgo Halensis_,\nand been her chaplain, it would have become him better: but he, poor man,\nthought no harm in that which he did, and will not be persuaded but that he\ndoth well, he hath so many patrons, and honourable precedents in the like\nkind, that justify as much, as eagerly, and more than he there saith of his\nlady and mistress: read but superstitious Coster and Gretser's Tract _de\nCruce_, Laur. Arcturus _Fanteus de Invoc. Sanct._ Bellarmine, Delrio _dis.\nmag. tom. 3. l. 6. quaest. 2. sect. 3._ Greg. Tolosanus _tom. 2. lib. 8.\ncap. 24._ Syntax. Strozius Cicogna _lib. 4. cap. 9._ Tyreus, Hieronymus\nMengus, and you shall find infinite examples of cures done in this kind, by\nholy waters, relics, crosses, exorcisms, amulets, images, consecrated\nbeads, &c. Barradius the Jesuit boldly gives it out, that Christ's\ncountenance, and the Virgin Mary's, would cure melancholy, if one had\nlooked steadfastly on them. P. Morales the Spaniard in his book _de pulch.\nJes. et Mar._ confirms the same out of Carthusianus, and I know not whom,\nthat it was a common proverb in those days, for such as were troubled in\nmind to say, _eamus ad videndum filium Mariae_, let us see the son of Mary,\nas they now do post to St. Anthony's in Padua, or to St. Hilary's at\nPoitiers in France. [2829] In a closet of that church, there is at this day\nSt. Hilary's bed to be seen, \"to which they bring all the madmen in the\ncountry, and after some prayers and other ceremonies, they lay them down\nthere to sleep, and so they recover.\" It is an ordinary thing in those\nparts, to send all their madmen to St. Hilary's cradle. They say the like\nof St. Tubery in [2830] another place. Giraldus Cambrensis _Itin. Camb. c.\n1._ tells strange stories of St. Ciricius' staff, that would cure this and\nall other diseases. Others say as much (as [2831]Hospinian observes) of the\nthree kings of Cologne; their names written in parchment, and hung about a\npatient's neck, with the sign of the cross, will produce like effects. Read\nLippomanus, or that golden legend of Jacobus de Voragine, you shall have\ninfinite stories, or those new relations of our [2832]Jesuits in Japan and\nChina, of Mat. Riccius, Acosta, Loyola, Xaverius's life, &c. Jasper Belga,\na Jesuit, cured a mad woman by hanging St. John's gospel about her neck,\nand many such. Holy water did as much in Japan, &c. Nothing so familiar in\ntheir works, as such examples.\n\nBut we on the other side seek to God alone. We say with David, Psal. xlvi.\n1. \"God is our hope and strength, and help in trouble, ready to be found.\"\nFor their catalogue of examples, we make no other answer, but that they are\nfalse fictions, or diabolical illusions, counterfeit miracles. We cannot\ndeny but that it is an ordinary thing on St. Anthony's day in Padua, to\nbring diverse madmen and demoniacal persons to be cured: yet we make a\ndoubt whether such parties be so affected indeed, but prepared by their\npriests, by certain ointments and drams, to cozen the commonalty, as [2833]\nHildesheim well saith; the like is commonly practised in Bohemia as\nMathiolus gives us to understand in his preface to his comment upon\nDioscorides. But we need not run so far for examples in this kind, we have\na just volume published at home to this purpose. [2834]\"A declaration of\negregious popish impostures, to withdraw the hearts of religious men under\nthe pretence of casting out of devils, practised by Father Edmunds, alias\nWeston, a Jesuit, and divers Romish priests, his wicked associates,\" with\nthe several parties' names, confessions, examinations, &c. which were\npretended to be possessed. But these are ordinary tricks only to get\nopinion and money, mere impostures. Aesculapius of old, that counterfeit\nGod, did as many famous cures; his temple (as [2835]Strabo relates) was\ndaily full of patients, and as many several tables, inscriptions, pendants,\ndonories, &c. to be seen in his church, as at this day our Lady of\nLoretto's in Italy. It was a custom long since,\n\n        ------\"suspendisse potenti\n        Vestimenta maris deo.\"[2836] _Hor. Od. 1. lib. 5. Od._\n\nTo do the like, in former times they were seduced and deluded as they are\nnow. 'Tis the same devil still, called heretofore Apollo, Mars, Neptune,\nVenus, Aesculapius, &c. as [2837]Lactantius _lib. 2. de orig. erroris, c.\n17._ observes. The same Jupiter and those bad angels are now worshipped and\nadored by the name of St. Sebastian, Barbara, &c. Christopher and George\nare come in their places. Our lady succeeds Venus (as they use her in many\noffices), the rest are otherwise supplied, as [2838]Lavater writes, and so\nthey are deluded. [2839]\"And God often winks at these impostures, because\nthey forsake his word, and betake themselves to the devil, as they do that\nseek after holy water, crosses,\" &c. Wierus, _lib. 4. cap. 3._ What can\nthese men plead for themselves more than those heathen gods, the same cures\ndone by both, the same spirit that seduceth; but read more of the Pagan\ngod's effects in Austin _de Civitate Dei, l. 10. cap. 6._ and of\nAesculapius especially in Cicogna _l. 3. cap. 8._ or put case they could\nhelp, why should we rather seek to them, than to Christ himself, since that\nhe so kindly invites us unto him, \"Come unto me all ye that are heavy\nladen, and I will ease you,\" Mat. xi. and we know that there is one God,\n\"one Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ,\" (1 Tim. ii. 5) \"who gave\nhimself a ransom for all men.\" We know that \"we have an [2840] advocate\nwith the Father, Jesus Christ\" (1 Joh. ii. 1.) that there is no \"other name\nunder heaven, by which we can be saved, but by his,\" who is always ready to\nhear us, and sits at the right hand of God, and from [2841] whom we can\nhave no repulse, _solus vult, solus potest, curat universos tanquam\nsingulos, et [2842]unumquemque nostrum et solum_, we are all as one to him,\nhe cares for us all as one, and why should we then seek to any other but to\nhim.\n\n\nMEMB. IV.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Physician, Patient, Physic_.\n\nOf those diverse gifts which our apostle Paul saith God hath bestowed on\nman, this of physic is not the least, but most necessary, and especially\nconducing to the good of mankind. Next therefore to God in all our\nextremities (\"for of the most high cometh healing,\" Ecclus. xxxviii. 2.) we\nmust seek to, and rely upon the Physician, [2843]who is _Manus Dei_, saith\nHierophilus, and to whom he hath given knowledge, that he might be\nglorified in his wondrous works. \"With such doth he heal men, and take away\ntheir pains,\" Ecclus. xxxviii. 6. 7. \"when thou hast need of him, let him\nnot go from thee. The hour may come that their enterprises may have good\nsuccess,\" ver. 13. It is not therefore to be doubted, that if we seek a\nphysician as we ought, we may be eased of our infirmities, such a one I\nmean as is sufficient, and worthily so called; for there be many\nmountebanks, quacksalvers, empirics, in every street almost, and in every\nvillage, that take upon them this name, make this noble and profitable art\nto be evil spoken of and contemned, by reason of these base and illiterate\nartificers: but such a physician I speak of, as is approved, learned,\nskilful, honest, &c., of whose duty Wecker, _Antid. cap. 2._ and _Syntax.\nmed._ Crato, Julius Alexandrinus _medic._ Heurnius _prax. med. lib. 3. cap.\n1._ &c. treat at large. For this particular disease, him that shall take\nupon him to cure it, [2844]Paracelsus will have to be a magician, a\nchemist, a philosopher, an astrologer; Thurnesserus, Severinus the Dane,\nand some other of his followers, require as much: \"many of them cannot be\ncured but by magic.\" [2845]Paracelsus is so stiff for those chemical\nmedicines, that in his cures he will admit almost of no other physic,\nderiding in the mean time Hippocrates, Galen, and all their followers: but\nmagic, and all such remedies I have already censured, and shall speak of\nchemistry [2846]elsewhere. Astrology is required by many famous physicians,\nby Ficinus, Crato, Fernelius; [2847]doubted of, and exploded by others: I\nwill not take upon me to decide the controversy myself, Johannes Hossurtus,\nThomas Boderius, and Maginus in the preface to his mathematical physic,\nshall determine for me. Many physicians explode astrology in physic (saith\nhe), there is no use of it, _unam artem ac quasi temerarium insectantur, ac\ngloriam sibi ab ejus imperitia, aucupari_: but I will reprove physicians by\nphysicians, that defend and profess it, Hippocrates, Galen, Avicen. &c.,\nthat count them butchers without it, _homicidas medicos Astrologiae\nignaros_, &c. Paracelsus goes farther, and will have his physician\n[2848]predestinated to this man's cure, this malady; and time of cure, the\nscheme of each geniture inspected, gathering of herbs, of administering\nastrologically observed; in which Thurnesserus and some iatromathematical\nprofessors, are too superstitious in my judgment. [2849]\"Hellebore will\nhelp, but not alway, not given by every physician,\" &c. but these men are\ntoo peremptory and self-conceited as I think. But what do I do, interposing\nin that which is beyond my reach? A blind man cannot judge of colours, nor\nI peradventure of these things. Only thus much I would require, honesty in\nevery physician, that he be not over-careless or covetous, harpy-like to\nmake a prey of his patient; _Carnificis namque est_ (as [2850]Wecker notes)\n_inter ipsos cruciatus ingens precium exposcere_, as a hungry chirurgeon\noften produces and wire-draws his cure, so long as there is any hope of\npay, _Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris hirudo._ [2851]Many of them, to\nget a fee, will give physic to every one that comes, when there is no\ncause, and they do so _irritare silentem morbum_, as [2852]Heurnius\ncomplains, stir up a silent disease, as it often falleth out, which by good\ncounsel, good advice alone, might have been happily composed, or by\nrectification of those six non-natural things otherwise cured. This is\n_Naturae bellum inferre_, to oppugn nature, and to make a strong body weak.\nArnoldus in his 8 and 11 Aphorisms gives cautions against, and expressly\nforbiddeth it. [2853]\"A wise physician will not give physic, but upon\nnecessity, and first try medicinal diet, before he proceed to medicinal\ncure.\" [2854]In another place he laughs those men to scorn, that think\n_longis syrupis expugnare daemones et animi phantasmata_, they can purge\nfantastical imaginations and the devil by physic. Another caution is, that\nthey proceed upon good grounds, if so be there be need of physic, and not\nmistake the disease; they are often deceived by the [2855]similitude of\nsymptoms, saith Heurnius, and I could give instance in many consultations,\nwherein they have prescribed opposite physic. Sometimes they go too\nperfunctorily to work, in not prescribing a just [2856]course of physic: To\nstir up the humour, and not to purge it, doth often more harm than good.\nMontanus _consil. 30._ inveighs against such perturbations, \"that purge to\nthe halves, tire nature, and molest the body to no purpose.\" 'Tis a crabbed\nhumour to purge, and as Laurentius calls this disease, the reproach of\nphysicians: _Bessardus, flagellum medicorum_, their lash; and for that\ncause, more carefully to be respected. Though the patient be averse, saith\nLaurentius, desire help, and refuse it again, though he neglect his own\nhealth, it behoves a good physician not to leave him helpless. But most\npart they offend in that other extreme, they prescribe too much physic, and\ntire out their bodies with continual potions, to no purpose. Aetius\n_tetrabib. 2. 2. ser. cap. 90._ will have them by all means therefore\n[2857]\"to give some respite to nature,\" to leave off now and then; and\nLaelius a Fonte Eugubinus in his consultations, found it (as he there\nwitnesseth) often verified by experience, [2858]\"that after a deal of\nphysic to no purpose, left to themselves, they have recovered.\" 'Tis that\nwhich Nic. Piso, Donatus Altomarus, still inculcate, _dare requiem\nnaturae_, to give nature rest.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Concerning the Patient_.\n\nWhen these precedent cautions are accurately kept, and that we have now got\na skilful, an honest physician to our mind, if his patient will not be\nconformable, and content to be ruled by him, all his endeavours will come\nto no good end. Many things are necessarily to be observed and continued on\nthe patient's behalf: First that he be not too niggardly miserable of his\npurse, or think it too much he bestows upon himself, and to save charges\nendanger his health. The Abderites, when they sent for [2859]Hippocrates,\npromised him what reward he would, [2860]\"all the gold they had, if all the\ncity were gold he should have it.\" Naaman the Syrian, when he went into\nIsrael to Elisha to be cured of his leprosy, took with him ten talents of\nsilver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment, (2 Kings\nv. 5.) Another thing is, that out of bashfulness he do not conceal his\ngrief; if aught trouble his mind, let him freely disclose it, _Stultorum\nincurata pudor malus ulcera celat_: by that means he procures to himself\nmuch mischief, and runs into a greater inconvenience: he must be willing to\nbe cured, and earnestly desire it. _Pars sanitatis velle sanare fuit_,\n(Seneca). 'Tis a part of his cure to wish his own health, and not to defer\nit too long.\n\n[2861] \"Qui blandiendo dulce nutrivit malum,\n        Soro recusat ferre quod subiit jugum.\"\n\n       \"He that by cherishing a mischief doth provoke,\n        Too late at last refuseth to cast off his yoke,\"\n\n[2862] \"Helleborum frustra cum jam cutis aegra tumebit,\n        Poscentes videas; venienti occurrite morbo.\"\n\n       \"When the skin swells, to seek it to appease\n        With hellebore, is vain; meet your disease.\"\n\nBy this means many times, or through their ignorance in not taking notice\nof their grievance and danger of it, contempt, supine negligence,\nextenuation, wretchedness and peevishness; they undo themselves. The\ncitizens, I know not of what city now, when rumour was brought their\nenemies were coming, could not abide to hear it; and when the plague begins\nin many places and they certainly know it, they command silence and hush it\nup; but after they see their foes now marching to their gates, and ready to\nsurprise them, they begin to fortify and resist when 'tis too late; when,\nthe sickness breaks out and can be no longer concealed, then they lament\ntheir supine negligence: 'tis no otherwise with these men. And often out of\nprejudice, a loathing, and distaste of physic, they had rather die, or do\nworse, than take any of it. \"Barbarous immanity\" ([2863]Melancthon terms\nit) \"and folly to be deplored, so to contemn the precepts of health, good\nremedies, and voluntarily to pull death, and many maladies upon their own\nheads.\" Though many again are in that other extreme too profuse,\nsuspicious, and jealous of their health, too apt to take physic on every\nsmall occasion, to aggravate every slender passion, imperfection,\nimpediment: if their finger do but ache, run, ride, send for a physician,\nas many gentlewomen do, that are sick, without a cause, even when they will\nthemselves, upon every toy or small discontent, and when he comes, they\nmake it worse than it is, by amplifying that which is not. [2864]Hier.\nCapivaccius sets it down as a common fault of all \"melancholy persons to\nsay their symptoms are greater than they are, to help themselves.\" And\nwhich [2865]Mercurialis notes, _consil. 53._ \"to be more troublesome to\ntheir physicians, than other ordinary patients, that they may have change\nof physic.\"\n\nA third thing to be required in a patient, is confidence, to be of good\ncheer, and have sure hope that his physician can help him. [2866]Damascen\nthe Arabian requires likewise in the physician himself, that he be\nconfident he can cure him, otherwise his physic will not be effectual, and\npromise withal that he will certainly help him, make him believe so at\nleast. [2867]Galeottus gives this reason, because the form of health is\ncontained in the physician's mind, and as Galen, holds [2868]\"confidence\nand hope to be more good than physic,\" he cures most in whom most are\nconfident. Axiocus sick almost to death, at the very sight of Socrates\nrecovered his former health. Paracelsus assigns it for an only cause, why\nHippocrates was so fortunate in his cures, not for any extraordinary skill\nhe had; [2869]but \"because the common people had a most strong conceit of\nhis worth.\" To this of confidence we may add perseverance, obedience, and\nconstancy, not to change his physician, or dislike him upon every toy; for\nhe that so doth (saith [2870]Janus Damascen) \"or consults with many, falls\ninto many errors; or that useth many medicines.\" It was a chief caveat of\n[2871]Seneca to his friend Lucilius, that he should not alter his\nphysician, or prescribed physic: \"Nothing hinders health more; a wound can\nnever be cured, that hath several plasters.\" Crato _consil. 186._ taxeth\nall melancholy persons of this fault: [2872]\"'Tis proper to them, if things\nfall not out to their mind, and that they have not present ease, to seek\nanother and another;\" (as they do commonly that have sore eyes) \"twenty one\nafter another, and they still promise all to cure them, try a thousand\nremedies; and by this means they increase their malady, make it most\ndangerous and difficult to be cured.\" \"They try many\" (saith [2873]\nMontanus) \"and profit by none:\" and for this cause, _consil. 24._ he\nenjoins his patient before he take him in hand, [2874]\"perseverance and\nsufferance, for in such a small time no great matter can be effected, and\nupon that condition he will administer physic, otherwise all his endeavour\nand counsel would be to small purpose.\" And in his _31. counsel_ for a\nnotable matron, he tells her, [2875]\"if she will be cured, she must be of a\nmost abiding patience, faithful obedience, and singular perseverance; if\nshe remit, or despair, she can expect or hope for no good success.\"\n_Consil. 230._ for an Italian Abbot, he makes it one of the greatest\nreasons why this disease is so incurable, [2876]\"because the parties are so\nrestless, and impatient, and will therefore have him that intends to be\neased,\" [2877]\"to take physic, not for a month, a year, but to apply\nhimself to their prescriptions all the days of his life.\" Last of all, it\nis required that the patient be not too bold to practise upon himself,\nwithout an approved physician's consent, or to try conclusions, if he read\na receipt in a book; for so, many grossly mistake, and do themselves more\nharm than good. That which is conducing to one man, in one case, the same\ntime is opposite to another. [2878]An ass and a mule went laden over a\nbrook, the one with salt, the other with wool: the mule's pack was wet by\nchance, the salt melted, his burden the lighter, and he thereby much eased:\nhe told the ass, who, thinking to speed as well, wet his pack likewise at\nthe next water, but it was much the heavier, he quite tired. So one thing\nmay be good and bad to several parties, upon diverse occasions. \"Many\nthings\" (saith [2879] Penottus) \"are written in our books, which seem to\nthe reader to be excellent remedies, but they that make use of them are\noften deceived, and take for physic poison.\" I remember in Valleriola's\nobservations, a story of one John Baptist a Neapolitan, that finding by\nchance a pamphlet in Italian, written in praise of hellebore, would needs\nadventure on himself, and took one dram for one scruple, and had not he\nbeen sent for, the poor fellow had poisoned himself. From whence he\nconcludes out of Damascenus _2 et 3. Aphoris._ [2880]\"that without\nexquisite knowledge, to work out of books is most dangerous: how unsavoury\na thing it is to believe writers, and take upon trust, as this patient\nperceived by his own peril.\" I could recite such another example of mine\nown knowledge, of a friend of mine, that finding a receipt in Brassivola,\nwould needs take hellebore in substance, and try it on his own person; but\nhad not some of his familiars come to visit him by chance, he had by his\nindiscretion hazarded himself: many such I have observed. These are those\nordinary cautions, which I should think fit to be noted, and he that shall\nkeep them, as [2881] Montanus saith, shall surely be much eased, if not\nthoroughly cured.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Concerning Physic_.\n\nPhysic itself in the last place is to be considered; \"for the Lord hath\ncreated medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them.\"\nEcclus. xxxviii. 4. ver. 7.[0000] \"of such doth the apothecary make a\nconfection,\" &c. Of these medicines there be diverse and infinite kinds,\nplants, metals, animals, &c., and those of several natures, some good for\none, hurtful to another: some noxious in themselves, corrected by art, very\nwholesome and good, simples, mixed, &c., and therefore left to be managed\nby discreet and skilful physicians, and thence applied to man's use. To\nthis purpose they have invented method, and several rules of art, to put\nthese remedies in order, for their particular ends. Physic (as Hippocrates\ndefines it) is nought else but [2882]\"addition and subtraction;\" and as it\nis required in all other diseases, so in this of melancholy it ought to be\nmost accurate, it being (as [2883]Mercurialis acknowledgeth) so common an\naffection in these our times, and therefore fit to be understood. Several\nprescripts and methods I find in several men, some take upon them to cure\nall maladies with one medicine, severally applied, as that panacea, _aurum\npotabile_, so much controverted in these days, _herba solis_, &c.\nParacelsus reduceth all diseases to four principal heads, to whom\nSeverinus, Ravelascus, Leo Suavius, and others adhere and imitate: those\nare leprosy, gout, dropsy, falling-sickness. To which they reduce the rest;\nas to leprosy, ulcers, itches, furfurs, scabs, &c. To gout, stone, colic,\ntoothache, headache, &c. To dropsy, agues, jaundice, cachexia, &c. To the\nfalling-sickness, belong palsy, vertigo, cramps, convulsions, incubus,\napoplexy, &c. [2884]\"If any of these four principal be cured\" (saith\nRavelascus) \"all the inferior are cured,\" and the same remedies commonly\nserve: but this is too general, and by some contradicted: for this peculiar\ndisease of melancholy, of which I am now to speak, I find several cures,\nseveral methods and prescripts. They that intend the practic cure of\nmelancholy, saith Duretus in his notes to Hollerius, set down nine peculiar\nscopes or ends; Savanarola prescribes seven especial canons. Aelianus\nMontaltus _cap. 26._ Faventinus in his empirics, Hercules de Saxonia, &c.,\nhave their several injunctions and rules, all tending to one end. The\nordinary is threefold, which I mean to follow. [Greek: Diaitaetikae],\n_Pharmaceutica_, and _Chirurgica_, diet, or living, apothecary, chirurgery,\nwhich Wecker, Crato, Guianerius, &c., and most, prescribe; of which I will\ninsist, and speak in their order.\n\n\nSECT. II. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Diet rectified in substance_.\n\nDiet, [Greek: Diaitaetikae], _victus_, or living, according to [2885]\nFuchsius and others, comprehends those six non-natural things, which I have\nbefore specified, are especial causes, and being rectified, a sole or chief\npart of the cure. [2886]Johannes Arculanus, _cap. 16. in 9. Rhasis_,\naccounts the rectifying of these six a sufficient cure. Guianerius, _tract.\n15, cap. 9._ calls them, _propriam et primam curam_, the principal cure: so\ndoth Montanus, Crato, Mercurialis, Altomarus, &c., first to be tried,\nLemnius, _instit. cap. 22_, names them the hinges of our health, [2887]no\nhope of recovery without them. Reinerus Solenander, in his seventh\nconsultation for a Spanish young gentlewoman, that was so melancholy she\nabhorred all company, and would not sit at table with her familiar friends,\nprescribes this physic above the rest, [2888]no good to be done without it.\n[2889]Aretus, _lib. 1. cap. 7._ an old physician, is of opinion, that this\nis enough of itself, if the party be not too far gone in sickness.\n[2890]Crato, in a consultation of his for a noble patient, tells him\nplainly, that if his highness will keep but a good diet, he will warrant\nhim his former health. [2891]Montanus, _consil. 27._ for a nobleman of\nFrance, admonisheth his lordship to be most circumspect in his diet, or\nelse all his other physic will [2892]be to small purpose. The same\ninjunction I find verbatim in J. Caesar Claudinus, _Respon. 34. Scoltzii_,\n_consil. 183._ Trallianus, _cap. 16. lib. 1._ Laelius a Fonte Aeugubinus\noften brags, that he hath done more cures in this kind by rectification of\ndiet, than all other physic besides. So that in a word I may say to most\nmelancholy men, as the fox said to the weasel, that could not get out of\nthe garner, _Macra cavum repetes, quem macra subisti_, [2893]the six\nnon-natural things caused it, and they must cure it. Which howsoever I\ntreat of, as proper to the meridian of melancholy, yet nevertheless, that\nwhich is here said with him in [2894]Tully, though writ especially for the\ngood of his friends at Tarentum and Sicily, yet it will generally serve\n[2895]most other diseases, and help them likewise, if it be observed.\n\nOf these six non-natural things, the first is diet, properly so called,\nwhich consists in meat and drink, in which we must consider substance,\nquantity, quality, and that opposite to the precedent. In substance, such\nmeats are generally commended, which are [2896]\"moist, easy of digestion,\nand not apt to engender wind, not fried, nor roasted, but sod\" (saith\nValescus, Altomarus, Piso, &c.) \"hot and moist, and of good nourishment;\"\nCrato, _consil. 21. lib. 2._ admits roast meat, [2897]if the burned and\nscorched _superficies_, the brown we call it, be pared off. Salvianus,\n_lib. 2. cap. 1._ cries out on cold and dry meats; [2898]young flesh and\ntender is approved, as of kid, rabbits, chickens, veal, mutton, capons,\nhens, partridge, pheasant, quails, and all mountain birds, which are so\nfamiliar in some parts of Africa, and in Italy, and as [2899]Dublinius\nreports, the common food of boors and clowns in Palestine. Galen takes\nexception at mutton, but without question he means that rammy mutton, which\nis in Turkey and Asia Minor, which have those great fleshy tails, of\nforty-eight pounds weight, as Vertomannus witnesseth, _navig. lib. 2.\ncap. 5._ The lean of fat meat is best, and all manner of broths, and\npottage, with borage, lettuce, and such wholesome herbs are excellent good,\nespecially of a cock boiled; all spoon meat. Arabians commend brains, but\n[2900]Laurentius, _c. 8._ excepts against them, and so do many others;\n[2901]eggs are justified as a nutritive wholesome meat, butter and oil may\npass, but with some limitation; so [2902]Crato confines it, and \"to some\nmen sparingly at set times, or in sauce,\" and so sugar and honey are\napproved. [2903]All sharp and sour sauces must be avoided, and spices, or\nat least seldom used: and so saffron sometimes in broth may be tolerated;\nbut these things may be more freely used, as the temperature of the party\nis hot or cold, or as he shall find inconvenience by them. The thinnest,\nwhitest, smallest wine is best, not thick, nor strong; and so of beer, the\nmiddling is fittest. Bread of good wheat, pure, well purged from the bran\nis preferred; Laurentius, _cap. 8._ would have it kneaded with rain water,\nif it may be gotten.\n\n_Water_.] Pure, thin, light water by all means use, of good smell and\ntaste, like to the air in sight, such as is soon hot, soon cold, and which\nHippocrates so much approves, if at least it may be had. Rain water is\npurest, so that it fall not down in great drops, and be used forthwith, for\nit quickly putrefies. Next to it fountain water that riseth in the east,\nand runneth eastward, from a quick running spring, from flinty, chalky,\ngravelly grounds: and the longer a river runneth, it is commonly the\npurest, though many springs do yield the best water at their fountains. The\nwaters in hotter countries, as in Turkey, Persia, India, within the\ntropics, are frequently purer than ours in the north, more subtile, thin,\nand lighter, as our merchants observe, by four ounces in a pound,\npleasanter to drink, as good as our beer, and some of them, as Choaspis in\nPersia, preferred by the Persian kings, before wine itself.\n\n[2904] \"Clitorio quicunque sitim de fonte levarit\n        Vina fugit gaudetque meris abstemius undis.\"\n\nMany rivers I deny not are muddy still, white, thick, like those in China,\nNile in Egypt, Tiber at Rome, but after they be settled two or three days,\ndefecate and clear, very commodious, useful and good. Many make use of deep\nwells, as of old in the Holy Land, lakes, cisterns, when they cannot be\nbetter provided; to fetch it in carts or gondolas, as in Venice, or camels'\nbacks, as at Cairo in Egypt, [2905]Radzivilius observed 8000 camels daily\nthere, employed about that business; some keep it in trunks, as in the East\nIndies, made four square with descending steps, and 'tis not amiss, for I\nwould not have any one so nice as that Grecian Calis, sister to Nicephorus,\nemperor of Constantinople, and [2906]married to Dominitus Silvius, duke of\nVenice, that out of incredible wantonness, _communi aqua uti nolebat_,\nwould use no vulgar water; but she died _tanta_ (saith mine author)\n_foetidissimi puris copia_, of so fulsome a disease, that no water could\nwash her clean. [2907]Plato would not have a traveller lodge in a city that\nis not governed by laws, or hath not a quick stream running by it; _illud\nenim animum, hoc corrumpit valetudinem_, one corrupts the body, the other\nthe mind. But this is more than needs, too much curiosity is naught, in\ntime of necessity any water is allowed. Howsoever, pure water is best, and\nwhich (as Pindarus holds) is better than gold; an especial ornament it is,\nand \"very commodious to a city\" (according to [2908]Vegetius) \"when fresh\nsprings are included within the walls,\" as at Corinth, in the midst of the\ntown almost, there was _arx altissima scatens fontibus_, a goodly mount\nfull of fresh water springs: \"if nature afford them not they must be had by\nart.\" It is a wonder to read of those [2909]stupend aqueducts, and infinite\ncost hath been bestowed in Rome of old, Constantinople, Carthage,\nAlexandria, and such populous cities, to convey good and wholesome waters:\nread [2910]Frontinus, Lipsius _de admir._ [2911]Plinius, _lib. 3. cap. 11_,\nStrabo in his _Geogr._ That aqueduct of Claudius was most eminent, fetched\nupon arches fifteen miles, every arch 109 feet high: they had fourteen such\nother aqueducts, besides lakes and cisterns, 700 as I take it; [2912]every\nhouse had private pipes and channels to serve them for their use. Peter\nGillius, in his accurate description of Constantinople, speaks of an old\ncistern which he went down to see, 336 feet long, 180 feet broad, built of\nmarble, covered over with arch-work, and sustained by 336 pillars, 12 feet\nasunder, and in eleven rows, to contain sweet water. Infinite cost in\nchannels and cisterns, from Nilus to Alexandria, hath been formerly\nbestowed, to the admiration of these times; [2913]their cisterns so\ncuriously cemented and composed, that a beholder would take them to be all\nof one stone: when the foundation is laid, and cistern made, their house is\nhalf built. That Segovian aqueduct in Spain, is much wondered at in these\ndays, [2914]upon three rows of pillars, one above another, conveying sweet\nwater to every house: but each city almost is full of such aqueducts.\nAmongst the rest [2915]he is eternally to be commended, that brought that\nnew stream to the north side of London at his own charge: and Mr. Otho\nNicholson, founder of our waterworks and elegant conduit in Oxford. So much\nhave all times attributed to this element, to be conveniently provided of\nit: although Galen hath taken exceptions at such waters, which run through\nleaden pipes, _ob cerussam quae in iis generatur_, for that unctuous\nceruse, which causeth dysenteries and fluxes; [2916]yet as Alsarius Crucius\nof Genna well answers, it is opposite to common experience. If that were\ntrue, most of our Italian cities, Montpelier in France, with infinite\nothers, would find this inconvenience, but there is no such matter. For\nprivate families, in what sort they should furnish themselves, let them\nconsult with P. Crescentius, _de Agric. l. 1. c. 4_, Pamphilius Hirelacus,\nand the rest.\n\nAmongst fishes, those are most allowed of, that live in gravelly or sandy\nwaters, pikes, perch, trout, gudgeon, smelts, flounders, &c. Hippolitus\nSalvianus takes exception at carp; but I dare boldly say with [2917]\nDubravius, it is an excellent meat, if it come not from [2918]muddy pools,\nthat it retain not an unsavoury taste. Erinacius Marinus is much commended\nby Oribatius, Aetius, and most of our late writers.\n\n[2919]Crato, _consil. 21. lib. 2._ censures all manner of fruits, as\nsubject to putrefaction, yet tolerable at sometimes, after meals, at second\ncourse, they keep down vapours, and have their use. Sweet fruits are best,\nas sweet cherries, plums, sweet apples, pearmains, and pippins, which\nLaurentius extols, as having a peculiar property against this disease, and\nPlater magnifies, _omnibus modis appropriata conveniunt_, but they must be\ncorrected for their windiness: ripe grapes are good, and raisins of the\nsun, musk-melons well corrected, and sparingly used. Figs are allowed, and\nalmonds blanched. Trallianus discommends figs, [2920]Salvianus olives and\ncapers, which [2921]others especially like of, and so of pistick nuts.\nMontanus and Mercurialis out of Avenzoar, admit peaches, [2922]pears, and\napples baked after meals, only corrected with sugar, and aniseed, or\nfennel-seed, and so they may be profitably taken, because they strengthen\nthe stomach, and keep down vapours. The like may be said of preserved\ncherries, plums, marmalade of plums, quinces, &c., but not to drink after\nthem. [2923]Pomegranates, lemons, oranges are tolerated, if they be not too\nsharp.\n\n[2924]Crato will admit of no herbs, but borage, bugloss, endive, fennel,\naniseed, baum; Callenius and Arnoldus tolerate lettuce, spinach, beets, &c.\nThe same Crato will allow no roots at all to be eaten. Some approve of\npotatoes, parsnips, but all corrected for wind. No raw salads; but as\nLaurentius prescribes, in broths; and so Crato commends many of them: or to\nuse borage, hops, baum, steeped in their ordinary drink. [2925]Avenzoar\nmagnifies the juice of a pomegranate, if it be sweet, and especially rose\nwater, which he would have to be used in every dish, which they put in\npractice in those hot countries, about Damascus, where (if we may believe\nthe relations of Vertomannus) many hogsheads of rose water are to be sold\nin the market at once, it is in so great request with them.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Diet rectified in quantity_.\n\nMan alone, saith [2926]Cardan, eats and drinks without appetite, and useth\nall his pleasure without necessity, _animae vitio_, and thence come many\ninconveniences unto him. For there is no meat whatsoever, though otherwise\nwholesome and good, but if unseasonably taken, or immoderately used, more\nthan the stomach can well bear, it will engender crudity, and do much harm.\nTherefore [2927]Crato adviseth his patient to eat but twice a day, and that\nat his set meals, by no means to eat without an appetite, or upon a full\nstomach, and to put seven hours' difference between dinner and supper.\nWhich rule if we did observe in our colleges, it would be much better for\nour healths: but custom, that tyrant, so prevails, that contrary to all\ngood order and rules of physic, we scarce admit of five. If after seven\nhours' tarrying he shall have no stomach, let him defer his meal, or eat\nvery little at his ordinary time of repast. This very counsel was given by\nProsper Calenus to Cardinal Caesius, labouring of this disease; and [2928]\nPlaterus prescribes it to a patient of his, to be most severely kept.\nGuianerius admits of three meals a day, but Montanus, _consil. 23. pro. Ab.\nItalo_, ties him precisely to two. And as he must not eat overmuch, so he\nmay not absolutely fast; for as Celsus contends, _lib. 1. Jacchinus 15. in\n9. Rhasis_, [2929]repletion and inanition may both do harm in two contrary\nextremes. Moreover, that which he doth eat, must be well [2930]chewed, and\nnot hastily gobbled, for that causeth crudity and wind; and by all means to\neat no more than he can well digest. \"Some think\" (saith [2931]\nTrincavelius, _lib. 11. cap. 29. de curand. part. hum._) \"the more they eat\nthe more they nourish themselves:\" eat and live, as the proverb is, \"not\nknowing that only repairs man, which is well concocted, not that which is\ndevoured.\" Melancholy men most part have good [2932]appetites, but ill\ndigestion, and for that cause they must be sure to rise with an appetite;\nand that which Socrates and Disarius the physicians in [2933]Macrobius so\nmuch require, St. Hierom enjoins Rusticus to eat and drink no more than,\nwill [2934]satisfy hunger and thirst. [2935]Lessius, the Jesuit, holds\ntwelve, thirteen, or fourteen ounces, or in our northern countries, sixteen\nat most, (for all students, weaklings, and such as lead an idle sedentary\nlife) of meat, bread, &c., a fit proportion for a whole day, and as much or\nlittle more of drink. Nothing pesters the body and mind sooner than to be\nstill fed, to eat and ingurgitate beyond all measure, as many do. [2936]\n\"By overmuch eating and continual feasts they stifle nature, and choke up\nthemselves; which, had they lived coarsely, or like galley slaves been tied\nto an oar, might have happily prolonged many fair years.\"\n\nA great inconvenience comes by variety of dishes, which causeth the\nprecedent distemperature, [2937]\"than which\" (saith Avicenna) \"nothing is\nworse; to feed on diversity of meats, or overmuch,\" Sertorius-like, _in\nlucem caenare_, and as commonly they do in Muscovy and Iceland, to prolong\ntheir meals all day long, or all night. Our northern countries offend\nespecially in this, and we in this island (_ampliter viventes in prandiis\net caenis_, as [2938]Polydore notes) are most liberal feeders, but to our\nown hurt. [2939]_Persicos odi puer apparatus_: \"Excess of meat breedeth\nsickness, and gluttony causeth choleric diseases: by surfeiting many\nperish, but he that dieteth himself prolongeth his life,\" Ecclus. xxxvii.\n29, 30. We account it a great glory for a man to have his table daily\nfurnished with variety of meats: but hear the physician, he pulls thee by\nthe ear as thou sittest, and telleth thee, [2940]\"that nothing can be more\nnoxious to thy health than such variety and plenty.\" Temperance is a bridle\nof gold, and he that can use it aright, [2941]_ego non summis viris\ncomparo, sed simillimum Deo judico_, is liker a God than a man: for as it\nwill transform a beast to a man again, so will it make a man a God. To\npreserve thine honour, health, and to avoid therefore all those inflations,\ntorments, obstructions, crudities, and diseases that come by a full diet,\nthe best way is to [2942]feed sparingly of one or two dishes at most, to\nhave _ventrem bene moratum_, as Seneca calls it, [2943]\"to choose one of\nmany, and to feed on that alone,\" as Crato adviseth his patient. The same\ncounsel [2944]Prosper Calenus gives to Cardinal Caesius, to use a moderate\nand simple diet: and though his table be jovially furnished by reason of\nhis state and guests, yet for his own part to single out some one savoury\ndish and feed on it. The same is inculcated by [2945]Crato, _consil. 9. l.\n2._ to a noble personage affected with this grievance, he would have his\nhighness to dine or sup alone, without all his honourable attendance and\ncourtly company, with a private friend or so, [2946]a dish or two, a cup of\nRhenish wine, &c. Montanus, _consil. 24._ for a noble matron enjoins her\none dish, and by no means to drink between meals. The like, _consil. 229._\nor not to eat till he be an hungry, which rule Berengarius did most\nstrictly observe, as Hilbertus, _Cenomecensis Episc._ writes in his life,\n\n        ------\"cui non fuit unquam\n        Ante sitim potus, nec cibus ante famem,\"\n\nand which all temperate men do constantly keep. It is a frequent solemnity\nstill used with us, when friends meet, to go to the alehouse or tavern,\nthey are not sociable otherwise: and if they visit one another's houses,\nthey must both eat and drink. I reprehend it not moderately used; but to\nsome men nothing can be more offensive; they had better, I speak it with\nSaint [2947]Ambrose, pour so much water in their shoes.\n\nIt much avails likewise to keep good order in our diet, [2948]\"to eat\nliquid things first, broths, fish, and such meats as are sooner corrupted\nin the stomach; harder meats of digestion must come last.\" Crato would have\nthe supper less than the dinner, which Cardan, _Contradict. lib. 1. tract.\n5. contradict. 18._ disallows, and that by the authority of Galen. _7. art.\ncurat. cap. 6._ and for four reasons he will have the supper biggest: I\nhave read many treatises to this purpose, I know not how it may concern\nsome few sick men, but for my part generally for all, I should subscribe to\nthat custom of the Romans, to make a sparing dinner, and a liberal supper;\nall their preparation and invitation was still at supper, no mention of\ndinner. Many reasons I could give, but when all is said _pro_ and _con_,\n[2949]Cardan's rule is best, to keep that we are accustomed unto, though it\nbe naught, and to follow our disposition and appetite in some things is not\namiss; to eat sometimes of a dish which is hurtful, if we have an\nextraordinary liking to it. Alexander Severus loved hares and apples above\nall other meats, as [2950]Lampridius relates in his life: one pope pork,\nanother peacock, &c.; what harm came of it? I conclude our own experience\nis the best physician; that diet which is most propitious to one, is often\npernicious to another, such is the variety of palates, humours, and\ntemperatures, let every man observe, and be a law unto himself. Tiberius,\nin [2951]Tacitus, did laugh at all such, that thirty years of age would ask\ncounsel of others concerning matters of diet; I say the same.\n\nThese few rules of diet he that keeps, shall surely find great ease and\nspeedy remedy by it. It is a wonder to relate that prodigious temperance of\nsome hermits, anchorites, and fathers of the church: he that shall but read\ntheir lives, written by Hierom, Athanasius, &c., how abstemious heathens\nhave been in this kind, those Curii and Fabritii, those old philosophers,\nas Pliny records, _lib. 11._ Xenophon, _lib. 1. de vit. Socrat._ Emperors\nand kings, as Nicephorus relates, _Eccles. hist. lib. 18. cap. 8._ of\nMauritius, Ludovicus Pius, &c., and that admirable [2952]example of\nLudovicus Cornarus, a patrician of Venice, cannot but admire them. This\nhave they done voluntarily and in health; what shall these private men do\nthat are visited with sickness, and necessarily [2953]enjoined to recover,\nand continue their health? It is a hard thing to observe a strict diet, _et\nqui medice vivit, misere vivit_, [2954]as the saying is, _quale hoc ipsum\nerit vivere, his si privatus fueris_? as good be buried, as so much\ndebarred of his appetite; _excessit medicina malum_, the physic is more\ntroublesome than the disease, so he complained in the poet, so thou\nthinkest: yet he that loves himself will easily endure this little misery,\nto avoid a greater inconvenience; _e malis minimum_ better do this than do\nworse. And as [2955]Tully holds, \"better be a temperate old man than a\nlascivious youth.\" 'Tis the only sweet thing (which he adviseth) so to\nmoderate ourselves, that we may have _senectutem in juventute, et in\njuventute senectutem_, be youthful in our old age, staid in our youth,\ndiscreet and temperate in both.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n_Retention and Evacuation rectified_.\n\nI have declared in the causes what harm costiveness hath done in procuring\nthis disease; if it be so noxious, the opposite must needs be good, or mean\nat least, as indeed it is, and to this cure necessarily required; _maxime\nconducit_, saith Montaltus, _cap. 27._ it very much avails. [2956]\nAltomarus, _cap. 7_, \"commends walking in a morning, into some fair green\npleasant fields, but by all means first, by art or nature, he will have\nthese ordinary excrements evacuated.\" Piso calls it, _Beneficium ventris_,\nthe benefit, help or pleasure of the belly, for it doth much ease it.\nLaurentius, _cap. 8_, Crato, _consil. 21. l. 2._ prescribes it once a day\nat least: where nature is defective, art must supply, by those lenitive\nelectuaries, suppositories, condite prunes, turpentine, clysters, as shall\nbe shown. Prosper Calenus, _lib. de atra bile_, commends clysters in\nhypochondriacal melancholy, still to be used as occasion serves; [2957]\nPeter Cnemander in a consultation of his _pro hypocondriaco_, will have his\npatient continually loose, and to that end sets down there many forms of\npotions and clysters. Mercurialis, _consil. 88._ if this benefit come not\nof its own accord, prescribes [2958]clysters in the first place: so doth\nMontanus, _consil. 24. consil. 31 et 229._ he commends turpentine to that\npurpose: the same he ingeminates, _consil. 230._ for an Italian abbot. 'Tis\nvery good to wash his hands and face often, to shift his clothes, to have\nfair linen about him, to be decently and comely attired, for _sordes\nvitiant_, nastiness defiles and dejects any man that is so voluntarily, or\ncompelled by want, it dulleth the spirits.\n\nBaths are either artificial or natural, both have their special uses in\nthis malady, and as [2959]Alexander supposeth, _lib. 1. cap. 16._ yield as\nspeedy a remedy as any other physic whatsoever. Aetius would have them\ndaily used, _assidua balnea_, _Tetra. 2. sect. 2. c. 9._ Galen cracks how\nmany several cures he hath performed in this kind by use of baths alone,\nand Rufus pills, moistening them which are otherwise dry. Rhasis makes it a\nprincipal cure, _Tota cura sit in humectando_, to bathe and afterwards\nanoint with oil. Jason Pratensis, Laurentius, _cap. 8._ and Montanus set\ndown their peculiar forms of artificial baths. Crato, _consil. 17. lib. 2._\ncommends mallows, camomile, violets, borage to be boiled in it, and\nsometimes fair water alone, and in his following counsel, _Balneum aquae\ndulcis solum saepissime profuisse compertum habemus_. So doth Fuchsius,\n_lib. 1. cap. 33._ _Frisimelica, 2. consil. 42._ in Trincavelius. Some\nbeside herbs prescribe a ram's head and other things to be boiled. [2960]\nFernelius, _consil. 44._ will have them used ten or twelve days together;\nto which he must enter fasting, and so continue in a temperate heat, and\nafter that frictions all over the body. Lelius Aegubinus, _consil. 142._\nand Christoph. Aererus, in a consultation of his, hold once or twice a week\nsufficient to bathe, the [2961]\"water to be warm, not hot, for fear of\nsweating.\" Felix Plater, _observ. lib. 1._ for a melancholy lawyer, [2962]\n\"will have lotions of the head still joined to these baths, with a ley\nwherein capital herbs have been boiled.\" [2963]Laurentius speaks of baths\nof milk, which I find approved by many others. And still after bath, the\nbody to be anointed with oil of bitter almonds, of violets, new or fresh\nbutter, [2964]capon's grease, especially the backbone, and then lotions of\nthe head, embrocations, &c. These kinds of baths have been in former times\nmuch frequented, and diversely varied, and are still in general use in\nthose eastern countries. The Romans had their public baths very sumptuous\nand stupend, as those of Antoninus and Diocletian. Plin. 36. saith there\nwere an infinite number of them in Rome, and mightily frequented; some\nbathed seven times a day, as Commodus the emperor is reported to have done;\nusually twice a day, and they were after anointed with most costly\nointments: rich women bathed themselves in milk, some in the milk of five\nhundred she-asses at once: we have many ruins of such, baths found in this\nisland, amongst those parietines and rubbish of old Roman towns. Lipsius,\n_de mag. Urb. Rom. l. 3, c. 8_, Rosinus, Scot of Antwerp, and other\nantiquaries, tell strange stories of their baths. Gillius, _l. 4. cap. ult.\nTopogr. Constant._ reckons up 155 public [2965]baths in Constantinople, of\nfair building; they are still [2966]frequented in that city by the Turks of\nall sorts, men and women, and all over Greece, and those hot countries; to\nabsterge belike that fulsomeness of sweat, to which they are there subject.\n[2967]Busbequius, in his epistles, is very copious in describing the manner\nof them, how their women go covered, a maid following with a box of\nointment to rub them. The richer sort have private baths in their houses;\nthe poorer go to the common, and are generally so curious in this behalf,\nthat they will not eat nor drink until they have bathed, before and after\nmeals some, [2968]\"and will not make water (but they will wash their hands)\nor go to stool.\" Leo Afer. _l. 3._ makes mention of one hundred several\nbaths at Fez in Africa, most sumptuous, and such as have great revenues\nbelonging to them. Buxtorf. _cap. 14, Synagog. Jud._ speaks of many\nceremonies amongst the Jews in this kind; they are very superstitious in\ntheir baths, especially women.\n\nNatural baths are praised by some, discommended by others; but it is in a\ndivers respect. [2969]Marcus, _de Oddis in Hip. affect._ consulted about\nbaths, condemns them for the heat of the liver, because they dry too fast;\nand yet by and by, [2970]in another counsel for the same disease, he\napproves them because they cleanse by reason of the sulphur, and would have\ntheir water to be drunk. Areteus, _c. 7._ commends alum baths above the\nrest; and [2971]Mercurialis, _consil. 88._ those of Lucca in that\nhypochondriacal passion. \"He would have his patient tarry there fifteen\ndays together, and drink the water of them, and to be bucketed, or have the\nwater poured on his head.\" John Baptista, _Sylvaticus cont. 64._ commends\nall the baths in Italy, and drinking of their water, whether they be iron,\nalum, sulphur; so doth [2972]Hercules de Saxonia. But in that they cause\nsweat and dry so much, he confines himself to hypochondriacal melancholy\nalone, excepting that of the head and the other. Trincavelius, _consil. 14.\nlib. 1._ refers those [2973]Porrectan baths before the rest, because of the\nmixture of brass, iron, alum, and _consil. 35. l. 3._ for a melancholy\nlawyer, and _consil. 36._ in that hypochondriacal passion, the [2974]baths\nof Aquaria, and _36. consil._ the drinking of them. Frisimelica, consulted\namongst the rest in Trincavelius, _consil. 42. lib. 2._ prefers the waters\nof [2975]Apona before all artificial baths whatsoever in this disease, and\nwould have one nine years affected with hypochondriacal passions fly to\nthem as to a [2976]holy anchor. Of the same mind is Trincavelius himself\nthere, and yet both put a hot liver in the same party for a cause, and send\nhim to the waters of St. Helen, which are much hotter. Montanus, _consil.\n230._ magnifies the [2977]Chalderinian baths, and _consil 237. et 239._ he\nexhorteth to the same, but with this caution, [2978]\"that the liver be\noutwardly anointed with some coolers that it be not overheated.\" But these\nbaths must be warily frequented by melancholy persons, or if used, to such\nas are very cold of themselves, for as Gabelius concludes of all Dutch\nbaths, and especially of those of Baden, \"they are good for all cold\ndiseases, [2979]naught for choleric, hot and dry, and all infirmities\nproceeding of choler, inflammations of the spleen and liver.\" Our English\nbaths, as they are hot, must needs incur the same censure: but D. Turner of\nold, and D. Jones have written at large of them. Of cold baths I find\nlittle or no mention in any physician, some speak against them:\n[2980]Cardan alone out of Agathinus commends \"bathing in fresh rivers, and\ncold waters, and adviseth all such as mean to live long to use it, for it\nagrees with all ages and complexions, and is most profitable for hot\ntemperatures.\" As for sweating, urine, bloodletting by haemrods, or\notherwise, I shall elsewhere more opportunely speak of them.\n\nImmoderate Venus in excess, as it is a cause, or in defect; so moderately\nused to some parties an only help, a present remedy. Peter Forestus calls\nit _aptissimum remedium_, a most apposite remedy, [2981]\"remitting anger,\nand reason, that was otherwise bound.\" Avicenna _Fen. 3. 20._ Oribasius\n_med. collect. lib. 6. cap. 37._ contend out of Ruffus and others, [2982]\n\"that many madmen, melancholy, and labouring of the falling sickness, have\nbeen cured by this alone.\" Montaltus _cap. 27. de melan._ will have it\ndrive away sorrow, and all illusions of the brain, to purge the heart and\nbrain from ill smokes and vapours that offend them: [2983]\"and if it be\nomitted,\" as Valescus supposeth, \"it makes the mind sad, the body dull and\nheavy.\" Many other inconveniences are reckoned up by Mercatus, and by\nRodericus a Castro, in their tracts _de melancholia virginum et monialium;\nob seminis retentionem saviunt saepe moniales et virgines_, but as Platerus\nadds, _si nubant sanantur_, they rave single, and pine away, much\ndiscontent, but marriage mends all. Marcellus Donatus _lib. 2. med. hist.\ncap. 1._ tells a story to confirm this out of Alexander Benedictus, of a\nmaid that was mad, _ob menses inhibitos, cum in officinam meritoriam\nincidisset, a quindecem viris eadem nocte compressa, mensium largo\nprofluvio, quod pluribus annis ante constiterat, non sine magno pudore mane\nmenti restituta discessit_. But this must be warily understood, for as\nArnoldus objects, _lib. 1. breviar. 18. cap._ _Quid coitus ad melancholicum\nsuccum_? What affinity have these two? [2984]\"except it be manifest that\nsuperabundance of seed, or fullness of blood be a cause, or that love, or\nan extraordinary desire of Venus, have gone before,\" or that as Lod.\nMercatus excepts, they be very flatuous, and have been otherwise accustomed\nunto it. Montaltus _cap. 27._ will not allow of moderate Venus to such as\nhave the gout, palsy, epilepsy, melancholy, except they be very lusty, and\nfull of blood. [2985]Lodovicus Antonius _lib. med. miscet._ in his chapter\nof Venus, forbids it utterly to all wrestlers, ditchers, labouring men, &c.\n[2986]Ficinus and [2987]Marsilius Cognatus puts Venus one of the five\nmortal enemies of a student: \"it consumes the spirits, and weakeneth the\nbrain.\" Halyabbas the Arabian, _5. Theor. cap. 36._ and Jason Pratensis\nmake it the fountain of most diseases, [2988]\"but most pernicious to them\nwho are cold and dry:\" a melancholy man must not meddle with it, but in\nsome cases. Plutarch in his book _de san. tuend._ accounts of it as one of\nthe three principal signs and preservers of health, temperance in this\nkind: [2989]\"to rise with an appetite, to be ready to work, and abstain\nfrom venery,\" _tria saluberrima_, are three most healthful things. We see\ntheir opposites how pernicious they are to mankind, as to all other\ncreatures they bring death, and many feral diseases: _Immodicis brevis est\naetas et rara senectus_. Aristotle gives instance in sparrows, which are\n_parum vivaces ob salacitatem_, [2990]short lived because of their\nsalacity, which is very frequent, as Scoppius in Priapus will better inform\nyou. The extremes being both bad, [2991]the medium is to be kept, which\ncannot easily be determined. Some are better able to sustain, such as are\nhot and moist, phlegmatic, as Hippocrates insinuateth, some strong and\nlusty, well fed like [2992]Hercules, [2993] Proculus the emperor, lusty\nLaurence, [2994]_prostibulum faeminae Messalina_ the empress, that by\nphilters, and such kind of lascivious meats, use all means to [2995]enable\nthemselves: and brag of it in the end, _confodi multas enim, occidi vero\npaucas per ventrem vidisti_, as that Spanish [2996]Celestina merrily said:\nothers impotent, of a cold and dry constitution, cannot sustain those\ngymnics without great hurt done to their own bodies, of which number\n(though they be very prone to it) are melancholy men for the most part.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Air rectified. With a digression of the Air_.\n\nAs a long-winged hawk, when he is first whistled off the fist, mounts\naloft, and for his pleasure fetcheth many a circuit in the air, still\nsoaring higher and higher, till he be come to his full pitch, and in the\nend when the game is sprung, comes down amain, and stoops upon a sudden: so\nwill I, having now come at last into these ample fields of air, wherein I\nmay freely expatiate and exercise myself for my recreation, awhile rove,\nwander round about the world, mount aloft to those ethereal orbs and\ncelestial spheres, and so descend to my former elements again. In which\nprogress I will first see whether that relation of the friar of [2997]\nOxford be true, concerning those northern parts under the pole (if I meet\n_obiter_ with the wandering Jew, Elias Artifex, or Lucian's\n_Icaromenippus_, they shall be my guides) whether there be such 4. Euripes,\nand a great rock of loadstones, which may cause the needle in the compass\nstill to bend that way, and what should be the true cause of the variation\nof the compass, [2998]is it a magnetical rock, or the pole-star, as Cardan\nwill; or some other star in the bear, as Marsilius Ficinus; or a magnetical\nmeridian, as Maurolieus; _Vel situs in vena terrae_, as Agricola; or the\nnearness of the next continent, as Cabeus will; or some other cause, as\nScaliger, Cortesius, Conimbricenses, Peregrinus contend; why at the Azores\nit looks directly north, otherwise not? In the Mediterranean or Levant (as\nsome observe) it varies 7. grad. by and by 12. and then 22. In the Baltic\nSeas, near Rasceburg in Finland, the needle runs round, if any ships come\nthat way, though [2999]Martin Ridley write otherwise, that the needle near\nthe Pole will hardly be forced from his direction. 'Tis fit to be inquired\nwhether certain rules may be made of it, as _11. grad. Lond. variat. alibi\n36._ &c. and that which is more prodigious, the variation varies in the\nsame place, now taken accurately, 'tis so much after a few years quite\naltered from that it was: till we have better intelligence, let our Dr.\nGilbert, and Nicholas [3000]Cabeus the Jesuit, that have both written great\nvolumes of this subject, satisfy these inquisitors. Whether the sea be open\nand navigable by the Pole arctic, and which is the likeliest way, that of\nBartison the Hollander, under the Pole itself, which for some reasons I\nhold best: or by Fretum Davis, or Nova Zembla. Whether [3001]Hudson's\ndiscovery be true of a new found ocean, any likelihood of Button's Bay in\n50. degrees, Hubberd's Hope in 60. that of _ut ultra_ near Sir Thomas Roe's\nwelcome in Northwest Fox, being that the sea ebbs and flows constantly\nthere 15. foot in 12. hours, as our [3002]new cards inform us that\nCalifornia is not a cape, but an island, and the west winds make the neap\ntides equal to the spring, or that there be any probability to pass by the\nstraits of Anian to China, by the promontory of Tabin. If there be, I shall\nsoon perceive whether [3003]Marcus Polus the Venetian's narration be true\nor false, of that great city of Quinsay and Cambalu; whether there be any\nsuch places, or that as [3004]Matth. Riccius the Jesuit hath written, China\nand Cataia be all one, the great Cham of Tartary and the king of China be\nthe same; Xuntain and Quinsay, and the city of Cambalu be that new Peking,\nor such a wall 400 leagues long to part China from Tartary: whether\n[3005]Presbyter John be in Asia or Africa; M. Polus Venetus puts him in\nAsia, [3006]the most received opinion is, that he is emperor of the\nAbyssines, which of old was Ethiopia, now Nubia, under the equator in\nAfrica. Whether [3007]Guinea be an island or part of the continent, or that\nhungry [3008]Spaniard's discovery of _Terra Australis Incognita_, or\nMagellanica, be as true as that of Mercurius Britannius, or his of Utopia,\nor his of Lucinia. And yet in likelihood it may be so, for without all\nquestion it being extended from the tropic of Capricorn to the circle\nAntarctic, and lying as it doth in the temperate zone, cannot choose but\nyield in time some flourishing kingdoms to succeeding ages, as America did\nunto the Spaniards. Shouten and Le Meir have done well in the discovery of\nthe Straits of Magellan, in finding a more convenient passage to _Mare\npacificum_: methinks some of our modern argonauts should prosecute the\nrest. As I go by Madagascar, I would see that great bird [3009]ruck, that\ncan carry a man and horse or an elephant, with that Arabian phoenix\ndescribed by [3010]Adricomius; see the pelicans of Egypt, those Scythian\ngryphes in Asia: and afterwards in Africa examine the fountains of Nilus,\nwhether Herodotus, [3011]Seneca, Plin. _lib. 5. cap. 9._ Strabo. _lib. 5._\ngive a true cause of his annual flowing, [3012]Pagaphetta discourse rightly\nof it, or of Niger and Senegal; examine Cardan, [3013]Scaliger's reasons,\nand the rest. Is it from those Etesian winds, or melting of snow in the\nmountains under the equator (for Jordan yearly overflows when the snow\nmelts in Mount Libanus), or from those great dropping perpetual showers\nwhich are so frequent to the inhabitants within the tropics, when the sun\nis vertical, and cause such vast inundations in Senegal, Maragnan, Oronoco\nand the rest of those great rivers in Zona Torrida, which have all commonly\nthe same passions at set times: and by good husbandry and policy hereafter\nno doubt may come to be as populous, as well tilled, as fruitful, as Egypt\nitself or Cauchinthina? I would observe all those motions of the sea, and\nfrom what cause they proceed, from the moon (as the vulgar hold) or earth's\nmotion, which Galileus, in the fourth dialogue of his system of the world,\nso eagerly proves, and firmly demonstrates; or winds, as [3014] some will.\nWhy in that quiet ocean of Zur, _in mari pacifico_, it is scarce perceived,\nin our British seas most violent, in the Mediterranean and Red Sea so\nvehement, irregular, and diverse? Why the current in that Atlantic Ocean\nshould still be in some places from, in some again towards the north, and\nwhy they come sooner than go? and so from Moabar to Madagascar in that\nIndian Ocean, the merchants come in three weeks, as [3015]Scaliger\ndiscusseth, they return scarce in three months, with the same or like\nwinds: the continual current is from east to west. Whether Mount Athos,\nPelion, Olympus, Ossa, Caucasus, Atlas, be so high as Pliny, Solinus, Mela\nrelate, above clouds, meteors, _ubi nec aurae nec venti spirant_ (insomuch\nthat they that ascend die suddenly very often, the air is so subtile,) 1250\npaces high, according to that measure of Dicearchus, or 78 miles\nperpendicularly high, as Jacobus Mazonius, _sec. 3. et 4._ expounding that\nplace of Aristotle about Caucasus; and as [3016]Blancanus the Jesuit\ncontends out of Clavius and Nonius demonstrations _de Crepusculis_: or\nrather 32 stadiums, as the most received opinion is; or 4 miles, which the\nheight of no mountain doth perpendicularly exceed, and is equal to the\ngreatest depths of the sea, which is, as Scaliger holds, 1580 paces, Exer.\n38, others 100 paces. I would see those inner parts of America, whether\nthere be any such great city of Manoa, or Eldorado, in that golden empire,\nwhere the highways are as much beaten (one reports) as between Madrid and\nValadolid in Spain; or any such Amazons as he relates, or gigantic\nPatagones in Chica; with that miraculous mountain [3017]Ybouyapab in the\nNorthern Brazil, _cujus jugum sternitur in amoenissimam planitiem_, &c. or\nthat of Pariacacca so high elevated in Peru. [3018]The peak of Tenerife how\nhigh it is? 70 miles, or 50 as Patricius holds, or 9 as Snellius\ndemonstrates in his Eratosthenes: see that strange [3019]Cirknickzerksey\nlake in Carniola, whose waters gush so fast out of the ground, that they\nwill overtake a swift horseman, and by and by with as incredible celerity\nare supped up: which Lazius and Wernerus make an argument of the Argonauts\nsailing under ground. And that vast den or hole called [3020]Esmellen in\nMuscovia, _quae visitur horriendo hiatu_, &c. which if anything casually\nfall in, makes such a roaring noise, that no thunder, or ordnance, or\nwarlike engine can make the like; such another is Gilber's Cave in Lapland,\nwith many the like. I would examine the Caspian Sea, and see where and how\nit exonerates itself, after it hath taken in Volga, Jaxares, Oxus, and\nthose great rivers; at the mouth of Oby, or where? What vent the Mexican\nlake hath, the Titicacan in Peru, or that circular pool in the vale of\nTerapeia, of which Acosta _l. 3. c. 16._ hot in a cold country, the spring\nof which boils up in the middle twenty foot square, and hath no vent but\nexhalation: and that of _Mare mortuum_ in Palestine, of Thrasymene, at\nPeruzium in Italy: the Mediterranean itself. For from the ocean, at the\nStraits of Gibraltar, there is a perpetual current into the Levant, and so\nlikewise by the Thracian Bosphorus out of the Euxine or Black Sea, besides\nall those great rivers of Nile, Po, Rhone, &c. how is this water consumed,\nby the sun or otherwise? I would find out with Trajan the fountains of\nDanube, of Ganges, Oxus, see those Egyptian pyramids, Trajan's bridge,\n_Grotto de Sybilla_, Lucullus's fishponds, the temple of Nidrose, &c.\n(And, if I could, observe what becomes of swallows, storks, cranes,\ncuckoos, nightingales, redstarts, and many other kind of singing birds,\nwater-fowls, hawks, &c. some of them are only seen in summer, some in\nwinter; some are observed in the [3021]snow, and at no other times, each\nhave their seasons. In winter not a bird is in Muscovy to be found, but at\nthe spring in an instant the woods and hedges are full of them, saith\n[3022]Herbastein: how comes it to pass? Do they sleep in winter, like\nGesner's Alpine mice; or do they lie hid (as [3023]Olaus affirms) \"in the\nbottom of lakes and rivers, _spiritum continentes_? often so found by\nfishermen in Poland and Scandia, two together, mouth to mouth, wing to\nwing; and when the spring comes they revive again, or if they be brought\ninto a stove, or to the fireside.\" Or do they follow the sun, as Peter\nMartyr _legat Babylonica l. 2._ manifestly convicts, out of his own\nknowledge; for when he was ambassador in Egypt, he saw swallows, Spanish\nkites, [3024]and many such other European birds, in December and January\nvery familiarly flying, and in great abundance, about Alexandria, _ubi\nfloridae tunc arbores ac viridaria_. Or lie they hid in caves, rocks, and\nhollow trees, as most think, in deep tin-mines or sea-cliffs, as [3025]Mr.\nCarew gives out? I conclude of them all, for my part, as [3026]Munster doth\nof cranes and storks; whence they come, whither they go, _incompertum\nadhuc_, as yet we know not. We see them here, some in summer, some in\nwinter; \"their coming and going is sure in the night: in the plains of\nAsia\" (saith he) \"the storks meet on such a set day, he that comes last is\ntorn in pieces, and so they get them gone.\" Many strange places, Isthmi,\nEuripi, Chersonesi, creeks, havens, promontories, straits, Lakes, baths,\nrocks, mountains, places, and fields, where cities have been ruined or\nswallowed, battles fought, creatures, sea-monsters, remora, &c. minerals,\nvegetals. Zoophytes were fit to be considered in such an expedition, and\namongst the rest that of [3027]Harbastein his Tartar lamb, [3028]Hector\nBoethius goosebearing tree in the orchards, to which Cardan _lib. 7. cap.\n36. de rerum varietat._ subscribes: [3029]Vertomannus wonderful palm, that\n[3030] fly in Hispaniola, that shines like a torch in the night, that one\nmay well see to write; those spherical stones in Cuba which nature hath so\nmade, and those like birds, beasts, fishes, crowns, swords, saws, pots, &c.\nusually found in the metal mines in Saxony about Mansfield, and in Poland\nnear Nokow and Pallukie, as [3031]Munster and others relate. Many rare\ncreatures and novelties each part of the world affords: amongst the rest, I\nwould know for a certain whether there be any such men, as Leo Suavius, in\nhis comment on Paracelsus _de sanit. tuend_. and [3032]Gaguinus records in\nhis description of Muscovy, \"that in Lucomoria, a province in Russia, lie\nfast asleep as dead all winter, from the 27 of November, like frogs and\nswallows, benumbed with cold, but about the 24 of April in the spring they\nrevive again, and go about their business.\" I would examine that\ndemonstration of Alexander Picolomineus, whether the earth's superficies be\nbigger than the seas: or that of Archimedes be true, the superficies of all\nwater is even? Search the depth, and see that variety of sea-monsters and\nfishes, mermaids, seamen, horses, &c. which it affords. Or whether that be\ntrue which Jordanus Brunus scoffs at, that if God did not detain it, the\nsea would overflow the earth by reason of his higher site, and which\nJosephus Blancanus the Jesuit in his interpretation on those mathematical\nplaces of Aristotle, foolishly fears, and in a just tract proves by many\ncircumstances, that in time the sea will waste away the land, and all the\nglobe of the earth shall be covered with waters; _risum teneatis amici_?\nwhat the sea takes away in one place it adds in another. Methinks he might\nrather suspect the sea should in time be filled by land, trees grow up,\ncarcasses, &c. that all-devouring fire, _omnia devorans et consumens_, will\nsooner cover and dry up the vast ocean with sand and ashes. I would examine\nthe true seat of that terrestrial [3033]paradise, and where Ophir was\nwhence Solomon did fetch his gold: from Peruana, which some suppose, or\nthat Aurea Chersonesus, as Dominicus Niger, Arias Montanus, Goropius, and\nothers will. I would censure all Pliny's, Solinus', Strabo's, Sir John\nMandeville's, Olaus Magnus', Marcus Polus' lies, correct those errors in\nnavigation, reform cosmographical charts, and rectify longitudes, if it\nwere possible; not by the compass, as some dream, with Mark Ridley in his\ntreatise of magnetical bodies, _cap. 43._ for as Cabeus _magnet philos.\nlib. 3. cap. 4._ fully resolves, there is no hope thence, yet I would\nobserve some better means to find them out.\n\nI would have a convenient place to go down with Orpheus, Ulysses, Hercules,\n[3034]Lucian's Menippus, at St. Patrick's purgatory, at Trophonius' den,\nHecla in Iceland, Aetna in Sicily, to descend and see what is done in the\nbowels of the earth: do stones and metals grow there still? how come fir\ntrees to be [3035]digged out from tops of hills, as in our mosses, and\nmarshes all over Europe? How come they to dig up fish bones, shells, beams,\nironworks, many fathoms under ground, and anchors in mountains far remote\nfrom all seas? [3036]Anno 1460 at Bern in Switzerland 50 fathom deep a ship\nwas digged out of a mountain, where they got metal ore, in which were 48\ncarcasses of men, with other merchandise. That such things are ordinarily\nfound in tops of hills, Aristotle insinuates in his meteors,\n[3037]Pomponius Mela in his first book, _c. de Numidia_, and familiarly in\nthe Alps, saith [3038]Blancanus the Jesuit, the like is to be seen: came\nthis from earthquakes, or from Noah's flood, as Christians suppose, or is\nthere a vicissitude of sea and land, as Anaximenes held of old, the\nmountains of Thessaly would become seas, and seas again mountains? The\nwhole world belike should be new moulded, when it seemed good to those\nall-commanding powers, and turned inside out, as we do haycocks in harvest,\ntop to bottom, or bottom to top: or as we turn apples to the fire, move the\nworld upon his centre; that which is under the poles now, should be\ntranslated to the equinoctial, and that which is under the torrid zone to\nthe circle arctic and antarctic another while, and so be reciprocally\nwarmed by the sun: or if the worlds be infinite, and every fixed star a\nsun, with his compassing planets (as Brunus and Campanella conclude) cast\nthree or four worlds into one; or else of one world make three or four new,\nas it shall seem to them best. To proceed, if the earth be 21,500 miles in\n[3039]compass, its diameter is 7,000 from us to our antipodes, and what\nshall be comprehended in all that space? What is the centre of the earth?\nis it pure element only, as Aristotle decrees, inhabited (as [3040]\nParacelsus thinks) with creatures, whose chaos is the earth: or with\nfairies, as the woods and waters (according to him) are with nymphs, or as\nthe air with spirits? Dionisiodorus, a mathematician in [3041]Pliny, that\nsent a letter, _ad superos_ after he was dead, from the centre of the\nearth, to signify what distance the same centre was from the _superficies_\nof the same, viz. 42,000 stadiums, might have done well to have satisfied\nall these doubts. Or is it the place of hell, as Virgil in his Aenides,\nPlato, Lucian, Dante, and others poetically describe it, and as many of our\ndivines think? In good earnest, Anthony Rusca, one of the society of that\nAmbrosian College, in Milan, in his great volume _de Inferno, lib. 1. cap.\n47._ is stiff in this tenet, 'tis a corporeal fire tow, _cap. 5. I. 2._ as\nhe there disputes. \"Whatsoever philosophers write\" (saith [3042]Surius)\n\"there be certain mouths of hell, and places appointed for the punishment\nof men's souls, as at Hecla in Iceland, where the ghosts of dead men are\nfamiliarly seen, and sometimes talk with the living: God would have such\nvisible places, that mortal men might be certainly informed, that there be\nsuch punishments after death, and learn hence to fear God.\" Kranzius _Dan.\nhist. lib. 2. cap. 24._ subscribes to this opinion of Surius, so doth\nColerus _cap. 12. lib. de immortal animae_ (out of the authority belike of\nSt. Gregory, Durand, and the rest of the schoolmen, who derive as much from\nAetna in Sicily, Lipari, Hiera, and those sulphureous vulcanian islands)\nmaking Terra del Fuego, and those frequent volcanoes in America, of which\nAcosta _lib. 3. cap. 24._ that fearful mount Hecklebirg in Norway, an\nespecial argument to prove it, [3043]\"where lamentable screeches and\nhowlings are continually heard, which strike a terror to the auditors;\nfiery chariots are commonly seen to bring in the souls of men in the\nlikeness of crows, and devils ordinarily go in and out.\" Such another proof\nis that place near the Pyramids in Egypt, by Cairo, as well to confirm this\nas the resurrection, mentioned by [3044]Kornmannus _mirac. mort. lib. 1.\ncap. 30._ Camerarius _oper. suc. cap. 37._ Bredenbachius _pereg. ter.\nsanct._ and some others, \"where once a year dead bodies arise about March,\nand walk, after awhile hide themselves again: thousands of people come\nyearly to see them.\" But these and such like testimonies others reject, as\nfables, illusions of spirits, and they will have no such local known place,\nmore than Styx or Phlegethon, Pluto's court, or that poetical _Infernus_,\nwhere Homer's soul was seen hanging on a tree, &c., to which they ferried\nover in Charon's boat, or went down at Hermione in Greece, _compendiaria ad\nInfernos via_, which is the shortest cut, _quia nullum a mortuis naulum eo\nloci exposcunt_, (saith [3045]Gerbelius) and besides there were no fees to\nbe paid. Well then, is it hell, or purgatory, as Bellarmine: or _Limbus\npatrum_, as Gallucius will, and as Rusca will (for they have made maps of\nit) [3046]or Ignatius parler? Virgil, sometimes bishop of Saltburg (as\nAventinus _anno_ 745 relates) by Bonifacius bishop of Mentz was therefore\ncalled in question, because he held antipodes (which they made a doubt\nwhether Christ died for) and so by that means took away the seat of hell,\nor so contracted it, that it could bear no proportion to heaven, and\ncontradicted that opinion of Austin, Basil, Lactantius that held the earth\nround as a trencher (whom Acosta and common experience more largely\nconfute) but not as a ball; and Jerusalem where Christ died the middle of\nit; or Delos, as the fabulous Greeks feigned: because when Jupiter let two\neagles loose, to fly from the world's ends east and west, they met at\nDelos. But that scruple of Bonifacius is now quite taken away by our latter\ndivines: Franciscus Ribera, _in cap. 14. Apocalyps._ will have hell a\nmaterial and local fire in the centre of the earth, 200 Italian miles in\ndiameter, as he defines it out of those words, _Exivit sanguis de\nterra--per stadia mille sexcenta_, &c. But Lessius _lib. 13. de moribus\ndivinis, cap. 24._ will have this local hell far less, one Dutch mile in\ndiameter, all filled with fire and brimstone: because, as he there\ndemonstrates, that space, cubically multiplied, will make a sphere able to\nhold eight hundred thousand millions of damned bodies (allowing each body\nsix foot square) which will abundantly suffice; _Cum cerium sit, inquit,\nfacta subductione, non futuros centies mille milliones damnandorum._ But if\nit be no material fire (as Sco. Thomas, Bonaventure, Soncinas, Voscius, and\nothers argue) it may be there or elsewhere, as Keckerman disputes _System.\nTheol._ for sure somewhere it is, _certum est alicubi, etsi definitus\ncirculus non assignetur._ I will end the controversy in [3047]Austin's\nwords, \"Better doubt of things concealed, than to contend about\nuncertainties, where Abraham's bosom is, and hell fire:\" [3048]_Vix a\nmansuetis, a contentiosis nunquam invenitur_; scarce the meek, the\ncontentious shall never find. If it be solid earth, 'tis the fountain of\nmetals, waters, which by his innate temper turns air into water, which\nsprings up in several chinks, to moisten the earth's _superficies_, and\nthat in a tenfold proportion (as Aristotle holds) or else these fountains\ncome directly from the sea, by [3049]secret passages, and so made fresh\nagain, by running through the bowels of the earth; and are either thick,\nthin, hot, cold, as the matter or minerals are by which they pass; or as\nPeter Martyr _Ocean. Decad. lib. 9._ and some others hold, from [3050]\nabundance of rain that falls, or from that ambient heat and cold, which\nalters that inward heat, and so _per consequens_ the generation of waters.\nOr else it may be full of wind, or a sulphureous innate fire, as our\nmeteorologists inform us, which sometimes breaking out, causeth those\nhorrible earthquakes, which are so frequent in these days in Japan, China,\nand oftentimes swallow up whole cities. Let Lucian's Menippus consult with\nor ask of Tiresias, if you will not believe philosophers, he shall clear\nall your doubts when he makes a second voyage.\n\nIn the mean time let us consider of that which is _sub dio_, and find out a\ntrue cause, if it be possible, of such accidents, meteors, alterations, as\nhappen above ground. Whence proceed that variety of manners, and a distinct\ncharacter (as it were) to several nations? Some are wise, subtile, witty;\nothers dull, sad and heavy; some big, some little, as Tully de Fato, Plato\nin Timaeo, Vegetius and Bodine prove at large, _method. cap. 5._ some soft,\nand some hardy, barbarous, civil, black, dun, white, is it from the air,\nfrom the soil, influence of stars, or some other secret cause? Why doth\nAfrica breed so many venomous beasts, Ireland none? Athens owls, Crete\nnone? [3051]Why hath Daulis and Thebes no swallows (so Pausanius informeth\nus) as well as the rest of Greece, [3052]Ithaca no hares, Pontus asses,\nScythia swine? whence comes this variety of complexions, colours, plants,\nbirds, beasts, [3053]metals, peculiar almost to every place? Why so many\nthousand strange birds and beasts proper to America alone, as Acosta\ndemands _lib. 4. cap. 36._ were they created in the six days, or ever in\nNoah's ark? if there, why are they not dispersed and found in other\ncountries? It is a thing (saith he) hath long held me in suspense; no\nGreek, Latin, Hebrew ever heard of them before, and yet as differing from\nour European animals, as an egg and a chestnut: and which is more, kine,\nhorses, sheep, &c., till the Spaniards brought them, were never heard of in\nthose parts? How comes it to pass, that in the same site, in one latitude,\nto such as are _Perioeci_, there should be such difference of soil,\ncomplexion, colour, metal, air, &c. The Spaniards are white, and so are\nItalians, when as the inhabitants about [3054]_Caput bonae spei_ are\nblackamoors, and yet both alike distant from the equator: nay they that\ndwell in the same parallel line with these Negroes, as about the Straits of\nMagellan, are white coloured, and yet some in Presbyter John's country in\nEthiopia are dun; they in Zeilan and Malabar parallel with them again\nblack: Manamotapa in Africa, and St. Thomas Isle are extreme hot, both\nunder the line, coal black their inhabitants, whereas in Peru they are\nquite opposite in colour, very temperate, or rather cold, and yet both\nalike elevated. Moscow in 53. degrees of latitude extreme cold, as those\nnorthern countries usually are, having one perpetual hard frost all winter\nlong; and in 52. deg. lat. sometimes hard frost and snow all summer, as\nButton's Bay, &c., or by fits; and yet [3055]England near the same\nlatitude, and Ireland, very moist, warm, and more temperate in winter than\nSpain, Italy, or France. Is it the sea that causeth this difference, and\nthe air that comes from it: Why then is [3056]Ister so cold near the\nEuxine, Pontus, Bithynia, and all Thrace; _frigidas regiones_ Maginus calls\nthem, and yet their latitude is but 42. which should be hot: [3057]\nQuevira, or Nova Albion in America, bordering on the sea, was so cold in\nJuly, that our [3058]Englishmen could hardly endure it. At Noremberga in\n45. lat. all the sea is frozen ice, and yet in a more southern latitude\nthan ours. New England, and the island of Cambrial Colchos, which that\nnoble gentleman Mr. Vaughan, or Orpheus junior, describes in his Golden\nFleece, is in the same latitude with little Britain in France, and yet\ntheir winter begins not till January, their spring till May; which search\nhe accounts worthy of an astrologer: is this from the easterly winds, or\nmelting of ice and snow dissolved within the circle arctic; or that the air\nbeing thick, is longer before it be warm by the sunbeams, and once heated\nlike an oven will keep itself from cold? Our climes breed lice, [3059]\nHungary and Ireland _male audiunt_ in this kind; come to the Azores, by a\nsecret virtue of that air they are instantly consumed, and all our European\nvermin almost, saith Ortelius. Egypt is watered with Nilus not far from the\nsea, and yet there it seldom or never rains: Rhodes, an island of the same\nnature, yields not a cloud, and yet our islands ever dropping and inclining\nto rain. The Atlantic Ocean is still subject to storms, but in Del Zur, or\n_Mare pacifico_, seldom or never any. Is it from tropic stars, _apertio\nportarum_, in the dodecotemories or constellations, the moon's mansions,\nsuch aspects of planets, such winds, or dissolving air, or thick air, which\ncauseth this and the like differences of heat and cold? Bodin relates of a\nPortugal ambassador, that coming from [3060]Lisbon to [3061]Danzig in\nSpruce, found greater heat there than at any time at home. Don Garcia de\nSylva, legate to Philip III., king of Spain, residing at Ispahan in Persia,\n1619, in his letter to the Marquess of Bedmar, makes mention of greater\ncold in Ispahan, whose lat. is 31. gr. than ever he felt in Spain, or any\npart of Europe. The torrid zone was by our predecessors held to be\nuninhabitable, but by our modern travellers found to be most temperate,\nbedewed with frequent rains, and moistening showers, the breeze and cooling\nblasts in some parts, as [3062]Acosta describes, most pleasant and fertile.\nArica in Chile is by report one of the sweetest places that ever the sun\nshined on, _Olympus terrae_, a heaven on earth: how incomparably do some\nextol Mexico in Nova Hispania, Peru, Brazil, &c., in some again hard, dry,\nsandy, barren, a very desert, and still in the same latitude. Many times we\nfind great diversity of air in the same [3063]country, by reason of the\nsite to seas, hills or dales, want of water, nature of soil, and the like:\nas in Spain Arragon is _aspera et sicca_, harsh and evil inhabited;\nEstremadura is dry, sandy, barren most part, extreme hot by reason of his\nplains; Andalusia another paradise; Valencia a most pleasant air, and\ncontinually green; so is it about [3064]Granada, on the one side fertile\nplains, on the other, continual snow to be seen all summer long on the hill\ntops. That their houses in the Alps are three quarters of the year covered\nwith snow, who knows not? That Tenerife is so cold at the top, extreme hot\nat the bottom: Mons Atlas in Africa, Libanus in Palestine, with many such,\n_tantos inter ardores fidos nivibus_, [3065]Tacitus calls them, and\nRadzivilus _epist. 2. fol. 27._ yields it to be far hotter there than in\nany part of Italy: 'tis true; but they are highly elevated, near the middle\nregion, and therefore cold, _ob paucam solarium radiorum refractionem_, as\nSerrarius answers, _com. in. 3. cap. Josua quaest. 5._ Abulensis _quaest.\n37._ In the heat of summer, in the king's palace in Escurial, the air is\nmost temperate, by reason of a cold blast which comes from the snowy\nmountains of Sierra de Cadarama hard by, when as in Toledo it is very hot:\nso in all other countries. The causes of these alterations are commonly by\nreason of their nearness (I say) to the middle region; but this diversity\nof air, in places equally situated, elevated and distant from the pole, can\nhardly be satisfied with that diversity of plants, birds, beasts, which is\nso familiar with us: with Indians, everywhere, the sun is equally distant,\nthe same vertical stars, the same irradiations of planets, aspects like,\nthe same nearness of seas, the same superficies, the same soil, or not much\ndifferent. Under the equator itself, amongst the Sierras, Andes, Lanos, as\nHerrera, Laet, and [3066]Acosta contend, there is _tam mirabilis et\ninopinata varietas_, such variety of weather, _ut merito exerceat ingenia_,\nthat no philosophy can yet find out the true cause of it. When I consider\nhow temperate it is in one place, saith [3067]Acosta, within the tropic of\nCapricorn, as about Laplata, and yet hard by at Potosi, in that same\naltitude, mountainous alike, extreme cold; extreme hot in Brazil, &c. _Hic\nego_, saith Acosta, _philosophiam Aristotelis meteorologicam vehementer\nirrisi, cum_, &c., when the sun comes nearest to them, they have great\ntempests, storms, thunder and lightning, great store of rain, snow, and the\nfoulest weather: when the sun is vertical, their rivers overflow, the\nmorning fair and hot, noonday cold and moist: all which is opposite to us.\nHow comes it to pass? Scaliger _poetices l. 3. c. 16._ discourseth thus of\nthis subject. How comes, or wherefore is this _temeraria siderum\ndispositio_, this rash placing of stars, or as Epicurus will, _fortuita_,\nor accidental? Why are some big, some little, why are they so confusedly,\nunequally situated in the heavens, and set so much out of order? In all\nother things nature is equal, proportionable, and constant; there be\n_justae dimensiones, et prudens partium dispositio_, as in the fabric of\nman, his eyes, ears, nose, face, members are correspondent, _cur non idem\ncoelo opere omnium pulcherrimo_? Why are the heavens so irregular, _neque\nparibus molibus, neque paribus intervallis_, whence is this difference?\n_Diversos_ (he concludes) _efficere locorum Genios_, to make diversity of\ncountries, soils, manners, customs, characters, and constitutions among us,\n_ut quantum vicinia ad charitatem addat, sidera distrahant ad perniciem_,\nand so by this means _fluvio vel monte distincti sunt dissimiles_, the same\nplaces almost shall be distinguished in manners. But this reason is weak\nand most insufficient. The fixed stars are removed since Ptolemy's time 26.\ngr. from the first of Aries, and if the earth be immovable, as their site\nvaries, so should countries vary, and diverse alterations would follow. But\nthis we perceive not; as in Tully's time with us in Britain, _coelum visu\nfoedum, et in quo facile generantur nubes_, &c., 'tis so still. Wherefore\nBodine _Theat. nat. lib. 2._ and some others, will have all these\nalterations and effects immediately to proceed from those genii, spirits,\nangels, which rule and domineer in several places; they cause storms,\nthunder, lightning, earthquakes, ruins, tempests, great winds, floods, &c.,\nthe philosophers of Conimbra, will refer this diversity to the influence of\nthat empyrean heaven: for some say the eccentricity of the sun is come\nnearer to the earth than in Ptolemy's time, the virtue therefore of all the\nvegetals is decayed, [3068]men grow less, &c. There are that observe new\nmotions of the heavens, new stars, _palantia sidera_, comets, clouds, call\nthem what you will, like those Medicean, Burbonian, Austrian planets,\nlately detected, which do not decay, but come and go, rise higher and\nlower, hide and show themselves amongst the fixed stars, amongst the\nplanets, above and beneath the moon, at set times, now nearer, now farther\noff, together, asunder; as he that plays upon a sackbut by pulling it up\nand down alters his tones and tunes, do they their stations and places,\nthough to us undiscerned; and from those motions proceed (as they conceive)\ndiverse alterations. Clavius conjectures otherwise, but they be but\nconjectures. About Damascus in Coeli-Syria is a [3069]Paradise, by reason\nof the plenty of waters, _in promptu causa est_, and the deserts of Arabia\nbarren, because of rocks, rolling seas of sands, and dry mountains _quod\ninaquosa_ (saith Adricomius) _montes habens asperos, saxosos, praecipites,\nhorroris et mortis speciem prae se ferentes_, \"uninhabitable therefore of\nmen, birds, beasts, void of all green trees, plants, and fruits, a vast\nrocky horrid wilderness, which by no art can be manured, 'tis evident.\"\nBohemia is cold, for that it lies all along to the north. But why should it\nbe so hot in Egypt, or there never rain? Why should those [3070]etesian and\nnortheastern winds blow continually and constantly so long together, in\nsome places, at set times, one way still, in the dog-days only: here\nperpetual drought, there dropping showers; here foggy mists, there a\npleasant air; here [3071]terrible thunder and lightning at such set\nseasons, here frozen seas all the year, there open in the same latitude, to\nthe rest no such thing, nay quite opposite is to be found? Sometimes (as in\n[3072]Peru) on the one side of the mountains it is hot, on the other cold,\nhere snow, there wind, with infinite such. Fromundus in his Meteors will\nexcuse or solve all this by the sun's motion, but when there is such\ndiversity to such as _Perioeci_ or very near site, how can that position\nhold?\n\nWho can give a reason of this diversity of meteors, that it should rain\n[3073]stones, frogs, mice, &c. Rats, which they call _lemmer_ in Norway,\nand are manifestly observed (as [3074]Munster writes) by the inhabitants,\nto descend and fall with some feculent showers, and like so many locusts,\nconsume all that is green. Leo Afer speaks as much of locusts, about Fez in\nBarbary there be infinite swarms in their fields upon a sudden: so at Aries\nin France, 1553, the like happened by the same mischief, all their grass\nand fruits were devoured, _magna incolarum admiratione et consternatione_\n(as Valleriola _obser. med. lib. 1. obser. 1._ relates) _coelum subito\nobumbrabant_, &c. he concludes, [3075]it could not be from natural causes,\nthey cannot imagine whence they come, but from heaven. Are these and such\ncreatures, corn, wood, stones, worms, wool, blood, &c. lifted up into the\nmiddle region by the sunbeams, as [3076]Baracellus the physician disputes,\nand thence let fall with showers, or there engendered? [3077]Cornelius\nGemma is of that opinion, they are there conceived by celestial influences:\nothers suppose they are immediately from God, or prodigies raised by art\nand illusions of spirits, which are princes of the air; to whom Bodin.\n_lib. 2. Theat. Nat_. subscribes. In fine, of meteors in general,\nAristotle's reasons are exploded by Bernardinus Telesius, by Paracelsus his\nprinciples confuted, and other causes assigned, sal, sulphur, mercury, in\nwhich his disciples are so expert, that they can alter elements, and\nseparate at their pleasure, make perpetual motions, not as Cardan, Tasneir,\nPeregrinus, by some magnetical virtue, but by mixture of elements; imitate\nthunder, like Salmoneus, snow, hail, the sea's ebbing and flowing, give\nlife to creatures (as they say) without generation, and what not? P. Nonius\nSaluciensis and Kepler take upon them to demonstrate that no meteors,\nclouds, fogs, [3078]vapours, arise higher than fifty or eighty miles, and\nall the rest to be purer air or element of fire: which [3079]Cardan,\n[3080]Tycho, and [3081]John Pena manifestly confute by refractions, and\nmany other arguments, there is no such element of fire at all. If, as Tycho\nproves, the moon be distant from us fifty and sixty semi-diameters of the\nearth: and as Peter Nonius will have it, the air be so angust, what\nproportion is there betwixt the other three elements and it? To what use\nserves it? Is it full of spirits which inhabit it, as the Paracelsians and\nPlatonists hold, the higher the more noble, [3082]full of birds, or a mere\nvacuum to no purpose? It is much controverted between Tycho Brahe and\nChristopher Rotman, the landgrave of Hesse's mathematician, in their\nastronomical epistles, whether it be the same _Diaphanum_ clearness, matter\nof air and heavens, or two distinct essences? Christopher Rotman, John\nPena, Jordanus Brunus, with many other late mathematicians, contend it is\nthe same and one matter throughout, saving that the higher still the purer\nit is, and more subtile; as they find by experience in the top of some\nhills in [3083]America; if a man ascend, he faints instantly for want of\nthicker air to refrigerate the heart. Acosta, _l. 3. c. 9._ calls this\nmountain Periacaca in Peru; it makes men cast and vomit, he saith, that\nclimb it, as some other of those Andes do in the deserts of Chile for five\nhundred miles together, and for extremity of cold to lose their fingers and\ntoes. Tycho will have two distinct matters of heaven and air; but to say\ntruth, with some small qualification, they have one and the self-same\nopinion about the essence and matter of heavens; that it is not hard and\nimpenetrable, as peripatetics hold, transparent, of a _quinta essentia_,\n[3084]\"but that it is penetrable and soft as the air itself is, and that\nthe planets move in it, as birds in the air, fishes in the sea.\" This they\nprove by motion of comets, and otherwise (though Claremontius in his\nAntitycho stiffly opposes), which are not generated, as Aristotle teacheth,\nin the aerial region, of a hot and dry exhalation, and so consumed: but as\nAnaxagoras and Democritus held of old, of a celestial matter: and as [3085]\nTycho, [3086]Eliseus, Roeslin, Thaddeus, Haggesius, Pena, Rotman,\nFracastorius, demonstrate by their progress, parallaxes, refractions,\nmotions of the planets, which interfere and cut one another's orbs, now\nhigher, and then lower, as [Symbol: Mars] amongst the rest, which\nsometimes, as [3087]Kepler confirms by his own, and Tycho's accurate\nobservations, comes nearer the earth than the [Symbol: Sun] and is again\neftsoons aloft in Jupiter's orb; and [3088]other sufficient reasons, far\nabove the moon: exploding in the meantime that element of fire, those\nfictitious first watery movers, those heavens I mean above the firmament,\nwhich Delrio, Lodovicus Imola, Patricius, and many of the fathers affirm;\nthose monstrous orbs of eccentrics, and _Eccentre Epicycles deserentes_.\nWhich howsoever Ptolemy, Alhasen, Vitellio, Purbachius, Maginus, Clavius,\nand many of their associates, stiffly maintain to be real orbs, eccentric,\nconcentric, circles aequant, &c. are absurd and ridiculous. For who is so\nmad to think that there should be so many circles, like subordinate wheels\nin a clock, all impenetrable and hard, as they feign, add and subtract at\ntheir pleasure. [3089]Maginus makes eleven heavens, subdivided into their\norbs and circles, and all too little to serve those particular appearances:\nFracastorius, seventy-two homocentrics; Tycho Brahe, Nicholas Ramerus,\nHeliseus Roeslin, have peculiar hypotheses of their own inventions; and\nthey be but inventions, as most of them acknowledge, as we admit of\nequators, tropics, colures, circles arctic and antarctic, for doctrine's\nsake (though Ramus thinks them all unnecessary), they will have them\nsupposed only for method and order. Tycho hath feigned I know not how many\nsubdivisions of epicycles in epicycles, &c., to calculate and express the\nmoon's motion: but when all is done, as a supposition, and no otherwise;\nnot (as he holds) hard, impenetrable, subtile, transparent, &c., or making\nmusic, as Pythagoras maintained of old, and Robert Constantine of late, but\nstill, quiet, liquid, open, &c.\n\nIf the heavens then be penetrable, as these men deliver, and no lets, it\nwere not amiss in this aerial progress, to make wings and fly up, which\nthat Turk in Busbequius made his fellow-citizens in Constantinople believe\nhe would perform: and some new-fangled wits, methinks, should some time or\nother find out: or if that may not be, yet with a Galileo's glass, or\nIcaromenippus' wings in Lucian, command the spheres and heavens, and see\nwhat is done amongst them. Whether there be generation and corruption, as\nsome think, by reason of ethereal comets, that in Cassiopea, 1572, that in\nCygno, 1600, that in Sagittarius, 1604, and many like, which by no means\nJul. Caesar la Galla, that Italian philosopher, in his physical disputation\nwith Galileis _de phenomenis in orbe lunae, cap. 9._ will admit: or that\nthey were created _ab initio_, and show themselves at set times. and as\n[3090]Helisaeus Roeslin contends, have poles, axle-trees, circles of their\nown, and regular motions. For, _non pereunt, sed minuuntur et disparent_,\n[3091]Blancanus holds they come and go by fits, casting their tails still\nfrom the sun: some of them, as a burning-glass, projects the sunbeams from\nit; though not always neither: for sometimes a comet casts his tail from\nVenus, as Tycho observes. And as [3092]Helisaeus Roeslin of some others,\nfrom the moon, with little stars about them _ad stuporem astronomorum; cum\nmultis aliis in coelo miraculis_, all which argue with those Medicean,\nAustrian, and Burbonian stars, that the heaven of the planets is\nindistinct, pure, and open, in which the planets move _certis legibus ac\nmetis_. Examine likewise, _An coelum sit coloratum_? Whether the stars be\nof that bigness, distance, as astronomers relate, so many in [3093]number,\n1026, or 1725, as J. Bayerus; or as some Rabbins, 29,000 myriads; or as\nGalileo discovers by his glasses, infinite, and that _via lactea_, a\nconfused light of small stars, like so many nails in a door: or all in a\nrow, like those 12,000 isles of the Maldives in the Indian ocean? Whether\nthe least visible star in the eighth sphere be eighteen times bigger than\nthe earth; and as Tycho calculates, 14,000 semi-diameters distant from it?\nWhether they be thicker parts of the orbs, as Aristotle delivers: or so\nmany habitable worlds, as Democritus? Whether they have light of their own,\nor from the sun, or give light round, as Patritius discourseth? _An aeque\ndistent a centra mundi_? Whether light be of their essence; and that light\nbe a substance or an accident? Whether they be hot by themselves, or by\naccident cause heat? Whether there be such a precession of the equinoxes as\nCopernicus holds, or that the eighth sphere move? _An bene philosophentur_,\nR. Bacon and J. Dee, _Aphorism. de multiplicatione specierum_? Whether\nthere be any such images ascending with each degree of the zodiac in the\neast, as Aliacensis feigns? _An aqua super coelum_? as Patritius and the\nschoolmen will, a crystalline [3094]watery heaven, which is [3095]\ncertainly to be understood of that in the middle region? for otherwise, if\nat Noah's flood the water came from thence, it must be above a hundred\nyears falling down to us, as [3096]some calculate. Besides, _An terra sit\nanimata_? which some so confidently believe, with Orpheus, Hermes,\nAverroes, from which all other souls of men, beasts, devils, plants,\nfishes, &c. are derived, and into which again, after some revolutions, as\nPlato in his Timaeus, Plotinus in his Enneades more largely discuss, they\nreturn (see Chalcidius and Bennius, Plato's commentators), as all\nphilosophical matter, _in materiam primam_. Keplerus, Patritius, and some\nother Neoterics, have in part revived this opinion. And that every star in\nheaven hath a soul, angel or intelligence to animate or move it, &c. Or to\nomit all smaller controversies, as matters of less moment, and examine that\nmain paradox, of the earth's motion, now so much in question: Aristarchus\nSamius, Pythagoras maintained it of old, Democritus and many of their\nscholars, Didacus Astunica, Anthony Fascarinus, a Carmelite, and some other\ncommentators, will have Job to insinuate as much, _cap. 9. ver. 4._ _Qui\ncommovet terram de loco suo_, &c., and that this one place of scripture\nmakes more for the earth's motion than all the other prove against it; whom\nPineda confutes most contradict. Howsoever, it is revived since by\nCopernicus, not as a truth, but a supposition, as he himself confesseth in\nthe preface to pope Nicholas, but now maintained in good earnest by [3097]\nCalcagninus, Telesius, Kepler, Rotman, Gilbert, Digges, Galileo,\nCampanella, and especially by [3098]Lansbergius, _naturae, rationi, et\nveritati consentaneum_, by Origanus, and some [3099]others of his\nfollowers. For if the earth be the centre of the world, stand still, and\nthe heavens move, as the most received [3100]opinion is, which they call\n_inordinatam coeli dispositionem_, though stiffly maintained by Tycho,\nPtolemeus, and their adherents, _quis ille furor_? &c. what fury is that,\nsaith [3101]Dr. Gilbert, _satis animose_, as Cabeus notes, that shall drive\nthe heavens about with such incomprehensible celerity in twenty-four hours,\nwhen as every point of the firmament, and in the equator, must needs move\n(so [3102]Clavius calculates) 176,660 in one 246th part of an hour, and an\narrow out of a bow must go seven times about the earth, whilst a man can\nsay an Ave Maria, if it keep the same space, or compass the earth 1884\ntimes in an hour, which is _supra humanam cogitationem_, beyond human\nconceit: _ocyor et jaculo, et ventos, aequante sagitta_. A man could not\nride so much ground, going 40 miles a day, in 2904 years, as the firmament\ngoes in 23 hours: or so much in 203 years, as the firmament in one minute:\n_quod incredibile videtur_: and the [3103]pole-star, which to our thinking\nscarce moveth out of his place, goeth a bigger circuit than the sun, whose\ndiameter is much larger than the diameter of the heaven of the sun, and\n20,000 semi-diameters of the earth from us, with the rest of the fixed\nstars, as Tycho proves. To avoid therefore these impossibilities, they\nascribe a triple motion to the earth, the sun immovable in the centre of\nthe whole world, the earth centre of the moon, alone, above [Symbol: Mars]\nand [Symbol: Mercury], beneath [Symbol: Saturn], [Symbol: Jupiter],\n[Symbol: Mars] (or as [3104]Origanus and others will, one single motion to\nthe earth, still placed in the centre of the world, which is more probable)\na single motion to the firmament, which moves in 30 or 26 thousand years;\nand so the planets, Saturn in 30 years absolves his sole and proper motion,\nJupiter in 12, Mars in 3, &c. and so solve all appearances better than any\nway whatsoever: calculate all motions, be they in _longum_ or _latum_,\ndirect, stationary, retrograde, ascent or descent, without epicycles,\nintricate eccentrics, &c. _rectius commodiusque per unicum motum terrae_,\nsaith Lansbergius, much more certain than by those Alphonsine, or any such\ntables, which are grounded from those other suppositions. And 'tis true\nthey say, according to optic principles, the visible appearances of the\nplanets do so indeed answer to their magnitudes and orbs, and come nearest\nto mathematical observations and precedent calculations, there is no\nrepugnancy to physical axioms, because no penetration of orbs; but then\nbetween the sphere of Saturn and the firmament, there is such an incredible\nand vast [3105]space or distance (7,000,000 semi-diameters of the earth, as\nTycho calculates) void of stars: and besides, they do so enhance the\nbigness of the stars, enlarge their circuit, to solve those ordinary\nobjections of parallaxes and retrogradations of the fixed stars, that\nalteration of the poles, elevation in several places or latitude of cities\nhere on earth (for, say they, if a man's eye were in the firmament, he\nshould not at all discern that great annual motion of the earth, but it\nwould still appear _punctum indivisibile_ and seem to be fixed in one\nplace, of the same bigness) that it is quite opposite to reason, to natural\nphilosophy, and all out as absurd as disproportional (so some will) as\nprodigious, as that of the sun's swift motion of heavens. But _hoc posito_,\nto grant this their tenet of the earth's motion: if the earth move, it is a\nplanet, and shines to them in the moon, and to the other planetary\ninhabitants, as the moon and they do to us upon the earth: but shine she\ndoth, as Galileo, [3106] Kepler, and others prove, and then _per\nconsequens_, the rest of the planets are inhabited, as well as the moon,\nwhich he grants in his dissertation with Galileo's _Nuncius Sidereus_,\n[3107]\"that there be Jovial and Saturn inhabitants,\" &c., and those several\nplanets have their several moons about them, as the earth hath hers, as\nGalileo hath already evinced by his glasses: [3108]four about Jupiter, two\nabout Saturn (though Sitius the Florentine, Fortunius Licetus, and Jul.\nCaesar le Galla cavil at it) yet Kepler, the emperor's mathematician,\nconfirms out of his experience, that he saw as much by the same help, and\nmore about Mars, Venus, and the rest they hope to find out, peradventure\neven amongst the fixed stars, which Brunus and Brutius have already\naverred. Then (I say) the earth and they be planets alike, moved about the\nsun, the common centre of the world alike, and it may be those two green\nchildren which [3109] Nubrigensis speaks of in his time, that fell from\nheaven, came from thence; and that famous stone that fell from heaven in\nAristotle's time, olymp. 84, _anno tertio, ad Capuas Fluenta_, recorded by\nLaertius and others, or Ancile or buckler in Numa's time, recorded by\nFestus. We may likewise insert with Campanella and Brunus, that which\nPythagoras, Aristarchus, Samius, Heraclitus, Epicurus, Melissus,\nDemocritus, Leucippus maintained in their ages, there be [3110]infinite\nworlds, and infinite earths or systems, _in infinito aethere_, which\n[3111]Eusebius collects out of their tenets, because infinite stars and\nplanets like unto this of ours, which some stick not still to maintain and\npublicly defend, _sperabundus expecto innumerabilium mundorum in\naeternitate per ambulationem_, &c. (Nic. Hill. Londinensis _philos.\nEpicur._) For if the firmament be of such an incomparable bigness, as these\nCopernical giants will have it, _infinitum, aut infinito proximum_, so vast\nand full of innumerable stars, as being infinite in extent, one above\nanother, some higher, some lower, some nearer, some farther off, and so far\nasunder, and those so huge and great, insomuch that if the whole sphere of\nSaturn, and all that is included in it, _totum aggregatum_ (as Fromundus of\nLouvain in his tract, _de immobilitate terrae_ argues) _evehatur inter\nstellas, videri a nobis non poterat, tam immanis est distantia inter\ntellurem et fixas, sed instar puncti_, &c. If our world be small in\nrespect, why may we not suppose a plurality of worlds, those infinite stars\nvisible in the firmament to be so many suns, with particular fixed centres;\nto have likewise their subordinate planets, as the sun hath his dancing\nstill round him? which Cardinal Cusanus, Walkarinus, Brunus, and some\nothers have held, and some still maintain, _Animae, Aristotelismo\ninnutritae, et minutis speculationibus assuetae, secus forsan_, &c. Though\nthey seem close to us, they are infinitely distant, and so _per\nconsequens_, there are infinite habitable worlds: what hinders? Why should\nnot an infinite cause (as God is) produce infinite effects? as Nic. Hill.\n_Democrit. philos._ disputes: Kepler (I confess) will by no means admit of\nBrunus's infinite worlds, or that the fixed stars should be so many suns,\nwith their compassing planets, yet the said [3112]Kepler between jest and\nearnest in his perspectives, lunar geography, [3113] & _somnio suo,\ndissertat. cum nunc. sider._ seems in part to agree with this, and partly\nto contradict; for the planets, he yields them to be inhabited, he doubts\nof the stars; and so doth Tycho in his astronomical epistles, out of a\nconsideration of their vastity and greatness, break out into some such like\nspeeches, that he will never believe those great and huge bodies were made\nto no other use than this that we perceive, to illuminate the earth, a\npoint insensible in respect of the whole. But who shall dwell in these vast\nbodies, earths, worlds, [3114] \"if they be inhabited? rational creatures?\"\nas Kepler demands, \"or have they souls to be saved? or do they inhabit a\nbetter part of the world than we do? Are we or they lords of the world? And\nhow are all things made for man?\" _Difficile est nodum hunc expedire, eo\nquod nondum omnia quae huc pertinent explorata habemus_: 'tis hard to\ndetermine: this only he proves, that we are in _praecipuo mundi sinu_, in\nthe best place, best world, nearest the heart of the sun. [3115]Thomas\nCampanella, a Calabrian monk, in his second book _de sensu rerum, cap. 4_,\nsubscribes to this of Kepler; that they are inhabited he certainly\nsupposeth, but with what kind of creatures he cannot say, he labours to\nprove it by all means: and that there are infinite worlds, having made an\napology for Galileo, and dedicates this tenet of his to Cardinal Cajetanus.\nOthers freely speak, mutter, and would persuade the world (as [3116]Marinus\nMarcenus complains) that our modern divines are too severe and rigid\nagainst mathematicians; ignorant and peevish, in not admitting their true\ndemonstrations and certain observations, that they tyrannise over art,\nscience, and all philosophy, in suppressing their labours (saith\nPomponatius), forbidding them to write, to speak a truth, all to maintain\ntheir superstition, and for their profit's sake. As for those places of\nScripture which oppugn it, they will have spoken _ad captum vulgi_, and if\nrightly understood, and favourably interpreted, not at all against it; and\nas Otho Gasman, _Astrol. cap. 1. part. 1._ notes, many great divines,\nbesides Porphyrius, Proclus, Simplicius, and those heathen philosophers,\n_doctrina et aetate venerandi, Mosis Genesin mundanam popularis nescio\ncujus ruditatis, quae longa absit a vera Philosophorum eruditione,\ninsimulant_: for Moses makes mention but of two planets, [Symbol: Sun] and\n[Symbol: Moon-3/4], no four elements, &c. Read more on him, in\n[3117]Grossius and Junius. But to proceed, these and such like insolent and\nbold attempts, prodigious paradoxes, inferences must needs follow, if it\nonce be granted, which Rotman, Kepler, Gilbert, Diggeus, Origanus, Galileo,\nand others, maintain of the earth's motion, that 'tis a planet, and shines\nas the moon doth, which contains in it [3118]\"both land and sea as the moon\ndoth:\" for so they find by their glasses that _Maculae in facie Lunae_,\n\"the brighter parts are earth, the dusky sea,\" which Thales, Plutarch, and\nPythagoras formerly taught: and manifestly discern hills and dales, and\nsuch like concavities, if we may subscribe to and believe Galileo's\nobservations. But to avoid these paradoxes of the earth's motion (which the\nChurch of Rome hath lately [3119]condemned as heretical, as appears by\nBlancanus and Fromundus's writings) our latter mathematicians have rolled\nall the stones that may be stirred: and to solve all appearances and\nobjections, have invented new hypotheses, and fabricated new systems of the\nworld, out of their own Dedalaean heads. Fracastorius will have the earth\nstand still, as before; and to avoid that supposition of eccentrics and\nepicycles, he hath coined seventy-two homocentrics, to solve all\nappearances. Nicholas Ramerus will have the earth the centre of the world,\nbut movable, and the eighth sphere immovable, the five upper planets to\nmove about the sun, the sun and moon about the earth. Of which orbs Tycho\nBrahe puts the earth the centre immovable, the stars immovable, the rest\nwith Ramerus, the planets without orbs to wander in the air, keep time and\ndistance, true motion, according to that virtue which God hath given them.\n[3120]Helisaeus Roeslin censureth both, with Copernicus (whose hypothesis\n_de terrae motu_, Philippus Lansbergius hath lately vindicated, and\ndemonstrated with solid arguments in a just volume, Jansonius Caesins\n[3121]hath illustrated in a sphere.) The said Johannes Lansbergius, 1633,\nhath since defended his assertion against all the cavils and calumnies of\nFromundus his Anti-Aristarchus, Baptista Morinus, and Petrus Bartholinus:\nFromundus, 1634, hath written against him again, J. Rosseus of Aberdeen,\n&c. (sound drums and trumpets) whilst Roeslin (I say) censures all, and\nPtolemeus himself as insufficient: one offends against natural philosophy,\nanother against optic principles, a third against mathematical, as not\nanswering to astronomical observations: one puts a great space between\nSaturn's orb and the eighth sphere, another too narrow. In his own\nhypothesis he makes the earth as before the universal centre, the sun to\nthe five upper planets, to the eighth sphere he ascribes diurnal motion,\neccentrics, and epicycles to the seven planets, which hath been formerly\nexploded; and so, _Dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt_, [3122]as\na tinker stops one hole and makes two, he corrects them, and doth worse\nhimself: reforms some, and mars all. In the mean time, the world is tossed\nin a blanket amongst them, they hoist the earth up and down like a ball,\nmake it stand and go at their pleasures: one saith the sun stands, another\nhe moves; a third comes in, taking them all at rebound, and lest there\nshould any paradox be wanting, he [3123]finds certain spots and clouds in\nthe sun, by the help of glasses, which multiply (saith Keplerus) a thing\nseen a thousand times bigger _in plano_, and makes it come thirty-two times\nnearer to the eye of the beholder: but see the demonstration of this glass\nin [3124]Tarde, by means of which, the sun must turn round upon his own\ncentre, or they about the sun. Fabricius puts only three, and those in the\nsun: Apelles 15, and those without the sun, floating like the Cyanean Isles\nin the Euxine sea. [3125]Tarde, the Frenchman, hath observed thirty-three,\nand those neither spots nor clouds, as Galileo, _Epist. ad Valserum_,\nsupposeth, but planets concentric with the sun, and not far from him with\nregular motions. [3126]Christopher Shemer, a German Suisser Jesuit, _Ursica\nRosa_, divides them _in maculas et faculas_, and will have them to be fixed\n_in Solis superficie_: and to absolve their periodical and regular motion\nin twenty-seven or twenty-eight days, holding withal the rotation of the\nsun upon his centre; and all are so confident, that they have made schemes\nand tables of their motions. The [3127]Hollander, in his _dissertatiuncula\ncum Apelle_, censures all; and thus they disagree amongst themselves, old\nand new, irreconcilable in their opinions; thus Aristarchus, thus\nHipparchus, thus Ptolemeus, thus Albateginus, thus Alfraganus, thus Tycho,\nthus Ramerus, thus Roeslinus, thus Fracastorius, thus Copernicus and his\nadherents, thus Clavius and Maginus, &c., with their followers, vary and\ndetermine of these celestial orbs and bodies: and so whilst these men\ncontend about the sun and moon, like the philosophers in Lucian, it is to\nbe feared, the sun and moon will hide themselves, and be as much offended\nas [3128]she was with those, and send another messenger to Jupiter, by some\nnew-fangled Icaromenippus, to make an end of all those curious\ncontroversies, and scatter them abroad.\n\nBut why should the sun and moon be angry, or take exceptions at\nmathematicians and philosophers? when as the like measure is offered unto\nGod himself, by a company of theologasters: they are not contented to see\nthe sun and moon, measure their site and biggest distance in a glass,\ncalculate their motions, or visit the moon in a poetical fiction, or a\ndream, as he saith, [3129]_Audax facinus et memorabile nunc incipiam, neque\nhoc saeculo usurpatum prius, quid in Lunae regno hac nocte gestum sit\nexponam, et quo nemo unquam nisi somniando pervenit_, [3130]but he and\nMenippus: or as [3131]Peter Cuneus, _Bona fide agam, nihil eorum quae\nscripturus sum, verum esse scitote, &c. quae nec facta, nec futura sunt,\ndicam, [3132]stili tantum et ingenii causa_, not in jest, but in good\nearnest these gigantical Cyclops will transcend spheres, heaven, stars,\ninto that Empyrean heaven; soar higher yet, and see what God himself doth.\nThe Jewish Talmudists take upon them to determine how God spends his whole\ntime, sometimes playing with Leviathan, sometimes overseeing the world,\n&c., like Lucian's Jupiter, that spent much of the year in painting\nbutterflies' wings, and seeing who offered sacrifice; telling the hours\nwhen it should rain, how much snow should fall in such a place, which way\nthe wind should stand in Greece, which way in Africa. In the Turks'\nAlcoran, Mahomet is taken up to heaven, upon a Pegasus sent on purpose for\nhim, as he lay in bed with his wife, and after some conference with God is\nset on ground again. The pagans paint him and mangle him after a thousand\nfashions; our heretics, schismatics, and some schoolmen, come not far\nbehind: some paint him in the habit of an old man, and make maps of heaven,\nnumber the angels, tell their several [3133]names, offices: some deny God\nand his providence, some take his office out of his hands, will [3134]bind\nand loose in heaven, release, pardon, forgive, and be quarter-master with\nhim: some call his Godhead in question, his power, and attributes, his\nmercy, justice, providence: they will know with [3135]Cecilius, why good\nand bad are punished together, war, fires, plagues, infest all alike, why\nwicked men flourish, good are poor, in prison, sick, and ill at ease. Why\ndoth he suffer so much mischief and evil to be done, if he be [3136]able to\nhelp? why doth he not assist good, or resist bad, reform our wills, if he\nbe not the author of sin, and let such enormities be committed, unworthy of\nhis knowledge, wisdom, government, mercy, and providence, why lets he all\nthings be done by fortune and chance? Others as prodigiously inquire after\nhis omnipotency, _an possit plures similes creare deos? an ex scarcibaeo\ndeum? &c., et quo demum ruetis sacrificuli_? Some, by visions and\nrevelations, take upon them to be familiar with God, and to be of privy\ncouncil with him; they will tell how many, and who shall be saved, when the\nworld shall come to an end, what year, what month, and whatsoever else God\nhath reserved unto himself, and to his angels. Some again, curious\nfantastics, will know more than this, and inquire with [3137]Epicurus, what\nGod did before the world was made? was he idle? Where did he bide? What did\nhe make the world of? why did he then make it, and not before? If he made\nit new, or to have an end, how is he unchangeable, infinite, &c. Some will\ndispute, cavil, and object, as Julian did of old, whom Cyril confutes, as\nSimon Magus is feigned to do, in that [3138]dialogue betwixt him and Peter:\nand Ammonius the philosopher, in that dialogical disputation with Zacharias\nthe Christian. If God be infinitely and only good, why should he alter or\ndestroy the world? if he confound that which is good, how shall himself\ncontinue good? If he pull it down because evil, how shall he be free from\nthe evil that made it evil? &c., with many such absurd and brain-sick\nquestions, intricacies, froth of human wit, and excrements of curiosity,\n&c., which, as our Saviour told his inquisitive disciples, are not fit for\nthem to know. But hoo! I am now gone quite out of sight, I am almost giddy\nwith roving about: I could have ranged farther yet; but I am an infant, and\nnot [3139]able to dive into these profundities, or sound these depths; not\nable to understand, much less to discuss. I leave the contemplation of\nthese things to stronger wits, that have better ability, and happier\nleisure to wade into such philosophical mysteries; for put case I were as\nable as willing, yet what can one man do? I will conclude with\n[3140]Scaliger, _Nequaquam nos homines sumus, sed partes hominis, ex\nomnibus aliquid fieri potest, idque non magnum; ex singulis fere nihil_.\nBesides (as Nazianzen hath it) _Deus latere nos multa voluit_; and with\nSeneca, _cap. 35. de Cometis_, _Quid miramur tam rara mundi spectacula non\nteneri certis legibus, nondum intelligi? multae sunt gentes quae tantum de\nfacie sciunt coelum, veniet, tempus fortasse, quo ista quae, nunc latent in\nlucem dies extrahat longioris aevi diligentia, una aetas non sufficit,\nposteri_, &c., when God sees his time, he will reveal these mysteries to\nmortal men, and show that to some few at last, which he hath concealed so\nlong. For I am of [3141]his mind, that Columbus did not find out America by\nchance, but God directed him at that time to discover it: it was contingent\nto him, but necessary to God; he reveals and conceals to whom and when he\nwill. And which [3142]one said of history and records of former times, \"God\nin his providence, to check our presumptuous inquisition, wraps up all\nthings in uncertainty, bars us from long antiquity, and bounds our search\nwithin the compass of some few ages:\" many good things are lost, which our\npredecessors made use of, as Pancirola will better inform you; many new\nthings are daily invented, to the public good; so kingdoms, men, and\nknowledge ebb and flow, are hid and revealed, and when you have all done,\nas the Preacher concluded, _Nihil est sub sole novum_ (nothing new under\nthe sun.) But my melancholy spaniel's quest, my game is sprung, and I must\nsuddenly come down and follow.\n\nJason Pratensis, in his book _de morbis capitis_, and chapter of\nMelancholy, hath these words out of Galen, [3143]\"Let them come to me to\nknow what meat and drink they shall use, and besides that, I will teach\nthem what temper of ambient air they shall make choice of, what wind, what\ncountries they shall choose, and what avoid.\" Out of which lines of his,\nthus much we may gather, that to this cure of melancholy, amongst other\nthings, the rectification of air is necessarily required. This is\nperformed, either in reforming natural or artificial air. Natural is that\nwhich is in our election to choose or avoid: and 'tis either general, to\ncountries, provinces; particular, to cities, towns, villages, or private\nhouses. What harm those extremities of heat or cold do in this malady, I\nhave formerly shown: the medium must needs be good, where the air is\ntemperate, serene, quiet, free from bogs, fens, mists, all manner of\nputrefaction, contagious and filthy noisome smells. The [3144]Egyptians by\nall geographers are commended to be _hilares_, a conceited and merry\nnation: which I can ascribe to no other cause than the serenity of their\nair. They that live in the Orcades are registered by [3145]Hector Boethius\nand [3146]Cardan, to be of fair complexion, long-lived, most healthful,\nfree from all manner of infirmities of body and mind, by reason of a sharp\npurifying air, which comes from the sea. The Boeotians in Greece were dull\nand heavy, _crassi Boeoti_, by reason of a foggy air in which they lived,\n[3147]_Boeotum in crasso jurares aere natum_, Attica most acute, pleasant,\nand refined. The clime changes not so much customs, manners, wits (as\nAristotle _Polit. lib. 6. cap. 4._ Vegetius, Plato, Bodine, _method. hist.\ncap. 5._ hath proved at large) as constitutions of their bodies, and\ntemperature itself. In all particular provinces we see it confirmed by\nexperience, as the air is, so are the inhabitants, dull, heavy, witty,\nsubtle, neat, cleanly, clownish, sick, and sound. In [3148]Perigord in\nFrance the air is subtle, healthful, seldom any plague or contagious\ndisease, but hilly and barren: the men sound, nimble, and lusty; but in\nsome parts of Guienne, full of moors and marshes, the people dull, heavy,\nand subject to many infirmities. Who sees not a great difference between\nSurrey, Sussex, and Romney Marsh, the wolds in Lincolnshire and the fens.\nHe therefore that loves his health, if his ability will give him leave,\nmust often shift places, and make choice of such as are wholesome,\npleasant, and convenient: there is nothing better than change of air in\nthis malady, and generally for health to wander up and down, as those\n[3149]_Tartari Zamolhenses_, that live in hordes, and take opportunity of\ntimes, places, seasons. The kings of Persia had their summer and winter\nhouses; in winter at Sardis, in summer at Susa; now at Persepolis, then at\nPasargada. Cyrus lived seven cold months at Babylon, three at Susa, two at\nEcbatana, saith [3150]Xenophon, and had by that means a perpetual spring.\nThe great Turk sojourns sometimes at Constantinople, sometimes at\nAdrianople, &c. The kings of Spain have their Escurial in heat of summer,\n[3151]Madrid for a wholesome seat, Valladolid a pleasant site, &c., variety\nof _secessus_ as all princes and great men have, and their several\nprogresses to this purpose. Lucullus the Roman had his house at Rome, at\nBaiae, &c. [3152]When Cn. Pompeius, Marcus Cicero (saith Plutarch) and many\nnoble men in the summer came to see him, at supper Pompeius jested with\nhim, that it was an elegant and pleasant village, full of windows,\ngalleries, and all offices fit for a summer house; but in his judgment very\nunfit for winter: Lucullus made answer that the lord of the house had wit\nlike a crane, that changeth her country with the season; he had other\nhouses furnished, and built for that purpose, all out as commodious as\nthis. So Tully had his Tusculan, Plinius his Lauretan village, and every\ngentleman of any fashion in our times hath the like. The [3153]bishop of\nExeter had fourteen several houses all furnished, in times past. In Italy,\nthough they bide in cities in winter, which is more gentlemanlike, all the\nsummer they come abroad to their country-houses, to recreate themselves.\nOur gentry in England live most part in the country (except it be some few\ncastles) building still in bottoms (saith [3154]Jovius) or near woods,\n_corona arborum virentium_; you shall know a village by a tuft of trees at\nor about it, to avoid those strong winds wherewith the island is infested,\nand cold winter blasts. Some discommend moated houses, as unwholesome; so\nCamden saith of [3155]Ew-elme, that it was therefore unfrequented, _ob\nstagni vicini halitus_, and all such places as be near lakes or rivers. But\nI am of opinion that these inconveniences will be mitigated, or easily\ncorrected by good fires, as [3156]one reports of Venice, that\n_graveolentia_ and fog of the moors is sufficiently qualified by those\ninnumerable smokes. Nay more, [3157]Thomas Philol. Ravennas, a great\nphysician, contends that the Venetians are generally longer-lived than any\ncity in Europe, and live many of them 120 years. But it is not water simply\nthat so much offends, as the slime and noisome smells that accompany such\noverflowed places, which is but at some few seasons after a flood, and is\nsufficiently recompensed with sweet smells and aspects in summer, _Ver\npinget vario gemmantia prata colore_, and many other commodities of\npleasure and profit; or else may be corrected by the site, if it be\nsomewhat remote from the water, as Lindley, [3158]_Orton super montem_,\n[3159]Drayton, or a little more elevated, though nearer, as [3160]Caucut,\n[3161]Amington, [3162]Polesworth, [3163]Weddington (to insist in such\nplaces best to me known, upon the river of Anker, in Warwickshire, [3164]\nSwarston, and [3165]Drakesly upon Trent). Or howsoever they be unseasonable\nin winter, or at some times, they have their good use in summer. If so be\nthat their means be so slender as they may not admit of any such variety,\nbut must determine once for all, and make one house serve each season, I\nknow no men that have given better rules in this behalf than our husbandry\nwriters. [3166]Cato and Columella prescribe a good house to stand by a\nnavigable river, good highways, near some city, and in a good soil, but\nthat is more for commodity than health.\n\nThe best soil commonly yields the worst air, a dry sandy plat is fittest to\nbuild upon, and such as is rather hilly than plain, full of downs, a\nCotswold country, as being most commodious for hawking, hunting, wood,\nwaters, and all manner of pleasures. Perigord in France is barren, yet by\nreason of the excellency of the air, and such pleasures that it affords,\nmuch inhabited by the nobility; as Nuremberg in Germany, Toledo in Spain.\nOur countryman Tusser will tell us so much, that the fieldone is for\nprofit, the woodland for pleasure and health; the one commonly a deep clay,\ntherefore noisome in winter, and subject to bad highways: the other a dry\nsand. Provision may be had elsewhere, and our towns are generally bigger in\nthe woodland than the fieldone, more frequent and populous, and gentlemen\nmore delight to dwell in such places. Sutton Coldfield in Warwickshire\n(where I was once a grammar scholar), may be a sufficient witness, which\nstands, as Camden notes, _loco ingrato et sterili_, but in an excellent\nair, and full of all manner of pleasures. [3167]Wadley in Berkshire is\nsituate in a vale, though not so fertile a soil as some vales afford, yet a\nmost commodious site, wholesome, in a delicious air, a rich and pleasant\nseat. So Segrave in Leicestershire (which town [3168]I am now bound to\nremember) is situated in a champaign, at the edge of the wolds, and more\nbarren than the villages about it, yet no place likely yields a better air.\nAnd he that built that fair house, [3169]Wollerton in Nottinghamshire, is\nmuch to be commended (though the tract be sandy and barren about it) for\nmaking choice of such a place. Constantine, _lib. 2. cap. de Agricult._\npraiseth mountains, hilly, steep places, above the rest by the seaside, and\nsuch as look toward the [3170]north upon some great river, as [3171]\nFarmack in Derbyshire, on the Trent, environed with hills, open only to the\nnorth, like Mount Edgecombe in Cornwall, which Mr. [3172]Carew so much\nadmires for an excellent seat: such is the general site of Bohemia:\n_serenat Boreas_, the north wind clarifies, [3173]\"but near lakes or\nmarshes, in holes, obscure places, or to the south and west, he utterly\ndisproves,\" those winds are unwholesome, putrefying, and make men subject\nto diseases. The best building for health, according to him, is in [3174]\n\"high places, and in an excellent prospect,\" like that of Cuddeston in\nOxfordshire (which place I must _honoris ergo_ mention) is lately and\nfairly [3175]built in a good air, good prospect, good soil, both for profit\nand pleasure, not so easily to be matched. P. Crescentius, in his _lib. 1.\nde Agric. cap. 5._ is very copious in this subject, how a house should be\nwholesomely sited, in a good coast, good air, wind, &c., Varro _de re rust.\nlib. 1. cap. 12._ [3176]forbids lakes and rivers, marshy and manured\ngrounds, they cause a bad air, gross diseases, hard to be cured: [3177]\"if\nit be so that he cannot help it, better (as he adviseth) sell thy house and\nland than lose thine health.\" He that respects not this in choosing of his\nseat, or building his house, is _mente captus_, mad, [3178]Cato saith, \"and\nhis dwelling next to hell itself,\" according to Columella: he commends, in\nconclusion, the middle of a hill, upon a descent. Baptista, _Porta Villae,\nlib. 1. cap. 22._ censures Varro, Cato, Columella, and those ancient\nrustics, approving many things, disallowing some, and will by all means\nhave the front of a house stand to the south, which how it may be good in\nItaly and hotter climes, I know not, in our northern countries I am sure it\nis best: Stephanus, a Frenchman, _praedio rustic. lib. 1. cap. 4._\nsubscribes to this, approving especially the descent of a hill south or\nsouth-east, with trees to the north, so that it be well watered; a\ncondition in all sites which must not be omitted, as Herbastein inculcates,\n_lib. 1._ Julius Caesar Claudinus, a physician, _consult. 24_, for a\nnobleman in Poland, melancholy given, adviseth him to dwell in a house\ninclining to the [3179]east, and [3180]by all means to provide the air be\nclear and sweet; which Montanus, _consil. 229_, counselleth the earl of\nMonfort, his patient, to inhabit a pleasant house, and in a good air. If it\nbe so the natural site may not be altered of our city, town, village, yet\nby artificial means it may be helped. In hot countries, therefore, they\nmake the streets of their cities very narrow, all over Spain, Africa,\nItaly, Greece, and many cities of France, in Languedoc especially, and\nProvence, those southern parts: Montpelier, the habitation and university\nof physicians, is so built, with high houses, narrow streets, to divert the\nsun's scalding rays, which Tacitus commends, _lib. 15. Annat._, as most\nagreeing to their health, [3181]\"because the height of buildings, and\nnarrowness of streets, keep away the sunbeams.\" Some cities use galleries,\nor arched cloisters towards the street, as Damascus, Bologna, Padua, Berne\nin Switzerland, Westchester with us, as well to avoid tempests, as the\nsun's scorching heat. They build on high hills, in hot countries, for more\nair; or to the seaside, as Baiae, Naples, &c. In our northern countries we\nare opposite, we commend straight, broad, open, fair streets, as most\nbefitting and agreeing to our clime. We build in bottoms for warmth: and\nthat site of Mitylene in the island of Lesbos, in the Aegean sea, which\nVitruvius so much discommends, magnificently built with fair houses, _sed\nimprudenter positam_ unadvisedly sited, because it lay along to the south,\nand when the south wind blew, the people were all sick, would make an\nexcellent site in our northern climes.\n\nOf that artificial site of houses I have sufficiently discoursed: if the\nplan of the dwelling may not be altered, yet there is much in choice of\nsuch a chamber or room, in opportune opening and shutting of windows,\nexcluding foreign air and winds, and walking abroad at convenient times.\n[3182]Crato, a German, commends east and south site (disallowing cold air\nand northern winds in this case, rainy weather and misty days), free from\nputrefaction, fens, bogs, and muck--hills. If the air be such, open no\nwindows, come not abroad. Montanus will have his patient not to [3183]stir\nat all, if the wind be big or tempestuous, as most part in March it is with\nus; or in cloudy, lowering, dark days, as in November, which we commonly\ncall the black month; or stormy, let the wind stand how it will, _consil.\n27. and 30._ he must not [3184]\"open a casement in bad weather,\" or in a\nboisterous season, _consil. 299_, he especially forbids us to open windows\nto a south wind. The best sites for chamber windows, in my judgment, are\nnorth, east, south, and which is the worst, west. Levinus Lemnius, _lib. 3.\ncap. 3. de occult. nat. mir._ attributes so much to air, and rectifying of\nwind and windows, that he holds it alone sufficient to make a man sick or\nwell; to alter body and mind. [3185]\"A clear air cheers up the spirits,\nexhilarates the mind; a thick, black, misty, tempestuous, contracts,\noverthrows.\" Great heed is therefore to be taken at what times we walk, how\nwe place our windows, lights, and houses, how we let in or exclude this\nambient air. The Egyptians, to avoid immoderate heat, make their windows on\nthe top of the house like chimneys, with two tunnels to draw a thorough\nair. In Spain they commonly make great opposite windows without glass,\nstill shutting those which are next to the sun: so likewise in Turkey and\nItaly (Venice excepted, which brags of her stately glazed palaces) they use\npaper windows to like purpose; and lie, _sub dio_, in the top of their\nflat-roofed houses, so sleeping under the canopy of heaven. In some parts\nof [3186]Italy they have windmills, to draw a cooling air out of hollow\ncaves, and disperse the same through all the chambers of their palaces, to\nrefresh them; as at Costoza, the house of Caesareo Trento, a gentleman of\nVicenza, and elsewhere. Many excellent means are invented to correct nature\nby art. If none of these courses help, the best way is to make artificial\nair, which howsoever is profitable and good, still to be made hot and\nmoist, and to be seasoned with sweet perfumes, [3187]pleasant and lightsome\nas it may be; to have roses, violets, and sweet-smelling flowers ever in\ntheir windows, posies in their hand. Laurentius commends water-lilies, a\nvessel of warm water to evaporate in the room, which will make a more\ndelightful perfume, if there be added orange-flowers, pills of citrons,\nrosemary, cloves, bays, rosewater, rose-vinegar, benzoin, laudanum, styrax,\nand such like gums, which make a pleasant and acceptable perfume.\n[3188]Bessardus Bisantinus prefers the smoke of juniper to melancholy\npersons, which is in great request with us at Oxford, to sweeten our\nchambers. [3189]Guianerius prescribes the air to be moistened with water,\nand sweet herbs boiled in it, vine, and sallow leaves, &c., [3190] to\nbesprinkle the ground and posts with rosewater, rose-vinegar, which\nAvicenna much approves. Of colours it is good to behold green, red, yellow,\nand white, and by all means to have light enough, with windows in the day,\nwax candles in the night, neat chambers, good fires in winter, merry\ncompanions; for though melancholy persons love to be dark and alone, yet\ndarkness is a great increaser of the humour.\n\nAlthough our ordinary air be good by nature or art, yet it is not amiss, as\nI have said, still to alter it; no better physic for a melancholy man than\nchange of air, and variety of places, to travel abroad and see fashions.\n[3191]Leo Afer speaks of many of his countrymen so cured, without all other\nphysic: amongst the Negroes, \"there is such an excellent air, that if any\nof them be sick elsewhere, and brought thither, he is instantly recovered,\nof which he was often an eyewitness.\" [3192]Lipsius, Zuinger, and some\nothers, add as much of ordinary travel. No man, saith Lipsius, in an\nepistle to Phil. Lanoius, a noble friend of his, now ready to make a\nvoyage, [3193]\"can be such a stock or stone, whom that pleasant speculation\nof countries, cities, towns, rivers, will not affect.\" [3194] Seneca the\nphilosopher was infinitely taken with the sight of Scipio Africanus' house,\nnear Linternum, to view those old buildings, cisterns, baths, tombs, &c.\nAnd how was [3195]Tully pleased with the sight of Athens, to behold those\nancient and fair buildings, with a remembrance of their worthy inhabitants.\nPaulus Aemilius, that renowned Roman captain, after he had conquered\nPerseus, the last king of Macedonia, and now made an end of his tedious\nwars, though he had been long absent from Rome, and much there desired,\nabout the beginning of autumn (as [3196]Livy describes it) made a pleasant\nperegrination all over Greece, accompanied with his son Scipio, and\nAtheneus the brother of king Eumenes, leaving the charge of his army with\nSulpicius Gallus. By Thessaly he went to Delphos, thence to Megaris, Aulis,\nAthens, Argos, Lacedaemon, Megalopolis, &c. He took great content,\nexceeding delight in that his voyage, as who doth not that shall attempt\nthe like, though his travel be _ad jactationem magis quam ad usum reipub._\n(as [3197]one well observes) to crack, gaze, see fine sights and fashions,\nspend time, rather than for his own or public good? (as it is to many\ngallants that travel out their best days, together with their means,\nmanners, honesty, religion) yet it availeth howsoever. For peregrination\ncharms our senses with such unspeakable and sweet variety, [3198]that some\ncount him unhappy that never travelled, and pity his case, that from his\ncradle to his old age beholds the same still; still, still the same, the\nsame. Insomuch that [3199]Rhasis, _cont. lib. 1. Tract. 2._ doth not only\ncommend, but enjoin travel, and such variety of objects to a melancholy\nman, \"and to lie in diverse inns, to be drawn into several companies:\"\nMontaltus, _cap. 36._ and many neoterics are of the same mind: Celsus\nadviseth him therefore that will continue his health, to have _varium vitae\ngenus_, diversity of callings, occupations, to be busied about, [3200]\n\"sometimes to live in the city, sometimes in the country; now to study or\nwork, to be intent, then again to hawk or hunt, swim, run, ride, or\nexercise himself.\" A good prospect alone will ease melancholy, as Comesius\ncontends, _lib. 2. c. 7. de Sale_. The citizens of [3201]Barcino, saith he,\notherwise penned in, melancholy, and stirring little abroad, are much\ndelighted with that pleasant prospect their city hath into the sea, which\nlike that of old Athens besides Aegina Salamina, and many pleasant islands,\nhad all the variety of delicious objects: so are those Neapolitans and\ninhabitants of Genoa, to see the ships, boats, and passengers go by, out of\ntheir windows, their whole cities being situated on the side of a hill,\nlike Pera by Constantinople, so that each house almost hath a free prospect\nto the sea, as some part of London to the Thames: or to have a free\nprospect all over the city at once, as at Granada in Spain, and Fez in\nAfrica, the river running betwixt two declining hills, the steepness\ncauseth each house almost, as well to oversee, as to be overseen of the\nrest. Every country is full of such [3202]delightsome prospects, as well\nwithin land, as by sea, as Hermon and [3203]Rama in Palestina, Colalto in\nItaly, the top of Magetus, or Acrocorinthus, that old decayed castle in\nCorinth, from which Peloponessus, Greece, the Ionian and Aegean seas were\n_semel et simul_ at one view to be taken. In Egypt the square top of the\ngreat pyramid, three hundred yards in height, and so the Sultan's palace in\nGrand Cairo, the country being plain, hath a marvellous fair prospect as\nwell over Nilus, as that great city, five Italian miles long, and two\nbroad, by the river side: from mount Sion in Jerusalem, the Holy Land is of\nall sides to be seen: such high places are infinite: with us those of the\nbest note are Glastonbury tower, Box Hill in Surrey, Bever castle, Rodway\nGrange, [3204]Walsby in Lincolnshire, where I lately received a real\nkindness, by the munificence of the right honourable my noble lady and\npatroness, the Lady Frances, countess dowager of Exeter: and two amongst\nthe rest, which I may not omit for vicinity's sake, Oldbury in the confines\nof Warwickshire, where I have often looked about me with great delight, at\nthe foot of which hill [3205]I was born: and Hanbury in Staffordshire,\ncontiguous to which is Falde, a pleasant village, and an ancient patrimony\nbelonging to our family, now in the possession of mine elder brother,\nWilliam Burton, Esquire. [3206]Barclay the Scot commends that of Greenwich\ntower for one of the best prospects in Europe, to see London on the one\nside, the Thames, ships, and pleasant meadows on the other. There be those\nthat say as much and more of St. Mark's steeple in Venice. Yet these are at\ntoo great a distance: some are especially affected with such objects as be\nnear, to see passengers go by in some great roadway, or boats in a river,\n_in subjectum forum despicere_, to oversee a fair, a marketplace, or out of\na pleasant window into some thoroughfare street, to behold a continual\nconcourse, a promiscuous rout, coming and going, or a multitude of\nspectators at a theatre, a mask, or some such like show. But I rove: the\nsum is this, that variety of actions, objects, air, places, are excellent\ngood in this infirmity, and all others, good for man, good for beast.\n[3207]Constantine the emperor, _lib. 18. cap. 13. ex Leontio_, \"holds it an\nonly cure for rotten sheep, and any manner of sick cattle.\" Laelius a Fonte\nAegubinus, that great doctor, at the latter end of many of his\nconsultations (as commonly he doth set down what success his physic had,)\nin melancholy most especially approves of this above all other remedies\nwhatsoever, as appears _consult. 69. consult. 229._ &c. [3208]\"Many other\nthings helped, but change of air was that which wrought the cure, and did\nmost good.\"\n\n\nMEMB. IV.\n_Exercise rectified of Body and Mind_.\n\nTo that great inconvenience, which comes on the one side by immoderate and\nunseasonable exercise, too much solitariness and idleness on the other,\nmust be opposed as an antidote, a moderate and seasonable use of it, and\nthat both of body and mind, as a most material circumstance, much conducing\nto this cure, and to the general preservation of our health. The heavens\nthemselves run continually round, the sun riseth and sets, the moon\nincreaseth and decreaseth, stars and planets keep their constant motions,\nthe air is still tossed by the winds, the waters ebb and flow to their\nconservation no doubt, to teach us that we should ever be in action. For\nwhich cause Hieron prescribes Rusticus the monk, that he be always occupied\nabout some business or other, [3209]\"that the devil do not find him idle.\"\n[3210]Seneca would have a man do something, though it be to no purpose.\n[3211]Xenophon wisheth one rather to play at tables, dice, or make a jester\nof himself (though he might be far better employed) than do nothing. The\n[3212]Egyptians of old, and many flourishing commonwealths since, have\nenjoined labour and exercise to all sorts of men, to be of some vocation\nand calling, and give an account of their time, to prevent those grievous\nmischiefs that come by idleness: \"for as fodder, whip, and burthen belong\nto the ass: so meat, correction, and work unto the servant,\" Ecclus.\nxxxiii. 23. The Turks enjoin all men whatsoever, of what degree, to be of\nsome trade or other, the Grand Signior himself is not excused. [3213]\"In\nour memory\" (saith Sabellicus) \"Mahomet the Turk, he that conquered Greece,\nat that very time when he heard ambassadors of other princes, did either\ncarve or cut wooden spoons, or frame something upon a table.\" [3214]This\npresent sultan makes notches for bows. The Jews are most severe in this\nexamination of time. All well-governed places, towns, families, and every\ndiscreet person will be a law unto himself. But amongst us the badge of\ngentry is idleness: to be of no calling, not to labour, for that's\nderogatory to their birth, to be a mere spectator, a drone, _fruges\nconsumere natus_, to have no necessary employment to busy himself about in\nchurch and commonwealth (some few governors exempted), \"but to rise to\neat,\" &c., to spend his days in hawking, hunting, &c., and such like\ndisports and recreations ([3215]which our casuists tax), are the sole\nexercise almost, and ordinary actions of our nobility, and in which they\nare too immoderate. And thence it comes to pass, that in city and country\nso many grievances of body and mind, and this feral disease of melancholy\nso frequently rageth, and now domineers almost all over Europe amongst our\ngreat ones. They know not how to spend their time (disports excepted, which\nare all their business), what to do, or otherwise how to bestow themselves:\nlike our modern Frenchmen, that had rather lose a pound of blood in a\nsingle combat, than a drop of sweat in any honest labour. Every man almost\nhath something or other to employ himself about, some vocation, some trade,\nbut they do all by ministers and servants, _ad otia duntaxat se natos\nexistimant, imo ad sui ipsius plerumque et aliorum perniciem_, [3216]as one\nfreely taxeth such kind of men, they are all for pastimes, 'tis all their\nstudy, all their invention tends to this alone, to drive away time, as if\nthey were born some of them to no other ends. Therefore to correct and\navoid these errors and inconveniences, our divines, physicians, and\npoliticians, so much labour, and so seriously exhort; and for this disease\nin particular, [3217]\"there can be no better cure than continual business,\"\nas Rhasis holds, \"to have some employment or other, which may set their\nmind awork, and distract their cogitations.\" Riches may not easily be had\nwithout labour and industry, nor learning without study, neither can our\nhealth be preserved without bodily exercise. If it be of the body,\nGuianerius allows that exercise which is gentle, [3218]\"and still after\nthose ordinary frications\" which must be used every morning. Montaltus,\n_cap. 26._ and Jason Pratensis use almost the same words, highly commending\nexercise if it be moderate; \"a wonderful help so used,\" Crato calls it,\"\nand a great means to preserve our health, as adding strength to the whole\nbody, increasing natural heat, by means of which the nutriment is well\nconcocted in the stomach, liver, and veins, few or no crudities left, is\nhappily distributed over all the body.\" Besides, it expels excrements by\nsweat and other insensible vapours; insomuch, that [3219]Galen prefers\nexercise before all physic, rectification of diet, or any regimen in what\nkind soever; 'tis nature's physician. [3220]Fulgentius, out of Gordonius\n_de conserv. vit. hom. lib. 1. cap. 7._ terms exercise, \"a spur of a dull,\nsleepy nature, the comforter of the members, cure of infirmity, death of\ndiseases, destruction of all mischiefs and vices.\" The fittest time for\nexercise is a little before dinner, a little before supper, [3221]or at any\ntime when the body is empty. Montanus, _consil. 31._ prescribes it every\nmorning to his patient, and that, as [3222]Calenus adds, \"after he hath\ndone his ordinary needs, rubbed his body, washed his hands and face, combed\nhis head and gargarised.\" What kind of exercise he should use, Galen tells\nus, _lib. 2. et 3. de sanit. tuend._ and in what measure, [3223] \"till the\nbody be ready to sweat,\" and roused up; _ad ruborem_, some say, _non ad\nsudorem_, lest it should dry the body too much; others enjoin those\nwholesome businesses, as to dig so long in his garden, to hold the plough,\nand the like. Some prescribe frequent and violent labour and exercises, as\nsawing every day so long together (_epid. 6._ Hippocrates confounds them),\nbut that is in some cases, to some peculiar men; [3224]the most forbid, and\nby no means will have it go farther than a beginning sweat, as being\n[3225]perilous if it exceed.\n\nOf these labours, exercises, and recreations, which are likewise included,\nsome properly belong to the body, some to the mind, some more easy, some\nhard, some with delight, some without, some within doors, some natural,\nsome are artificial. Amongst bodily exercises, Galen commends _ludum parvae\npilae_, to play at ball, be it with the hand or racket, in tennis-courts or\notherwise, it exerciseth each part of the body, and doth much good, so that\nthey sweat not too much. It was in great request of old amongst the Greeks,\nRomans, Barbarians, mentioned by Homer, Herodotus, and Plinius. Some write,\nthat Aganella, a fair maid of Corcyra, was the inventor of it, for she\npresented the first ball that ever was made to Nausica, the daughter of\nKing Alcinous, and taught her how to use it.\n\nThe ordinary sports which are used abroad are hawking, hunting, _hilares\nvenandi labores_, [3226]one calls them, because they recreate body and\nmind, [3227]another, the [3228]\"best exercise that is, by which alone many\nhave been [3229]freed from all feral diseases.\" Hegesippus, _lib. 1. cap.\n37._ relates of Herod, that he was eased of a grievous melancholy by that\nmeans. Plato, _7. de leg_. highly magnifies it, dividing it into three\nparts, \"by land, water, air.\" Xenophon, in _Cyropaed_. graces it with a\ngreat name, _Deorum munus_, the gift of the gods, a princely sport, which\nthey have ever used, saith Langius, _epist. 59. lib. 2._ as well for health\nas pleasure, and do at this day, it being the sole almost and ordinary\nsport of our noblemen in Europe, and elsewhere all over the world. Bohemus,\n_de mor. gent. lib. 3. cap. 12._ styles it therefore, _studium nobilium,\ncommuniter venantur, quod sibi solis licere contendunt_, 'tis all their\nstudy, their exercise, ordinary business, all their talk: and indeed some\ndote too much after it, they can do nothing else, discourse of naught else.\nPaulus Jovius, _descr. Brit._ doth in some sort tax our [3230] \"English\nnobility for it, for living in the country so much, and too frequent use of\nit, as if they had no other means but hawking and hunting to approve\nthemselves gentlemen with.\"\n\nHawking comes near to hunting, the one in the air, as the other on the\nearth, a sport as much affected as the other, by some preferred. [3231]It\nwas never heard of amongst the Romans, invented some twelve hundred years\nsince, and first mentioned by Firmicus, _lib. 5. cap. 8._ The Greek\nemperors began it, and now nothing so frequent: he is nobody that in the\nseason hath not a hawk on his fist. A great art, and many [3232]books\nwritten of it. It is a wonder to hear [3233]what is related of the Turks'\nofficers in this behalf, how many thousand men are employed about it, how\nmany hawks of all sorts, how much revenues consumed on that only disport,\nhow much time is spent at Adrianople alone every year to that purpose. The\n[3234]Persian kings hawk after butterflies with sparrows made to that use,\nand stares: lesser hawks for lesser games they have, and bigger for the\nrest, that they may produce their sport to all seasons. The Muscovian\nemperors reclaim eagles to fly at hinds, foxes, &c., and such a one was\nsent for a present to [3235]Queen Elizabeth: some reclaim ravens, castrils,\npies, &c., and man them for their pleasures.\n\nFowling is more troublesome, but all out as delightsome to some sorts of\nmen, be it with guns, lime, nets, glades, gins, strings, baits, pitfalls,\npipes, calls, stalking-horses, setting-dogs, decoy-ducks, &c., or\notherwise. Some much delight to take larks with day-nets, small birds with\nchaff-nets, plovers, partridge, herons, snipe, &c. Henry the Third, king of\nCastile (as Mariana the Jesuit reports of him, _lib. 3. cap. 7._) was much\naffected [3236]\"with catching of quails,\" and many gentlemen take a\nsingular pleasure at morning and evening to go abroad with their\nquail-pipes, and will take any pains to satisfy their delight in that kind.\nThe [3237]Italians have gardens fitted to such use, with nets, bushes,\nglades, sparing no cost or industry, and are very much affected with the\nsport. Tycho Brahe, that great astronomer, in the chorography of his Isle\nof Huena, and Castle of Uraniburge, puts down his nets, and manner of\ncatching small birds, as an ornament and a recreation, wherein he himself\nwas sometimes employed.\n\nFishing is a kind of hunting by water, be it with nets, weels, baits,\nangling, or otherwise, and yields all out as much pleasure to some men as\ndogs or hawks; [3238]\"When they draw their fish upon the bank,\" saith Nic.\nHenselius _Silesiographiae, cap. 3._ speaking of that extraordinary delight\nhis countrymen took in fishing, and in making of pools. James Dubravius,\nthat Moravian, in his book _de pisc._ telleth, how travelling by the\nhighway side in Silesia, he found a nobleman, [3239]\"booted up to the\ngroins,\" wading himself, pulling the nets, and labouring as much as any\nfisherman of them all: and when some belike objected to him the baseness of\nhis office, he excused himself, [3240]\"that if other men might hunt hares,\nwhy should not he hunt carps?\" Many gentlemen in like sort with us will\nwade up to the arm-holes upon such occasions, and voluntarily undertake\nthat to satisfy their pleasures, which a poor man for a good stipend would\nscarce be hired to undergo. Plutarch, in his book _de soler. animal._\nspeaks against all fishing, [3241]\"as a filthy, base, illiberal employment,\nhaving neither wit nor perspicacity in it, nor worth the labour.\" But he\nthat shall consider the variety of baits for all seasons, and pretty\ndevices which our anglers have invented, peculiar lines, false flies,\nseveral sleights, &c. will say, that it deserves like commendation,\nrequires as much study and perspicacity as the rest, and is to be preferred\nbefore many of them. Because hawking and hunting are very laborious, much\nriding, and many dangers accompany them; but this is still and quiet: and\nif so be the angler catch no fish, yet he hath a wholesome walk to the\nbrookside, pleasant shade by the sweet silver streams; he hath good air,\nand sweet smells of fine fresh meadow flowers, he hears the melodious\nharmony of birds, he sees the swans, herons, ducks, water-horns, coots,\n&c., and many other fowl, with their brood, which he thinketh better than\nthe noise of hounds, or blast of horns, and all the sport that they can\nmake.\n\nMany other sports and recreations there be, much in use, as ringing,\nbowling, shooting, which Ascam recommends in a just volume, and hath in\nformer times been enjoined by statute, as a defensive exercise, and an\n[3242]honour to our land, as well may witness our victories in France.\nKeelpins, tronks, quoits, pitching bars, hurling, wrestling, leaping,\nrunning, fencing, mustering, swimming, wasters, foils, football, balloon,\nquintain, &c., and many such, which are the common recreations of the\ncountry folks. Riding of great horses, running at rings, tilts and\ntournaments, horse races, wild-goose chases, which are the disports of\ngreater men, and good in themselves, though many gentlemen by that means\ngallop quite out of their fortunes.\n\nBut the most pleasant of all outward pastimes is that of [3243]Areteus,\n_deambulatio per amoena loca_, to make a petty progress, a merry journey\nnow and then with some good companions, to visit friends, see cities,\ncastles, towns,\n\n[3244] \"Visere saepe amnes nitidos, per amaenaque Tempe,\n        Et placidas summis sectari in montibus auras.\"\n\n       \"To see the pleasant fields, the crystal fountains,\n        And take the gentle air amongst the mountains.\"\n\n[3245]To walk amongst orchards, gardens, bowers, mounts, and arbours,\nartificial wildernesses, green thickets, arches, groves, lawns, rivulets,\nfountains, and such like pleasant places, like that Antiochian Daphne,\nbrooks, pools, fishponds, between wood and water, in a fair meadow, by a\nriver side, [3246]_ubi variae, avium cantationes, florum colores, pratorum\nfrutices_, &c. to disport in some pleasant plain, park, run up a steep hill\nsometimes, or sit in a shady seat, must needs be a delectable recreation.\n_Hortus principis et domus ad delectationem facia, cum sylva, monte et\npiscina, vulgo la montagna_: the prince's garden at Ferrara [3247]Schottus\nhighly magnifies, with the groves, mountains, ponds, for a delectable\nprospect, he was much affected with it: a Persian paradise, or pleasant\npark, could not be more delectable in his sight. St. Bernard, in the\ndescription of his monastery, is almost ravished with the pleasures of it.\n\"A sick [3248]man\" (saith he) \"sits upon a green bank, and when the\ndog-star parcheth the plains, and dries up rivers, he lies in a shady\nbower, _Fronde sub arborea ferventia temperat astra_, and feeds his eyes\nwith variety of objects, herbs, trees, to comfort his misery, he receives\nmany delightsome smells, and fills his ears with that sweet and various\nharmony of birds: good God\" (saith he), \"what a company of pleasures hast\nthou made for man!\" He that should be admitted on a sudden to the sight of\nsuch a palace as that of Escurial in Spain, or to that which the Moors\nbuilt at Granada, Fontainebleau in France, the Turk's gardens in his\nseraglio, wherein all manner of birds and beasts are kept for pleasure;\nwolves, bears, lynxes, tigers, lions, elephants, &c., or upon the banks of\nthat Thracian Bosphorus: the pope's Belvedere in Rome, [3249]as pleasing as\nthose _horti pensiles_ in Babylon, or that Indian king's delightsome garden\nin [3250]Aelian; or [3251]those famous gardens of the Lord Cantelow in\nFrance, could, not choose, though he were never so ill paid, but be much\nrecreated for the time; or many of our noblemen's gardens at home. To take\na boat in a pleasant evening, and with music [3252]to row upon the waters,\nwhich Plutarch so much applauds, Elian admires, upon the river Pineus: in\nthose Thessalian fields, beset with green bays, where birds so sweetly sing\nthat passengers, enchanted as it were with their heavenly music, _omnium\nlaborum et curarum obliviscantur_, forget forthwith all labours, care, and\ngrief: or in a gondola through the Grand Canal in Venice, to see those\ngoodly palaces, must needs refresh and give content to a melancholy dull\nspirit. Or to see the inner rooms of a fair-built and sumptuous edifice, as\nthat of the Persian kings, so much renowned by Diodorus and Curtius, in\nwhich all was almost beaten gold, [3253]chairs, stools, thrones,\ntabernacles, and pillars of gold, plane trees, and vines of gold, grapes of\nprecious stones, all the other ornaments of pure gold,\n\n[3254] \"Fulget gemma floris, et jaspide fulva supellex,\n        Strata micant Tyrio\"------\n\nWith sweet odours and perfumes, generous wines, opiparous fare, &c.,\nbesides the gallantest young men, the fairest [3255]virgins, _puellae\nscitulae ministrantes_, the rarest beauties the world could afford, and\nthose set out with costly and curious attires, _ad stuporem usque\nspectantium_, with exquisite music, as in [3256]Trimaltion's house, in\nevery chamber sweet voices ever sounding day and night, _incomparabilis\nluxus_, all delights and pleasures in each kind which to please the senses\ncould possibly be devised or had, _convives coronati, delitiis ebrii_, &c.\nTelemachus, in Homer, is brought in as one ravished almost at the sight of\nthat magnificent palace, and rich furniture of Menelaus, when he beheld\n\n[3257] \"Aeris fulgorem et resonantia tecta corusco\n        Auro, atque electro nitido, sectoque elephanto,\n        Argentoque simul. Talis Jovis ardua sedes,\n        Aulaque coelicolum stellans splendescit Olympo.\"\n\n       \"Such glittering of gold and brightest brass to shine,\n        Clear amber, silver pure, and ivory so fine:\n        Jupiter's lofty palace, where the gods do dwell,\n        Was even such a one, and did it not excel.\"\n\nIt will _laxare animos_, refresh the soul of man to see fair-built cities,\nstreets, theatres, temples, obelisks, &c. The temple of Jerusalem was so\nfairly built of white marble, with so many pyramids covered with gold;\n_tectumque templi fulvo coruscans auro, nimio suo fulgore obcaecabat oculos\nitinerantium_, was so glorious, and so glistened afar off, that the\nspectators might not well abide the sight of it. But the inner parts were\nall so curiously set out with cedar, gold, jewels, &c., as he said of\nCleopatra's palace in Egypt,--[3258]_Crassumque trabes absconderat aurum_,\nthat the beholders were amazed. What so pleasant as to see some pageant or\nsight go by, as at coronations, weddings, and such like solemnities, to see\nan ambassador or a prince met, received, entertained with masks, shows,\nfireworks, &c. To see two kings fight in single combat, as Porus and\nAlexander; Canute and Edmund Ironside; Scanderbeg and Ferat Bassa the Turk;\nwhen not honour alone but life itself is at stake, as the [3259]poet of\nHector,\n\n        ------\"nec enim pro tergore Tauri,\n        Pro bove nec certamen erat, quae praemia cursus\n        Esse solent, sed pro magni viraque animaque--Hectoris.\"\n\nTo behold a battle fought, like that of Crecy, or Agincourt, or Poitiers,\n_qua nescio_ (saith Froissart) _an vetustas ullam proferre possit\nclariorem_. To see one of Caesar's triumphs in old Rome revived, or the\nlike. To be present at an interview, [3260]as that famous of Henry the\nEighth and Francis the First, so much renowned all over Europe; _ubi tanto\napparatu_ (saith Hubertus Veillius) _tamque triumphali pompa ambo reges com\neorum conjugibus coiere, ut nulla unquam aetas tam celebria festa viderit\naut audieriti_, no age ever saw the like. So infinitely pleasant are such\nshows, to the sight of which oftentimes they will come hundreds of miles,\ngive any money for a place, and remember many years after with singular\ndelight. Bodine, when he was ambassador in England, said he saw the\nnoblemen go in their robes to the parliament house, _summa cum jucunditate\nvidimus_, he was much affected with the sight of it. Pomponius Columna,\nsaith Jovius in his life, saw thirteen Frenchmen, and so many Italians,\nonce fight for a whole army: _Quod jucundissimum spectaculum in vita dicit\nsua_, the pleasantest sight that ever he saw in his life. Who would not\nhave been affected with such a spectacle? Or that single combat of [3261]\nBreaute the Frenchman, and Anthony Schets a Dutchman, before the walls of\nSylvaducis in Brabant, anno 1600. They were twenty-two horse on the one\nside, as many on the other, which like Livy's Horatii, Torquati and Corvini\nfought for their own glory and country's honour, in the sight and view of\ntheir whole city and army. [3262]When Julius Caesar warred about the banks\nof Rhone, there came a barbarian prince to see him and the Roman army, and\nwhen he had beheld Caesar a good while, [3263]\"I see the gods now\" (saith\nhe) \"which before I heard of,\" _nec feliciorem ullam vitae meae aut optavi,\naut sensi diem_: it was the happiest day that ever he had in his life. Such\na sight alone were able of itself to drive away melancholy; if not for\never, yet it must needs expel it for a time. Radzivilus was much taken with\nthe pasha's palace in Cairo, and amongst many other objects which that\nplace afforded, with that solemnity of cutting the banks of the Nile by\nImbram Pasha, when it overflowed, besides two or three hundred gilded\ngalleys on the water, he saw two millions of men gathered together on the\nland, with turbans as white as snow; and 'twas a goodly sight. The very\nreading of feasts, triumphs, interviews, nuptials, tilts, tournaments,\ncombats, and monomachies, is most acceptable and pleasant. [3264]\nFranciscus Modius hath made a large collection of such solemnities in two\ngreat tomes, which whoso will may peruse. The inspection alone of those\ncurious iconographies of temples and palaces, as that of the Lateran church\nin Albertus Durer, that of the temple of Jerusalem in [3265]Josephus,\nAdricomius, and Villalpandus: that of the Escurial in Guadas, of Diana at\nEphesus in Pliny, Nero's golden palace in Rome, [3266]Justinian's in\nConstantinople, that Peruvian Jugo's in [3267]Cusco, _ut non ab hominibus,\nsed a daemoniis constructum videatur_; St. Mark's in Venice, by Ignatius,\nwith many such; _priscorum artificum opera_ (saith that [3268]interpreter\nof Pausanias), the rare workmanship of those ancient Greeks, in theatres,\nobelisks, temples, statues, gold, silver, ivory, marble images, _non minore\nferme quum leguntur, quam quum cernuntur, animum delectatione complent_,\naffect one as much by reading almost as by sight.\n\nThe country hath his recreations, the city his several gymnics and\nexercises, May games, feasts, wakes, and merry meetings, to solace\nthemselves; the very being in the country; that life itself is a sufficient\nrecreation to some men, to enjoy such pleasures, as those old patriarchs\ndid. Diocletian, the emperor, was so much affected with it, that he gave\nover his sceptre, and turned gardener. Constantine wrote twenty books of\nhusbandry. Lysander, when ambassadors came to see him, bragged of nothing\nmore than of his orchard, _hi sunt ordines mei_. What shall I say of\nCincinnatus, Cato, Tully, and many such? how they have been pleased with\nit, to prune, plant, inoculate and graft, to show so many several kinds of\npears, apples, plums, peaches, &c.\n\n[3269] \"Nunc captare feras laqueo, nunc fallere visco,\n        Atque etiam magnos canibus circundare saltus\n        Insidias avibus moliri, incendere vepres.\"\n\n       \"Sometimes with traps deceive, with line and string\n        To catch wild birds and beasts, encompassing\n        The grove with dogs, and out of bushes firing.\"\n\n        ------\"et nidos aviumscrutari,\" &c.\n\nJucundus, in his preface to Cato, Varro, Columella, &c., put out by him,\nconfesseth of himself, that he was mightily delighted with these husbandry\nstudies, and took extraordinary pleasure in them: if the theory or\nspeculation can so much affect, what shall the place and exercise itself,\nthe practical part do? The same confession I find in Herbastein, Porta,\nCamerarius, and many others, which have written of that subject. If my\ntestimony were aught worth, I could say as much of myself; I am _vere\nSaturnus_; no man ever took more delight in springs, woods, groves,\ngardens, walks, fishponds, rivers, &c. But\n\n[3270] \"Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat\n        Flumina;\"\n\nAnd so do I; _Velle licet, potiri non licet_.[3271]\n\nEvery palace, every city almost hath its peculiar walks, cloisters,\nterraces, groves, theatres, pageants, games, and several recreations; every\ncountry, some professed gymnics to exhilarate their minds, and exercise\ntheir bodies. The [3272]Greeks had their Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian,\nNemean games, in honour of Neptune, Jupiter, Apollo; Athens hers: some for\nhonour, garlands, crowns; for [3273]beauty, dancing, running, leaping, like\nour silver games. The [3274]Romans had their feasts, as the Athenians, and\nLacedaemonians held their public banquets, in Pritanaeo, Panathenaeis,\nThesperiis, Phiditiis, plays, naumachies, places for sea-fights,\n[3275]theatres, amphitheatres able to contain 70,000 men, wherein they had\nseveral delightsome shows to exhilarate the people; [3276] gladiators,\ncombats of men with themselves, with wild beasts, and wild beasts one with\nanother, like our bull-baitings, or bear-baitings (in which many countrymen\nand citizens amongst us so much delight and so frequently use), dancers on\nropes. Jugglers, wrestlers, comedies, tragedies, publicly exhibited at the\nemperor's and city's charge, and that with incredible cost and\nmagnificence. In the Low-Countries (as [3277]Meteran relates) before these\nwars, they had many solemn feasts, plays, challenges, artillery gardens,\ncolleges of rhymers, rhetoricians, poets: and to this day, such places are\ncuriously maintained in Amsterdam, as appears by that description of\nIsaacus Pontanus, _rerum Amstelrod. lib. 2. cap. 25._ So likewise not long\nsince at Friburg in Germany, as is evident by that relation of\n[3278]Neander, they had _Ludos septennales_, solemn plays every seven\nyears, which Bocerus, one of their own poets, hath elegantly described:\n\n[3279] \"At nunc magnifico spectacula structa paratu\n        Quid memorem, veteri non concessura Quirino,\n        Ludorum pompa,\" &c.\n\nIn Italy they have solemn declamations of certain select young gentlemen in\nFlorence (like those reciters in old Rome), and public theatres in most of\ntheir cities, for stage-players and others, to exercise and recreate\nthemselves. All seasons almost, all places, have their several pastimes;\nsome in summer, some in winter; some abroad, some within: some of the body,\nsome of the mind: and diverse men have diverse recreations and exercises.\nDomitian, the emperor, was much delighted with catching flies; Augustus to\nplay with nuts amongst children; [3280]Alexander Severus was often pleased\nto play with whelps and young pigs. [3281]Adrian was so wholly enamoured\nwith dogs and horses, that he bestowed monuments and tombs of them, and\nburied them in graves. In foul weather, or when they can use no other\nconvenient sports, by reason of the time, as we do cock-fighting, to avoid\nidleness, I think, (though some be more seriously taken with it, spend much\ntime, cost and charges, and are too solicitous about it) [3282]Severus used\npartridges and quails, as many Frenchmen do still, and to keep birds in\ncages, with which he was much pleased, when at any time he had leisure from\npublic cares and businesses. He had (saith Lampridius) tame pheasants,\nducks, partridges, peacocks, and some 20,000 ring-doves and pigeons.\nBusbequius, the emperor's orator, when he lay in Constantinople, and could\nnot stir much abroad, kept for his recreation, busying himself to see them\nfed, almost all manner of strange birds and beasts; this was something,\nthough not to exercise his body, yet to refresh his mind. Conradus Gesner,\nat Zurich in Switzerland, kept so likewise for his pleasure, a great\ncompany of wild beasts; and (as he saith) took great delight to see them\neat their meat. Turkey gentlewomen, that are perpetual prisoners, still\nmewed up according to the custom of the place, have little else beside\ntheir household business, or to play with their children to drive away\ntime, but to dally with their cats, which they have _in delitiis_, as many\nof our ladies and gentlewomen use monkeys and little dogs. The ordinary\nrecreations which we have in winter, and in most solitary times busy our\nminds with, are cards, tables and dice, shovelboard, chess-play, the\nphilosopher's game, small trunks, shuttlecock, billiards, music, masks,\nsinging, dancing, Yule-games, frolics, jests, riddles, catches, purposes,\nquestions and commands, [3283]merry tales of errant knights, queens,\nlovers, lords, ladies, giants, dwarfs, thieves, cheaters, witches, fairies,\ngoblins, friars, &c., such as the old woman told Psyche in [3284]Apuleius,\nBoccace novels, and the rest, _quarum auditione pueri delectantur, senes\nnarratione_, which some delight to hear, some to tell; all are well pleased\nwith. Amaranthus, the philosopher, met Hermocles, Diophantus and Philolaus,\nhis companions, one day busily discoursing about Epicurus and Democritus'\ntenets, very solicitous which was most probable and came nearest to truth:\nto put them out of that surly controversy, and to refresh their spirits, he\ntold them a pleasant tale of Stratocles the physician's wedding, and of all\nthe particulars, the company, the cheer, the music, &c., for he was new\ncome from it; with which relation they were so much delighted, that\nPhilolaus wished a blessing to his heart, and many a good wedding,[3285]\nmany such merry meetings might he be at, \"to please himself with the sight,\nand others with the narration of it.\" News are generally welcome to all our\nears, _avide audimus, aures enim hominum novitate laetantur_ ([3286]as\nPliny observes), we long after rumour to hear and listen to it,\n[3287]_densum humeris bibit aure vulgus_. We are most part too inquisitive\nand apt to hearken after news, which Caesar, in his [3288]Commentaries,\nobserves of the old Gauls, they would be inquiring of every carrier and\npassenger what they had heard or seen, what news abroad?\n\n        ------\"quid toto fiat in orbe,\n        Quid Seres, quid Thraces agant, secreta novercae,\n        Et pueri, quis amet,\" &c.\n\nas at an ordinary with us, bakehouse or barber's shop. When that great\nGonsalva was upon some displeasure confined by King Ferdinand to the city\nof Loxa in Andalusia, the only, comfort (saith [3289]Jovius) he had to\nease his melancholy thoughts, was to hear news, and to listen after those\nordinary occurrences which were brought him _cum primis_, by letters or\notherwise out of the remotest parts of Europe. Some men's whole delight is,\nto take tobacco, and drink all day long in a tavern or alehouse, to\ndiscourse, sing, jest, roar, talk of a cock and bull over a pot, &c. Or\nwhen three or four good companions meet, tell old stories by the fireside,\nor in the sun, as old folks usually do, _quae aprici meminere senes_,\nremembering afresh and with pleasure ancient matters, and such like\naccidents, which happened in their younger years: others' best pastime is\nto game, nothing to them so pleasant. [3290]_Hic Veneri indulget, hunc\ndecoquit alea_--many too nicely take exceptions at cards, [3291]tables,\nand dice, and such mixed lusorious lots, whom Gataker well confutes. Which\nthough they be honest recreations in themselves, yet may justly be\notherwise excepted at, as they are often abused, and forbidden as things\nmost pernicious; _insanam rem et damnosam_, [3292]Lemnius calls it. \"For\nmost part in these kind of disports 'tis not art or skill, but subtlety,\ncony-catching, knavery, chance and fortune carries all away:\" 'tis\n_ambulatoria pecunia_,\n\n[3293]  ------\"puncto mobilis horae\n        Permutat dominos, et cedit in altera jura.\"\n\nThey labour most part not to pass their time in honest disport, but for\nfilthy lucre, and covetousness of money. _In foedissimum lucrum et\navaritiam hominum convertitur_, as Daneus observes. _Fons fraudum et\nmaleficiorum_, 'tis the fountain of cozenage and villainy. [3294]\"A thing\nso common all over Europe at this day, and so generally abused, that many\nmen are utterly undone by it,\" their means spent, patrimonies consumed,\nthey and their posterity beggared; besides swearing, wrangling, drinking,\nloss of time, and such inconveniences, which are ordinary concomitants:\n[3295]\"for when once they have got a haunt of such companies, and habit of\ngaming, they can hardly be drawn from it, but as an itch it will tickle\nthem, and as it is with whoremasters, once entered, they cannot easily\nleave it off:\" _Vexat mentes insania cupido_, they are mad upon their\nsport. And in conclusion (which Charles the Seventh, that good French king,\npublished in an edict against gamesters) _unde piae et hilaris vitae,\nsuffugium sibi suisque liberis, totique familiae_, &c. \"That which was once\ntheir livelihood, should have maintained wife, children, family, is now\nspent and gone;\" _maeror et egestas_, &c., sorrow and beggary succeeds. So\ngood things may be abused, and that which was first invented to [3296]\nrefresh men's weary spirits, when they come from other labours and studies\nto exhilarate the mind, to entertain time and company, tedious otherwise in\nthose long solitary winter nights, and keep them from worse matters, an\nhonest exercise is contrarily perverted.\n\nChess-play is a good and witty exercise of the mind for some kind of men,\nand fit for such melancholy, Rhasis holds, as are idle, and have\nextravagant impertinent thoughts, or troubled with cares, nothing better to\ndistract their mind, and alter their meditations: invented (some say) by\nthe [3297]general of an army in a famine, to keep soldiers from mutiny: but\nif it proceed from overmuch study, in such a case it may do more harm than\ngood; it is a game too troublesome for some men's brains, too full of\nanxiety, all out as bad as study; besides it is a testy choleric game, and\nvery offensive to him that loseth the mate. [3298]William the Conqueror, in\nhis younger years, playing at chess with the Prince of France (Dauphine was\nnot annexed to that crown in those days) losing a mate, knocked the\nchess-board about his pate, which was a cause afterward of much enmity\nbetween them. For some such reason it is belike, that Patritius, in his _3.\nbook, tit. 12. de reg. instit_. forbids his prince to play at chess;\nhawking and hunting, riding, &c. he will allow; and this to other men, but\nby no means to him. In Muscovy, where they live in stoves and hot houses\nall winter long, come seldom or little abroad, it is again very necessary,\nand therefore in those parts, (saith [3299]Herbastein) much used. At Fez in\nAfrica, where the like inconvenience of keeping within doors is through\nheat, it is very laudable; and (as [3300]Leo Afer relates) as much\nfrequented. A sport fit for idle gentlewomen, soldiers in garrison, and\ncourtiers that have nought but love matters to busy themselves about, but\nnot altogether so convenient for such as are students. The like I may say\nof Col. Bruxer's philosophy game, D. Fulke's _Metromachia_ and his\n_Ouronomachia_, with the rest of those intricate astrological and\ngeometrical fictions, for such especially as are mathematically given; and\nthe rest of those curious games.\n\nDancing, singing, masking, mumming, stage plays, howsoever they be heavily\ncensured by some severe Catos, yet if opportunely and soberly used, may\njustly be approved. _Melius est foedere, quam saltare_, [3301]saith Austin:\nbut what is that if they delight in it? [3302]_Nemo saltat sobrius_. But in\nwhat kind of dance? I know these sports have many oppugners, whole volumes\nwrit against them; when as all they say (if duly considered) is but\n_ignoratio Elenchi_; and some again, because they are now cold and wayward,\npast themselves, cavil at all such youthful sports in others, as he did in\nthe comedy; they think them, _illico nasci senes_, &c. Some out of\npreposterous zeal object many times trivial arguments, and because of some\nabuse, will quite take away the good use, as if they should forbid wine\nbecause it makes men drunk; but in my judgment they are too stern: there\n\"is a time for all things, a time to mourn, a time to dance,\" Eccles. iii.\n4. \"a time to embrace, a time not to embrace,\" (verse 5.) \"and nothing\nbetter than that a man should rejoice in his own works,\" verse 22; for my\npart, I will subscribe to the king's declaration, and was ever of that\nmind, those May games, wakes, and Whitsun ales, &c., if they be not at\nunseasonable hours, may justly be permitted. Let them freely feast, sing\nand dance, have their puppet-plays, hobby-horses, tabors, crowds, bagpipes,\n&c., play at ball, and barley-breaks, and what sports and recreations they\nlike best. In Franconia, a province of Germany, (saith [3303]Aubanus\nBohemus) the old folks, after evening prayer, went to the alehouse, the\nyounger sort to dance: and to say truth with [3304]Salisburiensis, _satius\nfuerat sic otiari, quam turpius occupari_, better to do so than worse, as\nwithout question otherwise (such is the corruption of man's nature) many of\nthem will do. For that cause, plays, masks, jesters, gladiators, tumblers,\njugglers, &c., and all that crew is admitted and winked at: [3305]_Tota\njocularium scena procedit, et ideo spectacula admissa sunt, et infinita\ntyrocinia vanitatum, ut his occupentur, qui perniciosius otiari solent_:\nthat they might be busied about such toys, that would otherwise more\nperniciously be idle. So that as [3306]Tacitus said of the astrologers in\nRome, we may say of them, _genus hominum est quod in civitate nostra et\nvitabitur semper et retinebitur_, they are a debauched company most part,\nstill spoken against, as well they deserve some of them (for I so relish\nand distinguish them as fiddlers, and musicians), and yet ever retained.\n\"Evil is not to be done (I confess) that good may come of it:\" but this is\nevil _per accidens_, and in a qualified sense, to avoid a greater\ninconvenience, may justly be tolerated. Sir Thomas More, in his Utopian\nCommonwealth, [3307]\"as he will have none idle, so will he have no man\nlabour over hard, to be toiled out like a horse, 'tis more than slavish\ninfelicity, the life of most of our hired servants and tradesmen elsewhere\"\n(excepting his Utopians) \"but half the day allotted for work, and half for\nhonest recreation, or whatsoever employment they shall think fit for\nthemselves.\" If one half day in a week were allowed to our household\nservants for their merry meetings, by their hard masters, or in a year some\nfeasts, like those Roman Saturnals, I think they would labour harder all\nthe rest of their time, and both parties be better pleased: but this needs\nnot (you will say), for some of them do nought but loiter all the week\nlong.\n\nThis which I aim at, is for such as are _fracti animis_, troubled in mind,\nto ease them, over-toiled on the one part, to refresh: over idle on the\nother, to keep themselves busied. And to this purpose, as any labour or\nemployment will serve to the one, any honest recreation will conduce to the\nother, so that it be moderate and sparing, as the use of meat and drink;\nnot to spend all their life in gaming, playing, and pastimes, as too many\ngentlemen do; but to revive our bodies and recreate our souls with honest\nsports: of which as there be diverse sorts, and peculiar to several\ncallings, ages, sexes, conditions, so there be proper for several seasons,\nand those of distinct natures, to fit that variety of humours which is\namongst them, that if one will not, another may: some in summer, some in\nwinter, some gentle, some more violent, some for the mind alone, some for\nthe body and mind: (as to some it is both business and a pleasant\nrecreation to oversee workmen of all sorts, husbandry, cattle, horses, &c.\nTo build, plot, project, to make models, cast up accounts, &c.) some\nwithout, some within doors; new, old, &c., as the season serveth, and as\nmen are inclined. It is reported of Philippus Bonus, that good duke of\nBurgundy (by Lodovicus Vives, in Epist. and Pont. [3308]Heuter in his\nhistory) that the said duke, at the marriage of Eleonora, sister to the\nking of Portugal, at Bruges in Flanders, which was solemnised in the deep\nof winter, when, as by reason of unseasonable weather, he could neither\nhawk nor hunt, and was now tired with cards, dice, &c., and such other\ndomestic sports, or to see ladies dance, with some of his courtiers, he\nwould in the evening walk disguised all about the town. It so fortuned, as\nhe was walking late one night, he found a country fellow dead drunk,\nsnorting on a bulk; [3309]he caused his followers to bring him to his\npalace, and there stripping him of his old clothes, and attiring him after\nthe court fashion, when he waked, he and they were all ready to attend upon\nhis excellency, persuading him he was some great duke. The poor fellow\nadmiring how he came there, was served in state all the day long; after\nsupper he saw them dance, heard music, and the rest of those court-like\npleasures: but late at night, when he was well tippled, and again fast\nasleep, they put on his old robes, and so conveyed him to the place where\nthey first found him. Now the fellow had not made them so good sport the\nday before as he did when he returned to himself; all the jest was, to see\nhow he [3310]looked upon it. In conclusion, after some little admiration,\nthe poor man told his friends he had seen a vision, constantly believed it,\nwould not otherwise be persuaded, and so the jest ended. [3311]Antiochus\nEpiphanes would often disguise himself, steal from his court, and go into\nmerchants', goldsmiths', and other tradesmen's shops, sit and talk with\nthem, and sometimes ride or walk alone, and fall aboard with any tinker,\nclown, serving man, carrier, or whomsoever he met first. Sometimes he did\n_ex insperato_ give a poor fellow money, to see how he would look, or on\nset purpose lose his purse as he went, to watch who found it, and withal\nhow he would be affected, and with such objects he was much delighted. Many\nsuch tricks are ordinarily put in practice by great men, to exhilarate\nthemselves and others, all which are harmless jests, and have their good\nuses.\n\nBut amongst those exercises, or recreations of the mind within doors, there\nis none so general, so aptly to be applied to all sorts of men, so fit and\nproper to expel idleness and melancholy, as that of study: _Studia,\nsenectutem oblectant, adolescentiam, alunt, secundas res ornant, adversis\nperfugium et solatium praebent, domi delectant_, &c., find the rest in\nTully _pro Archia Poeta._ [3312]What so full of content, as to read, walk,\nand see maps, pictures, statues, jewels, marbles, which some so much\nmagnify, as those that Phidias made of old so exquisite and pleasing to be\nbeheld, that as [3313]Chrysostom thinketh, \"if any man be sickly, troubled\nin mind, or that cannot sleep for grief, and shall but stand over against\none of Phidias' images, he will forget all care, or whatsoever else may\nmolest him, in an instant?\" There be those as much taken with Michael\nAngelo's, Raphael de Urbino's, Francesco Francia's pieces, and many of\nthose Italian and Dutch painters, which were excellent in their ages; and\nesteem of it as a most pleasing sight, to view those neat architectures,\ndevices, escutcheons, coats of arms, read such books, to peruse old coins\nof several sorts in a fair gallery; artificial works, perspective glasses,\nold relics, Roman antiquities, variety of colours. A good picture is _falsa\nveritas, et muta poesis_: and though (as [3314]Vives saith) _artificialia\ndelectant, sed mox fastidimus_, artificial toys please but for a time; yet\nwho is he that will not be moved with them for the present? When Achilles\nwas tormented and sad for the loss of his dear friend Patroclus, his mother\nThetis brought him a most elaborate and curious buckler made by Vulcan, in\nwhich were engraven sun, moon, stars, planets, sea, land, men fighting,\nrunning, riding, women scolding, hills, dales, towns, castles, brooks,\nrivers, trees, &c., with many pretty landscapes, and perspective pieces:\nwith sight of which he was infinitely delighted, and much eased of his\ngrief.\n\n[3315] \"Continuo eo spectaculo captus delenito maerore\n        Oblectabatur, in manibus tenens dei splendida dona.\"\n\nWho will not be affected so in like case, or see those well-furnished\ncloisters and galleries of the Roman cardinals, so richly stored with all\nmodern pictures, old statues and antiquities? _Cum se--spectando recreet\nsimul et legendo_, to see their pictures alone and read the description, as\n[3316]Boisardus well adds, whom will it not affect? which Bozius,\nPomponius, Laetus, Marlianus, Schottus, Cavelerius, Ligorius, &c., and he\nhimself hath well performed of late. Or in some prince's cabinets, like\nthat of the great dukes in Florence, of Felix Platerus in Basil, or\nnoblemen's houses, to see such variety of attires, faces, so many, so rare,\nand such exquisite pieces, of men, birds, beasts, &c., to see those\nexcellent landscapes, Dutch works, and curious cuts of Sadlier of Prague,\nAlbertus Durer, Goltzius Vrintes, &c., such pleasant pieces of perspective,\nIndian pictures made of feathers, China works, frames, thaumaturgical\nmotions, exotic toys, &c. Who is he that is now wholly overcome with\nidleness, or otherwise involved in a labyrinth of worldly cares, troubles\nand discontents, that will not be much lightened in his mind by reading of\nsome enticing story, true or feigned, whereas in a glass he shall observe\nwhat our forefathers have done, the beginnings, ruins, falls, periods of\ncommonwealths, private men's actions displayed to the life, &c. [3317]\nPlutarch therefore calls them, _secundas mensas et bellaria_, the second\ncourse and junkets, because they were usually read at noblemen's feasts.\nWho is not earnestly affected with a passionate speech, well penned, an\nelegant poem, or some pleasant bewitching discourse, like that of [3318]\nHeliodorus, _ubi oblectatio quaedam placide fuit, cum hilaritate\nconjuncta_? Julian the Apostate was so taken with an oration of Libanius,\nthe sophister, that, as he confesseth, he could not be quiet till he had\nread it all out. _Legi orationem tuam magna ex parte, hesterna die ante\nprandium, pransus vero sine ulla intermissione totam absolvi_. [3319]_O\nargumenta! O compositionem!_ I may say the same of this or that pleasing\ntract, which will draw his attention along with it. To most kind of men it\nis an extraordinary delight to study. For what a world of books offers\nitself, in all subjects, arts, and sciences, to the sweet content and\ncapacity of the reader? In arithmetic, geometry, perspective, optics,\nastronomy, architecture, sculpture, painting, of which so many and such\nelaborate treatises are of late written: in mechanics and their mysteries,\nmilitary matters, navigation, [3320]riding of horses, [3321]fencing,\nswimming, gardening, planting, great tomes of husbandry, cookery, falconry,\nhunting, fishing, fowling, &c., with exquisite pictures of all sports,\ngames, and what not? In music, metaphysics, natural and moral philosophy,\nphilology, in policy, heraldry, genealogy, chronology, &c., they afford\ngreat tomes, or those studies of [3322]antiquity, &c., _et [3323]quid\nsubtilius Arithmeticis inventionibus, quid jucundius Musicis rationibus,\nquid divinius Astronomicis, quid rectius Geometricis demonstrationibus_?\nWhat so sure, what so pleasant? He that shall but see that geometrical\ntower of Garezenda at Bologna in Italy, the steeple and clock at Strasburg,\nwill admire the effects of art, or that engine of Archimedes, to remove the\nearth itself, if he had but a place to fasten his instrument: Archimedes\nCoclea, and rare devices to corrivate waters, musical instruments, and\ntri-syllable echoes again, again, and again repeated, with myriads of such.\nWhat vast tomes are extant in law, physic, and divinity, for profit,\npleasure, practice, speculation, in verse or prose, &c.! their names alone\nare the subject of whole volumes, we have thousands of authors of all\nsorts, many great libraries full well furnished, like so many dishes of\nmeat, served out for several palates; and he is a very block that is\naffected with none of them. Some take an infinite delight to study the very\nlanguages wherein these books are written, Hebrew, Greek, Syriac, Chaldee,\nArabic, &c. Methinks it would please any man to look upon a geographical\nmap, [3324]_sauvi animum delectatione allicere, ob incredibilem rerum\nvarietatem et jucunditatem, et ad pleniorem sui cognitionem excitare_,\nchorographical, topographical delineations, to behold, as it were, all the\nremote provinces, towns, cities of the world, and never to go forth of the\nlimits of his study, to measure by the seale and compass their extent,\ndistance, examine their site. Charles the Great, as Platina writes, had\nthree fair silver tables, in one of which superficies was a large map of\nConstantinople, in the second Rome neatly engraved, in the third an\nexquisite description of the whole world, and much delight he took in them.\nWhat greater pleasure can there now be, than to view those elaborate maps\nof Ortelius, [3325]Mercator, Hondius, &c.? To peruse those books of cities,\nput out by Braunus and Hogenbergius? To read those exquisite descriptions\nof Maginus, Munster, Herrera, Laet, Merula, Boterus, Leander, Albertus,\nCamden, Leo Afer, Adricomius, Nic. Gerbelius, &c.? Those famous expeditions\nof Christoph. Columbus, Americus Vespucius, Marcus Polus the Venetian, Lod.\nVertomannus, Aloysius Cadamustus, &c.? Those accurate diaries of\nPortuguese, Hollanders, of Bartison, Oliver a Nort, &c. Hakluyt's voyages,\nPet. Martyr's Decades, Benzo, Lerius, Linschoten's relations, those\nHodoeporicons of Jod. a Meggen, Brocard the monk, Bredenbachius, Jo.\nDublinius, Sands, &c., to Jerusalem, Egypt, and other remote places of the\nworld? those pleasant itineraries of Paulus Hentzerus, Jodocus Sincerus,\nDux Polonus, &c., to read Bellonius' observations, P. Gillius his surveys;\nthose parts of America, set out, and curiously cut in pictures, by Fratres\na Bry. To see a well-cut herbal, herbs, trees, flowers, plants, all\nvegetables expressed in their proper colours to the life, as that of\nMatthiolus upon Dioscorides, Delacampius, Lobel, Bauhinus, and that last\nvoluminous and mighty herbal of Beslar of Nuremberg, wherein almost every\nplant is to his own bigness. To see birds, beasts, and fishes of the sea,\nspiders, gnats, serpents, flies, &c., all creatures set out by the same\nart, and truly expressed in lively colours, with an exact description of\ntheir natures, virtues, qualities, &c., as hath been accurately performed\nby Aelian, Gesner, Ulysses Aldrovandus, Bellonius, Rondoletius, Hippolitus\nSalvianus, &c. [3326]_Arcana coeli, naturae secreta, ordinem universi scire\nmajoris felicitatis et dulcedinis est, quam cogitatione quis assequi\npossit, aut mortalis sperare_. What more pleasing studies can there be than\nthe mathematics, theoretical or practical parts? as to survey land, make\nmaps, models, dials, &c., with which I was ever much delighted myself.\n_Tails est Mathematum pulchritudo_ (saith [3327] Plutarch) _ut his indignum\nsit divitiarum phaleras istas et bullas, et puellaria spectacula\ncomparari_; such is the excellency of these studies, that all those\nornaments and childish bubbles of wealth, are not worthy to be compared to\nthem: _credi mihi_ ( [3328]saith one) _extingui dulce erit Mathematicarum\nartium studio_, I could even live and die with such meditation, [3329]and\ntake more delight, true content of mind in them, than thou hast in all thy\nwealth and sport, how rich soever thou art. And as [3330]Cardan well\nseconds me, _Honorificum magis est et gloriosum haec intelligere, quam\nprovinciis praeesse, formosum aut ditem juvenem esse_. [3331]The like\npleasure there is in all other studies, to such as are truly addicted to\nthem, [3332]_ea suavitas_ (one holds) _ut cum quis ea degustaverit, quasi\npoculis Circeis captus, non possit unquam ab illis divelli_; the like\nsweetness, which as Circe's cup bewitcheth a student, he cannot leave off,\nas well may witness those many laborious hours, days and nights, spent in\nthe voluminous treatises written by them; the same content. [3333]Julius\nScaliger was so much affected with poetry, that he brake out into a\npathetical protestation, he had rather be the author of twelve verses in\nLucan, or such an ode in [3334]Horace, than emperor of Germany.\n[3335]Nicholas Gerbelius, that good old man, was so much ravished with a\nfew Greek authors restored to light, with hope and desire of enjoying the\nrest, that he exclaims forthwith, _Arabibus atque Indis omnibus erimus\nditiores_, we shall be richer than all the Arabic or Indian princes; of\nsuch [3336]esteem they were with him, incomparable worth and value. Seneca\nprefers Zeno and Chrysippus, two doting stoics (he was so much enamoured of\ntheir works), before any prince or general of an army; and Orontius, the\nmathematician, so far admires Archimedes, that he calls him _Divinum et\nhomine majorem_, a petty god, more than a man; and well he might, for aught\nI see, if you respect fame or worth. Pindarus, of Thebes, is as much\nrenowned for his poems, as Epaminondas, Pelopidas, Hercules or Bacchus, his\nfellow citizens, for their warlike actions; _et si famam respicias, non\npauciores Aristotelis quam Alexandri meminerunt_ (as Cardan notes),\nAristotle is more known than Alexander; for we have a bare relation of\nAlexander's deeds, but Aristotle, _totus vivit in monumentis_, is whole in\nhis works: yet I stand not upon this; the delight is it, which I aim at, so\ngreat pleasure, such sweet content there is in study. [3337]King James,\n1605, when he came to see our University of Oxford, and amongst other\nedifices now went to view that famous library, renewed by Sir Thomas\nBodley, in imitation of Alexander, at his departure brake out into that\nnoble speech, If I were not a king, I would be a university man: [3338]\n\"and if it were so that I must be a prisoner, if I might have my wish, I\nwould desire to have no other prison than that library, and to be chained\ntogether with so many good authors _et mortuis magistris_.\" So sweet is the\ndelight of study, the more learning they have (as he that hath a dropsy,\nthe more he drinks the thirstier he is) the more they covet to learn, and\nthe last day is _prioris discipulus_; harsh at first learning is, _radices\namarcae_, but _fractus dulces_, according to that of Isocrates, pleasant at\nlast; the longer they live, the more they are enamoured with the Muses.\nHeinsius, the keeper of the library at Leyden in Holland, was mewed up in\nit all the year long: and that which to thy thinking should have bred a\nloathing, caused in him a greater liking. [3339]\"I no sooner\" (saith he)\n\"come into the library, but I bolt the door to me, excluding lust,\nambition, avarice, and all such vices, whose nurse is idleness, the mother\nof ignorance, and melancholy herself, and in the very lap of eternity,\namongst so many divine souls, I take my seat, with so lofty a spirit and\nsweet content, that I pity all our great ones, and rich men that know not\nthis happiness.\" I am not ignorant in the meantime (notwithstanding this\nwhich I have said) how barbarously and basely, for the most part, our ruder\ngentry esteem of libraries and books, how they neglect and contemn so great\na treasure, so inestimable a benefit, as Aesop's cock did the jewel he\nfound in the dunghill; and all through error, ignorance, and want of\neducation. And 'tis a wonder, withal, to observe how much they will vainly\ncast away in unnecessary expenses, _quot modis pereant_ (saith\n[3340]Erasmus) _magnatibus pecuniae, quantum absumant alea, scorta,\ncompotationes, profectiones non necessariae, pompae, bella quaesita,\nambitio, colax, morio, ludio_, &c., what in hawks, hounds, lawsuits, vain\nbuilding, gormandising, drinking, sports, plays, pastimes, &c. If a\nwell-minded man to the Muses, would sue to some of them for an exhibition,\nto the farther maintenance or enlargement of such a work, be it college,\nlecture, library, or whatsoever else may tend to the advancement of\nlearning, they are so unwilling, so averse, that they had rather see these\nwhich are already, with such cost and care erected, utterly ruined,\ndemolished or otherwise employed; for they repine many and grudge at such\ngifts and revenues so bestowed: and therefore it were in vain, as Erasmus\nwell notes, _vel ab his, vel a negotiatoribus qui se Mammonae dediderunt,\nimprobum fortasse tale officium exigere_, to solicit or ask anything of\nsuch men that are likely damned to riches; to this purpose. For my part I\npity these men, _stultos jubeo esse libenter_, let them go as they are, in\nthe catalogue of Ignoramus. How much, on the other side, are all we bound\nthat are scholars, to those munificent Ptolemies, bountiful Maecenases,\nheroical patrons, divine spirits,\n\n[3341]  ------\"qui nobis haec otio fecerunt, namque erit ille mihi semper\n        Deus\"------\n\n       \"These blessings, friend, a Deity bestow'd,\n        For never can I deem him less than God.\"\n\nthat have provided for us so many well-furnished libraries, as well in our\npublic academies in most cities, as in our private colleges? How shall I\nremember [3342]Sir Thomas Bodley, amongst the rest, [3343]Otho Nicholson,\nand the Right Reverend John Williams, Lord Bishop of Lincoln (with many\nother pious acts), who besides that at St. John's College in Cambridge,\nthat in Westminster, is now likewise in _Fieri_ with a library at Lincoln\n(a noble precedent for all corporate towns and cities to imitate), _O quam\nte memorem (vir illustrissime) quibus elogiis_? But to my task again.\n\nWhosoever he is therefore that is overrun with solitariness, or carried\naway with pleasing melancholy and vain conceits, and for want of employment\nknows not how to spend his time, or crucified with worldly care, I can\nprescribe him no better remedy than this of study, to compose himself to\nthe learning of some art or science. Provided always that this malady\nproceed not from overmuch study; for in such case he adds fuel to the fire,\nand nothing can be more pernicious: let him take heed he do not overstretch\nhis wits, and make a skeleton of himself; or such inamoratos as read\nnothing but play-books, idle poems, jests, Amadis de Gaul, the Knight of\nthe Sun, the Seven Champions, Palmerin de Oliva, Huon of Bordeaux, &c. Such\nmany times prove in the end as mad as Don Quixote. Study is only prescribed\nto those that are otherwise idle, troubled in mind, or carried headlong\nwith vain thoughts and imaginations, to distract their cogitations\n(although variety of study, or some serious subject, would do the former no\nharm) and divert their continual meditations another way. Nothing in this\ncase better than study; _semper aliquid memoriter ediscant_, saith Piso,\nlet them learn something without book, transcribe, translate, &c. Read the\nScriptures, which Hyperius, _lib. 1. de quotid. script. lec. fol. 77._\nholds available of itself, [3344]\"the mind is erected thereby from all\nworldly cares, and hath much quiet and tranquillity.\" For as [3345]Austin\nwell hath it, 'tis _scientia scientiarum, omni melle dulcior, omni pane\nsuavior, omni vino, hilarior_: 'tis the best nepenthe, surest cordial,\nsweetest alterative, presentest diverter: for neither as [3346]Chrysostom\nwell adds, \"those boughs and leaves of trees which are plashed for cattle\nto stand under, in the heat of the day, in summer, so much refresh them\nwith their acceptable shade, as the reading of the Scripture doth recreate\nand comfort a distressed soul, in sorrow and affliction.\" Paul bids \"pray\ncontinually;\" _quod cibus corpori, lectio animae facit_, saith Seneca, as\nmeat is to the body, such is reading to the soul. [3347]\"To be at leisure\nwithout books is another hell, and to be buried alive.\" [3348]Cardan calls\na library the physic of the soul; [3349]\"divine authors fortify the mind,\nmake men bold and constant; and (as Hyperius adds) godly conference will\nnot permit the mind to be tortured with absurd cogitations.\" Rhasis enjoins\ncontinual conference to such melancholy men, perpetual discourse of some\nhistory, tale, poem, news, &c., _alternos sermones edere ac bibere, aeque\njucundum quam cibus, sive potus_, which feeds the mind as meat and drink\ndoth the body, and pleaseth as much: and therefore the said Rhasis, not\nwithout good cause, would have somebody still talk seriously, or dispute\nwith them, and sometimes [3350]\"to cavil and wrangle\" (so that it break not\nout to a violent perturbation), \"for such altercation is like stirring of a\ndead fire to make it burn afresh,\" it whets a dull spirit, \"and will not\nsuffer the mind to be drowned in those profound cogitations, which\nmelancholy men are commonly troubled with.\" [3351]Ferdinand and Alphonsus,\nkings of Arragon and Sicily, were both cured by reading the history, one of\nCurtius, the other of Livy, when no prescribed physic would take place.\n[3352]Camerarius relates as much of Lorenzo de' Medici. Heathen\nphilosophers arc so full of divine precepts in this kind, that, as some\nthink, they alone are able to settle a distressed mind. [3353]_Sunt verba\net voces, quibus liunc lenire dolorem_, &c. Epictetus, Plutarch, and\nSeneca; _qualis ille, quae tela_, saith Lipsius, _adversus omnes animi\ncasus administrat, et ipsam mortem, quomodo vitia eripit, infert virtutes_?\nwhen I read Seneca, [3354]\"methinks I am beyond all human fortunes, on the\ntop of a hill above mortality.\" Plutarch saith as much of Homer, for which\ncause belike Niceratus, in Xenophon, was made by his parents to con Homer's\nIliads and Odysseys without book, _ut in virum bonum evaderet_, as well to\nmake him a good and honest man, as to avoid idleness. If this comfort be\ngot from philosophy, what shall be had from divinity? What shall Austin,\nCyprian, Gregory, Bernard's divine meditations afford us?\n\n[3355] \"Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,\n        Plenius et melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicunt.\"\n\nNay, what shall the Scripture itself? Which is like an apothecary's shop,\nwherein are all remedies for all infirmities of mind, purgatives, cordials,\nalteratives, corroboratives, lenitives, &c. \"Every disease of the soul,\"\nsaith [3356]Austin, \"hath a peculiar medicine in the Scripture; this only\nis required, that the sick man take the potion which God hath already\ntempered.\" [3357]Gregory calls it \"a glass wherein we may see all our\ninfirmities,\" _ignitum colloquium_, Psalm cxix. 140. [3358]Origen a charm.\nAnd therefore Hierom prescribes Rusticus the monk, [3359]\"continually to\nread the Scripture, and to meditate on that which he hath read; for as\nmastication is to meat, so is meditation on that which we read.\" I would\nfor these causes wish him that, is melancholy to use both human and divine\nauthors, voluntarily to impose some task upon himself, to divert his\nmelancholy thoughts: to study the art of memory, Cosmus Rosselius, Pet.\nRavennas, Scenkelius' Detectus, or practise brachygraphy, &c., that will\nask a great deal of attention: or let him demonstrate a proposition in\nEuclid, in his five last books, extract a square root, or study Algebra:\nthan which, as [3360]Clavius holds, \"in all human disciplines nothing can\nbe more excellent and pleasant, so abstruse and recondite, so bewitching,\nso miraculous, so ravishing, so easy withal and full of delight,\" _omnem\nhumanum captum superare videtur_. By this means you may define _ex ungue\nleonem_, as the diverb is, by his thumb alone the bigness of Hercules, or\nthe true dimensions of the great [3361]Colossus, Solomon's temple, and\nDomitian's amphitheatre out of a little part. By this art you may\ncontemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters, which may be so\ninfinitely varied, that the words complicated and deduced thence will not\nbe contained within the compass of the firmament; ten words may be varied\n40,320 several ways: by this art you may examine how many men may stand one\nby another in the whole superficies of the earth, some say\n148,456,800,000,000, _assignando singulis passum quadratum_ (assigning a\nsquare foot to each), how many men, supposing all the world as habitable as\nFrance, as fruitful and so long-lived, may be born in 60,000 years, and so\nmay you demonstrate with [3362]Archimedes how many sands the mass of the\nwhole world might contain if all sandy, if you did but first know how much\na small cube as big as a mustard-seed might hold, with infinite such. But\nin all nature what is there so stupendous as to examine and calculate the\nmotion of the planets, their magnitudes, apogees, perigees, eccentricities,\nhow far distant from the earth, the bigness, thickness, compass of the\nfirmament, each star, with their diameters and circumference, apparent\narea, superficies, by those curious helps of glasses, astrolabes, sextants,\nquadrants, of which Tycho Brahe in his mechanics, optics ([3363]divine\noptics) arithmetic, geometry, and such like arts and instruments? What so\nintricate and pleasing withal, as to peruse and practise Heron\nAlexandrinus's works, _de spiritalibus, de machinis bellicis, de machina se\nmovente_, Jordani Nemorarii _de ponderibus proposit. 13_, that pleasant\ntract of Machometes Bragdedinus _de superficierum divisionibus_,\nApollonius's Conics, or Commandinus's labours in that kind, _de centro\ngravitatis_, with many such geometrical theorems and problems? Those rare\ninstruments and mechanical inventions of Jac. Bessonus, and Cardan to this\npurpose, with many such experiments intimated long since by Roger Bacon, in\nhis tract _de [3364]Secretis artis et naturae_, as to make a chariot to\nmove _sine animali_, diving boats, to walk on the water by art, and to fly\nin the air, to make several cranes and pulleys, _quibus homo trahat ad se\nmille homines_, lift up and remove great weights, mills to move themselves,\nArchita's dove, Albertus's brazen head, and such thaumaturgical works. But\nespecially to do strange miracles by glasses, of which Proclus and Bacon\nwrit of old, burning glasses, multiplying glasses, perspectives, _ut unus\nhomo appareat exercitus_, to see afar off, to represent solid bodies by\ncylinders and concaves, to walk in the air, _ut veraciter videant_, (saith\nBacon) _aurum et argentum et quicquid aliud volunt, et quum veniant ad\nlocum visionis, nihil inveniant_, which glasses are much perfected of late\nby Baptista Porta and Galileo, and much more is promised by Maginus and\nMidorgius, to be performed in this kind. _Otocousticons_ some speak of, to\nintend hearing, as the other do sight; Marcellus Vrencken, a Hollander, in\nhis epistle to Burgravius, makes mention of a friend of his that is about\nan instrument, _quo videbit quae in altero horizonte sint_. But our\nalchemists, methinks, and Rosicrucians afford most rarities, and are fuller\nof experiments: they can make gold, separate and alter metals, extract\noils, salts, lees, and do more strange works than Geber, Lullius, Bacon, or\nany of those ancients. Crollius hath made after his master Paracelsus,\n_aurum fulminans_, or _aurum volatile_, which shall imitate thunder and\nlightning, and crack louder than any gunpowder; Cornelius Drible a\nperpetual motion, inextinguishable lights, _linum non ardens_, with many\nsuch feats; see his book _de natura elementorum_, besides hail, wind, snow,\nthunder, lightning, &c., those strange fireworks, devilish petards, and\nsuch like warlike machinations derived hence, of which read Tartalea and\nothers. Ernestus Burgravius, a disciple of Paracelsus, hath published a\ndiscourse, in which he specifies a lamp to be made of man's blood, _Lucerna\nvitae et mortis index_, so he terms it, which chemically prepared forty\ndays, and afterwards kept in a glass, shall show all the accidents of this\nlife; _si lampus hic clarus, tunc homo hilaris et sanus corpore et animo;\nsi nebulosus et depressus, male afficitur, et sic pro statu hominis\nvariatur, unde sumptus sanguis_; [3365]and which is most wonderful, it dies\nwith the party, _cum homine perit, et evanescit_, the lamp and the man\nwhence the blood was taken, are extinguished together. The same author hath\nanother tract of Mumia (all out as vain and prodigious as the first) by\nwhich he will cure most diseases, and transfer them from a man to a beast,\nby drawing blood from one, and applying it to the other, _vel in plantam\nderivare_, and an Alexi-pharmacum, of which Roger Bacon of old in his\n_Tract. de retardanda senectute_, to make a man young again, live three or\nfour hundred years. Besides panaceas, martial amulets, _unguentum\narmarium_, balsams, strange extracts, elixirs, and such like\nmagico-magnetical cures. Now what so pleasing can there be as the\nspeculation of these things, to read and examine such experiments, or if a\nman be more mathematically given, to calculate, or peruse Napier's\nLogarithms, or those tables of artificial [3366]sines and tangents, not\nlong since set out by mine old collegiate, good friend, and late\nfellow-student of Christ Church in Oxford, [3367]Mr. Edmund Gunter, which\nwill perform that by addition and subtraction only, which heretofore\nRegiomontanus's tables did by multiplication and division, or those\nelaborate conclusions of his [3368]sector, quadrant, and cross-staff. Or\nlet him that is melancholy calculate spherical triangles, square a circle,\ncast a nativity, which howsoever some tax, I say with [3369]Garcaeus,\n_dabimus hoc petulantibus ingeniis_, we will in some cases allow: or let\nhim make an _ephemerides_, read Suisset the calculator's works, Scaliger\n_de emendatione temporum_, and Petavius his adversary, till he understand\nthem, peruse subtle Scotus and Suarez's metaphysics, or school divinity,\nOccam, Thomas, Entisberus, Durand, &c. If those other do not affect him,\nand his means be great, to employ his purse and fill his head, he may go\nfind the philosopher's stone; he may apply his mind, I say, to heraldry,\nantiquity, invent impresses, emblems; make epithalamiums, epitaphs,\nelegies, epigrams, palindroma epigrammata, anagrams, chronograms,\nacrostics, upon his friends' names; or write a comment on Martianus\nCapella, Tertullian _de pallio_, the Nubian geography, or upon Aelia Laelia\nCrispis, as many idle fellows have essayed; and rather than do nothing,\nvary a [3370]verse a thousand ways with Putean, so torturing his wits, or\nas Rainnerus of Luneburg, [3371]2150 times in his _Proteus Poeticus_, or\nScaliger, Chrysolithus, Cleppissius, and others, have in like sort done. If\nsuch voluntary tasks, pleasure and delight, or crabbedness of these\nstudies, will not yet divert their idle thoughts, and alienate their\nimaginations, they must be compelled, saith Christophorus a Vega, _cogi\ndebent_, _l. 5. c. 14_, upon some mulct, if they perform it not, _quod ex\nofficio incumbat_, loss of credit or disgrace, such as our public\nUniversity exercises. For, as he that plays for nothing will not heed his\ngame; no more will voluntary employment so thoroughly affect a student,\nexcept he be very intent of himself, and take an extraordinary delight in\nthe study, about which he is conversant. It should be of that nature his\nbusiness, which _volens nolens_ he must necessarily undergo, and without\ngreat loss, mulct, shame, or hindrance, he may not omit.\n\nNow for women, instead of laborious studies, they have curious needleworks,\ncut-works, spinning, bone-lace, and many pretty devices of their own\nmaking, to adorn their houses, cushions, carpets, chairs, stools, (\"for she\neats not the bread of idleness,\" Prov. xxxi. 27. _quaesivit lanam et\nlinum_) confections, conserves, distillations, &c., which they show to\nstrangers.\n\n[3372] \"Ipsa comes praesesque operis venientibus ultro\n        Hospitibus monstrare solet, non segniter horas\n        Contestata suas, sed nec sibi depertisse.\"\n\n       \"Which to her guests she shows, with all her pelf,\n        Thus far my maids, but this I did myself.\"\n\nThis they have to busy themselves about, household offices, &c., [3373]\nneat gardens, full of exotic, versicolour, diversely varied, sweet-smelling\nflowers, and plants in all kinds, which they are most ambitious to get,\ncurious to preserve and keep, proud to possess, and much many times brag\nof. Their merry meetings and frequent visitations, mutual invitations in\ngood towns, I voluntarily omit, which are so much in use, gossiping among\nthe meaner sort, &c., old folks have their beads: an excellent invention to\nkeep them from idleness, that are by nature melancholy, and past all\naffairs, to say so many paternosters, avemarias, creeds, if it were not\nprofane and superstitious. In a word, body and mind must be exercised, not\none, but both, and that in a mediocrity; otherwise it will cause a great\ninconvenience. If the body be overtired, it tires the mind. The mind\noppresseth the body, as with students it oftentimes falls out, who (as\n[3374]Plutarch observes) have no care of the body, \"but compel that which\nis mortal to do as much as that which is immortal: that which is earthly,\nas that which is ethereal. But as the ox tired, told the camel, (both\nserving one master) that refused to carry some part of his burden, before\nit were long he should be compelled to carry all his pack, and skin to boot\n(which by and by, the ox being dead, fell out), the body may say to the\nsoul, that will give him no respite or remission: a little after, an ague,\nvertigo, consumption, seizeth on them both, all his study is omitted, and\nthey must be compelled to be sick together:\" he that tenders his own good\nestate, and health, must let them draw with equal yoke, both alike, [3375]\n\"that so they may happily enjoy their wished health.\"\n\n\nMEMB. V.\n_Waking and terrible Dreams rectified_.\n\nAs waking that hurts, by all means must be avoided, so sleep, which so much\nhelps, by like ways, [3376]\"must be procured, by nature or art, inward or\noutward medicines, and be protracted longer than ordinary, if it may be, as\nbeing an especial help.\" It moistens and fattens the body, concocts, and\nhelps digestion (as we see in dormice, and those Alpine mice that sleep all\nwinter), which Gesner speaks of, when they are so found sleeping under the\nsnow in the dead of winter, as fat as butter. It expels cares, pacifies the\nmind, refresheth the weary limbs after long work:\n\n[3377]Somne quies rerum, placidissime somne deorum,\n        Pax animi, quem cura fugit, qui corpora duris\n        Fessa ministeriis mulces reparasque labori.\"\n\n       \"Sleep, rest of things, O pleasing deity,\n        Peace of the soul, which cares dost crucify,\n        Weary bodies refresh and mollify.\"\n\nThe chiefest thing in all physic, [3378]Paracelsus calls it, _omnia arcana\ngemmarum superans et metallorum_. The fittest time is [3379]\"two or three\nhours after supper, when as the meat is now settled at the bottom of the\nstomach, and 'tis good to lie on the right side first, because at that site\nthe liver doth rest under the stomach, not molesting any way, but heating\nhim as a fire doth a kettle, that is put to it. After the first sleep 'tis\nnot amiss to lie on the left side, that the meat may the better descend;\"\nand sometimes again on the belly, but never on the back. Seven or eight\nhours is a competent time for a melancholy man to rest, as Crato thinks;\nbut as some do, to lie in bed and not sleep, a day, or half a day together,\nto give assent to pleasing conceits and vain imaginations, is many ways\npernicious. To procure this sweet moistening sleep, it's best to take away\nthe occasions (if it be possible) that hinder it, and then to use such\ninward or outward remedies, which may cause it. _Constat hodie_ (saith\nBoissardus in his tract _de magia, cap. 4._) _multos ita fascinari ut\nnoctes integras exigant insomnes, summa, inquietudine animorum et\ncorporum_; many cannot sleep for witches and fascinations, which are too\nfamiliar in some places; they call it, _dare alicui malam noctem_. But the\nordinary causes are heat and dryness, which must first be removed: [3380]a\nhot and dry brain never sleeps well: grief, fears, cares, expectations,\nanxieties, great businesses, [3381]_In aurum utramque otiose ut dormias_,\nand all violent perturbations of the mind, must in some sort be qualified,\nbefore we can hope for any good repose. He that sleeps in the daytime, or\nis in suspense, fear, any way troubled in mind, or goes to bed upon a full\n[3382]stomach, may never hope for quiet rest in the night; _nec enim\nmeritoria somnos admittunt_, as the [3383]poet saith; inns and such like\ntroublesome places are not for sleep; one calls ostler, another tapster,\none cries and shouts, another sings, whoops, halloos,\n\n[3384]  ------\"absentem cantat amicam,\n        Multa prolutus vappa nauta atque viator.\"\n\nWho not accustomed to such noises can sleep amongst them? He that will\nintend to take his rest must go to bed _animo securo, quieto et libero_,\nwith a [3385]secure and composed mind, in a quiet place: _omnia noctes\nerunt placida composta quiete_: and if that will not serve, or may not be\nobtained, to seek then such means as are requisite. To lie in clean linen\nand sweet; before he goes to bed, or in bed, to hear [3386]\"sweet music,\"\nwhich Ficinus commends, _lib. 1. cap. 24_, or as Jobertus, _med. pract.\nlib. 3. cap. 10._ [3387]\"to read some pleasant author till he be asleep, to\nhave a basin of water still dropping by his bedside,\" or to lie near that\npleasant murmur, _lene sonantis aquae_. Some floodgates, arches, falls of\nwater, like London Bridge, or some continuate noise which may benumb the\nsenses, _lenis motus, silentium et tenebra, tum et ipsa voluntas somnos\nfaciunt_; as a gentle noise to some procures sleep, so, which Bernardinus\nTilesius, _lib. de somno_, well observes, silence, in a dark room, and the\nwill itself, is most available to others. Piso commends frications, Andrew\nBorde a good draught of strong drink before one goes to bed; I say, a\nnutmeg and ale, or a good draught of Muscadine, with a toast and nutmeg, or\na posset of the same, which many use in a morning, but methinks, for such\nas have dry brains, are much more proper at night; some prescribe a [3388]\nsup of vinegar as they go to bed, a spoonful, saith Aetius _Tetrabib. lib.\n2. ser. 2. cap. 10. lib. 6. cap. 10._ Aegineta, _lib. 3. cap. 14._ Piso, \"a\nlittle after meat,\" [3389]\"because it rarefies melancholy, and procures an\nappetite to sleep.\" _Donat. ab Altomar. cap. 7._ and Mercurialis approve of\nit, if the malady proceed from the [3390]spleen. Salust. Salvian. _lib. 2.\ncap. 1. de remed._ Hercules de Saxonia _in Pan. Aelinus_, Montaltus _de\nmorb. capitis, cap. 28. de Melan._ are altogether against it. Lod.\nMercatus, _de inter. Morb. cau. lib. 1. cap. 17._ in some cases doth allow\nit. [3391]Rhasis seems to deliberate of it, though Simeon commend it (in\nsauce peradventure) he makes a question of it: as for baths, fomentations,\noils, potions, simples or compounds, inwardly taken to this purpose, [3392]\nI shall speak of them elsewhere. If, in the midst of the night, when they\nlie awake, which is usual to toss and tumble, and not sleep, [3393]\nRanzovius would have them, if it be in warm weather, to rise and walk three\nor four turns (till they be cold) about the chamber, and then go to bed\nagain.\n\nAgainst fearful and troublesome dreams, Incubus and such inconveniences,\nwherewith melancholy men are molested, the best remedy is to eat a light\nsupper, and of such meats as are easy of digestion, no hare, venison, beef,\n&c., not to lie on his back, not to meditate or think in the daytime of any\nterrible objects, or especially talk of them before he goes to bed. For, as\nhe said in Lucian after such conference, _Hecates somniare mihi videor_, I\ncan think of nothing but hobgoblins: and as Tully notes, [3394] \"for the\nmost part our speeches in the daytime cause our fantasy to work upon the\nlike in our sleep,\" which Ennius writes of Homer: _Et canis in somnis\nleporis vestigia latrat_: as a dog dreams of a hare, so do men on such\nsubjects they thought on last.\n\n[3395] \"Somnia quae mentes ludunt volitantibus umbris,\n        Nec delubra deum, nec ab aethere numina mittunt,\n        Sed sibi quisque facit,\" &c.\n\nFor that cause when Ptolemy, king of Egypt, had posed the seventy\ninterpreters in order, and asked the nineteenth man what would make one\nsleep quietly in the night, he told him, [3396]\"the best way was to have\ndivine and celestial meditations, and to use honest actions in the daytime.\n[3397]Lod. Vives wonders how schoolmen could sleep quietly, and were not\nterrified in the night, or walk in the dark, they had such monstrous\nquestions, and thought of such terrible matters all day long.\" They had\nneed, amongst the rest, to sacrifice to god Morpheus, whom [3398]\nPhilostratus paints in a white and black coat, with a horn and ivory box\nfull of dreams, of the same colours, to signify good and bad. If you will\nknow how to interpret them, read Artemidorus, Sambucus and Cardan; but how\nto help them, [3399]I must refer you to a more convenient place.\n\n\nMEMB. VI.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Perturbations of the mind rectified. From himself, by\nresisting to the utmost, confessing his grief to a friend, &c._\n\nWhosoever he is that shall hope to cure this malady in himself or any\nother, must first rectify these passions and perturbations of the mind: the\nchiefest cure consists in them. A quiet mind is that _voluptas_, or _summum\nbonum_ of Epicurus, _non dolere, curis vacare, animo tranquillo esse_, not\nto grieve, but to want cares, and have a quiet soul, is the only pleasure\nof the world, as Seneca truly recites his opinion, not that of eating and\ndrinking, which injurious Aristotle maliciously puts upon him, and for\nwhich he is still mistaken, _male audit et vapulat_, slandered without a\ncause, and lashed by all posterity. [3400]\"Fear and sorrow, therefore, are\nespecially to be avoided, and the mind to be mitigated with mirth,\nconstancy, good hope; vain terror, bad objects are to be removed, and all\nsuch persons in whose companies they be not well pleased.\" Gualter Bruel.\nFernelius, _consil. 43._ Mercurialis, _consil. 6._ Piso, Jacchinus, _cap.\n15. in 9. Rhasis_, Capivaccius, Hildesheim, &c., all inculcate this as an\nespecial means of their cure, that their [3401]\"minds be quietly pacified,\nvain conceits diverted, if it be possible, with terrors, cares,\" [3402]\n\"fixed studies, cogitations, and whatsoever it is that shall any way molest\nor trouble the soul,\" because that otherwise there is no good to be done.\n[3403]\"The body's mischiefs,\" as Plato proves, \"proceed from the soul: and\nif the mind be not first satisfied, the body can never be cured.\"\nAlcibiades raves (saith [3404]Maximus Tyrius) and is sick, his furious\ndesires carry him from Lyceus to the pleading place, thence to the sea, so\ninto Sicily, thence to Lacedaemon, thence to Persia, thence to Samos, then\nagain to Athens; Critias tyranniseth over all the city; Sardanapalus is\nlovesick; these men are ill-affected all, and can never be cured, till\ntheir minds be otherwise qualified. Crato, therefore, in that often-cited\nCounsel of his for a nobleman his patient, when he had sufficiently\ninformed him in diet, air, exercise, Venus, sleep, concludes with these as\nmatters of greatest moment, _Quod reliquum est, animae accidentia\ncorrigantur_, from which alone proceeds melancholy; they are the fountain,\nthe subject, the hinges whereon it turns, and must necessarily be reformed.\n[3405]\"For anger stirs choler, heats the blood and vital spirits; sorrow on\nthe other side refrigerates the body, and extinguisheth natural heat,\noverthrows appetite, hinders concoction, dries up the temperature, and\nperverts the understanding:\" fear dissolves the spirits, infects the heart,\nattenuates the soul: and for these causes all passions and perturbations\nmust, to the uttermost of our power and most seriously, be removed.\nAelianus Montaltus attributes so much to them, [3406]\"that he holds the\nrectification of them alone to be sufficient to the cure of melancholy in\nmost patients.\" Many are fully cured when they have seen or heard, &c.,\nenjoy their desires, or be secured and satisfied in their minds; Galen, the\ncommon master of them all, from whose fountain they fetch water, brags,\n_lib. 1. de san. tuend._, that he, for his part, hath cured divers of this\ninfirmity, _solum animis ad rectum institutis_, by right settling alone of\ntheir minds.\n\nYea, but you will here infer, that this is excellent good indeed if it\ncould be done; but how shall it be effected, by whom, what art, what means?\n_hic labor, hoc opus est._ 'Tis a natural infirmity, a most powerful\nadversary, all men are subject to passions, and melancholy above all\nothers, as being distempered by their innate humours, abundance of choler\nadust, weakness of parts, outward occurrences; and how shall they be\navoided? The wisest men, greatest philosophers of most excellent wit,\nreason, judgment, divine spirits, cannot moderate themselves in this\nbehalf; such as are sound in body and mind, Stoics, heroes, Homer's gods,\nall are passionate, and furiously carried sometimes; and how shall we that\nare already crazed, _fracti animis_, sick in body, sick in mind, resist? we\ncannot perform it. You may advise and give good precepts, as who cannot?\nBut how shall they be put in practice? I may not deny but our passions are\nviolent, and tyrannise of us, yet there be means to curb them; though they\nbe headstrong, they may be tamed, they may be qualified, if he himself or\nhis friends will but use their honest endeavours, or make use of such\nordinary helps as are commonly prescribed.\n\nHe himself (I say); from the patient himself the first and chiefest remedy\nmust be had; for if he be averse, peevish, waspish, give way wholly to his\npassions, will not seek to be helped, or be ruled by his friends, how is it\npossible he should be cured? But if he be willing at least, gentle,\ntractable, and desire his own good, no doubt but he may _magnam morbi\ndeponere partem_, be eased at least, if not cured. He himself must do his\nutmost endeavour to resist and withstand the beginnings. _Principiis\nobsta_, \"Give not water passage, no not a little,\" Ecclus. xxv. 27. If they\nopen a little, they will make a greater breach at length. Whatsoever it is\nthat runneth in his mind, vain conceit, be it pleasing or displeasing,\nwhich so much affects or troubleth him, [3407]\"by all possible means he\nmust withstand it, expel those vain, false, frivolous imaginations, absurd\nconceits, feigned fears and sorrows; from which,\" saith Piso, \"this disease\nprimarily proceeds, and takes his first occasion or beginning, by doing\nsomething or other that shall be opposite unto them, thinking of something\nelse, persuading by reason, or howsoever to make a sudden alteration of\nthem.\" Though he have hitherto run in a full career, and precipitated\nhimself, following his passions, giving reins to his appetite, let him now\nstop upon a sudden, curb himself in; and as [3408]Lemnius adviseth, \"strive\nagainst with all his power, to the utmost of his endeavour, and not cherish\nthose fond imaginations, which so covertly creep into his mind, most\npleasing and amiable at first, but bitter as gall at last, and so\nheadstrong, that by no reason, art, counsel, or persuasion, they may be\nshaken off.\" Though he be far gone, and habituated unto such fantastical\nimaginations, yet as [3409]Tully and Plutarch advise, let him oppose,\nfortify, or prepare himself against them, by premeditation, reason, or as\nwe do by a crooked staff, bend himself another way.\n\n[3410] \"Tu tamen interea effugito quae tristia mentem\n        Solicitant, procul esse jube curasque metumque\n        Pallentum, ultrices iras, sint omnia laeta.\"\n\n       \"In the meantime expel them from thy mind,\n        Pale fears, sad cares, and griefs which do it grind,\n        Revengeful anger, pain and discontent,\n        Let all thy soul be set on merriment.\"\n\n_Curas tolle graves, irasci crede profanum_. If it be idleness hath caused\nthis infirmity, or that he perceive himself given to solitariness, to walk\nalone, and please his mind with fond imaginations, let him by all means\navoid it; 'tis a bosom enemy, 'tis delightsome melancholy, a friend in\nshow, but a secret devil, a sweet poison, it will in the end be his\nundoing; let him go presently, task or set himself a work, get some good\ncompany. If he proceed, as a gnat flies about a candle, so long till at\nlength he burn his bodv, so in the end he will undo himself: if it be any\nharsh object, ill company, let him presently go from it. If by his own\ndefault, through ill diet, bad air, want of exercise, &c., let him now\nbegin to reform himself. \"It would be a perfect remedy against all\ncorruption, if,\" as [3411]Roger Bacon hath it, \"we could but moderate\nourselves in those six non-natural things.\" [3412]\"If it be any disgrace,\nabuse, temporal loss, calumny, death of friends, imprisonment, banishment,\nbe not troubled with it, do not fear, be not angry, grieve not at it, but\nwith all courage sustain it.\" (Gordonius, _lib. 1. c. 15. de conser. vit._)\n_Tu contra audentior ito_. [3413]If it be sickness, ill success, or any\nadversity that hath caused it, oppose an invincible courage, \"fortify\nthyself by God's word, or otherwise,\" _mala bonis persuadenda_, set\nprosperity against adversity, as we refresh our eyes by seeing some\npleasant meadow, fountain, picture, or the like: recreate thy mind by some\ncontrary object, with some more pleasing meditation divert thy thoughts.\n\nYea, but you infer again, _facile consilium damus aliis_, we can easily\ngive counsel to others; every man, as the saying is, can tame a shrew but\nhe that hath her; _si hic esses, aliter sentires_; if you were in our\nmisery, you would find it otherwise, 'tis not so easily performed. We know\nthis to be true; we should moderate ourselves, but we are furiously\ncarried, we cannot make use of such precepts, we are overcome, sick, _male\nsani_, distempered and habituated to these courses, we can make no\nresistance; you may as well bid him that is diseased not to feel pain, as a\nmelancholy man not to fear, not to be sad: 'tis within his blood, his\nbrains, his whole temperature, it cannot be removed. But he may choose\nwhether he will give way too far unto it, he may in some sort correct\nhimself. A philosopher was bitten with a mad dog, and as the nature of that\ndisease is to abhor all waters, and liquid things, and to think still they\nsee the picture of a dog before them: he went for all this, _reluctante\nse_, to the bath, and seeing there (as he thought) in the water the picture\nof a dog, with reason overcame this conceit, _quid cani cum balneo_? what\nshould a dog do in a bath? a mere conceit. Thou thinkest thou hearest and\nseest devils, black men, &c., 'tis not so, 'tis thy corrupt fantasy; settle\nthine imagination, thou art well. Thou thinkest thou hast a great nose,\nthou art sick, every man observes thee, laughs thee to scorn; persuade\nthyself 'tis no such matter: this is fear only, and vain suspicion. Thou\nart discontent, thou art sad and heavy; but why? upon what ground? consider\nof it: thou art jealous, timorous, suspicious; for what cause? examine it\nthoroughly, thou shalt find none at all, or such as is to be contemned;\nsuch as thou wilt surely deride, and contemn in thyself, when it is past.\nRule thyself then with reason, satisfy thyself, accustom thyself, wean\nthyself from such fond conceits, vain fears, strong imaginations, restless\nthoughts. Thou mayst do it; _Est in nobis assuescere_ (as Plutarch saith),\nwe may frame ourselves as we will. As he that useth an upright shoe, may\ncorrect the obliquity, or crookedness, by wearing it on the other side; we\nmay overcome passions if we will. _Quicquid sibi imperavit animus obtinuit_\n(as [3414]Seneca saith) _nulli tam feri affectus, ut non disciplina\nperdomentur_, whatsoever the will desires, she may command: no such cruel\naffections, but by discipline they may be tamed; voluntarily thou wilt not\ndo this or that, which thou oughtest to do, or refrain, &c., but when thou\nart lashed like a dull jade, thou wilt reform it: fear of a whip will make\nthee do, or not do. Do that voluntarily then which thou canst do, and must\ndo by compulsion; thou mayst refrain if thou wilt, and master thine\naffections. [3415]\"As in a city\" (saith Melancthon) \"they do by stubborn\nrebellious rogues, that will not submit themselves to political judgment,\ncompel them by force; so must we do by our affections. If the heart will\nnot lay aside those vicious motions, and the fantasy those fond\nimaginations, we have another form of government to enforce and refrain our\noutward members, that they be not led by our passions.\" If appetite will\nnot obey, let the moving faculty overrule her, let her resist and compel\nher to do otherwise. In an ague the appetite would drink; sore eyes that\nitch would be rubbed; but reason saith no, and therefore the moving faculty\nwill not do it. Our fantasy would intrude a thousand fears, suspicions,\nchimeras upon us, but we have reason to resist, yet we let it be overborne\nby our appetite; [3416]\"imagination enforceth spirits, which, by an\nadmirable league of nature, compel the nerves to obey, and they our several\nlimbs:\" we give too much way to our passions. And as to him that is sick of\nan ague, all things are distasteful and unpleasant, _non ex cibi vitio_\nsaith Plutarch, not in the meat, but in our taste: so many things are\noffensive to us, not of themselves, but out of our corrupt judgment,\njealousy, suspicion, and the like: we pull these mischiefs upon our own\nheads.\n\nIf then our judgment be so depraved, our reason overruled, will\nprecipitated, that we cannot seek our own good, or moderate ourselves, as\nin this disease commonly it is, the best way for ease is to impart our\nmisery to some friend, not to smother it up in our own breast: _aliter\nvitium crescitque tegendo_, &c., and that which was most offensive to us, a\ncause of fear and grief, _quod nunc te coquit_, another hell; for [3417]\n_strangulat inclusus dolor atque exaestuat intus_, grief concealed\nstrangles the soul; but when as we shall but impart it to some discreet,\ntrusty, loving friend, it is [3418]instantly removed, by his counsel\nhappily, wisdom, persuasion, advice, his good means, which we could not\notherwise apply unto ourselves. A friend's counsel is a charm, like\nmandrake wine, _curas sopit_; and as a [3419]bull that is tied to a\nfig-tree becomes gentle on a sudden (which some, saith [3420]Plutarch,\ninterpret of good words), so is a savage, obdurate heart mollified by fair\nspeeches. \"All adversity finds ease in complaining\" (as [3421]Isidore\nholds), \"and 'tis a solace to relate it,\" [3422][Greek: Agathae de\nparaiphasis estin etairou]. Friends' confabulations are comfortable at all\ntimes, as fire in winter, shade in summer, _quale sopor fessis in gramine_,\nmeat and drink to him that is hungry or athirst; Democritus's collyrium is\nnot so sovereign to the eyes as this is to the heart; good words are\ncheerful and powerful of themselves, but much more from friends, as so many\nprops, mutually sustaining each other like ivy and a wall, which Camerarius\nhath well illustrated in an emblem. _Lenit animum simplex vel saepe\nnarratio_, the simple narration many times easeth our distressed mind, and\nin the midst of greatest extremities; so diverse have been relieved, by\n[3423]exonerating themselves to a faithful friend: he sees that which we\ncannot see for passion and discontent, he pacifies our minds, he will ease\nour pain, assuage our anger; _quanta inde voluptas, quanta securitas_,\nChrysostom adds, what pleasure, what security by that means! [3424]\"Nothing\nso available, or that so much refresheth the soul of man.\" Tully, as I\nremember, in an epistle to his dear friend Atticus, much condoles the\ndefect of such a friend. [3425]\"I live here\" (saith he) \"in a great city,\nwhere I have a multitude of acquaintance, but not a man of all that company\nwith whom I dare familiarly breathe, or freely jest. Wherefore I expect\nthee, I desire thee, I send for thee; for there be many things which\ntrouble and molest me, which had I but thee in presence, I could quickly\ndisburden myself of in a walking discourse.\" The like, peradventure, may he\nand he say with that old man in the comedy,\n\n[3426] \"Nemo est meorum amicorum hodie,\n        Apud quem expromere occulta mea audeam.\"\n\nand much inconvenience may both he and he suffer in the meantime by it. He\nor he, or whosoever then labours of this malady, by all means let him get\nsome trusty friend, [3427]_Semper habens Pylademque aliquem qui curet\nOrestem_, a Pylades, to whom freely and securely he may open himself. For\nas in all other occurrences, so it is in this, _Si quis in coelum\nascendisset_, &c. as he said in [3428]Tully, if a man had gone to heaven,\n\"seen the beauty of the skies,\" stars errant, fixed, &c., _insuavis erit\nadmiratio_, it will do him no pleasure, except he have somebody to impart\nwhat he hath seen. It is the best thing in the world, as [3429]Seneca\ntherefore adviseth in such a case, \"to get a trusty friend, to whom we may\nfreely and sincerely pour out our secrets; nothing so delighteth and easeth\nthe mind, as when we have a prepared bosom, to which our secrets may\ndescend, of whose conscience we are assured as our own, whose speech may\nease our succourless estate, counsel relieve, mirth expel our mourning, and\nwhose very sight may be acceptable unto us.\" It was the counsel which that\npolitic [3430]Comineus gave to all princes, and others distressed in mind,\nby occasion of Charles Duke of Burgundy, that was much perplexed, \"first to\npray to God, and lay himself open to him, and then to some special friend,\nwhom we hold most dear, to tell all our grievances to him; nothing so\nforcible to strengthen, recreate, and heal the wounded soul of a miserable\nman.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Help from friends by counsel, comfort, fair and foul means,\nwitty devices, satisfaction, alteration of his course of life, removing\nobjects, &c._\n\nWhen the patient of himself is not able to resist, or overcome these\nheart-eating passions, his friends or physician must be ready to supply\nthat which is wanting. _Suae erit humanitatis et sapientiae_ (which [3431]\nTully enjoineth in like case) _siquid erratum, curare, aut improvisum, sua\ndiligentia corrigere._ They must all join; _nec satis medico_, saith [3432]\nHippocrates, _suum fecisse officium, nisi suum quoque aegrotus, suum\nastantes_, &c. First, they must especially beware, a melancholy\ndiscontented person (be it in what kind of melancholy soever) never be left\nalone or idle: but as physicians prescribe physic, _cum custodia_, let them\nnot be left unto themselves, but with some company or other, lest by that\nmeans they aggravate and increase their disease; _non oportet aegros\nhumjusmodi esse solos vel inter ignotos, vel inter eos quos non amant aut\nnegligunt_, as Rod. a Fonseca, _tom. 1. consul. 35._ prescribes. _Lugentes\ncustodire solemus_ (saith [3433]Seneca) _ne solitudine male utantur_; we\nwatch a sorrowful person, lest he abuse his solitariness, and so should we\ndo a melancholy man; set him about some business, exercise or recreation,\nwhich may divert his thoughts, and still keep him otherwise intent; for his\nfantasy is so restless, operative and quick, that if it be not in perpetual\naction, ever employed, it will work upon itself, melancholise, and be\ncarried away instantly, with some fear, jealousy, discontent, suspicion,\nsome vain conceit or other. If his weakness be such that he cannot discern\nwhat is amiss, correct, or satisfy, it behoves them by counsel, comfort, or\npersuasion, by fair or foul means, to alienate his mind, by some artificial\ninvention, or some contrary persuasion, to remove all objects, causes,\ncompanies, occasions, as may any ways molest him, to humour him, please\nhim, divert him, and if it be possible, by altering his course of life, to\ngive him security and satisfaction. If he conceal his grievances, and will\nnot be known of them, [3434]\"they must observe by his looks, gestures,\nmotions, fantasy, what it is that offends,\" and then to apply remedies unto\nhim: many are instantly cured, when their minds are satisfied.\n[3435]Alexander makes mention of a woman, \"that by reason of her husband's\nlong absence in travel, was exceeding peevish and melancholy, but when she\nheard her husband was returned, beyond all expectation, at the first sight\nof him, she was freed from all fear, without help of any other physic\nrestored to her former health.\" Trincavellius, _consil. 12. lib. 1._ hath\nsuch a story of a Venetian, that being much troubled with melancholy,\n[3436]\"and ready to die for grief, when he heard his wife was brought to\nbed of a son, instantly recovered.\" As Alexander concludes, [3437]\"If our\nimaginations be not inveterate, by this art they may be cured, especially\nif they proceed from such a cause.\" No better way to satisfy, than to\nremove the object, cause, occasion, if by any art or means possible we may\nfind it out. If he grieve, stand in fear, be in suspicion, suspense, or any\nway molested, secure him, _Solvitur malum_, give him satisfaction, the cure\nis ended; alter his course of life, there needs no other physic. If the\nparty be sad, or otherwise affected, \"consider\" (saith [3438]Trallianus)\n\"the manner of it, all circumstances, and forthwith make a sudden\nalteration,\" by removing the occasions, avoid all terrible objects, heard\nor seen, [3439]\"monstrous and prodigious aspects,\" tales of devils,\nspirits, ghosts, tragical stories; to such as are in fear they strike a\ngreat impression, renewed many times, and recall such chimeras and terrible\nfictions into their minds. [3440]\"Make not so much as mention of them in\nprivate talk, or a dumb show tending to that purpose: such things\" (saith\nGalateus) \"are offensive to their imaginations.\" And to those that are now\nin sorrow, [3441]Seneca \"forbids all sad companions, and such as lament; a\ngroaning companion is an enemy to quietness.\" [3442]\"Or if there be any\nsuch party, at whose presence the patient is not well pleased, he must be\nremoved: gentle speeches, and fair means, must first be tried; no harsh\nlanguage used, or uncomfortable words; and not expel, as some do, one\nmadness with another; he that so doth, is madder than the patient himself:\"\nall things must be quietly composed; _eversa non evertenda, sed erigenda_,\nthings down must not be dejected, but reared, as Crato counselleth; [3443]\n\"he must be quietly and gently used,\" and we should not do anything against\nhis mind, but by little and little effect it. As a horse that starts at a\ndrum or trumpet, and will not endure the shooting of a piece, may be so\nmanned by art, and animated, that he cannot only endure, but is much more\ngenerous at the hearing of such things, much more courageous than before,\nand much delighteth in it: they must not be reformed _ex abrupto_, but by\nall art and insinuation, made to such companies, aspects, objects they\ncould not formerly away with. Many at first cannot endure the sight of a\ngreen wound, a sick man, which afterward become good chirurgeons, bold\nempirics: a horse starts at a rotten post afar off, which coming near he\nquietly passeth. 'Tis much in the manner of making such kind of persons, be\nthey never so averse from company, bashful, solitary, timorous, they may be\nmade at last with those Roman matrons, to desire nothing more than in a\npublic show, to see a full company of gladiators breathe out their last.\n\nIf they may not otherwise be accustomed to brook such distasteful and\ndispleasing objects, the best way then is generally to avoid them.\nMontanus, _consil. 229._ to the Earl of Montfort, a courtier, and his\nmelancholy patient, adviseth him to leave the court, by reason of those\ncontinual discontents, crosses, abuses, [3444]\"cares, suspicions,\nemulations, ambition, anger, jealousy, which that place afforded, and which\nsurely caused him to be so melancholy at the first:\" _Maxima quaeque domus\nservis est plena superbis_; a company of scoffers and proud jacks are\ncommonly conversant and attend in such places, and able to make any man\nthat is of a soft, quiet disposition (as many times they do) _ex stulto\ninsanum_, if once they humour him, a very idiot, or stark mad. A thing too\nmuch practised in all common societies, and they have no better sport than\nto make themselves merry by abusing some silly fellow, or to take advantage\nof another man's weakness. In such cases as in a plague, the best remedy is\n_cito longe tarde_: (for to such a party, especially if he be apprehensive,\nthere can be no greater misery) to get him quickly gone far enough off, and\nnot to be overhasty in his return. If he be so stupid that he do not\napprehend it, his friends should take some order, and by their discretion\nsupply that which is wanting in him, as in all other cases they ought to\ndo. If they see a man melancholy given, solitary, averse from company,\nplease himself with such private and vain meditations, though he delight in\nit, they ought by all means seek to divert him, to dehort him, to tell him\nof the event and danger that may come of it. If they see a man idle, that\nby reason of his means otherwise will betake himself to no course of life,\nthey ought seriously to admonish him, he makes a noose to entangle himself,\nhis want of employment will be his undoing. If he have sustained any great\nloss, suffered a repulse, disgrace, &c., if it be possible, relieve him. If\nhe desire aught, let him be satisfied; if in suspense, fear, suspicion, let\nhim be secured: and if it may conveniently be, give him his heart's\ncontent; for the body cannot be cured till the mind be satisfied. [3445]\nSocrates, in Plato, would prescribe no physic for Charmides' headache,\n\"till first he had eased his troubled mind; body and soul must be cured\ntogether, as head and eyes.\"\n\n[3446] \"Oculum non curabis sine toto capite,\n        Nec caput sine toto corpora,\n        Nec totum corpus sine anima.\"\n\nIf that may not be hoped or expected, yet ease him with comfort, cheerful\nspeeches, fair promises, and good words, persuade him, advise him. \"Many,\"\nsaith [3447]Galen, \"have been cured by good counsel and persuasion alone.\"\n\"Heaviness of the heart of man doth bring it down, but a good word\nrejoiceth it,\" Prov. xii. 25. \"And there is he that speaketh words like the\npricking of a sword, but the tongue of a wise man is health,\" ver. 18.\n_Oratio, namque saucii animi est remedium_, a gentle speech is the true\ncure of a wounded soul, as [3448]Plutarch contends out of Aeschylus and\nEuripides: \"if it be wisely administered it easeth grief and pain, as\ndiverse remedies do many other diseases.\" 'Tis _incantationis instar_, a\ncharm, _aestuantis animi refrigerium_, that true Nepenthe of Homer, which\nwas no Indian plant, or feigned medicine, which Epidamna, Thonis' wife,\nsent Helena for a token, as Macrobius, _7. Saturnal._ Goropius _Hermat.\nlib. 9._ Greg. Nazianzen, and others suppose, but opportunity of speech:\nfor Helena's bowl, Medea's unction, Venus's girdle, Circe's cup, cannot so\nenchant, so forcibly move or alter as it doth. A letter sent or read will\ndo as much; _multum allevor quum tuas literas lego_, I am much eased, as\n[3449]Tully wrote to Pomponius Atticus, when I read thy letters, and as\nJulianus the Apostate once signified to Maximus the philosopher; as\nAlexander slept with Homer's works, so do I with thine epistles, _tanquam\nPaeoniis medicamentis, easque assidue tanquam, recentes et novas iteramus;\nscribe ergo, et assidue scribe_, or else come thyself; _amicus ad amicum\nvenies_. Assuredly a wise and well-spoken man may do what he will in such a\ncase; a good orator alone, as [3450]Tully holds, can alter affections by\npower of his eloquence, \"comfort such as are afflicted, erect such as are\ndepressed, expel and mitigate fear, lust, anger,\" &c. And how powerful is\nthe charm of a discreet and dear friend? _Ille regit dictis animos et\ntemperat iras_. What may not he effect? As [3451]Chremes told Menedemus,\n\"Fear not, conceal it not, O friend! but tell me what it is that troubles\nthee, and I shall surely help thee by comfort, counsel, or in the matter\nitself.\" [3452] Arnoldus, _lib. 1. breviar. cap. 18._ speaks of a usurer in\nhis time, that upon a loss, much melancholy and discontent, was so cured.\nAs imagination, fear, grief, cause such passions, so conceits alone,\nrectified by good hope, counsel, &c., are able again to help: and 'tis\nincredible how much they can do in such a case, as [3453]Trincavellius\nillustrates by an example of a patient of his; Porphyrius, the philosopher,\nin Plotinus's life (written by him), relates, that being in a discontented\nhumour through insufferable anguish of mind, he was going to make away\nhimself: but meeting by chance his master Plotinus, who perceiving by his\ndistracted looks all was not well, urged him to confess his grief: which\nwhen he had heard, he used such comfortable speeches, that he redeemed him\n_e faucibus Erebi_, pacified his unquiet mind, insomuch that he was easily\nreconciled to himself, and much abashed to think afterwards that he should\never entertain so vile a motion. By all means, therefore, fair promises,\ngood words, gentle persuasions, are to be used, not to be too rigorous at\nfirst, [3454]\"or to insult over them, not to deride, neglect, or contemn,\"\nbut rather, as Lemnius exhorteth, \"to pity, and by all plausible means to\nseek to redress them:\" but if satisfaction may not be had, mild courses,\npromises, comfortable speeches, and good counsel will not take place; then\nas Christophorus a Vega determines, _lib. 3. cap. 14. de Mel._ to handle\nthem more roughly, to threaten and chide, saith [3455]Altomarus, terrify\nsometimes, or as Salvianus will have them, to be lashed and whipped, as we\ndo by a starting horse, [3456]that is affrighted without a cause, or as\n[3457]Rhasis adviseth, \"one while to speak fair and flatter, another while\nto terrify and chide, as they shall see cause.\"\n\nWhen none of these precedent remedies will avail, it will not be amiss,\nwhich Savanarola and Aelian Montaltus so much commend, _clavum clavo\npellere_, [3458]\"to drive out one passion with another, or by some contrary\npassion,\" as they do bleeding at nose by letting blood in the arm, to expel\none fear with another, one grief with another. [3459] Christophorus a Vega\naccounts it rational physic, _non alienum a ratione_: and Lemnius much\napproves it, \"to use a hard wedge to a hard knot,\" to drive out one disease\nwith another, to pull out a tooth, or wound him, to geld him, saith\n[3460]Platerus, as they did epileptical patients of old, because it quite\nalters the temperature, that the pain of the one may mitigate the grief of\nthe other; [3461]\"and I knew one that was so cured of a quartan ague, by\nthe sudden coming of his enemies upon him.\" If we may believe [3462]Pliny,\nwhom Scaliger calls _mendaciorum patrem_, the father of lies, Q. Fabius\nMaximus, that renowned consul of Rome, in a battle fought with the king of\nthe Allobroges, at the river Isaurus, was so rid of a quartan ague.\nValesius, in his controversies, holds this an excellent remedy, and if it\nbe discreetly used in this malady, better than any physic.\n\nSometimes again by some [3463]feigned lie, strange news, witty device,\nartificial invention, it is not amiss to deceive them. [3464]\"As they hate\nthose,\" saith Alexander, \"that neglect or deride, so they will give ear to\nsuch as will soothe them up. If they say they have swallowed frogs or a\nsnake, by all means grant it, and tell them you can easily cure it;\" 'tis\nan ordinary thing. Philodotus, the physician, cured a melancholy king, that\nthought his head was off, by putting a leaden cap thereon; the weight made\nhim perceive it, and freed him of his fond imagination. A woman, in the\nsaid Alexander, swallowed a serpent as she thought; he gave her a vomit,\nand conveyed a serpent, such as she conceived, into the basin; upon the\nsight of it she was amended. The pleasantest dotage that ever I read, saith\n[3465]Laurentius, was of a gentleman at Senes in Italy, who was afraid to\npiss, lest all the town should be drowned; the physicians caused the bells\nto be rung backward, and told him the town was on fire, whereupon he made\nwater, and was immediately cured. Another supposed his nose so big that he\nshould dash it against the wall if he stirred; his physician took a great\npiece of flesh, and holding it in his hand, pinched him by the nose, making\nhim believe that flesh was cut from it. Forestus, _obs. lib. 1._ had a\nmelancholy patient, who thought he was dead, [3466]\"he put a fellow in a\nchest, like a dead man, by his bedside, and made him rear himself a little,\nand eat: the melancholy man asked the counterfeit, whether dead men use to\neat meat? He told him yea; whereupon he did eat likewise and was cured.\"\nLemnius, _lib. 2. cap. 6. de 4. complex_, hath many such instances, and\nJovianus Pontanus, _lib. 4. cap. 2. of Wisd._ of the like; but amongst the\nrest I find one most memorable, registered in the [3467]French chronicles\nof an advocate of Paris before mentioned, who believed verily he was dead,\n&c. I read a multitude of examples of melancholy men cured by such\nartificial inventions.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Music a remedy_.\n\nMany and sundry are the means which philosophers and physicians have\nprescribed to exhilarate a sorrowful heart, to divert those fixed and\nintent cares and meditations, which in this malady so much offend; but in\nmy judgment none so present, none so powerful, none so apposite as a cup of\nstrong drink, mirth, music, and merry company. Ecclus. xl. 20. \"Wine and\nmusic rejoice the heart.\" [3468]Rhasis, _cont. 9. Tract. 15._ Altomarus,\n_cap. 7._ Aelianus Montaltus, _c. 26._ Ficinus, Bened. Victor. Faventinus\nare almost immoderate in the commendation of it; a most forcible medicine\n[3469]Jacchinus calls it: Jason Pratensis, \"a most admirable thing, and\nworthy of consideration, that can so mollify the mind, and stay those\ntempestuous affections of it.\" _Musica est mentis medicina moestae_, a\nroaring-meg against melancholy, to rear and revive the languishing soul;\n[3470]\"affecting not only the ears, but the very arteries, the vital and\nanimal spirits, it erects the mind, and makes it nimble.\" Lemnius, _instit,\ncap. 44._ This it will effect in the most dull, severe and sorrowful souls,\n[3471]\"expel grief with mirth, and if there be any clouds, dust, or dregs\nof cares yet lurking in our thoughts, most powerfully it wipes them all\naway,\" Salisbur. _polit. lib. 1. cap. 6._ and that which is more, it will\nperform all this in an instant: [3472]\"Cheer up the countenance, expel\nausterity, bring in hilarity\" (Girald. Camb. _cap. 12. Topog. Hiber._)\n\"inform our manners, mitigate anger;\" Athenaeus (_Dipnosophist. lib. 14.\ncap. 10._) calleth it an infinite treasure to such as are endowed with it:\n_Dulcisonum reficit tristia corda melos_, Eobanus Hessus. Many other\nproperties [3473]Cassiodorus, _epist. 4._ reckons up of this our divine\nmusic, not only to expel the greatest griefs, but \"it doth extenuate fears\nand furies, appeaseth cruelty, abateth heaviness, and to such as are\nwatchful it causeth quiet rest; it takes away spleen and hatred,\" be it\ninstrumental, vocal, with strings, wind, [3474]_Quae, a spiritu, sine\nmanuum dexteritate gubernetur_, &c. it cures all irksomeness and heaviness\nof the soul. [3475]Labouring men that sing to their work, can tell as much,\nand so can soldiers when they go to fight, whom terror of death cannot so\nmuch affright, as the sound of trumpet, drum, fife, and such like music\nanimates; _metus enim mortis_, as [3476]Censorinus informeth us, _musica\ndepellitur_. \"It makes a child quiet,\" the nurse's song, and many times the\nsound of a trumpet on a sudden, bells ringing, a carman's whistle, a boy\nsinging some ballad tune early in the streets, alters, revives, recreates a\nrestless patient that cannot sleep in the night, &c. In a word, it is so\npowerful a thing that it ravisheth the soul, _regina sensuum_, the queen of\nthe senses, by sweet pleasure (which is a happy cure), and corporal tunes\npacify our incorporeal soul, _sine ore loquens, dominatum in animam\nexercet_, and carries it beyond itself, helps, elevates, extends it.\nScaliger, _exercit. 302_, gives a reason of these effects, [3477]\"because\nthe spirits about the heart take in that trembling and dancing air into the\nbody, are moved together, and stirred up with it,\" or else the mind, as\nsome suppose harmonically composed, is roused up at the tunes of music. And\n'tis not only men that are so affected, but almost all other creatures. You\nknow the tale of Hercules Gallus, Orpheus, and Amphion, _felices animas_\nOvid calls them, that could _saxa movere sono testudinis_, &c. make stocks\nand stones, as well as beasts and other animals, dance after their pipes:\nthe dog and hare, wolf and lamb; _vicinumque lupo praebuit agna latus;\nclamosus graculus, stridula cornix, et Jovis aquila_, as Philostratus\ndescribes it in his images, stood all gaping upon Orpheus; and [3478]trees\npulled up by the roots came to hear him, _Et comitem quercum pinus amica\ntrahit_.\n\nArion made fishes follow him, which, as common experience evinceth, [3479]\nare much affected with music. All singing birds are much pleased with it,\nespecially nightingales, if we may believe Calcagninus; and bees amongst\nthe rest, though they be flying away, when they hear any tingling sound,\nwill tarry behind. [3480]\"Harts, hinds, horses, dogs, bears, are\nexceedingly delighted with it.\" Scal, _exerc. 302._ Elephants, Agrippa\nadds, _lib. 2. cap. 24._ and in Lydia in the midst of a lake there be\ncertain floating islands (if ye will believe it), that after music will\ndance.\n\nBut to leave all declamatory speeches in praise [3481]of divine music, I\nwill confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it\nhath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against [3482]\ndespair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a\nRhodian fiddler, in [3483]Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to\nknow what he could do with his pipe, told him, \"That he would make a\nmelancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a\nlover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\" Ismenias the Theban,\n[3484]Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other\ndiseases by music alone: as now they do those, saith [3485]Bodine, that are\ntroubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance. [3486]Timotheus, the musician,\ncompelled Alexander to skip up and down, and leave his dinner (like the\ntale of the Friar and the Boy), whom Austin, _de civ. Dei, lib. 17. cap.\n14._ so much commends for it. Who hath not heard how David's harmony drove\naway the evil spirits from king Saul, 1 Sam. xvi. and Elisha when he was\nmuch troubled by importunate kings, called for a minstrel, \"and when he\nplayed, the hand of the Lord came upon him,\" 2 Kings iii. Censorinus _de\nnatali, cap. 12._ reports how Asclepiades the physician helped many frantic\npersons by this means, _phreneticorum mentes morbo turbatas_--Jason\nPratensis, _cap. de Mania_, hath many examples, how Clinias and Empedocles\ncured some desperately melancholy, and some mad by this our music. Which\nbecause it hath such excellent virtues, belike [3487]Homer brings in\nPhemius playing, and the Muses singing at the banquet of the gods.\nAristotle, _Polit. l. 8. c. 5_, Plato _2. de legibus_, highly approve it,\nand so do all politicians. The Greeks, Romans, have graced music, and made\nit one of the liberal sciences, though it be now become mercenary. All\ncivil Commonwealths allow it: Cneius Manlius (as [3488]Livius relates)\n_anno ab urb. cond._ 567. brought first out of Asia to Rome singing\nwenches, players, jesters, and all kinds of music to their feasts. Your\nprinces, emperors, and persons of any quality, maintain it in their courts;\nno mirth without music. Sir Thomas More, in his absolute Utopian\ncommonwealth, allows music as an appendix to every meal, and that\nthroughout, to all sorts. Epictetus calls _mensam mutam praesepe_, a table\nwithout music a manger: for \"the concert of musicians at a banquet is a\ncarbuncle set in gold; and as the signet of an emerald well trimmed with\ngold, so is the melody of music in a pleasant banquet.\" Ecclus. xxxii. 5,\n6. [3489]Louis the Eleventh, when he invited Edward the Fourth to come to\nParis, told him that as a principal part of his entertainment, he should\nhear sweet voices of children, Ionic and Lydian tunes, exquisite music, he\nshould have a --, and the cardinal of Bourbon to be his confessor, which he\nused as a most plausible argument: as to a sensual man indeed it is. [3490]\nLucian in his book, _de saltatione_, is not ashamed to confess that he took\ninfinite delight in singing, dancing, music, women's company, and such like\npleasures: \"and if thou\" (saith he) \"didst but hear them play and dance, I\nknow thou wouldst be so well pleased with the object, that thou wouldst\ndance for company thyself, without doubt thou wilt be taken with it.\" So\nScaliger ingenuously confesseth, _exercit. 274._ [3491]\"I am beyond all\nmeasure affected with music, I do most willingly behold them dance, I am\nmightily detained and allured with that grace and comeliness of fair women,\nI am well pleased to be idle amongst them.\" And what young man is not? As\nit is acceptable and conducing to most, so especially to a melancholy man.\nProvided always, his disease proceed not originally from it, that he be not\nsome light _inamarato_, some idle fantastic, who capers in conceit all the\nday long, and thinks of nothing else, but how to make jigs, sonnets,\nmadrigals, in commendation of his mistress. In such cases music is most\npernicious, as a spur to a free horse will make him run himself blind, or\nbreak his wind; _Incitamentum enim amoris musica_, for music enchants, as\nMenander holds, it will make such melancholy persons mad, and the sound of\nthose jigs and hornpipes will not be removed out of the ears a week after.\n[3492]Plato for this reason forbids music and wine to all young men,\nbecause they are most part amorous, _ne ignis addatur igni_, lest one fire\nincrease another. Many men are melancholy by hearing music, but it is a\npleasing melancholy that it causeth; and therefore to such as are\ndiscontent, in woe, fear, sorrow, or dejected, it is a most present remedy:\nit expels cares, alters their grieved minds, and easeth in an instant.\nOtherwise, saith [3493]Plutarch, _Musica magis dementat quam vinum_; music\nmakes some men mad as a tiger; like Astolphos' horn in Ariosto; or\nMercury's golden wand in Homer, that made some wake, others sleep, it hath\ndivers effects: and [3494]Theophrastus right well prophesied, that diseases\nwere either procured by music, or mitigated.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Mirth and merry company, fair objects, remedies_.\n\nMirth and merry company may not be separated from music, both concerning\nand necessarily required in this business. \"Mirth,\" (saith [3495]Vives)\n\"purgeth the blood, confirms health, causeth a fresh, pleasing, and fine\ncolour,\" prorogues life, whets the wit, makes the body young, lively and\nfit for any manner of employment. The merrier the heart the longer the\nlife; \"A merry heart is the life of the flesh,\" Prov. xiv. 30. \"Gladness\nprolongs his days,\" Ecclus. xxx. 22; and this is one of the three\nSalernitan doctors, Dr. Merryman, Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet, [3496]which cure all\ndiseases--_Mens hilaris, requies, moderata dieta_. [3497]Gomesius,\n_praefat. lib. 3. de sal. gen._ is a great magnifier of honest mirth, by\nwhich (saith he) \"we cure many passions of the mind in ourselves, and in\nour friends;\" which [3498]Galateus assigns for a cause why we love merry\ncompanions: and well they deserve it, being that as [3499]Magninus holds, a\nmerry companion is better than any music, and as the saying is, _comes\njucundus in via pro vehiculo_, as a wagon to him that is wearied on the\nway. _Jucunda confabulatio, sales, joci_, pleasant discourse, jests,\nconceits, merry tales, _melliti verborum globuli_, as Petronius, [3500]\nPliny, [3501]Spondanus, [3502]Caelius, and many good authors plead, are\nthat sole Nepenthes of Homer, Helena's bowl, Venus's girdle, so renowned of\nold [3503]to expel grief and care, to cause mirth and gladness of heart, if\nthey be rightly understood, or seasonably applied. In a word,\n\n[3504] \"Amor, voluptas, Venus, gaudium,\n        Jocus, ludus, sermo suavis, suaviatio.\"\n\n       \"Gratification, pleasure, love, joy,\n        Mirth, sport, pleasant words and no alloy,\"\n\nare the true Nepenthes. For these causes our physicians generally prescribe\nthis as a principal engine to batter the walls of melancholy, a chief\nantidote, and a sufficient cure of itself. \"By all means\" (saith [3505]\nMesue) \"procure mirth to these men in such things as are heard, seen,\ntasted, or smelled, or any way perceived, and let them have all enticements\nand fair promises, the sight of excellent beauties, attires, ornaments,\ndelightsome passages to distract their minds from fear and sorrow, and such\nthings on which they are so fixed and intent.\" [3506]\"Let them use hunting,\nsports, plays, jests, merry company,\" as Rhasis prescribes, \"which will not\nlet the mind be molested, a cup of good drink now and then, hear music, and\nhave such companions with whom they are especially delighted;\" [3507]\"merry\ntales or toys, drinking, singing, dancing, and whatsoever else may procure\nmirth:\" and by no means, saith Guianerius, suffer them to be alone.\nBenedictus Victorius Faventinus, in his empirics, accounts it an especial\nremedy against melancholy, [3508]\"to hear and see singing, dancing,\nmaskers, mummers, to converse with such merry fellows and fair maids.\" \"For\nthe beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance,\" Ecclus. xxxvi. 22. [3509]\nBeauty alone is a sovereign remedy against fear, grief, and all melancholy\nfits; a charm, as Peter de la Seine and many other writers affirm, a\nbanquet itself; he gives instance in discontented Menelaus, that was so\noften freed by Helena's fair face: and [3510]Tully, _3 Tusc_. cites\nEpicurus as a chief patron of this tenet. To expel grief, and procure\npleasure, sweet smells, good diet, touch, taste, embracing, singing,\ndancing, sports, plays, and above the rest, exquisite beauties, _quibus\noculi jucunde moventur et animi_, are most powerful means, _obvia forma_,\nto meet or see a fair maid pass by, or to be in company with her. He found\nit by experience, and made good use of it in his own person, if Plutarch\nbelie him not; for he reckons up the names of some more elegant pieces;\n[3511]Leontia, Boedina, Hedieia, Nicedia, that were frequently seen in\nEpicurus' garden, and very familiar in his house. Neither did he try it\nhimself alone, but if we may give credit to [3512]Atheneus, he practised it\nupon others. For when a sad and sick patient was brought unto him to be\ncured, \"he laid him on a down bed, crowned him with a garland of\nsweet-smelling flowers, in a fair perfumed closet delicately set out, and\nafter a portion or two of good drink, which he administered, he brought in\na beautiful young [3513]wench that could play upon a lute, sing, and\ndance,\" &c. Tully, _3. Tusc._ scoffs at Epicurus, for this his profane\nphysic (as well he deserved), and yet Phavorinus and Stobeus highly approve\nof it; most of our looser physicians in some cases, to such parties\nespecially, allow of this; and all of them will have a melancholy, sad, and\ndiscontented person, make frequent use of honest sports, companies, and\nrecreations, _et incitandos ad Venerem_, as [3514]Rodericus a Fonseca will,\n_aspectu et contactu pulcherrimarum foeminarum_, to be drawn to such\nconsorts, whether they will or no. Not to be an auditor only, or a\nspectator, but sometimes an actor himself. _Dulce est desipere in loco_, to\nplay the fool now and then is not amiss, there is a time for all things.\nGrave Socrates would be merry by fits, sing, dance, and take his liquor\ntoo, or else Theodoret belies him; so would old Cato, [3515]Tully by his\nown confession, and the rest. Xenophon, in his _Sympos._ brings in Socrates\nas a principal actor, no man merrier than himself, and sometimes he would\n[3516]\"ride a cockhorse with his children.\"--_equitare in arundine longa_.\n(Though Alcibiades scoffed at him for it) and well he might; for now and\nthen (saith Plutarch) the most virtuous, honest, and gravest men will use\nfeasts, jests, and toys, as we do sauce to our meats. So did Scipio and\nLaelius,\n\n[3517] \"Qui ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant,\n        Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,\n        Nugari cum illo, et discincti ludere, donec\n        Decoqueretur olus, soliti\"------\n\n       \"Valorous Scipio and gentle Laelius,\n        Removed from the scene and rout so clamorous,\n        Were wont to recreate themselves their robes laid by,\n        Whilst supper by the cook was making ready.\"\n\nMachiavel, in the eighth book of his Florentine history, gives this note of\nCosmo de Medici, the wisest and gravest man of his time in Italy, that he\nwould [3518]\"now and then play the most egregious fool in his carriage, and\nwas so much given to jesters, players and childish sports, to make himself\nmerry, that he that should but consider his gravity on the one part, his\nfolly and lightness on the other, would surely say, there were two distinct\npersons in him.\" Now methinks he did well in it, though [3519]\nSalisburiensis be of opinion, that magistrates, senators, and grave men,\nshould not descend to lighter sports, _ne respublica ludere videatur_: but\nas Themistocles, still keep a stern and constant carriage. I commend Cosmo\nde Medici and Castruccius Castrucanus, than whom Italy never knew a\nworthier captain, another Alexander, if [3520]Machiavel do not deceive us\nin his life: \"when a friend of his reprehended him for dancing beside his\ndignity,\" (belike at some cushion dance) he told him again, _qui sapit\ninterdiu, vix unquam noctii desipit_, he that is wise in the day may dote a\nlittle in the night. Paulus Jovius relates as much of Pope Leo Decimus,\nthat he was a grave, discreet, staid man, yet sometimes most free, and too\nopen in his sports. And 'tis not altogether [3521]unfit or misbeseeming the\ngravity of such a man, if that decorum of time, place, and such\ncircumstances be observed. [3522]_Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem_--and\nas [3523]he said in an epigram to his wife, I would have every man say to\nhimself, or to his friend,\n\n       \"Moll, once in pleasant company by chance,\n        I wished that you for company would dance:\n        Which you refus'd, and said, your years require,\n        Now, matron-like, both manners and attire.\n        Well, Moll, if needs you will be matron-like,\n        Then trust to this, I will thee matron-like:\n        Yet so to you my love, may never lessen,\n        As you for church, house, bed, observe this lesson:\n        Sit in the church as solemn as a saint,\n        No deed, word, thought, your due devotion taint:\n        Veil, if you will, your head, your soul reveal\n        To him that only wounded souls can heal:\n        Be in my house as busy as a bee.\n        Having a sting for every one but me;\n        Buzzing in every corner, gath'ring honey:\n        Let nothing waste, that costs or yieldeth money.\n[3524]  And when thou seest my heart to mirth incline,\n        Thy tongue, wit, blood, warm with good cheer and wine:\n          Then of sweet sports let no occasion scape,\n          But be as wanton, toying as an ape.\"\n\nThose old [3525]Greeks had their _Lubentiam Deam_, goddess of pleasure, and\nthe Lacedaemonians, instructed from Lycurgus, did _Deo Risui sucrificare_,\nafter their wars especially, and in times of peace, which was used in\nThessaly, as it appears by that of [3526]Apuleius, who was made an\ninstrument of their laughter himself: [3527]\"Because laughter and merriment\nwas to season their labours and modester life.\" [3528]_Risus enim divum\natque; hominum est aeterna voluptas_. Princes use jesters, players, and\nhave those masters of revels in their courts. The Romans at every supper\n(for they had no solemn dinner) used music, gladiators, jesters, &c. as\n[3529]Suetonius relates of Tiberius, Dion of Commodus, and so did the\nGreeks. Besides music, in Xenophon's _Sympos._ _Philippus ridendi artifex_,\nPhilip, a jester, was brought to make sport. Paulus Jovius, in the eleventh\nbook of his history, hath a pretty digression of our English customs, which\nhowsoever some may misconstrue, I, for my part, will interpret to the best.\n[3530]\"The whole nation beyond all other mortal men, is most given to\nbanqueting and feasts; for they prolong them many hours together, with\ndainty cheer, exquisite music, and facete jesters, and afterwards they fall\na dancing and courting their mistresses, till it be late in the night.\"\nVolateran gives the same testimony of this island, commending our jovial\nmanner of entertainment and good mirth, and methinks he saith well, there\nis no harm in it; long may they use it, and all such modest sports. Ctesias\nreports of a Persian king, that had 150 maids attending at his table, to\nplay, sing, and dance by turns; and [3531]Lil. Geraldus of an Egyptian\nprince, that kept nine virgins still to wait upon him, and those of most\nexcellent feature, and sweet voices, which afterwards gave occasion to the\nGreeks of that fiction of the nine Muses. The king of Ethiopia in Africa,\nmost of our Asiatic princes have done so and do; those Sophies, Mogors,\nTurks, &c. solace themselves after supper amongst their queens and\nconcubines, _quae jucundioris oblectamenti causa_ ([3532]saith mine author)\n_coram rege psallere et saltare consueverant_, taking great pleasure to see\nand hear them sing and dance. This and many such means to exhilarate the\nheart of men, have been still practised in all ages, as knowing there is no\nbetter thing to the preservation of man's life. What shall I say, then, but\nto every melancholy man,\n\n[3533] \"Utere convivis, non tristibus utere amicis,\n        Quos nugae et risus, et joca salsa juvant.\"\n\n       \"Feast often, and use friends not still so sad,\n        Whose jests and merriments may make thee glad.\"\n\nUse honest and chaste sports, scenical shows, plays, games; [3534]\n_Accedant juvenumque Chori, mistaeque puellae_. And as Marsilius Ficinus\nconcludes an epistle to Bernard Canisianus, and some other of his friends,\nwill I this tract to all good students, [3535]\"Live merrily, O my friends,\nfree from cares, perplexity, anguish, grief of mind, live merrily,\"\n_laetitia caelum vos creavit_: [3536]\"Again and again I request you to be\nmerry, if anything trouble your hearts, or vex your souls, neglect and\ncontemn it,\" [3537]\"let it pass.\" [3538]\"And this I enjoin you, not as a\ndivine alone, but as a physician; for without this mirth, which is the life\nand quintessence of physic, medicines, and whatsoever is used and applied\nto prolong the life of man, is dull, dead, and of no force.\" _Dum fata\nsinunt, vivite laeti_ (Seneca), I say be merry.\n\n[3539] \"Nec lusibus virentem\n        Viduemus hanc juventam.\"\n\nIt was Tiresias the prophet's council to [3540]Menippus, that travelled all\nthe world over, even down to hell itself to seek content, and his last\nfarewell to Menippus, to be merry. [3541]\"Contemn the world\" (saith he)\n\"and count that is in it vanity and toys; this only covet all thy life\nlong; be not curious, or over solicitous in anything, but with a well\ncomposed and contented estate to enjoy thyself, and above all things to be\nmerry.\"\n\n[3542] \"Si Numerus uti censet sine amore jocisque,\n        Nil est jucundum, vivas in amore jocisque.\"\n\nNothing better (to conclude with Solomon, Eccles. iii. 22), \"than that a\nman should rejoice in his affairs.\" 'Tis the same advice which every\nphysician in this case rings to his patient, as Capivaccius to his, [3543]\n\"avoid overmuch study and perturbations of the mind, and as much as in thee\nlies live at heart's-ease:\" Prosper Calenus to that melancholy Cardinal\nCaesius, [3544]\"amidst thy serious studies and business, use jests and\nconceits, plays and toys, and whatsoever else may recreate thy mind.\"\nNothing better than mirth and merry company in this malady. [3545]\"It\nbegins with sorrow\" (saith Montanus), \"it must be expelled with hilarity.\"\n\nBut see the mischief; many men, knowing that merry company is the only\nmedicine against melancholy, will therefore neglect their business; and in\nanother extreme, spend all their days among good fellows in a tavern or an\nalehouse, and know not otherwise how to bestow their time but in drinking;\nmalt-worms, men-fishes, or water-snakes, [3546]_Qui bibunt solum ranarum\nmore, nihil comedentes_, like so many frogs in a puddle. 'Tis their sole\nexercise to eat, and drink; to sacrifice to Volupia, Rumina, Edulica,\nPotina, Mellona, is all their religion. They wish for Philoxenus' neck,\nJupiter's trinoctium, and that the sun would stand still as in Joshua's\ntime, to satisfy their lust, that they might _dies noctesque pergraecari et\nbibere_. Flourishing wits, and men of good parts, good fashion, and good\nworth, basely prostitute themselves to every rogue's company, to take\ntobacco and drink, to roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places.\n\n[3547] \"Invenies aliquem cum percussore jacentem,\n        Permistum nautis, aut furibus, aut fugitivis.\"\n\nWhich Thomas Erastus objects to Paracelsus, that he would be drinking all\nday long with carmen and tapsters in a brothel-house, is too frequent among\nus, with men of better note: like Timocreon of Rhodes, _multa bibens, et\nmulta vorans_, &c. They drown their wits, seethe their brains in ale,\nconsume their fortunes, lose their time, weaken their temperatures,\ncontract filthy diseases, rheums, dropsies, calentures, tremor, get swollen\njugulars, pimpled red faces, sore eyes, &c.; heat their livers, alter their\ncomplexions, spoil their stomachs, overthrow their bodies; for drink drowns\nmore than the sea and all the rivers that fall into it (mere funges and\ncasks), confound their souls, suppress reason, go from Scylla to Charybdis,\nand use that which is a help to their undoing. [3548]_Quid refert morbo an\nferro pereamve ruina_? [3549]When the Black Prince went to set the exiled\nking of Castile into his kingdom, there was a terrible battle fought\nbetween the English and the Spanish: at last the Spanish fled, the English\nfollowed them to the river side, where some drowned themselves to avoid\ntheir enemies, the rest were killed. Now tell me what difference is between\ndrowning and killing? As good be melancholy still, as drunken beasts and\nbeggars. Company a sole comfort, and an only remedy to all kind of\ndiscontent, is their sole misery and cause of perdition. As Hermione\nlamented in Euripides, _malae mulieres me fecerunt malam_. Evil company\nmarred her, may they justly complain, bad companions have been their bane.\nFor, [3550]_malus malum vult ut sit sui similis_; one drunkard in a\ncompany, one thief, one whoremaster, will by his goodwill make all the rest\nas bad as himself,\n\n[3551]  ------\"Et si\n        Nocturnos jures te formidare vapores,\"\n\nbe of what complexion you will, inclination, love or hate, be it good or\nbad, if you come amongst them, you must do as they do; yea, [3552]though it\nbe to the prejudice of your health, you must drink _venenum pro vino_. And\nso like grasshoppers, whilst they sing over their cups all summer, they\nstarve in winter; and for a little vain merriment shall find a sorrowful\nreckoning in the end.\n\n\nSECT. III. MEMB. I.\n_A Consolatory Digression, containing the Remedies of all manner of\nDiscontents_.\n\nBecause in the preceding section I have made mention of good counsel,\ncomfortable speeches, persuasion, how necessarily they are required to the\ncure of a discontented or troubled mind, how present a remedy they yield,\nand many times a sole sufficient cure of themselves; I have thought fit in\nthis following section, a little to digress (if at least it be to digress\nin this subject), to collect and glean a few remedies, and comfortable\nspeeches out of our best orators, philosophers, divines, and fathers of the\nchurch, tending to this purpose. I confess, many have copiously written of\nthis subject, Plato, Seneca, Plutarch, Xenophon, Epictetus, Theophrastus,\nXenocrates, Grantor, Lucian, Boethius: and some of late, Sadoletus, Cardan,\nBudaeus, Stella, Petrarch, Erasmus, besides Austin, Cyprian, Bernard, &c.\nAnd they so well, that as Hierome in like case said, _si nostrum areret\ningenium, de illorum posset fontibus irrigari_, if our barren wits were\ndried up, they might be copiously irrigated from those well-springs: and I\nshall but _actum agere_; yet because these tracts are not so obvious and\ncommon, I will epitomise, and briefly insert some of their divine precepts,\nreducing their voluminous and vast treatises to my small scale; for it were\notherwise impossible to bring so great vessels into so little a creek. And\nalthough (as Cardan said of his book _de consol._) [3553]\"I know\nbeforehand, this tract of mine many will contemn and reject; they that are\nfortunate, happy, and in flourishing estate, have no need of such\nconsolatory speeches; they that are miserable and unhappy, think them\ninsufficient to ease their grieved minds, and comfort their misery:\" yet I\nwill go on; for this must needs do some good to such as are happy, to bring\nthem to a moderation, and make them reflect and know themselves, by seeing\nthe inconstancy of human felicity, others' misery; and to such as are\ndistressed, if they will but attend and consider of this, it cannot choose\nbut give some content and comfort. [3554]\"'Tis true, no medicine can cure\nall diseases, some affections of the mind are altogether incurable; yet\nthese helps of art, physic, and philosophy must not be contemned.\" Arrianus\nand Plotinus are stiff in the contrary opinion, that such precepts can do\nlittle good. Boethius himself cannot comfort in some cases, they will\nreject such speeches like bread of stones, _Insana stultae mentis haec\nsolatia._ [3555]\n\n\"Words add no courage,\" which [3556]Catiline once said to his soldiers, \"a\ncaptain's oration doth not make a coward a valiant man:\" and as Job [3557]\nfeelingly said to his friends, \"you are but miserable comforters all.\" 'Tis\nto no purpose in that vulgar phrase to use a company of obsolete sentences,\nand familiar sayings: as [3558]Plinius Secundus, being now sorrowful and\nheavy for the departure of his dear friend Cornelius Rufus, a Roman\nsenator, wrote to his fellow Tiro in like case, _adhibe solatia, sed nova\naliqua, sed fortia, quae audierim nunquam, legerim nunquam: nam quae\naudivi, quae legi omnia, tanto dolore superantur_, either say something\nthat I never read nor heard of before, or else hold thy peace. Most men\nwill here except trivial consolations, ordinary speeches, and known\npersuasions in this behalf will be of small force; what can any man say\nthat hath not been said? To what end are such paraenetical discourses? you\nmay as soon remove Mount Caucasus, as alter some men's affections. Yet sure\nI think they cannot choose but do some good, and comfort and ease a little,\nthough it be the same again, I will say it, and upon that hope I will\nadventure. [3559]_Non meus hic sermo_, 'tis not my speech this, but of\nSeneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, Austin, Bernard, Christ and his Apostles. If I\nmake nothing, as [3560]Montaigne said in like case, I will mar nothing;\n'tis not my doctrine but my study, I hope I shall do nobody wrong to speak\nwhat I think, and deserve not blame in imparting my mind. If it be not for\nthy ease, it may for mine own; so Tully, Cardan, and Boethius wrote _de\nconsol_. as well to help themselves as others; be it as it may I will\nessay.\n\nDiscontents and grievances are either general or particular; general are\nwars, plagues, dearths, famine, fires, inundations, unseasonable weather,\nepidemical diseases which afflict whole kingdoms, territories, cities; or\npeculiar to private men, [3561]as cares, crosses, losses, death of friends,\npoverty, want, sickness, orbities, injuries, abuses, &c. Generally all\ndiscontent, [3562]_homines quatimur fortunae, salo_. No condition free,\n_quisque suos patimur manes_. Even in the midst of our mirth and jollity,\nthere is some grudging, some complaint; as [3563]he saith, our whole life\nis a glycypicron, a bitter sweet passion, honey and gall mixed together, we\nare all miserable and discontent, who can deny it? If all, and that it be a\ncommon calamity, an inevitable necessity, all distressed, then as Cardan\ninfers, [3564]\"who art thou that hopest to go free? Why dost thou not\ngrieve thou art a mortal man, and not governor of the world?\" _Ferre quam\nsortem patiuntur omnes, Nemo recuset_, [3565]\"If it be common to all, why\nshould one man be more disquieted than another?\" If thou alone wert\ndistressed, it were indeed more irksome, and less to be endured; but when\nthe calamity is common, comfort thyself with this, thou hast more fellows,\n_Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris_; 'tis not thy sole case, and why\nshouldst thou be so impatient? [3566]\"Aye, but alas we are more miserable\nthan others, what shall we do? Besides private miseries, we live in\nperpetual fear and danger of common enemies: we have Bellona's whips, and\npitiful outcries, for epithalamiums; for pleasant music, that fearful noise\nof ordnance, drums, and warlike trumpets still sounding in our ears;\ninstead of nuptial torches, we have firing of towns and cities; for\ntriumphs, lamentations; for joy, tears.\" [3567]\"So it is, and so it was,\nand so it ever will be. He that refuseth to see and hear, to suffer this,\nis not fit to live in this world, and knows not the common condition of all\nmen, to whom so long as they live, with a reciprocal course, joys and\nsorrows are annexed, and succeed one another.\" It is inevitable, it may not\nbe avoided, and why then shouldst thou be so much troubled? _Grave nihil\nest homini quod fert necessitas_, as [3568]Tully deems out of an old poet,\n\"that which is necessary cannot be grievous.\" If it be so, then comfort\nthyself in this, [3569]\"that whether thou wilt or no, it must be endured:\"\nmake a virtue of necessity, and conform thyself to undergo it. [3570]_Si\nlonga est, levis est; si gravis est, brevis est._ If it be long, 'tis\nlight; if grievous, it cannot last. It will away, _dies dolorem minuit_,\nand if nought else, time will wear it out; custom will ease it; [3571]\noblivion is a common medicine for all losses, injuries, griefs, and\ndetriments whatsoever, [3572]\"and when they are once past, this commodity\ncomes of infelicity, it makes the rest of our life sweeter unto us:\" [3573]\n_Atque haec olim meminisse juvabit_, \"recollection of the past is\npleasant:\" \"the privation and want of a thing many times makes it more\npleasant and delightsome than before it was.\" We must not think the\nhappiest of us all to escape here without some misfortunes,\n\n[3574]  ------\"Usque adeo nulla est sincera voluptas,\n        Solicitumque aliquid laetis intervenit.\"------\n\nHeaven and earth are much unlike: [3575]\"Those heavenly bodies indeed are\nfreely carried in their orbs without any impediment or interruption, to\ncontinue their course for innumerable ages, and make their conversions: but\nmen are urged with many difficulties, and have diverse hindrances,\noppositions still crossing, interrupting their endeavours and desires, and\nno mortal man is free from this law of nature.\" We must not therefore hope\nto have all things answer our own expectation, to have a continuance of\ngood success and fortunes, _Fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona_. And as\nMinutius Felix, the Roman consul, told that insulting Coriolanus, drunk\nwith his good fortunes, look not for that success thou hast hitherto had;\n[3576]\"It never yet happened to any man since the beginning of the world,\nnor ever will, to have all things according to his desire, or to whom\nfortune was never opposite and adverse.\" Even so it fell out to him as he\nforetold. And so to others, even to that happiness of Augustus; though he\nwere Jupiter's almoner, Pluto's treasurer, Neptune's admiral, it could not\nsecure him. Such was Alcibiades's fortune, Narsetes, that great Gonsalvus,\nand most famous men's, that as [3577]Jovius concludes, \"it is almost fatal\nto great princes, through their own default or otherwise circumvented with\nenvy and malice, to lose their honours, and die contumeliously.\" 'Tis so,\nstill hath been, and ever will be, _Nihil est ab omni parte beatum_,\n\n       \"There's no perfection is so absolute,\n        That some impurity doth not pollute.\"\n\nWhatsoever is under the moon is subject to corruption, alteration; and so\nlong as thou livest upon earth look not for other. [3578]\"Thou shalt not\nhere find peaceable and cheerful days, quiet times, but rather clouds,\nstorms, calumnies, such is our fate.\" And as those errant planets in their\ndistinct orbs have their several motions, sometimes direct, stationary,\nretrograde, in apogee, perigee, oriental, occidental, combust, feral, free,\nand as our astrologers will, have their fortitudes and debilities, by\nreason of those good and bad irradiations, conferred to each other's site\nin the heavens, in their terms, houses, case, detriments, &c. So we rise\nand fall in this world, ebb and flow, in and out, reared and dejected, lead\na troublesome life, subject to many accidents and casualties of fortunes,\nvariety of passions, infirmities as well from ourselves as others.\n\nYea, but thou thinkest thou art more miserable than the rest, other men are\nhappy but in respect of thee, their miseries are but flea-bitings to thine,\nthou alone art unhappy, none so bad as thyself. Yet if, as Socrates said,\n[3579]\"All men in the world should come and bring their grievances\ntogether, of body, mind, fortune, sores, ulcers, madness, epilepsies,\nagues, and all those common calamities of beggary, want, servitude,\nimprisonment, and lay them on a heap to be equally divided, wouldst thou\nshare alike, and take thy portion? or be as thou art? Without question thou\nwouldst be as thou art.\" If some Jupiter should say, to give us all\ncontent,\n\n[3580] \"Jam faciam quod vultis; eris tu, qui modo miles,\n        Mercator; tu consultus modo, rusticus; hinc vos,\n        Vos hinc mutatis discedite partibus; eia\n        Quid slatis? nolint.\"\n\n       \"Well be't so then; you master soldier\n        Shall be a merchant; you sir lawyer\n        A country gentlemen; go you to this,\n        That side you; why stand ye? it's well as 'tis.\"\n\n[3581]\"Every man knows his own, but not others' defects and miseries; and\n'tis the nature of all men still to reflect upon themselves, their own\nmisfortunes,\" not to examine or consider other men's, not to compare\nthemselves with others: To recount their miseries, but not their good\ngifts, fortunes, benefits, which they have, or ruminate on their adversity,\nbut not once to think on their prosperity, not what they have, but what\nthey want: to look still on them that go before, but not on those infinite\nnumbers that come after. [3582]\"Whereas many a man would think himself in\nheaven, a pretty prince, if he had but the least part of that fortune which\nthou so much repinest at, abhorrest and accountest a most vile and wretched\nestate.\" How many thousands want that which thou hast? how many myriads of\npoor slaves, captives, of such as work day and night in coal-pits,\ntin-mines, with sore toil to maintain a poor living, of such as labour in\nbody and mind, live in extreme anguish, and pain, all which thou art free\nfrom? _O fortunatos nimium bona si sua norint_: Thou art most happy if thou\ncouldst be content, and acknowledge thy happiness; [3583]_Rem carendo, non\nfruendo cognoscimus_, when thou shalt hereafter come to want that which\nthou now loathest, abhorrest, and art weary of, and tired with, when 'tis\npast thou wilt say thou wert most happy: and after a little miss, wish with\nall thine heart thou hadst the same content again, mightst lead but such a\nlife, a world for such a life: the remembrance of it is pleasant. Be silent\nthen, [3584]rest satisfied, _desine, intuensque in aliorum infortunia\nsolare mentem_, comfort thyself with other men's misfortunes, and as the\nmouldwarp in Aesop told the fox, complaining for want of a tail, and the\nrest of his companions, _tacete, quando me occulis captum videtis_, you\ncomplain of toys, but I am blind, be quiet. I say to thee be thou\nsatisfied. It is [3585]recorded of the hares, that with a general consent\nthey went to drown themselves, out of a feeling of their misery; but when\nthey saw a company of frogs more fearful than they were, they began to take\ncourage, and comfort again. Compare thine estate with others. _Similes\naliorum respice casus, mitius ista feres_. Be content and rest satisfied,\nfor thou art well in respect to others: be thankful for that thou hast,\nthat God hath done for thee, he hath not made thee a monster, a beast, a\nbase creature, as he might, but a man, a Christian, such a man; consider\naright of it, thou art full well as thou art. [3586]_Quicquid vult habere\nnemo potest_, no man can have what he will, _Illud potest nolle quod non\nhabet_, he may choose whether he will desire that which he hath not. Thy\nlot is fallen, make the best of it. [3587]\"If we should all sleep at all\ntimes,\" (as Endymion is said to have done) \"who then were happier than his\nfellow?\" Our life is but short, a very dream, and while we look about\n[3588]_immortalitas adest_, eternity is at hand: [3589]\"Our life is a\npilgrimage on earth, which wise men pass with great alacrity.\" If thou be\nin woe, sorrow, want, distress, in pain, or sickness, think of that of our\napostle, \"God chastiseth them whom he loveth: they that sow in tears, shall\nreap in joy,\" Psal. cxxvi. 6. \"As the furnace proveth the potter's vessel,\nso doth temptation try men's thoughts,\" Eccl. xxv. 5, 'tis for [3590]thy\ngood, _Periisses nisi periisses_: hadst thou not been so visited, thou\nhadst been utterly undone: \"as gold in the fire,\" so men are tried in\nadversity. _Tribulatio ditut_: and which Camerarius hath well shadowed in\nan emblem of a thresher and corn,\n\n       \"Si tritura absit paleis sunt abdita grana,\n        Nos crux mundanis separat a paleis:\"\n\n       \"As threshing separates from straw the corn,\n        By crosses from the world's chaff are we born.\"\n\n'Tis the very same which [3591]Chrysostom comments, _hom. 2. in 3 Mat._\n\"Corn is not separated but by threshing, nor men from worldly impediments\nbut by tribulation.\" 'Tis that which [3592]Cyprian ingeminates, _Ser. 4. de\nimmort._ 'Tis that which [3593]Hierom, which all the fathers inculcate, \"so\nwe are catechised for eternity.\" 'Tis that which the proverb insinuates.\n_Nocumentum documentum_; 'tis that which all the world rings in our ears.\n_Deus unicum habet filium sine peccato, nullum sine flagello_: God, saith\n[3594]Austin, hath one son without sin, none without correction. [3595]\"An\nexpert seaman is tried in a tempest, a runner in a race, a captain in a\nbattle, a valiant man in adversity, a Christian in tentation and misery.\"\n_Basil, hom. 8._ We are sent as so many soldiers into this world, to strive\nwith it, the flesh, the devil; our life is a warfare, and who knows it not?\n[3596]_Non est ad astra mollis e terris via_: [3597]\"and therefore\nperadventure this world here is made troublesome unto us,\" that, as Gregory\nnotes, \"we should not be delighted by the way, and forget whither we are\ngoing.\"\n\n[3598] \"Ite nunc fortes, ubi celsa magni\n        Ducit exempli via, cur inertis\n        Terga nudatis? superata tellus\n                Sidera donat.\"\n\nGo on then merrily to heaven. If the way be troublesome, and you in misery,\nin many grievances: on the other side you have many pleasant sports,\nobjects, sweet smells, delightsome tastes, music, meats, herbs, flowers,\n&c. to recreate your senses. Or put case thou art now forsaken of the\nworld, dejected, contemned, yet comfort thyself, as it was said to Agar in\nthe wilderness, [3599]\"God sees thee, he takes notice of thee:\" there is a\nGod above that can vindicate thy cause, that can relieve thee. And surely\n[3600]Seneca thinks he takes delight in seeing thee. \"The gods are well\npleased when they see great men contending with adversity,\" as we are to\nsee men fight, or a man with a beast. But these are toys in respect, [3601]\n\"Behold,\" saith he, \"a spectacle worthy of God; a good man contented with\nhis estate.\" A tyrant is the best sacrifice to Jupiter, as the ancients\nheld, and his best object \"a contented mind.\" For thy part then rest\nsatisfied, \"cast all thy care on him, thy burthen on him,\" [3602]\"rely on\nhim, trust on him, and he shall nourish thee, care for thee, give thee\nthine heart's desire;\" say with David, \"God is our hope and strength, in\ntroubles ready to be found,\" Psal. xlvi. 1. \"for they that trust in the\nLord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed,\" Psal. cxxiv. 1. 2.\n\"as the mountains are about Jerusalem, so is the Lord about his people,\nfrom henceforth and for ever.\"\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n_Deformity of body, sickness, baseness of birth, peculiar discontents_.\n\nParticular discontents and grievances, are either of body, mind, or\nfortune, which as they wound the soul of man, produce this melancholy, and\nmany great inconveniences, by that antidote of good counsel and persuasion\nmay be eased or expelled. Deformities and imperfections of our bodies, as\nlameness, crookedness, deafness, blindness, be they innate or accidental,\ntorture many men: yet this may comfort them, that those imperfections of\nthe body do not a whit blemish the soul, or hinder the operations of it,\nbut rather help and much increase it. Thou art lame of body, deformed to\nthe eye, yet this hinders not but that thou mayst be a good, a wise,\nupright, honest man. [3603]\"Seldom,\" saith Plutarch, \"honesty and beauty\ndwell together,\" and oftentimes under a threadbare coat lies an excellent\nunderstanding, _saepe sub attrita latitat sapientia veste_. [3604]Cornelius\nMussus, that famous preacher in Italy, when he came first into the pulpit\nin Venice, was so much contemned by reason of his outside, a little lean,\npoor, dejected person, [3605]they were all ready to leave the church; but\nwhen they heard his voice they did admire him, and happy was that senator\ncould enjoy his company, or invite him first to his house. A silly fellow\nto look to, may have more wit, learning, honesty, than he that struts it\nout _Ampullis jactans, &c. grandia gradiens_, and is admired in the world's\nopinion: _Vilis saepe cadus nobile nectar habet_, the best wine comes out\nof an old vessel. How many deformed princes, kings, emperors, could I\nreckon up, philosophers, orators? Hannibal had but one eye, Appius\nClaudius, Timoleon, blind, Muleasse, king of Tunis, John, king of Bohemia,\nand Tiresias the prophet. [3606]\"The night hath his pleasure;\" and for the\nloss of that one sense such men are commonly recompensed in the rest; they\nhave excellent memories, other good parts, music, and many recreations;\nmuch happiness, great wisdom, as Tully well discourseth in his [3607]\nTusculan questions: Homer was blind, yet who (saith he) made more accurate,\nlively, or better descriptions, with both his eyes? Democritus was blind,\nyet as Laertius writes of him, he saw more than all Greece besides, as\n[3608]Plato concludes, _Tum sane mentis oculus acute incipit cernere, quum\nprimum corporis oculus deflorescit_, when our bodily eyes are at worst,\ngenerally the eyes of our soul see best. Some philosophers and divines have\nevirated themselves, and put out their eyes voluntarily, the better to\ncontemplate. Angelus Politianus had a tetter in his nose continually\nrunning, fulsome in company, yet no man so eloquent and pleasing in his\nworks. Aesop was crooked, Socrates purblind, long-legged, hairy; Democritus\nwithered, Seneca lean and harsh, ugly to behold, yet show me so many\nflourishing wits, such divine spirits: Horace a little blear-eyed\ncontemptible fellow, yet who so sententious and wise? Marcilius Picinus,\nFaber Stapulensis, a couple of dwarfs, [3609]Melancthon a short\nhard-favoured man, _parvus erat, sed magnus erat_, &c., yet of incomparable\nparts all three. [3610]Ignatius Loyola the founder of the Jesuits, by\nreason of a hurt he received in his leg, at the siege of Pampeluna, the\nchief town of Navarre in Spain, unfit for wars and less serviceable at\ncourt, upon that accident betook himself to his beads, and by those means\ngot more honour than ever he should have done with the use of his limbs,\nand properness of person: [3611]_Vulnus non penetrat animum_, a wound hurts\nnot the soul. Galba the emperor was crook-backed, Epictetus lame: that\ngreat Alexander a little man of stature, [3612]Augustus Caesar of the same\npitch: Agesilaus _despicabili forma_; Boccharis a most deformed prince as\never Egypt had, yet as [3613]Diodorus Siculus records of him, in wisdom and\nknowledge far beyond his predecessors. _A. Dom._ 1306. [3614] Uladeslaus\nCubitalis that pigmy king of Poland reigned and fought more victorious\nbattles than any of his long-shanked predecessors. _Nullam virtus respuit\nstaturam_, virtue refuseth no stature, and commonly your great vast bodies,\nand fine features, are sottish, dull, and leaden spirits. What's in them?\n[3615]_Quid nisi pondus iners stolidaeque ferocia memtis_, What in Osus and\nEphialtes (Neptune's sons in Homer), nine acres long?\n\n[3616] \"Qui ut magnus Orion,\n        Cum pedes incedit, medii per maxima Nerei\n        Stagna, viam findens humero supereminet undas.\"\n\n       \"Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood:\n        When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,\n        His shoulder scarce the topmost billow laves.\"\n\nWhat in Maximinus, Ajax, Caligula, and the rest of those great Zanzummins,\nor gigantical Anakims, heavy, vast, barbarous lubbers?\n\n[3617]  ------\"si membra tibi dant grandia Parcae,\n        Mentis eges?\"\n\nTheir body, saith [3618]Lemnius, \"is a burden to them, and their spirits\nnot so lively, nor they so erect and merry:\" _Non est in magno corpore mica\nsalis_: a little diamond is more worth than a rocky mountain: which made\nAlexander Aphrodiseus positively conclude, \"The lesser, the [3619]wiser,\nbecause the soul was more contracted in such a body.\" Let Bodine in his _5.\nc. method, hist._ plead the rest; the lesser they are, as in Asia, Greece,\nthey have generally the finest wits. And for bodily stature which some so\nmuch admire, and goodly presence, 'tis true, to say the best of them, great\nmen are proper, and tall, I grant,--_caput inter nubila condunt_, (hide\ntheir heads in the clouds); but _belli pusilli_ little men are pretty: _Sed\nsi bellus homo est Cotta, pusillus homo est_. Sickness, diseases, trouble\nmany, but without a cause; [3620]\"It may be 'tis for the good of their\nsouls:\" _Pars fati fuit_, the flesh rebels against the spirit; that which\nhurts the one, must needs help the other. Sickness is the mother of\nmodesty, putteth us in mind of our mortality; and when we are in the full\ncareer of worldly pomp and jollity, she pulleth us by the ear, and maketh\nus know ourselves. [3621]Pliny calls it, the sum of philosophy, \"If we\ncould but perform that in our health, which we promise in our sickness.\"\n_Quum infirmi sumus, optimi sumus_; [3622]for what sick man (as [3623]\nSecundus expostulates with Rufus) was ever \"lascivious, covetous, or\nambitious? he envies no man, admires no man, flatters no man, despiseth no\nman, listens not after lies and tales,\" &c. And were it not for such gentle\nremembrances, men would have no moderation of themselves, they would be\nworse than tigers, wolves, and lions: who should keep them in awe?\n\"princes, masters, parents, magistrates, judges, friends, enemies, fair or\nfoul means cannot contain us, but a little sickness,\" (as [3624]Chrysostom\nobserves) \"will correct and amend us.\" And therefore with good discretion,\n[3625]Jovianus Pontanus caused this short sentence to be engraven on his\ntomb in Naples: \"Labour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want and woe, to serve\nproud masters, bear that superstitious yoke, and bury your clearest\nfriends, &c., are the sauces of our life.\" If thy disease be continuate and\npainful to thee, it will not surely last: \"and a light affliction, which is\nbut for a moment, causeth unto us a far more excellent and eternal weight\nof glory,\" 2 Cor. iv. 17. bear it with patience; women endure much sorrow\nin childbed, and yet they will not contain; and those that are barren, wish\nfor this pain; \"be courageous, [3626]there is as much valour to be shown in\nthy bed, as in an army, or at a sea fight:\" _aut vincetur, aut vincet_,\nthou shalt be rid at last. In the mean time, let it take its course, thy\nmind is not any way disabled. Bilibaldus Pirkimerus, senator to Charles the\nFifth, ruled all Germany, lying most part of his days sick of the gout upon\nhis bed. The more violent thy torture is, the less it will continue: and\nthough it be severe and hideous for the time, comfort thyself as martyrs\ndo, with honour and immortality. [3627]That famous philosopher Epicurus,\nbeing in as miserable pain of stone and colic, as a man might endure,\nsolaced himself with a conceit of immortality; \"the joy of his soul for his\nrare inventions, repelled the pain of his bodily torments.\"\n\nBaseness of birth is a great disparagement to some men, especially if they\nbe wealthy, bear office, and come to promotion in a commonwealth; then (as\n[3628]he observes) if their birth be not answerable to their calling, and\nto their fellows, they are much abashed and ashamed of themselves. Some\nscorn their own father and mother, deny brothers and sisters, with the rest\nof their kindred and friends, and will not suffer them to come near them,\nwhen they are in their pomp, accounting it a scandal to their greatness to\nhave such beggarly beginnings. Simon in Lucian, having now got a little\nwealth, changed his name from Simon to Simonides, for that there were so\nmany beggars of his kin, and set the house on fire where he was born,\nbecause no body should point at it. Others buy titles, coats of arms, and\nby all means screw themselves into ancient families, falsifying pedigrees,\nusurping scutcheons, and all because they would not seem to be base. The\nreason is, for that this gentility is so much admired by a company of\noutsides, and such honour attributed unto it, as amongst [3629]Germans,\nFrenchmen, and Venetians, the gentry scorn the commonalty, and will not\nsuffer them to match with them; they depress, and make them as so many\nasses, to carry burdens. In our ordinary talk and fallings out, the most\nopprobrious and scurrile name we can fasten upon a man, or first give, is\nto call him base rogue, beggarly rascal, and the like: Whereas in my\njudgment, this ought of all other grievances to trouble men least. Of all\nvanities and fopperies, to brag of gentility is the greatest; for what is\nit they crack so much of, and challenge such superiority, as if they were\ndemigods? Birth? _Tantane vos generis tenuit fiducia vestri_? [3630]It is\n_non ens_, a mere flash, a ceremony, a toy, a thing of nought. Consider the\nbeginning, present estate, progress, ending of gentry, and then tell me\nwhat it is. [3631]\"Oppression, fraud, cozening, usury, knavery, bawdry,\nmurder, and tyranny, are the beginning of many ancient families:\"\n[3632]\"one hath been a bloodsucker, a parricide, the death of many a silly\nsoul in some unjust quarrels, seditions, made many an orphan and poor\nwidow, and for that he is made a lord or an earl, and his posterity\ngentlemen for ever after. Another hath been a bawd, a pander to some great\nmen, a parasite, a slave,\" [3633]\"prostituted himself, his wife, daughter,\"\nto some lascivious prince, and for that he is exalted. Tiberius preferred\nmany to honours in his time, because they were famous whoremasters and\nsturdy drinkers; many come into this parchment-row (so [3634]one calls it)\nby flattery or cozening; search your old families, and you shall scarce\nfind of a multitude (as Aeneas Sylvius observes) _qui sceleratum non habent\nortum_, that have not a wicked beginning; _aut qui vi et dolo eo fastigii\nnon ascendunt_, as that plebeian in [3635]Machiavel in a set oration proved\nto his fellows, that do not rise by knavery, force, foolery, villainy, or\nsuch indirect means. \"They are commonly able that are wealthy; virtue and\nriches seldom settle on one man: who then sees not the beginning of\nnobility? spoils enrich one, usury another, treason a third, witchcraft a\nfourth, flattery a fifth, lying, stealing, bearing false witness a sixth,\nadultery the seventh,\" &c. One makes a fool of himself to make his lord\nmerry, another dandles my young master, bestows a little nag on him, a\nthird marries a cracked piece, &c. Now may it please your good worship,\nyour lordship, who was the first founder of your family? The poet answers,\n[3636]_Aut Pastor fuit, aut illud quod dicere nolo._ Are he or you the\nbetter gentleman? If he, then we have traced him to his form. If you, what\nis it of which thou boastest so much? That thou art his son. It may be his\nheir, his reputed son, and yet indeed a priest or a serving man may be the\ntrue father of him; but we will not controvert that now; married women are\nall honest; thou art his son's son's son, begotten and born _infra quatuor\nmaria_, &c. Thy great great great grandfather was a rich citizen, and then\nin all likelihood a usurer, a lawyer, and then a--a courtier, and then a--a\ncountry gentleman, and then he scraped it out of sheep, &c. And you are the\nheir of all his virtues, fortunes, titles; so then, what is your gentry,\nbut as Hierom saith, _Opes antiquae, inveteratae divitiae_, ancient wealth?\nthat is the definition of gentility. The father goes often to the devil, to\nmake his son a gentleman. For the present, what is it? \"It began\" (saith\n[3637]Agrippa) \"with strong impiety, with tyranny, oppression,\" &c. and so\nit is maintained: wealth began it (no matter how got), wealth continueth\nand increaseth it. Those Roman knights were so called, if they could\ndispend _per annum_ so much. [3638]In the kingdom of Naples and France, he\nthat buys such lands, buys the honour, title, barony, together with it; and\nthey that can dispend so much amongst us, must be called to bear office, to\nbe knights, or fine for it, as one observes, [3639]_nobiliorum ex censu\njudicant_, our nobles are measured by their means. And what now is the\nobject of honour? What maintains our gentry but wealth? [3640]_Nobilitas\nsine re projecta vilior alga._ Without means gentry is naught worth,\nnothing so contemptible and base. [3641]_Disputare de nobilitate generis,\nsine divitiis, est disputare de nobilitate stercoris_, saith Nevisanus the\nlawyer, to dispute of gentry without wealth, is (saving your reverence) to\ndiscuss the original of a merd. So that it is wealth alone that\ndenominates, money which maintains it, gives _esse_ to it, for which every\nman may have it. And what is their ordinary exercise? [3642]\"sit to eat,\ndrink, lie down to sleep, and rise to play:\" wherein lies their worth and\nsufficiency? in a few coats of arms, eagles, lions, serpents, bears,\ntigers, dogs, crosses, bends, fesses, &c., and such like baubles, which\nthey commonly set up in their galleries, porches, windows, on bowls,\nplatters, coaches, in tombs, churches, men's sleeves, &c. [3643]\"If he can\nhawk and hunt, ride a horse, play at cards and dice, swagger, drink,\nswear,\" take tobacco with a grace, sing, dance, wear his clothes in\nfashion, court and please his mistress, talk big fustian, [3644]insult,\nscorn, strut, contemn others, and use a little mimical and apish compliment\nabove the rest, he is a complete, (_Egregiam vero laudem_) a well-qualified\ngentleman; these are most of their employments, this their greatest\ncommendation. What is gentry, this parchment nobility then, but as [3645]\nAgrippa defines it, \"a sanctuary of knavery and naughtiness, a cloak for\nwickedness and execrable vices, of pride, fraud, contempt, boasting,\noppression, dissimulation, lust, gluttony, malice, fornication, adultery,\nignorance, impiety?\" A nobleman therefore in some likelihood, as he\nconcludes, is an \"atheist, an oppressor, an epicure, a [3646]gull, a\ndizzard, an illiterate idiot, an outside, a glowworm, a proud fool, an\narrant ass,\" _Ventris et inguinis mancipium_, a slave to his lust and\nbelly, _solaque libidine fortis_. And as Salvianus observed of his\ncountrymen the Aquitanes in France, _sicut titulis primi fuere, sic et\nvitiis_ (as they were the first in rank so also in rottenness); and Cabinet\ndu Roy, their own writer, distinctly of the rest. \"The nobles of Berry are\nmost part lechers, they of Touraine thieves, they of Narbonne covetous,\nthey of Guienne coiners, they of Provence atheists, they of Rheims\nsuperstitious, they of Lyons treacherous, of Normandy proud, of Picardy\ninsolent,\" &c. We may generally conclude, the greater men, the more\nvicious. In fine, as [3647]Aeneas Sylvius adds, \"they are most part\nmiserable, sottish, and filthy fellows, like the walls of their houses,\nfair without, foul within.\" What dost thou vaunt of now? [3648]\"What dost\nthou gape and wonder at? admire him for his brave apparel, horses, dogs,\nfine houses, manors, orchards, gardens, walks? Why? a fool may be possessor\nof this as well as he; and he that accounts him a better man, a nobleman\nfor having of it, he is a fool himself.\" Now go and brag of thy gentility.\nThis is it belike which makes the [3649]Turks at this day scorn nobility,\nand all those huffing bombast titles, which so much elevate their poles:\nexcept it be such as have got it at first, maintain it by some supereminent\nquality, or excellent worth. And for this cause, the Ragusian commonwealth,\nSwitzers, and the united provinces, in all their aristocracies, or\ndemocratical monarchies, (if I may so call them,) exclude all these degrees\nof hereditary honours, and will admit of none to bear office, but such as\nare learned, like those Athenian Areopagites, wise, discreet, and well\nbrought up. The [3650]Chinese observe the same customs, no man amongst them\nnoble by birth; out of their philosophers and doctors they choose\nmagistrates: their politic nobles are taken from such as be _moraliter\nnobiles_ virtuous noble; _nobilitas ut olim ab officio, non a natura_, as\nin Israel of old, and their office was to defend and govern their country\nin war and peace, not to hawk, hunt, eat, drink, game alone, as too many\ndo. Their Loysii, Mandarini, literati, licentiati, and such as have raised\nthemselves by their worth, are their noblemen only, though fit to govern a\nstate: and why then should any that is otherwise of worth be ashamed of his\nbirth? why should not he be as much respected that leaves a noble\nposterity, as he that hath had noble ancestors? nay why not more? for\n_plures solem orientem_ we adore the sun rising most part; and how much\nbetter is it to say, _Ego meis majoribus virtute praeluxi_, (I have\noutshone my ancestors in virtues), to boast himself of his virtues, than of\nhis birth? Cathesbeius, sultan of Egypt and Syria, was by his condition a\nslave, but for worth, valour, and manhood second to no king, and for that\ncause (as, [3651]Jovius writes) elected emperor of the Mamelukes. That poor\nSpanish Pizarro for his valour made by Charles the fifth marquess of\nAnatillo; the Turkey Pashas are all such. Pertinax, Philippus Arabs,\nMaximinus, Probus, Aurelius, &c., from common soldiers, became emperors,\nCato, Cincinnatus, &c. consuls. Pius Secundus, Sixtus Quintus, Johan,\nSecundus, Nicholas Quintus, &c. popes. Socrates, Virgil, Horace, _libertino\nparte natus_. [3652]The kings of Denmark fetch their pedigree, as some say,\nfrom one Ulfo, that was the son of a bear. [3653]_E tenui casa saepe vir\nmagnus exit_, many a worthy man comes out of a poor cottage. Hercules,\nRomulus, Alexander (by Olympia's confession), Themistocles, Jugurtha, King\nArthur, William the Conqueror, Homer, Demosthenes, P. Lumbard, P. Comestor,\nBartholus, Adrian the fourth Pope, &c., bastards; and almost in every\nkingdom, the most ancient families have been at first princes' bastards:\ntheir worthiest captains, best wits, greatest scholars, bravest spirits in\nall our annals, have been base. [3654]Cardan, in his subtleties, gives a\nreason why they are most part better able than others in body and mind, and\nso, _per consequens_, more fortunate. Castruccius Castrucanus, a poor\nchild, found in the field, exposed to misery, became prince of Lucca and\nSenes in Italy, a most complete soldier and worthy captain; Machiavel\ncompares him to Scipio or Alexander. \"And 'tis a wonderful thing\" ([3655]\nsaith he) \"to him that shall consider of it, that all those, or the\ngreatest part of them, that have done the bravest exploits here upon earth,\nand excelled the rest of the nobles of their time, have been still born in\nsome abject, obscure place, or of base and obscure abject parents.\" A most\nmemorable observation, [3656]Scaliger accounts it, _et non praetereundum,\nmaximorum virorum plerosque patres ignoratos, matres impudicas fuisse_.\n[3657]\"I could recite a great catalogue of them,\" every kingdom, every\nprovince will yield innumerable examples: and why then should baseness of\nbirth be objected to any man? Who thinks worse of Tully for being\n_arpinas_, an upstart? Or Agathocles, that Silician king, for being a\npotter's son? Iphicrates and Marius were meanly born. What wise man thinks\nbetter of any person for his nobility? as he said in [3658]Machiavel,\n_omnes eodem patre nati_, Adam's sons, conceived all and born in sin, &c.\n\"We are by nature all as one, all alike, if you see us naked; let us wear\ntheirs and they our clothes, and what is the difference?\" To speak truth,\nas [3659]Bale did of P. Schalichius, \"I more esteem thy worth, learning,\nhonesty, than thy nobility; honour thee more that thou art a writer, a\ndoctor of divinity, than Earl of the Huns, Baron of Skradine, or hast title\nto such and such provinces,\" &c. \"Thou art more fortunate and great\" (so\n[3660]Jovius writes to Cosmo de Medici, then Duke of Florence) \"for thy\nvirtues, than for thy lovely wife, and happy children, friends, fortunes,\nor great duchy of Tuscany.\" So I account thee; and who doth not so indeed?\n[3661]Abdolominus was a gardener, and yet by Alexander for his virtues made\nKing of Syria. How much better is it to be born of mean parentage, and to\nexcel in worth, to be morally noble, which is preferred before that natural\nnobility, by divines, philosophers, and [3662]politicians, to be learned,\nhonest, discreet, well-qualified, to be fit for any manner of employment,\nin country and commonwealth, war and peace, than to be _Degeneres\nNeoptolemi_, as many brave nobles are, only wise because rich, otherwise\nidiots, illiterate, unfit for any manner of service? [3663] Udalricus, Earl\nof Cilia, upbraided John Huniades with the baseness of his birth, but he\nreplied, _in te Ciliensis comitatus turpiter extinguitur, in me gloriose\nBistricensis exoritur_, thine earldom is consumed with riot, mine begins\nwith honour and renown. Thou hast had so many noble ancestors; what is that\nto thee? _Vix ea nostra voco_, [3664]when thou art a dizzard thyself: _quod\nprodest, Pontice, longo stemmate censeri_? &c. I conclude, hast thou a\nsound body, and a good soul, good bringing up? Art thou virtuous, honest,\nlearned, well-qualified, religious, are thy conditions good?--thou art a\ntrue nobleman, perfectly noble, although born of Thersites--_dum modo tu\nsis--Aeacidae similis, non natus, sed factus_, noble [Greek: kat'\nexochaen], [3665]\"for neither sword, nor fire, nor water, nor sickness, nor\noutward violence, nor the devil himself can take thy good parts from thee.\"\nBe not ashamed of thy birth then, thou art a gentleman all the world over,\nand shalt be honoured, when as he, strip him of his fine clothes,\n[3666]dispossess him of his wealth, is a funge (which [3667] Polynices in\nhis banishment found true by experience, gentry was not esteemed) like a\npiece of coin in another country, that no man will take, and shall be\ncontemned. Once more, though thou be a barbarian, born at Tontonteac, a\nvillain, a slave, a Saldanian Negro, or a rude Virginian in Dasamonquepec,\nhe a French monsieur, a Spanish don, a signor of Italy, I care not how\ndescended, of what family, of what order, baron, count, prince, if thou be\nwell qualified, and he not, but a degenerate Neoptolemus, I tell thee in a\nword, thou art a man, and he is a beast.\n\nLet no _terrae filius_, or upstart, insult at this which I have said, no\nworthy gentleman take offence. I speak it not to detract from such as are\nwell deserving, truly virtuous and noble: I do much respect and honour true\ngentry and nobility; I was born of worshipful parents myself, in an ancient\nfamily, but I am a younger brother, it concerns me not: or had I been some\ngreat heir, richly endowed, so minded as I am, I should not have been\nelevated at all, but so esteemed of it, as of all other human happiness,\nhonours, &c., they have their period, are brittle and inconstant. As [3668]\nhe said of that great river Danube, it riseth from a small fountain, a\nlittle brook at first, sometimes broad, sometimes narrow, now slow, then\nswift, increased at last to an incredible greatness by the confluence of\nsixty navigable rivers, it vanisheth in conclusion, loseth his name, and is\nsuddenly swallowed up of the Euxine sea: I may say of our greatest\nfamilies, they were mean at first, augmented by rich marriages, purchases,\noffices, they continue for some ages, with some little alteration of\ncircumstances, fortunes, places, &c., by some prodigal son, for some\ndefault, or for want of issue they are defaced in an instant, and their\nmemory blotted out.\n\nSo much in the mean time I do attribute to Gentility, that if he be\nwell-descended, of worshipful or noble parentage, he will express it in his\nconditions,\n\n[3669]  ------\"nec enim feroces\n        Progenerant aquilae columbas.\"\n\nAnd although the nobility of our times be much like our coins, more in\nnumber and value, but less in weight and goodness, with finer stamps, cuts,\nor outsides than of old; yet if he retain those ancient characters of true\ngentry, he will be more affable, courteous, gently disposed, of fairer\ncarriage, better temper, or a more magnanimous, heroical, and generous\nspirit, than that _vulgus hominum_, those ordinary boors and peasants, _qui\nadeo improbi, agrestes, et inculti plerumque sunt, ne dicam maliciosi, ut\nnemini ullum humanitatis officium praestent, ne ipsi Deo si advenerit_, as\n[3670]one observes of them, a rude, brutish, uncivil, wild, a currish\ngeneration, cruel and malicious, incapable of discipline, and such as have\nscarce common sense. And it may be generally spoken of all, which [3671]\nLemnius the physician said of his travel into England, the common people\nwere silly, sullen, dogged clowns, _sed mitior nobilitas, ad omne\nhumanitatis officium paratissima_, the gentlemen were courteous and civil.\nIf it so fall out (as often it doth) that such peasants are preferred by\nreason of their wealth, chance, error, &c., or otherwise, yet as the cat in\nthe fable, when she was turned to a fair maid, would play with mice; a cur\nwill be a cur, a clown will be a clown, he will likely savour of the stock\nwhence he came, and that innate rusticity can hardly be shaken off.\n\n[3672] \"Licet superbus ambulet pecunia,\n        Fortuna non mutat genus.\"\n\nAnd though by their education such men may be better qualified, and more\nrefined; yet there be many symptoms by which they may likely be descried,\nan affected fantastical carriage, a tailor-like spruceness, a peculiar garb\nin all their proceedings; choicer than ordinary in his diet, and as [3673]\nHierome well describes such a one to his Nepotian; \"An upstart born in a\nbase cottage, that scarce at first had coarse bread to fill his hungry\nguts, must now feed on kickshaws and made dishes, will have all variety of\nflesh and fish, the best oysters,\" &c. A beggar's brat will be commonly\nmore scornful, imperious, insulting, insolent, than another man of his\nrank: \"Nothing so intolerable as a fortunate fool,\" as [3674]Tully found\nout long since out of his experience; _Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit\nin altum_, set a beggar on horseback, and he will ride a gallop, a gallop,\n&c.\n\n[3675]  ------\"desaevit in omnes\n        Dum se posse putat, nec bellua saevior ulla est,\n        Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis;\"\n\nhe forgets what he was, domineers, &c., and many such other symptoms he\nhath, by which you may know him from a true gentleman. Many errors and\nobliquities are on both sides, noble, ignoble, _factis, natis_; yet still\nin all callings, as some degenerate, some are well deserving, and most\nworthy of their honours. And as Busbequius said of Suleiman the\nMagnificent, he was _tanto dignus imperio_, worthy of that great empire.\nMany meanly descended are most worthy of their honour, _politice nobiles_,\nand well deserve it. Many of our nobility so born (which one said of\nHephaestion, Ptolemeus, Seleucus, Antigonus, &c., and the rest of\nAlexander's followers, they were all worthy to be monarchs and generals of\narmies) deserve to be princes. And I am so far forth of [3676]Sesellius's\nmind, that they ought to be preferred (if capable) before others, \"as being\nnobly born, ingenuously brought up, and from their infancy trained to all\nmanner of civility.\" For learning and virtue in a nobleman is more eminent,\nand, as a jewel set in gold is more precious, and much to be respected,\nsuch a man deserves better than others, and is as great an honour to his\nfamily as his noble family to him. In a word, many noblemen are an ornament\nto their order: many poor men's sons are singularly well endowed, most\neminent, and well deserving for their worth, wisdom, learning, virtue,\nvalour, integrity; excellent members and pillars of a commonwealth. And\ntherefore to conclude that which I first intended, to be base by birth,\nmeanly born is no such disparagement. _Et sic demonstratur, quod erat\ndemonstrandum_.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Against Poverty and Want, with such other Adversities_.\n\nOne of the greatest miseries that can befall a man, in the world's esteem,\nis poverty or want, which makes men steal, bear false witness, swear,\nforswear, contend, murder and rebel, which breaketh sleep, and causeth\ndeath itself. [Greek: ouden penias baruteron esti phortion], no burden\n(saith [3677]Menander) so intolerable as poverty: it makes men desperate,\nit erects and dejects, _census honores, census amicitias_; money makes, but\npoverty mars, &c. and all this in the world's esteem: yet if considered\naright, it is a great blessing in itself, a happy estate, and yields no\ncause of discontent, or that men should therefore account themselves vile,\nhated of God, forsaken, miserable, unfortunate. Christ himself was poor,\nborn in a manger, and had not a house to hide his head in all his life,\n[3678]\"lest any man should make poverty a judgment of God, or an odious\nestate.\" And as he was himself, so he informed his Apostles and Disciples,\nthey were all poor, Prophets poor, Apostles poor, (Act. iii. \"Silver and\ngold have I none.\") \"As sorrowing\" (saith Paul) \"and yet always rejoicing;\nas having nothing, and yet possessing all things,\" 1 Cor. vi. 10. Your\ngreat Philosophers have been voluntarily poor, not only Christians, but\nmany others. Crates Thebanus was adored for a God in Athens, [3679]\"a\nnobleman by birth, many servants he had, an honourable attendance, much\nwealth, many manors, fine apparel; but when he saw this, that all the\nwealth of the world was but brittle, uncertain and no whit availing to live\nwell, he flung his burden into the sea, and renounced his estate.\" Those\nCurii and Fabricii will be ever renowned for contempt of these fopperies,\nwherewith the world is so much affected. Amongst Christians I could reckon\nup many kings and queens, that have forsaken their crowns and fortunes, and\nwilfully abdicated themselves from these so much esteemed toys; [3680]many\nthat have refused honours, titles, and all this vain pomp and happiness,\nwhich others so ambitiously seek, and carefully study to compass and\nattain. Riches I deny not are God's good gifts, and blessings; and _honor\nest in honorante_, honours are from God; both rewards of virtue, and fit to\nbe sought after, sued for, and may well be possessed: yet no such great\nhappiness in having, or misery in wanting of them. _Dantur quidem bonis_,\nsaith Austin, _ne quis mala aestimet: mails autem ne quis nimis bona_, good\nmen have wealth that we should not think, it evil; and bad men that they\nshould not rely on or hold it so good; as the rain falls on both sorts, so\nare riches given to good and bad, _sed bonis in bonum_, but they are good\nonly to the godly. But [3681]compare both estates, for natural parts they\nare not unlike; and a beggar's child, as [3682]Cardan well observes, \"is no\nwhit inferior to a prince's, most part better;\" and for those accidents of\nfortune, it will easily appear there is no such odds, no such extraordinary\nhappiness in the one, or misery in the other. He is rich, wealthy, fat;\nwhat gets he by it? pride, insolency, lust, ambition, cares, fears,\nsuspicion, trouble, anger, emulation, and many filthy diseases of body and\nmind. He hath indeed variety of dishes, better fare, sweet wine, pleasant\nsauce, dainty music, gay clothes, lords it bravely out, &c., and all that\nwhich Misillus admired in [3683]Lucian; but with them he hath the gout,\ndropsies, apoplexies, palsies, stone, pox, rheums, catarrhs, crudities,\noppilations, [3684]melancholy, &c., lust enters in, anger, ambition,\naccording to [3685]Chrysostom, \"the sequel of riches is pride, riot,\nintemperance, arrogancy, fury, and all irrational courses.\"\n\n[3686]  ------\"turpi fregerunt saecula luxu\n        Divitiae molles\"------\n\nwith their variety of dishes, many such maladies of body and mind get in,\nwhich the poor man knows not of. As Saturn in [3687]Lucian answered the\ndiscontented commonalty, (which because of their neglected Saturnal feasts\nin Rome, made a grievous complaint and exclamation against rich men) that\nthey were much mistaken in supposing such happiness in riches; [3688]\"you\nsee the best\" (said he) \"but you know not their several gripings and\ndiscontents:\" they are like painted walls, fair without, rotten within:\ndiseased, filthy, crazy, full of intemperance's effects; [3689]\"and who can\nreckon half? if you but knew their fears, cares, anguish of mind and\nvexation, to which they are subject, you would hereafter renounce all\nriches.\"\n\n[3690] \"O si pateant pectora divitum,\n        Quantos intus sublimis agit\n        Fortuna metus? Brutia Coro\n        Pulsante fretum mitior unda est.\"\n\n       \"O that their breasts were but conspicuous,\n        How full of fear within, how furious?\n        The narrow seas are not so boisterous.\"\n\nYea, but he hath the world at will that is rich, the good things of the\nearth: _suave est de magno tollere acervo_, (it is sweet to draw from a\ngreat heap) he is a happy man, [3691]adored like a god, a prince, every man\nseeks to him, applauds, honours, admires him. He hath honours indeed,\nabundance of all things; but (as I said) withal [3692]\"pride, lust, anger,\nfaction, emulation, fears, cares, suspicion enter with his wealth;\" for his\nintemperance he hath aches, crudities, gouts, and as fruits of his\nidleness, and fullness, lust, surfeiting and drunkenness, all manner of\ndiseases: _pecuniis augetur improbitas_, the wealthier, the more dishonest.\n[3693]\"He is exposed to hatred, envy, peril and treason, fear of death,\ndegradation,\" &c. 'tis _lubrica statio et proxima praecipitio_, and the\nhigher he climbs, the greater is his fall.\n\n[3694]  ------\"celsae graviore casu\n        Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos\"\n\n_Fulgura montes_, the lightning commonly sets on fire the highest towers;\n[3695]in the more eminent place he is, the more subject to fall.\n\n       \"Rumpitur innumeris arbos uberrima pomis,\n        Et subito nimiae praecipitantur opes.\"\n\nAs a tree that is heavy laden with fruit breaks her own boughs, with their\nown greatness they ruin themselves: which Joachimus Camerarius hath\nelegantly expressed in his _13 Emblem cent. 1._ _Inopem se copia fecit_.\nTheir means is their misery, though they do apply themselves to the times,\nto lie, dissemble, collogue and flatter their lieges, obey, second his will\nand commands as much as may be, yet too frequently they miscarry, they fat\nthemselves like so many hogs, as [3696]Aeneas Sylvius observes, that when\nthey are full fed, they may be devoured by their princes, as Seneca by Nero\nwas served, Sejanus by Tiberius, and Haman by Ahasuerus: I resolve with\nGregory, _potestas culminis, est tempestas mentis; et quo dignitas altior,\ncasus gravior_, honour is a tempest, the higher they are elevated, the more\ngrievously depressed. For the rest of his prerogatives which wealth\naffords, as he hath more his expenses are the greater. \"When goods\nincrease, they are increased that eat them; and what good cometh to the\nowners, but the beholding thereof with the eyes?\" Eccles. iv. 10.\n\n[3697] \"Millia frumenti tua triverit area centum,\n        Non tuus hinc capiet venter plus quam meus\"------\n\n\"an evil sickness,\" Solomon calls it, \"and reserved to them for an evil,\"\n12 verse. \"They that will be rich fall into many fears and temptations,\ninto many foolish and noisome lusts, which drown men in perdition.\" 1 Tim.\nvi. 9. \"Gold and silver hath destroyed many,\" Ecclus. viii. 2. _divitia\nsaeculi sunt laquei diaboli_: so writes Bernard; worldly wealth is the\ndevil's bait: and as the Moon when she is fuller of light is still farthest\nfrom the Sun, the more wealth they have, the farther they are commonly from\nGod. (If I had said this of myself, rich men would have pulled me to\npieces; but hear who saith, and who seconds it, an Apostle) therefore St.\nJames bids them \"weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon them;\ntheir gold shall rust and canker, and eat their flesh as fire,\" James v. 1,\n2, 3. I may then boldly conclude with [3698]Theodoret, _quotiescunque\ndivitiis affluentem_, &c. \"As often as you shall see a man abounding in\nwealth,\" _qui gemmis bibit et Serrano dormit in ostro_, \"and naught withal,\nI beseech you call him not happy, but esteem him unfortunate, because he\nhath many occasions offered to live unjustly; on the other side, a poor man\nis not miserable, if he be good, but therefore happy, that those evil\noccasions are taken from him.\"\n\n[3699] \"Non possidentem multa vocaveris\n        Recte beatum; rectius occupat\n        Nomen beati, qui deorum\n        Muneribus sapienter uti,\n        Duramque callet pauperiem pati,\n        Pejusque laetho flagitium timet.\"\n\n       \"He is not happy that is rich,\n        And hath the world at will,\n        But he that wisely can God's gifts\n        Possess and use them still:\n        That suffers and with patience\n        Abides hard poverty,\n        And chooseth rather for to die;\n        Than do such villainy.\"\n\nWherein now consists his happiness? what privileges hath he more than other\nmen? or rather what miseries, what cares and discontents hath he not more\nthan other men?\n\n[3700] \"Non enim gazae, neque consularis\n        Summovet lictor miseros tumultus\n        Mentis, et curas laqueata circum\n                Tecta volantes.\"\n\n       \"Nor treasures, nor majors officers remove\n          The miserable tumults of the mind:\n        Or cares that lie about, or fly above\n          Their high-roofed houses, with huge beams combin'd.\"\n\n'Tis not his wealth can vindicate him, let him have Job's inventory, _sint\nCraesi et Crassi licet, non hos Pactolus aureas undas agens, eripiat unquum\ne miseriis_, Croesus or rich Crassus cannot now command health, or get\nhimself a stomach. [3701]\"His worship,\" as Apuleius describes him, \"in all\nhis plenty and great provision, is forbidden to eat, or else hath no\nappetite,\" (sick in bed, can take no rest, sore grieved with some chronic\ndisease, contracted with full diet and ease, or troubled in mind) \"when as,\nin the meantime, all his household are merry, and the poorest servant that\nhe keeps doth continually feast.\" 'Tis _Bracteata felicitas_, as [3702]\nSeneca terms it, tinfoiled happiness, _infelix felicitas_, an unhappy kind\nof happiness, if it be happiness at all. His gold, guard, clattering of\nharness, and fortifications against outward enemies, cannot free him from\ninward fears and cares.\n\n       \"Reveraque metus hominum, curaeque sequaces\n        Nec metuunt fremitus armorum, aut ferrea tela,\n        Audacterque inter reges, regumque potentes\n        Versantur, neque fulgorem reverentur ab auro.\"\n\n       \"Indeed men still attending fears and cares\n        Nor armours clashing, nor fierce weapons fears:\n        With kings converse they boldly, and kings peers,\n        Fearing no flashing that from gold appears.\"\n\nLook how many servants he hath, and so many enemies he suspects; for\nliberty he entertains ambition; his pleasures are no pleasures; and that\nwhich is worst, he cannot be private or enjoy himself as other men do, his\nstate is a servitude. [3703]A countryman may travel from kingdom to\nkingdom, province to province, city to city, and glut his eyes with\ndelightful objects, hawk, hunt, and use those ordinary disports, without\nany notice taken, all which a prince or a great man cannot do. He keeps in\nfor state, _ne majestatis dignitas evilescat_, as our China kings, of\nBorneo, and Tartarian Chams, those _aurea mancipia_, are said to do, seldom\nor never seen abroad, _ut major sit hominum erga se observantia_, which the\n[3704]Persian kings so precisely observed of old. A poor man takes more\ndelight in an ordinary meal's meat, which he hath but seldom, than they do\nwith all their exotic dainties and continual viands; _Quippe voluptatem\ncommendat rarior usus_, 'tis the rarity and necessity that makes a thing\nacceptable and pleasant. Darius, put to flight by Alexander, drank puddle\nwater to quench his thirst, and it was pleasanter, he swore, than any wine\nor mead. All excess, as [3705]Epictetus argues, will cause a dislike; sweet\nwill be sour, which made that temperate Epicurus sometimes voluntarily\nfast. But they being always accustomed to the same [3706]dishes, (which are\nnastily dressed by slovenly cooks, that after their obscenities never wash\ntheir bawdy hands) be they fish, flesh, compounded, made dishes, or\nwhatsoever else, are therefore cloyed; nectar's self grows loathsome to\nthem, they are weary of all their fine palaces, they are to them but as so\nmany prisons. A poor man drinks in a wooden dish, and eats his meat in\nwooden spoons, wooden platters, earthen vessels, and such homely stuff: the\nother in gold, silver, and precious stones; but with what success? _in auro\nbibitur venenum_, fear of poison in the one, security in the other. A poor\nman is able to write, to speak his mind, to do his own business himself;\n_locuples mittit parasitum_, saith [3707]Philostratus, a rich man employs a\nparasite, and as the major of a city, speaks by the town clerk, or by Mr.\nRecorder, when he cannot express himself. [3708]Nonius the senator hath a\npurple coat as stiff with jewels as his mind is full of vices; rings on his\nfingers worth 20,000 sesterces, and as [3709]Perox the Persian king, an\nunion in his ear worth one hundred pounds weight of gold: [3710]Cleopatra\nhath whole boars and sheep served up to her table at once, drinks jewels\ndissolved, 40,000 sesterces in value; but to what end?\n\n[3711] \"Num tibi cum fauces urit sitis, aurea quaeris\n        Pocula?\"------\n\nDoth a man that is adry desire to drink in gold? Doth not a cloth suit\nbecome him as well, and keep him as warm, as all their silks, satins,\ndamasks, taffeties and tissues? Is not homespun cloth as great a\npreservative against cold, as a coat of Tartar lamb's-wool, died in grain,\nor a gown of giant's beards? Nero, saith [3712]Sueton., never put on one\ngarment twice, and thou hast scarce one to put on? what's the difference?\none's sick, the other sound: such is the whole tenor of their lives, and\nthat which is the consummation and upshot of all, death itself makes the\ngreatest difference. One like a hen feeds on the dunghill all his days, but\nis served up at last to his Lord's table; the other as a falcon is fed with\npartridge and pigeons, and carried on his master's fist, but when he dies\nis flung to the muck-hill, and there lies. The rich man lives like Dives\njovially here on earth, _temulentus divitiis_, make the best of it; and\n\"boasts himself in the multitude of his riches,\" Psalm xlix. 6. 11. he\nthinks his house \"called after his own name,\" shall continue for ever; \"but\nhe perisheth like a beast,\" verse 20. \"his way utters his folly,\" verse 13.\n_male parta, male dilabuntur_; \"like sheep they lie in the grave,\" verse\n14. _Puncto descendunt ad infernum_, \"they spend their days in wealth, and\ngo suddenly down to hell,\" Job xxi. 13. For all physicians and medicines\nenforcing nature, a swooning wife, families' complaints, friends' tears,\ndirges, masses, _naenias_, funerals, for all orations, counterfeit hired\nacclamations, eulogiums, epitaphs, hearses, heralds, black mourners,\nsolemnities, obelisks, and Mausolean tombs, if he have them, at least,\n[3713]he, like a hog, goes to hell with a guilty conscience (_propter hos\ndilatavit infernos os suum_), and a poor man's curse; his memory stinks\nlike the snuff of a candle when it is put out; scurrilous libels, and\ninfamous obloquies accompany him. When as poor Lazarus is _Dei sacrarium_,\nthe temple of God, lives and dies in true devotion, hath no more\nattendants, but his own innocency, the heaven a tomb, desires to be\ndissolved, buried in his mother's lap, and hath a company of [3714]Angels\nready to convey his soul into Abraham's bosom, he leaves an everlasting and\na sweet memory behind him. Crassus and Sylla are indeed still recorded, but\nnot so much for their wealth as for their victories: Croesus for his end,\nSolomon for his wisdom. In a word, [3715]\"to get wealth is a great trouble,\nanxiety to keep, grief to lose it.\"\n\n[3716] \"Quid dignum stolidis mentibus imprecer?\n        Opes, honores ambiant:\n        Et cum falsa gravi mole paraverint,\n        Tum vera cognoscant bona.\"\n\nBut consider all those other unknown, concealed happinesses, which a poor\nman hath (I call them unknown, because they be not acknowledged in the\nworld's esteem, or so taken) _O fortunatos nimium bona si sua norint_:\nhappy they are in the meantime if they would take notice of it, make use,\nor apply it to themselves. \"A poor man wise is better than a foolish king,\"\nEccles. ii. 13. [3717]\"Poverty is the way to heaven,\" [3718]\"the mistress\nof philosophy,\" [3719]\"the mother of religion, virtue, sobriety, sister of\ninnocency, and an upright mind.\" How many such encomiums might I add out of\nthe fathers, philosophers, orators? It troubles many that are poor, they\naccount of it as a great plague, curse, a sign of God's hatred, _ipsum\nscelus_, damned villainy itself, a disgrace, shame and reproach; but to\nwhom, or why? [3720]\"If fortune hath envied me wealth, thieves have robbed\nme, my father have not left me such revenues as others have,\" that I am a\nyounger brother, basely born,--_cui sine luce genus, surdumque\nparentum--nomen_, of mean parentage, a dirt-dauber's son, am I therefore to\nbe blamed? \"an eagle, a bull, a lion is not rejected for his poverty, and\nwhy should a man?\" 'Tis [3721]_fortunae telum, non culpae_, fortune's\nfault, not mine. \"Good Sir, I am a servant,\" (to use [3722]Seneca's words)\n\"howsoever your poor friend; a servant, and yet your chamber-fellow, and if\nyou consider better of it, your fellow-servant.\" I am thy drudge in the\nworld's eyes, yet in God's sight peradventure thy better, my soul is more\nprecious, and I dearer unto him. _Etiam servi diis curae sunt_, as\nEvangelus at large proves in Macrobius, the meanest servant is most\nprecious in his sight. Thou art an epicure, I am a good Christian; thou art\nmany parasangs before me in means, favour, wealth, honour, Claudius's\nNarcissus, Nero's Massa, Domitian's Parthenius, a favourite, a golden\nslave; thou coverest thy floors with marble, thy roofs with gold, thy walls\nwith statues, fine pictures, curious hangings, &c., what of all this?\n_calcas opes_, &c., what's all this to true happiness? I live and breathe\nunder that glorious heaven, that august capitol of nature, enjoy the\nbrightness of stars, that clear light of sun and moon, those infinite\ncreatures, plants, birds, beasts, fishes, herbs, all that sea and land\nafford, far surpassing all that art and _opulentia_ can give. I am free,\nand which [3723]Seneca said of Rome, _culmen liberos texit, sub marmore et\nauro postea servitus habitavit_, thou hast _Amaltheae cornu_, plenty,\npleasure, the world at will, I am despicable and poor; but a word overshot,\na blow in choler, a game at tables, a loss at sea, a sudden fire, the\nprince's dislike, a little sickness, &c., may make us equal in an instant;\nhowsoever take thy time, triumph and insult awhile, _cinis aequat_, as\n[3724]Alphonsus said, death will equalise us all at last. I live sparingly,\nin the mean time, am clad homely, fare hardly; is this a reproach? am I the\nworse for it? am I contemptible for it? am I to be reprehended? A learned\nman in [3725] Nevisanus was taken down for sitting amongst gentlemen, but\nhe replied, \"my nobility is about the head, yours declines to the tail,\"\nand they were silent. Let them mock, scoff and revile, 'tis not thy scorn,\nbut his that made thee so; \"he that mocketh the poor, reproacheth him that\nmade him,\" Prov. xi. 5. \"and he that rejoiceth at affliction, shall not be\nunpunished.\" For the rest, the poorer thou art, the happier thou art,\n_ditior est, at non melior_, saith [3726]Epictetus, he is richer, not\nbetter than thou art, not so free from lust, envy, hatred, ambition.\n\n       \"Beatus ille qui procul negotiis\n        Paterna rura bobus exercet suis.\"\n\nHappy he, in that he is [3727]freed from the tumults of the world, he seeks\nno honours, gapes after no preferment, flatters not, envies not,\ntemporiseth not, but lives privately, and well contented with his estate;\n\n       \"Nec spes corde avidas, nec curam pascit inanem\n        Securus quo fata cadant.\"\n\nHe is not troubled with state matters, whether kingdoms thrive better by\nsuccession or election; whether monarchies should be mixed, temperate, or\nabsolute; the house of Ottomans and Austria is all one to him; he inquires\nnot after colonies or new discoveries; whether Peter were at Rome, or\nConstantine's donation be of force; what comets or new stars signify,\nwhether the earth stand or move, there be a new world in the moon, or\ninfinite worlds, &c. He is not touched with fear of invasions, factions or\nemulations;\n\n[3728] \"Felix ille animi, divisque simillimus ipsis,\n        Quem non mordaci resplendens gloria fuco\n        Solicitat, non fastosi mala gaudia luxus,\n        Sed tacitos sinit ire dies, et paupere cultu\n[3729]   Exigit innocuae tranquilla silentia vitae.\n\n       \"A happy soul, and like to God himself,\n        Whom not vain glory macerates or strife.\n        Or wicked joys of that proud swelling pelf,\n        But leads a still, poor, and contented life.\"\n\nA secure, quiet, blissful state he hath, if he could acknowledge it. But\nhere is the misery, that he will not take notice of it; he repines at rich\nmen's wealth, brave hangings, dainty fare, as [3730]Simonides objected to\nHieron, he hath all the pleasures of the world, [3731]_in lectis eburneis\ndormit, vinum phialis bibit, optimis unguentis delibuitur_, \"he knows not\nthe affliction of Joseph, stretching himself on ivory beds, and singing to\nthe sound of the viol.\" And it troubles him that he hath not the like:\nthere is a difference (he grumbles) between Laplolly and Pheasants, to\ntumble i' th' straw and lie in a down bed, betwixt wine and water, a\ncottage and a palace. \"He hates nature\" (as [3732]Pliny characterised him)\n\"that she hath made him lower than a god, and is angry with the gods that\nany man goes before him;\" and although he hath received much, yet (as\n[3733]Seneca follows it) \"he thinks it an injury that he hath no more, and\nis so far from giving thanks for his tribuneship, that he complains he is\nnot praetor, neither doth that please him, except he may be consul.\" Why is\nhe not a prince, why not a monarch, why not an emperor? Why should one man\nhave so much more than his fellows, one have all, another nothing? Why\nshould one man be a slave or drudge to another? One surfeit, another\nstarve, one live at ease, another labour, without any hope of better\nfortune? Thus they grumble, mutter, and repine: not considering that\ninconstancy of human affairs, judicially conferring one condition with\nanother, or well weighing their own present estate. What they are now, thou\nmayst shortly be; and what thou art they shall likely be. Expect a little,\ncompare future and times past with the present, see the event, and comfort\nthyself with it. It is as well to be discerned in commonwealths, cities,\nfamilies, as in private men's estates. Italy was once lord of the world,\nRome the queen of cities, vaunted herself of two [3734]myriads of\ninhabitants; now that all-commanding country is possessed by petty princes,\n[3735]Rome a small village in respect. Greece of old the seat of civility,\nmother of sciences and humanity; now forlorn, the nurse of barbarism, a den\nof thieves. Germany then, saith Tacitus, was incult and horrid, now full of\nmagnificent cities: Athens, Corinth, Carthage, how flourishing cities, now\nburied in their own ruins! _Corvorum, ferarum, aprorum et bestiarum\nlustra_, like so many wildernesses, a receptacle of wild beasts. Venice a\npoor fisher-town; Paris, London, small cottages in Caesar's time, now most\nnoble emporiums. Valois, Plantagenet, and Scaliger how fortunate families,\nhow likely to continue! now quite extinguished and rooted out. He stands\naloft today, full of favour, wealth, honour, and prosperity, in the top of\nfortune's wheel: tomorrow in prison, worse than nothing, his son's a\nbeggar. Thou art a poor servile drudge, _Foex populi_, a very slave, thy\nson may come to be a prince, with Maximinus, Agathocles, &c. a senator, a\ngeneral of an army; thou standest bare to him now, workest for him,\ndrudgest for him and his, takest an alms of him: stay but a little, and his\nnext heir peradventure shall consume all with riot, be degraded, thou\nexalted, and he shall beg of thee. Thou shalt be his most honourable\npatron, he thy devout servant, his posterity shall run, ride, and do as\nmuch for thine, as it was with [3736]Frisgobald and Cromwell, it may be for\nthee. Citizens devour country gentlemen, and settle in their seats; after\ntwo or three descents, they consume all in riot, it returns to the city\nagain.\n\n[3737]  ------\"Novus incola venit;\n        Nam propriae telluris herum natura, neque illum.\n        Nec me, nec quenquam statuit; nos expulit ille:\n        Illum aut nequities, aut vafri inscitia juris.\"\n\n        ------\"have we liv'd at a more frugal rate,\n        Since this new stranger seiz'd on our estate?\n        Nature will no perpetual heir assign,\n        Or make the farm his property or mine.\n        He turn'd us out: but follies all his own,\n        Or lawsuits and their knaveries yet unknown,\n        Or, all his follies and his lawsuits past,\n        Some long-liv'd heir shall turn him out at last.\"\n\nA lawyer buys out his poor client, after a while his client's posterity buy\nout him and his; so things go round, ebb and flow.\n\n       \"Nunc ager Umbreni sub nomine, nuper Ofelli\n        Dictus erat, nulli proprius, sed cedit in usum\n        Nunc mihi, nunc aliis;\"------\n\n       \"The farm, once mine, now bears Umbrenus' name;\n        The use alone, not property, we claim;\n        Then be not with your present lot depressed,\n        And meet the future with undaunted breast;\"\n\nas he said then, _ager cujus, quot habes Dominos_? So say I of land,\nhouses, movables and money, mine today, his anon, whose tomorrow? In fine,\n(as [3738]Machiavel observes) \"virtue and prosperity beget rest; rest\nidleness; idleness riot; riot destruction from which we come again to good\nlaws; good laws engender virtuous actions; virtue, glory, and prosperity;\"\n\"and 'tis no dishonour then\" (as Guicciardine adds) \"for a flourishing man,\ncity, or state to come to ruin,\" [3739]\"nor infelicity to be subject to the\nlaw of nature.\" _Ergo terrena calcanda, sitienda coelestia_, (therefore I\nsay) scorn this transitory state, look up to heaven, think not what others\nare, but what thou art: [3740]_Qua parte locatus es in re_: and what thou\nshalt be, what thou mayst be. Do (I say) as Christ himself did, when he\nlived here on earth, imitate him as much as in thee lies. How many great\nCaesars, mighty monarchs, tetrarchs, dynasties, princes lived in his days,\nin what plenty, what delicacy, how bravely attended, what a deal of gold\nand silver, what treasure, how many sumptuous palaces had they, what\nprovinces and cities, ample territories, fields, rivers, fountains, parks,\nforests, lawns, woods, cells, &c.? Yet Christ had none of all this, he\nwould have none of this, he voluntarily rejected all this, he could not be\nignorant, he could not err in his choice, he contemned all this, he chose\nthat which was safer, better, and more certain, and less to be repented, a\nmean estate, even poverty itself; and why dost thou then doubt to follow\nhim, to imitate him, and his apostles, to imitate all good men: so do thou\ntread in his divine steps, and thou shalt not err eternally, as too many\nworldlings do, that run on in their own dissolute courses, to their\nconfusion and ruin, thou shalt not do amiss. Whatsoever thy fortune is, be\ncontented with it, trust in him, rely on him, refer thyself wholly to him.\nFor know this, in conclusion, _Non est volentis nec currentis, sed\nmiserentis Dei_, 'tis not as men, but as God will. \"The Lord maketh poor\nand maketh rich, bringeth low, and exalteth\" (1 Sam. ii. ver. 7. 8), \"he\nlifteth the poor from the dust, and raiseth the beggar from the dunghill,\nto set them amongst princes, and make them inherit the seat of glory;\" 'tis\nall as he pleaseth, how, and when, and whom; he that appoints the end\n(though to us unknown) appoints the means likewise subordinate to the end.\n\nYea, but their present estate crucifies and torments most mortal men, they\nhave no such forecast, to see what may be, what shall likely be, but what\nis, though not wherefore, or from whom, _hoc anget_, their present\nmisfortunes grind their souls, and an envious eye which they cast upon\nother men's prosperities, _Vicinumque pecus grandius uber habet_, how rich,\nhow fortunate, how happy is he? But in the meantime he doth not consider\nthe other miseries, his infirmities of body and mind, that accompany his\nestate, but still reflects upon his own false conceived woes and wants,\nwhereas if the matter were duly examined, [3741]he is in no distress at\nall, he hath no cause to complain.\n\n[3742]  ------\"tolle querelas,\n        Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus,\"\n\n       \"Then cease complaining, friend, and learn to live.\n        He is not poor to whom kind fortune grants,\n        Even with a frugal hand, what Nature wants.\"\n\nhe is not poor, he is not in need. [3743]\"Nature is content with bread and\nwater; and he that can rest satisfied with that, may contend with Jupiter\nhimself for happiness.\" In that golden age, [3744]_somnos dedit umbra\nsalubres, potum quoque lubricus amnis_, the tree gave wholesome shade to\nsleep under, and the clear rivers drink. The Israelites drank water in the\nwilderness; Samson, David, Saul, Abraham's servant when he went for Isaac's\nwife, the Samaritan woman, and how many besides might I reckon up, Egypt,\nPalestine, whole countries in the [3745]Indies, that drank pure water all\ntheir lives. [3746]The Persian kings themselves drank no other drink than\nthe water of Chaospis, that runs by Susa, which was carried in bottles\nafter them, whithersoever they went. Jacob desired no more of God, but\nbread to eat, and clothes to put on in his journey, Gen. xxviii. 20. _Bene\nest cui deus obtulit Parca quod satis est manu_; bread is enough [3747]\"to\nstrengthen the heart.\" And if you study philosophy aright, saith [3748]\nMaudarensis, \"whatsoever is beyond this moderation, is not useful, but\ntroublesome.\" [3749]Agellius, out of Euripides, accounts bread and water\nenough to satisfy nature, \"of which there is no surfeit, the rest is not a\nfeast, but a riot.\" [3750]S. Hierome esteems him rich \"that hath bread to\neat, and a potent man that is not compelled to be a slave; hunger is not\nambitious, so that it have to eat, and thirst doth not prefer a cup of\ngold.\" It was no epicurean speech of an epicure, he that is not satisfied\nwith a little will never have enough: and very good counsel of him in the\n[3751]poet, \"O my son, mediocrity of means agrees best with men; too much\nis pernicious.\"\n\n       \"Divitiae grandes homini sunt vivere parce,\n        Aequo animo.\"------\n\nAnd if thou canst be content, thou hast abundance, _nihil est, nihil\ndeest_, thou hast little, thou wantest nothing. 'Tis all one to be hanged\nin a chain of gold, or in a rope; to be filled with dainties or coarser\nmeat.\n\n[3752] \"Si ventri bene, si lateri, pedibusque tuis, nil\n        Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.\"\n\n       \"If belly, sides and feet be well at ease,\n        A prince's treasure can thee no more please.\"\n\nSocrates in a fair, seeing so many things bought and sold, such a multitude\nof people convented to that purpose, exclaimed forthwith, \"O ye gods what a\nsight of things do not I want?\" 'Tis thy want alone that keeps thee in\nhealth of body and mind, and that which thou persecutest and abhorrest as a\nferal plague is thy physician and [3753]chiefest friend, which makes thee a\ngood man, a healthful, a sound, a virtuous, an honest and happy man. For\nwhen virtue came from heaven (as the poet feigns) rich men kicked her up,\nwicked men abhorred her, courtiers scoffed at her, citizens hated her,\n[3754]and that she was thrust out of doors in every place, she came at last\nto her sister Poverty, where she had found good entertainment. Poverty and\nVirtue dwell together.\n\n[3755]  ------\"O vitae tuta facultas\n        Pauperis, angustique lares, o munera nondum\n        Intellecta deum.\"\n\nHow happy art thou if thou couldst be content. \"Godliness is a great gain,\nif a man can be content with that which he hath,\" 1 Tim. vi. 6. And all\ntrue happiness is in a mean estate. I have a little wealth, as he said,\n[3756]_sed quas animus magnas facit_, a kingdom in conceit;\n\n[3757]  ------\"nil amplius opto\n        Maia nate, nisi ut propria haec mihi munera faxis;\"\n\nI have enough and desire no more.\n\n[3758] \"Dii bene fecerunt inopis me quodque pusilli\n        Fecerunt animi\"------\n\n'tis very well, and to my content. [3759]_Vestem et fortunam concinnam\npotius quam laxam probo_, let my fortune and my garments be both alike fit\nfor me. And which [3760]Sebastian Foscarinus, sometime Duke of Venice,\ncaused to be engraven on his tomb in St. Mark's Church, \"Hear, O ye\nVenetians, and I will tell you which is the best thing in the world: to\ncontemn it.\" I will engrave it in my heart, it shall be my whole study to\ncontemn it. Let them take wealth, _Stercora stercus amet_ so that I may\nhave security: _bene qui latuit, bene vixit_; though I live obscure, [3761]\nyet I live clean and honest; and when as the lofty oak is blown down, the\nsilky reed may stand. Let them take glory, for that's their misery; let\nthem take honour, so that I may have heart's ease. _Duc me O Jupiter et tu\nfatum_, [3762]&c. Lead me, O God, whither thou wilt, I am ready to follow;\ncommand, I will obey. I do not envy at their wealth, titles, offices;\n\n[3763] \"Stet quicunque volet potens\n        Aulae culmine lubrico,\n        Me dulcis saturet quies.\"\n\nlet me live quiet and at ease. [3764]_Erimus fortasse_ (as he comforted\nhimself) _quando illi non erunt_, when they are dead and gone, and all\ntheir pomp vanished, our memory may flourish:\n\n[3765]  ------\"dant perennes\n        Stemmata non peritura Musae.\"\n\nLet him be my lord, patron, baron, earl, and possess so many goodly\ncastles, 'tis well for me [3766]that I have a poor house, and a little\nwood, and a well by it, &c.\n\n       \"His me consolor victurum suavius, ac si\n        Quaestor avus pater atque meus, patruusque fuissent.\"\n\n       \"With which I feel myself more truly blest\n        Than if my sires the quaestor's power possess'd.\"\n\nI live, I thank God, as merrily as he, and triumph as much in this my mean\nestate, as if my father and uncle had been lord treasurer, or my lord\nmayor. He feeds of many dishes, I of one: [3767]_qui Christum curat, non\nmultum curat quam de preciosis cibis stercus conficiat_, what care I of\nwhat stuff my excrements be made? [3768]\"He that lives according to nature\ncannot be poor, and he that exceeds can never have enough,\" _totus non\nsufficit orbis_, the whole world cannot give him content. \"A small thing\nthat the righteous hath, is better than the riches of the ungodly,\" Psal.\nxxxvii. 19; \"and better is a poor morsel with quietness, than abundance\nwith strife,\" Prov. xvii. 7. Be content then, enjoy thyself, and as [3769]\nChrysostom adviseth, \"be not angry for what thou hast not, but give God\nhearty thanks for what thou hast received.\"\n\n[3770] \"Si dat oluscula\n        Mensa minuscula\n          pace referta,\"\n\n       \"Ne pete grandia,\n        Lautaque prandia\n          lite repleta.\"\n\nBut what wantest thou, to expostulate the matter? or what hast thou not\nbetter than a rich man? [3771]\"health, competent wealth, children,\nsecurity, sleep, friends, liberty, diet, apparel, and what not,\" or at\nleast mayst have (the means being so obvious, easy, and well known) for as\nhe inculcated to himself,\n\n[3772] \"Vitam quae faciunt beatiorem,\n        Jucundissime Martialis, haec sunt;\n        Res non parta labore, sed relicta,\n        Lis nunquam,\" &c.\n\nI say again thou hast, or at least mayst have it, if thou wilt thyself, and\nthat which I am sure he wants, a merry heart. \"Passing by a village in the\nterritory of Milan,\" saith [3773]St. Austin, \"I saw a poor beggar that had\ngot belike his bellyful of meat, jesting and merry; I sighed, and said to\nsome of my friends that were then with me, what a deal of trouble, madness,\npain and grief do we sustain and exaggerate unto ourselves, to get that\nsecure happiness which this poor beggar hath prevented us of, and which we\nperadventure shall never have? For that which he hath now attained with the\nbegging of some small pieces of silver, a temporal happiness, and present\nheart's ease, I cannot compass with all my careful windings, and running in\nand out,\" [3774]\"And surely the beggar was very merry, but I was heavy; he\nwas secure, but I timorous. And if any man should ask me now, whether I had\nrather be merry, or still so solicitous and sad, I should say, merry. If he\nshould ask me again, whether I had rather be as I am, or as this beggar\nwas, I should sure choose to be as I am, tortured still with cares and\nfears; but out of peevishness, and not out of truth.\" That which St. Austin\nsaid of himself here in this place, I may truly say to thee, thou\ndiscontented wretch, thou covetous niggard, thou churl, thou ambitious and\nswelling toad, 'tis not want but peevishness which is the cause of thy\nwoes; settle thine affection, thou hast enough.\n\n[3775] \"Denique sit finis quaerendi, quoque habeas plus,\n        Pauperiem metuas minus, et finire laborem\n        Incipias; parto, quod avebas, utere.\"\n\nMake an end of scraping, purchasing this manor, this field, that house, for\nthis and that child; thou hast enough for thyself and them:\n\n[3776]  ------\"Quod petis hic est,\n        Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus.\"\n\n'Tis at hand, at home already, which thou so earnestly seekest. But\n\n        ------\"O si angulus ille\n        Proximus accedat, qui nunc denormat agellum,\"\n\nO that I had but that one nook of ground, that field there, that pasture,\n_O si venam argenti fors quis mihi monstret--_. O that I could but find a\npot of money now, to purchase, &c., to build me a new house, to marry my\ndaughter, place my son, &c. [3777]\"O if I might but live a while longer to\nsee all things settled, some two or three years, I would pay my debts,\"\nmake all my reckonings even: but they are come and past, and thou hast more\nbusiness than before. \"O madness, to think to settle that in thine old age\nwhen thou hast more, which in thy youth thou canst not now compose having\nbut a little.\" [3778]Pyrrhus would first conquer Africa, and then Asia, _et\ntum suaviter agere_, and then live merrily and take his ease: but when\nCyneas the orator told him he might do that already, _id jam posse fieri_,\nrested satisfied, condemning his own folly. _Si parva licet componere\nmagnis_, thou mayst do the like, and therefore be composed in thy fortune.\nThou hast enough: he that is wet in a bath, can be no more wet if he be\nflung into Tiber, or into the ocean itself: and if thou hadst all the\nworld, or a solid mass of gold as big as the world, thou canst not have\nmore than enough; enjoy thyself at length, and that which thou hast; the\nmind is all; be content, thou art not poor, but rich, and so much the\nricher as [3779]Censorinus well writ to Cerellius, _quanto pauciora optas,\nnon quo plura possides_, in wishing less, not having more. I say then, _Non\nadjice opes, sed minue cupiditates_ ('tis [3780]Epicurus' advice), add no\nmore wealth, but diminish thy desires; and as [3781]Chrysostom well seconds\nhim, _Si vis ditari, contemne divitias_; that's true plenty, not to have,\nbut not to want riches, _non habere, sed non indigere, vera abundantia_:\n'tis more glory to contemn, than to possess; _et nihil agere, est deorum_,\n\"and to want nothing is divine.\" How many deaf, dumb, halt, lame, blind,\nmiserable persons could I reckon up that are poor, and withal distressed,\nin imprisonment, banishment, galley slaves, condemned to the mines,\nquarries, to gyves, in dungeons, perpetual thraldom, than all which thou\nart richer, thou art more happy, to whom thou art able to give an alms, a\nlord, in respect, a petty prince: [3782]be contented then I say, repine and\nmutter no more, \"for thou art not poor indeed but in opinion.\"\n\nYea, but this is very good counsel, and rightly applied to such as have it,\nand will not use it, that have a competency, that are able to work and get\ntheir living by the sweat of their brows, by their trade, that have\nsomething yet; he that hath birds, may catch birds; but what shall we do\nthat are slaves by nature, impotent, and unable to help ourselves, mere\nbeggars, that languish and pine away, that have no means at all, no hope of\nmeans, no trust of delivery, or of better success? as those old Britons\ncomplained to their lords and masters the Romans oppressed by the Picts.\n_mare ad barbaros, barbari ad mare_, the barbarians drove them to the sea,\nthe sea drove them back to the barbarians: our present misery compels us to\ncry out and howl, to make our moan to rich men: they turn us back with a\nscornful answer to our misfortune again, and will take no pity of us; they\ncommonly overlook their poor friends in adversity; if they chance to meet\nthem, they voluntarily forget and will take no notice of them; they will\nnot, they cannot help us. Instead of comfort they threaten us, miscall,\nscoff at us, to aggravate our misery, give us bad language, or if they do\ngive good words, what's that to relieve us? According to that of Thales,\n_Facile est alios monere_; who cannot give good counsel? 'tis cheap, it\ncosts them nothing. It is an easy matter when one's belly is full to\ndeclaim against fasting, _Qui satur est pleno laudat jejunia ventre_; \"Doth\nthe wild ass bray when he hath grass, or loweth the ox when he hath\nfodder?\" Job vi. 5. [3783]_Neque enim populo Romano quidquam potest esse\nlaetius_, no man living so jocund, so merry as the people of Rome when they\nhad plenty; but when they came to want, to be hunger-starved, \"neither\nshame, nor laws, nor arms, nor magistrates could keep them in obedience.\"\nSeneca pleadeth hard for poverty, and so did those lazy philosophers: but\nin the meantime [3784]he was rich, they had wherewithal to maintain\nthemselves; but doth any poor man extol it? \"There are those\" (saith [3785]\nBernard) \"that approve of a mean estate, but on that condition they never\nwant themselves: and some again are meek so long as they may say or do what\nthey list; but if occasion be offered, how far are they from all patience?\"\nI would to God (as he said) [3786]\"No man should commend poverty, but he\nthat is poor,\" or he that so much admires it, would relieve, help, or ease\nothers.\n\n[3787] \"Nunc si nos audis, atque es divinus Apollo,\n        Dic mihi, qui nummos non habet, unde petat:\"\n\n       \"Now if thou hear'st us, and art a good man,\n        Tell him that wants, to get means, if you can.\"\n\nBut no man hears us, we are most miserably dejected, the scum of the world.\n[3788]_Vix habet in nobis jam nova plaga locum_. We can get no relief, no\ncomfort, no succour, [3789]_Et nihil inveni quod mihi ferret opem_. We have\ntried all means, yet find no remedy: no man living can express the anguish\nand bitterness of our souls, but we that endure it; we are distressed,\nforsaken, in torture of body and mind, in another hell: and what shall we\ndo? When [3790]Crassus the Roman consul warred against the Parthians, after\nan unlucky battle fought, he fled away in the night, and left four thousand\nmen, sore, sick, and wounded in his tents, to the fury of the enemy, which,\nwhen the poor men perceived, _clamoribus et ululatibus omnia complerunt_,\nthey made lamentable moan, and roared downright, as loud as Homer's Mars\nwhen he was hurt, which the noise of 10,000 men could not drown, and all\nfor fear of present death. But our estate is far more tragical and\nmiserable, much more to be deplored, and far greater cause have we to\nlament; the devil and the world persecute us, all good fortune hath\nforsaken us, we are left to the rage of beggary, cold, hunger, thirst,\nnastiness, sickness, irksomeness, to continue all torment, labour and pain,\nto derision and contempt, bitter enemies all, and far worse than any death;\ndeath alone we desire, death we seek, yet cannot have it, and what shall we\ndo? _Quod male fers, assuesce; feres bene_ --accustom thyself to it, and it\nwill be tolerable at last. Yea, but I may not, I cannot, _In me consumpsit\nvires fortuna nocendo_, I am in the extremity of human adversity; and as a\nshadow leaves the body when the sun is gone, I am now left and lost, and\nquite forsaken of the world. _Qui jacet in terra, non habet unde cadat_;\ncomfort thyself with this yet, thou art at the worst, and before it be long\nit will either overcome thee or thou it. If it be violent, it cannot\nendure, _aut solvetur, aut solvet_: let the devil himself and all the\nplagues of Egypt come upon thee at once, _Ne tu cede malis, sed contra\naudentior ito_, be of good courage; misery is virtue's whetstone.\n\n[3791] \"--serpens, sitis, ardor, arenae,\n        Dulcia virtuti,\"\n\nas Cato told his soldiers marching in the deserts of Libya, \"Thirst, heat,\nsands, serpents, were pleasant to a valiant man;\" honourable enterprises\nare accompanied with dangers and damages, as experience evinceth: they will\nmake the rest of thy life relish the better. But put case they continue;\nthou art not so poor as thou wast born, and as some hold, much better to be\npitied than envied. But be it so thou hast lost all, poor thou art,\ndejected, in pain of body, grief of mind, thine enemies insult over thee,\nthou art as bad as Job; yet tell me (saith Chrysostom) \"was Job or the\ndevil the greater conqueror? surely Job; the [3792]devil had his goods, he\nsat on the muck-hill and kept his good name; he lost his children, health,\nfriends, but he kept his innocency; he lost his money, but he kept his\nconfidence in God, which was better than any treasure.\" Do thou then as Job\ndid, triumph as Job did, [3793]and be not molested as every fool is. _Sed\nqua ratione potero_? How shall this be done? Chrysostom answers, _facile si\ncoelum cogitaveris_, with great facility, if thou shalt but meditate on\nheaven. [3794]Hannah wept sore, and troubled in mind, could not eat; \"but\nwhy weepest thou,\" said Elkanah her husband, \"and why eatest thou not? why\nis thine heart troubled? am not I better to thee than ten sons?\" and she\nwas quiet. Thou art here [3795]vexed in this world; but say to thyself,\n\"Why art thou troubled, O my soul?\" Is not God better to thee than all\ntemporalities, and momentary pleasures of the world? be then pacified. And\nthough thou beest now peradventure in extreme want, [3796]it may be 'tis\nfor thy further good, to try thy patience, as it did Job's, and exercise\nthee in this life: trust in God, and rely upon him, and thou shalt be\n[3797]crowned in the end. What's this life to eternity? The world hath\nforsaken thee, thy friends and fortunes all are gone: yet know this, that\nthe very hairs of thine head are numbered, that God is a spectator of all\nthy miseries, he sees thy wrongs, woes, and wants. [3798]\"'Tis his\ngoodwill and pleasure it should be so, and he knows better what is for thy\ngood than thou thyself. His providence is over all, at all times; he hath\nset a guard of angels over us, and keeps us as the apple of his eye,\" Ps.\nxvii. 8. Some he doth exalt, prefer, bless with worldly riches, honours,\noffices, and preferments, as so many glistering stars he makes to shine\nabove the rest: some he doth miraculously protect from thieves, incursions,\nsword, fire, and all violent mischances, and as the [3799]poet feigns of\nthat Lycian Pandarus, Lycaon's son, when he shot at Menelaus the Grecian\nwith a strong arm, and deadly arrow, Pallas, as a good mother keeps flies\nfrom her child's face asleep, turned by the shaft, and made it hit on the\nbuckle of his girdle; so some he solicitously defends, others he exposeth\nto danger, poverty, sickness, want, misery, he chastiseth and corrects, as\nto him seems best, in his deep, unsearchable and secret judgment, and all\nfor our good. \"The tyrant took the city\" (saith [3800]Chrysostom), \"God did\nnot hinder it; led them away captives, so God would have it; he bound them,\nGod yielded to it: flung them into the furnace, God permitted it: heat the\noven hotter, it was granted: and when the tyrant had done his worst, God\nshowed his power, and the children's patience; he freed them:\" so can he\nthee, and can [3801]help in an instant, when it seems to him good. [3802]\n\"Rejoice not against me, O my enemy; for though I fall, I shall rise: when\nI sit in darkness, the Lord shall lighten me.\" Remember all those martyrs\nwhat they have endured, the utmost that human rage and fury could invent,\nwith what [3803]patience they have borne, with what willingness embraced\nit. \"Though he kill me,\" saith Job, \"I will trust in him.\" _Justus\n[3804]inexpugnabilis_, as Chrysostom holds, a just man is impregnable, and\nnot to be overcome. The gout may hurt his hands, lameness his feet,\nconvulsions may torture his joints, but not _rectam mentem_ his soul is\nfree.\n\n[3805]  ------\"nempe pecus, rem,\n        Lectos, argentum tollas licet; in manicis, et\n        Compedibus saevo teneas custode\"------\n\n       \"Perhaps, you mean,\n        My cattle, money, movables or land,\n        Then take them all.--But, slave, if I command,\n        A cruel jailor shall thy freedom seize.\"\n\n[3806]\"Take away his money, his treasure is in heaven: banish him his\ncountry, he is an inhabitant of that heavenly Jerusalem: cast him into\nbands, his conscience is free; kill his body, it shall rise again; he\nfights with a shadow that contends with an upright man:\" he will not be\nmoved.\n\n        ------\"si fractus illabatur orbis,\n        Impavidum ferient ruinae.\"\n\nThough heaven itself should fall on his head, he will not be offended. He\nis impenetrable, as an anvil hard, as constant as Job.\n\n[3807] \"Ipse deus simul atque volet me solvet opinor.\"\n\n       \"A God shall set me free whene'er I please.\"\n\nBe thou such a one; let thy misery be what it will, what it can, with\npatience endure it; thou mayst be restored as he was. _Terris proscriptus,\nad coelum propera; ab hominibus desertus, ad deum fuge_. \"The poor shall\nnot always be forgotten, the patient abiding of the meek shall not perish\nfor ever,\" Psal. x. 18. ver. 9. \"The Lord will be a refuge of the\noppressed, and a defence in the time of trouble.\"\n\n       \"Servus Epictetus, multilati corporis, Irus\n        Pauper: at haec inter charus erat superis.\"\n\n       \"Lame was Epictetus, and poor Irus,\n        Yet to them both God was propitious.\"\n\nLodovicus Vertomannus, that famous traveller, endured much misery, yet\nsurely, saith Scaliger, he was _vir deo charus_, in that he did escape so\nmany dangers, \"God especially protected him, he was dear unto him:\" _Modo\nin egestate, tribulatione, convalle deplorationis_, &c. \"Thou art now in\nthe vale of misery, in poverty, in agony,\" [3808]\"in temptation; rest,\neternity, happiness, immortality, shall be thy reward,\" as Chrysostom\npleads, \"if thou trust in God, and keep thine innocency.\" _Non si male\nnunc, et olim sic erit semper_; a good hour may come upon a sudden; [3809]\nexpect a little.\n\nYea, but this expectation is it which tortures me in the mean time; [3810]\n_futura expectans praesentibus angor_, whilst the grass grows the horse\nstarves: [3811]despair not, but hope well,\n\n[3812] \"Spera Batte, tibi melius lux Crastina ducet;\n        Dum spiras spera\"------\n\nCheer up, I say, be not dismayed; _Spes alit agricolas_: \"he that sows in\ntears, shall reap in joy,\" Psal. cxxvi. 7.\n\n       \"Si fortune me tormente,\n        Esperance me contente.\"\n\nHope refresheth, as much as misery depresseth; hard beginnings have many\ntimes prosperous events, and that may happen at last which never was yet.\n\"A desire accomplished delights the soul,\" Prov. xiii. 19.\n\n[3813] \"Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora:\"\n\n       \"Which makes m'enjoy my joys long wish'd at last,\n        Welcome that hour shall come when hope is past:\"\n\na lowering morning may turn to a fair afternoon, [3814]_Nube solet pulsa\ncandidus ire dies_. \"The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the\nheart, but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life,\" Prov. xiii. 12,\n[3815]_suavissimum est voti compos fieri_. Many men are both wretched and\nmiserable at first, but afterwards most happy: and oftentimes it so falls\nout, as [3816]Machiavel relates of Cosmo de Medici, that fortunate and\nrenowned citizen of Europe, \"that all his youth was full of perplexity,\ndanger, and misery, till forty years were past, and then upon a sudden the\nsun of his honour broke out as through a cloud.\" Huniades was fetched out\nof prison, and Henry the Third of Portugal out of a poor monastery, to be\ncrowned kings.\n\n       \"Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaque labra,\"\n\n       \"Many things happen between the cup and the lip,\"\n\nbeyond all hope and expectation many things fall out, and who knows what\nmay happen? _Nondum omnium dierum Soles occiderunt_, as Philippus said, all\nthe suns are not yet set, a day may come to make amends for all. \"Though my\nfather and mother forsake me, yet the Lord will gather me up,\" Psal. xxvii.\n10. \"Wait patiently on the Lord, and hope in him,\" Psal. xxxvii. 7. \"Be\nstrong, hope and trust in the Lord, and he will comfort thee, and give thee\nthine heart's desire,\" Psal. xxvii. 14.\n\n       \"Sperate et vosmet rebus servate secundis.\"\n\n       \"Hope, and reserve yourself for prosperity.\"\n\nFret not thyself because thou art poor, contemned, or not so well for the\npresent as thou wouldst be, not respected as thou oughtest to be, by birth,\nplace, worth; or that which is a double corrosive, thou hast been happy,\nhonourable, and rich, art now distressed and poor, a scorn of men, a burden\nto the world, irksome to thyself and others, thou hast lost all: _Miserum\nest fuisse, felicem_, and as Boethius calls it, _Infelicissimum genus\ninfortunii_; this made Timon half mad with melancholy, to think of his\nformer fortunes and present misfortunes: this alone makes many miserable\nwretches discontent. I confess it is a great misery to have been happy, the\nquintessence of infelicity, to have been honourable and rich, but yet\neasily to be endured: [3817]security succeeds, and to a judicious man a far\nbetter estate. The loss of thy goods and money is no loss; [3818] \"thou\nhast lost them, they would otherwise have lost thee.\" If thy money be gone,\n[3819]\"thou art so much the lighter,\" and as Saint Hierome persuades\nRusticus the monk, to forsake all and follow Christ: \"Gold and silver are\ntoo heavy metals for him to carry that seeks heaven.\"\n\n[3820] \"Vel nos in mare proximum,\n        Gemmas et lapides, aurum et inutile,\n        Summi materiam mali\n        Mittamus, scelerum si hene poenitet.\"\n\nZeno the philosopher lost all his goods by shipwreck, [3821]he might like\nof it, fortune had done him a good turn: _Opes a me, animum auferre non\npotest_: she can take away my means, but not my mind. He set her at\ndefiance ever after, for she could not rob him that had nought to lose: for\nhe was able to contemn more than they could possess or desire. Alexander\nsent a hundred talents of gold to Phocion of Athens for a present, because\nhe heard he was a good man: but Phocion returned his talents back again\nwith a _permitte me in posterum virum bonum esse_ to be a good man still;\nlet me be as I am: _Non mi aurum posco, nec mi precium_[3822]--That Theban\nCrates flung of his own accord his money into the sea, _abite nummi, ego\nvos mergam, ne mergar, a vobis_, I had rather drown you, than you should\ndrown me. Can stoics and epicures thus contemn wealth, and shall not we\nthat are Christians? It was _mascula vox et praeclara_, a generous speech\nof Cotta in [3823]Sallust, \"Many miseries have happened unto me at home,\nand in the wars abroad, of which by the help of God some I have endured,\nsome I have repelled, and by mine own valour overcome: courage was never\nwanting to my designs, nor industry to my intents: prosperity or adversity\ncould never alter my disposition.\" A wise man's mind, as Seneca holds,\n[3824] \"is like the state of the world above the moon, ever serene.\" Come\nthen what can come, befall what may befall, _infractum invictumque [3825]\nanimum opponas: Rebus angustis animosus atque fortis appare_. (Hor. _Od.\n11. lib. 2._) Hope and patience are two sovereign remedies for all, the\nsurest reposals, the softest cushions to lean on in adversity:\n\n[3826] \"Durum sed levius fit patientia,\n        Quicquid corrigere est nefas.\"\n\n       \"What can't be cured must be endured.\"\n\nIf it cannot be helped, or amended, [3827]make the best of it; [3828]\n_necessitati qui se accommodat, sapit_, he is wise that suits himself to\nthe time. As at a game at tables, so do by all such inevitable accidents.\n\n[3829] \"Ita vita est hominum quasi cum ludas tesseris,\n        Si illud quod est maxime opus jactu non cadit,\n        Illud quod cecidit forte, id arte ut corrigas;\"\n\nIf thou canst not fling what thou wouldst, play thy cast as well as thou\ncanst. Everything, saith [3830]Epictetus, hath two handles, the one to be\nheld by, the other not: 'tis in our choice to take and leave whether we\nwill (all which Simplicius's Commentator hath illustrated by many\nexamples), and 'tis in our power, as they say, to make or mar ourselves.\nConform thyself then to thy present fortune, and cut thy coat according to\nthy cloth, [3831]_Ut quimus (quod aiunt) quando quod volumus non licet_,\n\"Be contented with thy loss, state, and calling, whatsoever it is, and rest\nas well satisfied with thy present condition in this life:\"\n\n       \"Este quod es; quod sunt alii, sine quamlibet esse;\n        Quod non es, nolis; quod potus esse, velis.\"\n\n       \"Be as thou art; and as they are, so let\n        Others be still; what is and may be covert.\"\n\nAnd as he that is [3832]invited to a feast eats what is set before him, and\nlooks for no other, enjoy that thou hast, and ask no more of God than what\nhe thinks fit to bestow upon thee. _Non cuivis contingit adire Corinthum_,\nwe may not be all gentlemen, all Catos, or Laelii, as Tully telleth us, all\nhonourable, illustrious, and serene, all rich; but because mortal men want\nmany things, [3833]\"therefore,\" saith Theodoret, \"hath God diversely\ndistributed his gifts, wealth to one, skill to another, that rich men might\nencourage and set poor men at work, poor men might learn several trades to\nthe common good.\" As a piece of arras is composed of several parcels, some\nwrought of silk, some of gold, silver, crewel of diverse colours, all to\nserve for the exornation of the whole: music is made of diverse discords\nand keys, a total sum of many small numbers, so is a commonwealth of\nseveral unequal trades and callings. [3834]If all should be Croesi and\nDarii, all idle, all in fortunes equal, who should till the land? As\n[3835]Menenius Agrippa well satisfied the tumultuous rout of Rome, in his\nelegant apologue of the belly and the rest of the members. Who should build\nhouses, make our several stuffs for raiments? We should all be starved for\ncompany, as Poverty declared at large in Aristophanes' Plutus, and sue at\nlast to be as we were at first. And therefore God hath appointed this\ninequality of states, orders, and degrees, a subordination, as in all other\nthings. The earth yields nourishment to vegetables, sensible creatures feed\non vegetables, both are substitutes to reasonable souls, and men are\nsubject amongst themselves, and all to higher powers, so God would have it.\nAll things then being rightly examined and duly considered as they ought,\nthere is no such cause of so general discontent, 'tis not in the matter\nitself, but in our mind, as we moderate our passions and esteem of things.\n_Nihil aliud necessarium ut sis miser_ (saith [3836]Cardan) _quam ut te\nmiserum credas_, let thy fortune be what it will, 'tis thy mind alone that\nmakes thee poor or rich, miserable or happy. _Vidi ego_ (saith divine\nSeneca) _in villa hilari et amaena maestos, et media solitudine occupatos;\nnon locus, sed animus facit ad tranquillitatem_. I have seen men miserably\ndejected in a pleasant village, and some again well occupied and at good\nease in a solitary desert. 'Tis the mind not the place causeth\ntranquillity, and that gives true content. I will yet add a word or two for\na corollary. Many rich men, I dare boldly say it, that lie on down beds,\nwith delicacies pampered every day, in their well-furnished houses, live at\nless heart's ease, with more anguish, more bodily pain, and through their\nintemperance, more bitter hours, than many a prisoner or galley-slave;\n[3837]_Maecenas in pluma aeque vigilat ac Regulus in dolio_: those poor\nstarved Hollanders, whom [3838]Bartison their captain left in Nova Zembla,\nanno 1596, or those [3839]eight miserable Englishmen that were lately left\nbehind, to winter in a stove in Greenland, in 77 deg. of lat., 1630, so\npitifully forsaken, and forced to shift for themselves in a vast, dark, and\ndesert place, to strive and struggle with hunger, cold, desperation, and\ndeath itself. 'Tis a patient and quiet mind (I say it again and again)\ngives true peace and content. So for all other things, they are, as old\n[3840]Chremes told us, as we use them.\n\n       \"Parentes, patriam, amicos, genus, cognates, divitias,\n        Haec perinde sunt ac illius animus qui ea possidet;\n        Qui uti scit, ei bona; qui utitur non recte, mala.\"\n\n\"Parents, friends, fortunes, country, birth, alliance, &c., ebb and flow\nwith our conceit; please or displease, as we accept and construe them, or\napply them to ourselves.\" _Faber quisque fortunae suae_, and in some sort I\nmay truly say, prosperity and adversity are in our own hands. _Nemo\nlaeditur nisi a seipso_, and which Seneca confirms out of his judgment and\nexperience. [3841]\"Every man's mind is stronger than fortune, and leads him\nto what side he will; a cause to himself each one is of his good or bad\nlife.\" But will we, or nill we, make the worst of it, and suppose a man in\nthe greatest extremity, 'tis a fortune which some indefinitely prefer\nbefore prosperity; of two extremes it is the best. _Luxuriant animi rebus\nplerumque secundis_, men in [3842]prosperity forget God and themselves,\nthey are besotted with their wealth, as birds with henbane: [3843]\nmiserable if fortune forsake them, but more miserable if she tarry and\noverwhelm them: for when they come to be in great place, rich, they that\nwere most temperate, sober, and discreet in their private fortunes, as\nNero, Otho, Vitellius, Heliogabalus (_optimi imperatores nisi imperassent_)\ndegenerate on a sudden into brute beasts, so prodigious in lust, such\ntyrannical oppressors, &c., they cannot moderate themselves, they become\nmonsters, odious, harpies, what not? _Cum triumphos, opes, honores adepti\nsunt, ad voluptatem et otium deinceps se convertunt_: 'twas [3844]Cato's\nnote, \"they cannot contain.\" For that cause belike\n\n[3845] \"Eutrapilus cuicunque nocere volebat,\n        Vestimenta dabat pretiosa: beatus enim jam,\n        Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes,\n        Dormiet in lucem scorto, postponet honestum\n        Officium\"------\n\n       \"Eutrapilus when he would hurt a knave,\n        Gave him gay clothes and wealth to make him brave:\n        Because now rich he would quite change his mind,\n        Keep whores, fly out, set honesty behind.\"\n\nOn the other side, in adversity many mutter and repine, despair, &c., both\nbad, I confess,\n\n[3846]  ------\"ut calceus olim\n        Si pede major erit, subvertet: si minor, uret.\"\n\n\"As a shoe too big or too little, one pincheth, the other sets the foot\nawry,\" _sed e malis minimum_. If adversity hath killed his thousand,\nprosperity hath killed his ten thousand: therefore adversity is to be\npreferred; [3847]_haec froeno indiget, illa solatio: illa fallit, haec\ninstruit_: the one deceives, the other instructs; the one miserably happy,\nthe other happily miserable; and therefore many philosophers have\nvoluntarily sought adversity, and so much commend it in their precepts.\nDemetrius, in Seneca, esteemed it a great infelicity, that in his lifetime\nhe had no misfortune, _miserum cui nihil unquam accidisset, adversi_.\nAdversity then is not so heavily to be taken, and we ought not in such\ncases so much to macerate ourselves: there is no such odds in poverty and\nriches. To conclude in [3848]Hierom's words, \"I will ask our magnificoes\nthat build with marble, and bestow a whole manor on a thread, what\ndifference between them and Paul the Eremite, that bare old man? They drink\nin jewels, he in his hand: he is poor and goes to heaven, they are rich and\ngo to hell.\"\n\n\nMEMB. IV.\n_Against Servitude, Loss of Liberty, Imprisonment, Banishment_.\n\nServitude, loss of liberty, imprisonment, are no such miseries as they are\nheld to be: we are slaves and servants the best of us all: as we do\nreverence our masters, so do our masters their superiors: gentlemen serve\nnobles, and nobles subordinate to kings, _omne sub regno graviore regnum_,\nprinces themselves are God's servants, _reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis_.\nThey are subject to their own laws, and as the kings of China endure more\nthan slavish imprisonment, to maintain their state and greatness, they\nnever come abroad. Alexander was a slave to fear, Caesar of pride,\nVespasian to his money (_nihil enim refert, rerum sis servus an hominum_),\n[3849] Heliogabalus to his gut, and so of the rest. Lovers are slaves to\ntheir mistresses, rich men to their gold, courtiers generally to lust and\nambition, and all slaves to our affections, as Evangelus well discourseth\nin [3850]Macrobius, and [3851]Seneca the philosopher, _assiduam servitutem\nextremam et ineluctabilem_ he calls it, a continual slavery, to be so\ncaptivated by vices; and who is free? Why then dost thou repine? _Satis est\npotens_, Hierom saith, _qui servire non cogitur_. Thou carriest no burdens,\nthou art no prisoner, no drudge, and thousands want that liberty, those\npleasures which thou hast. Thou art not sick, and what wouldst thou have?\nBut _nitimur in vetitum_, we must all eat of the forbidden fruit. Were we\nenjoined to go to such and such places, we would not willingly go: but\nbeing barred of our liberty, this alone torments our wandering soul that we\nmay not go. A citizen of ours, saith [3852]Cardan, was sixty years of age,\nand had never been forth of the walls of the city of Milan; the prince\nhearing of it, commanded him not to stir out: being now forbidden that\nwhich all his life he had neglected, he earnestly desired, and being\ndenied, _dolore confectus mortem, obiit_, he died for grief.\n\nWhat I have said of servitude, I again say of imprisonment, we are all\nprisoners. [3853]What is our life but a prison? We are all imprisoned in an\nisland. The world itself to some men is a prison, our narrow seas as so\nmany ditches, and when they have compassed the globe of the earth, they\nwould fain go see what is done in the moon. In [3854]Muscovy and many other\nnorthern parts, all over Scandia, they are imprisoned half the year in\nstoves, they dare not peep out for cold. At [3855]Aden in Arabia they are\npenned in all day long with that other extreme of heat, and keep their\nmarkets in the night. What is a ship but a prison? And so many cities are\nbut as so many hives of bees, anthills; but that which thou abhorrest, many\nseek: women keep in all winter, and most part of summer, to preserve their\nbeauties; some for love of study: Demosthenes shaved his beard because he\nwould cut off all occasions from going abroad: how many monks and friars,\nanchorites, abandon the world. _Monachus in urbe, piscis in arido_. Art in\nprison? Make right use of it, and mortify thyself; [3856] \"Where may a man\ncontemplate better than in solitariness,\" or study more than in quietness?\nMany worthy men have been imprisoned all their lives, and it hath been\noccasion of great honour and glory to them, much public good by their\nexcellent meditation. [3857]Ptolomeus king of Egypt, _cum viribus\nattenuatis infirma valetudine laboraret, miro descendi studio affectus_,\n&c. now being taken with a grievous infirmity of body that he could not\nstir abroad, became Strato's scholar, fell hard to his book, and gave\nhimself wholly to contemplation, and upon that occasion (as mine author\nadds), _pulcherrimum regiae opulentiae monumentum_, &c., to his great\nhonour built that renowned library at Alexandria, wherein were 40,000\nvolumes. Severinus Boethius never writ so elegantly as in prison, Paul so\ndevoutly, for most of his epistles were dictated in his bands: \"Joseph,\"\nsaith [3858]Austin, \"got more credit in prison, than when he distributed\ncorn, and was lord of Pharaoh's house.\" It brings many a lewd, riotous\nfellow home, many wandering rogues it settles, that would otherwise have\nbeen like raving tigers, ruined themselves and others.\n\nBanishment is no grievance at all, _Omne solum forti patria, &c. et patria\nest ubicunque bene est_, that's a man's country where he is well at ease.\nMany travel for pleasure to that city, saith Seneca, to which thou art\nbanished, and what a part of the citizens are strangers born in other\nplaces? [3859]_Incolentibus patria_, 'tis their country that are born in\nit, and they would think themselves banished to go to the place which thou\nleavest, and from which thou art so loath to depart. 'Tis no disparagement\nto be a stranger, or so irksome to be an exile. [3860]\"The rain is a\nstranger to the earth, rivers to the sea, Jupiter in Egypt, the sun to us\nall. The soul is an alien to the body, a nightingale to the air, a swallow\nin a house, and Ganymede in heaven, an elephant at Rome, a Phoenix in\nIndia;\" and such things commonly please us best, which are most strange and\ncome the farthest off. Those old Hebrews esteemed the whole world Gentiles;\nthe Greeks held all barbarians but themselves; our modern Italians account\nof us as dull Transalpines by way of reproach, they scorn thee and thy\ncountry which thou so much admirest. 'Tis a childish humour to hone after\nhome, to be discontent at that which others seek; to prefer, as base\nislanders and Norwegians do, their own ragged island before Italy or\nGreece, the gardens of the world. There is a base nation in the north,\nsaith [3861]Pliny, called Chauci, that live amongst rocks and sands by the\nseaside, feed on fish, drink water: and yet these base people account\nthemselves slaves in respect, when they come to Rome. _Ita est profecto_\n(as he concludes) _multis fortuna parcit in poenam_, so it is, fortune\nfavours some to live at home, to their further punishment: 'tis want of\njudgment. All places are distant from heaven alike, the sun shines happily\nas warm in one city as in another, and to a wise man there is no difference\nof climes; friends are everywhere to him that behaves himself well, and a\nprophet is not esteemed in his own country. Alexander, Caesar, Trajan,\nAdrian, were as so many land-leapers, now in the east, now in the west,\nlittle at home; and Polus Venetus, Lod. Vertomannus, Pinzonus, Cadamustus,\nColumbus, Americus Vespucius, Vascus Gama, Drake, Candish, Oliver Anort,\nSchoutien, got, all their honour by voluntary expeditions. But you say such\nmen's travel is voluntary; we are compelled, and as malefactors must\ndepart; yet know this of [3862]Plato to be true, _ultori Deo summa cura\nperegrinus est_, God hath an especial care of strangers, \"and when he wants\nfriends and allies, he shall deserve better and find more favour with God\nand men.\" Besides the pleasure of peregrination, variety of objects will\nmake amends; and so many nobles, Tully, Aristides, Themistocles, Theseus,\nCodrus, &c. as have been banished, will give sufficient credit unto it.\nRead Pet. Alcionius his two books of this subject.\n\n\nMEMB. V.\n_Against Sorrow for Death of Friends or otherwise, vain Fear, &c._\n\nDeath and departure of friends are things generally grievous, [3863]\n_Omnium quae in humana vita contingunt, luctus atque mors sunt\nacerbissima_, the most austere and bitter accidents that can happen to a\nman in this life, _in aeternum valedicere_, to part for ever, to forsake\nthe world and all our friends, 'tis _ultimum terribilium_, the last and the\ngreatest terror, most irksome and troublesome unto us, [3864]_Homo toties\nmoritur, quoties amittit suos_. And though we hope for a better life,\neternal happiness, after these painful and miserable days, yet we cannot\ncompose ourselves willingly to die; the remembrance of it is most grievous\nunto us, especially to such who are fortunate and rich: they start at the\nname of death, as a horse at a rotten post. Say what you can of that other\nworld, [3865]Montezuma that Indian prince, _Bonum est esse hic_, they had\nrather be here. Nay many generous spirits, and grave staid men otherwise,\nare so tender in this, that at the loss of a dear friend they will cry out,\nroar, and tear their hair, lamenting some months after, howling \"O Hone,\"\nas those Irish women and [3866]Greeks at their graves, commit many indecent\nactions, and almost go beside themselves. My dear father, my sweet husband,\nmine only brother's dead, to whom shall I make my moan? _O me miserum! Quis\ndabit in lachrymas fontem_, &c. What shall I do?\n\n[3867] \"Sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors\n        Abstulit, hei misero frater adempte mihi?\"\n\n       \"My brother's death my study hath undone,\n        Woe's me, alas my brother he is gone.\"\n\nMezentius would not live after his son:\n\n[3868] \"Nunc vivo, nec adhuc homines lucemque relinquo,\n        Sed linquam\"------\n\nAnd Pompey's wife cried out at the news of her husband's death,\n\n[3869] \"Turpe mori post te solo non posse dolore,\n        Violenta luctu et nescia tolerandi,\"\n\nas [3870]Tacitus of Agrippina, not able to moderate her passions. So when\nshe heard her son was slain, she abruptly broke off her work, changed\ncountenance and colour, tore her hair, and fell a roaring downright.\n\n[3871]  ------\"subitus miserae color ossa reliquit,\n        Excussi manibus radii, revolutaque pensa:\n        Evolat infelix et foemineo ululatu\n        Scissa comam\"------\n\nAnother would needs run upon the sword's point after Euryalus' departure,\n\n[3872] \"Figite me, si qua est pietas, in me omnia tela\n        Conjicite o Rutili;\"------\n\nO let me die, some good man or other make an end of me. How did Achilles\ntake on for Patroclus' departure? A black cloud of sorrows overshadowed\nhim, saith Homer. Jacob rent his clothes, put sackcloth about his loins,\nsorrowed for his son a long season, and could not be comforted, but would\nneeds go down into the grave unto his son, Gen. xxxvii. 37. Many years\nafter, the remembrance of such friends, of such accidents, is most grievous\nunto us, to see or hear of it, though it concern not ourselves but others.\nScaliger saith of himself, that he never read Socrates' death, in Plato's\nPhaedon, but he wept: [3873]Austin shed tears when he read the destruction\nof Troy. But howsoever this passion of sorrow be violent, bitter, and\nseizeth familiarly on wise, valiant, discreet men, yet it may surely be\nwithstood, it may be diverted. For what is there in this life, that it\nshould be so dear unto us? or that we should so much deplore the departure\nof a friend? The greatest pleasures are common society, to enjoy one\nanother's presence, feasting, hawking, hunting, brooks, woods, hills,\nmusic, dancing, &c. all this is but vanity and loss of time, as I have\nsufficiently declared.\n\n[3874]  ------\"dum bibimus, dum serta, unguenta, puellas\n        Poscimus, obrepit non intellecta senectus.\"\n\n       \"Whilst we drink, prank ourselves, with wenches dally,\n        Old age upon's at unawares doth sally.\"\n\nAs alchemists spend that small modicum they have to get gold, and never\nfind it, we lose and neglect eternity, for a little momentary pleasure\nwhich we cannot enjoy, nor shall ever attain to in this life. We abhor\ndeath, pain, and grief, all, yet we will do nothing of that which should\nvindicate us from, but rather voluntarily thrust ourselves upon it. [3875]\n\"The lascivious prefers his whore before his life, or good estate; an angry\nman his revenge: a parasite his gut; ambitious, honours; covetous, wealth;\na thief his booty; a soldier his spoil; we abhor diseases, and yet we pull\nthem upon us.\" We are never better or freer from cares than when we sleep,\nand yet, which we so much avoid and lament, death is but a perpetual sleep;\nand why should it, as [3876]Epicurus argues, so much affright us? \"When we\nare, death is not: but when death is, then we are not:\" our life is tedious\nand troublesome unto him that lives best; [3877]\"'tis a misery to be born,\na pain to live, a trouble to die:\" death makes an end of our miseries, and\nyet we cannot consider of it; a little before [3878]Socrates drank his\nportion of cicuta, he bid the citizens of Athens cheerfully farewell, and\nconcluded his speech with this short sentence; \"My time is now come to be\ngone, I to my death, you to live on; but which of these is best, God alone\nknows.\" For there is no pleasure here but sorrow is annexed to it,\nrepentance follows it. [3879]\"If I feed liberally, I am likely sick or\nsurfeit: if I live sparingly my hunger and thirst is not allayed; I am well\nneither full nor fasting; if I live honest, I burn in lust;\" if I take my\npleasure, I tire and starve myself, and do injury to my body and soul.\n[3880]\"Of so small a quantity of mirth, how much sorrow? after so little\npleasure, how great misery?\" 'Tis both ways troublesome to me, to rise and\ngo to bed, to eat and provide my meat; cares and contentions attend me all\nday long, fears and suspicions all my life. I am discontented, and why\nshould I desire so much to live? But a happy death will make an end of all\nour woes and miseries; _omnibus una meis certa medela malis_; why shouldst\nnot thou then say with old Simeon since thou art so well affected, \"Lord\nnow let thy servant depart in peace:\" or with Paul, \"I desire to be\ndissolved, and to be with Christ\"? _Beata mors quae ad beatam vitam aditum\naperit_, 'tis a blessed hour that leads us to a [3881]blessed life, and\nblessed are they that die in the Lord. But life is sweet, and death is not\nso terrible in itself as the concomitants of it, a loathsome disease, pain,\nhorror, &c. and many times the manner of it, to be hanged, to be broken on\nthe wheel, to be burned alive. [3882]Servetus the heretic, that suffered in\nGeneva, when he was brought to the stake, and saw the executioner come with\nfire in his hand, _homo viso igne tam horrendum exclamavit, ut universum\npopulum perterrefecerit_, roared so loud, that he terrified the people. An\nold stoic would have scorned this. It troubles some to be unburied, or so:\n\n        ------\"non te optima mater\n        Condet humi, patriove onerabit membra sepulchro;\n        Alitibus linguere feris, et gurgite mersum\n        Unda feret, piscesque impasti vulnera lambent.\"\n\n       \"Thy gentle parents shall not bury thee,\n        Amongst thine ancestors entomb'd to be,\n        But feral fowl thy carcass shall devour,\n        Or drowned corps hungry fish maws shall scour.\"\n\nAs Socrates told Crito, it concerns me not what is done with me when I am\ndead; _Facilis jactura sepulchri_: I care not so long as I feel it not; let\nthem set mine head on the pike of Tenerife, and my quarters in the four\nparts of the world,--_pascam licet in cruce corvos_, let wolves or bears\ndevour me;--[3883]_Caelo tegitur qui non habet urnam_, the canopy of heaven\ncovers him that hath no tomb. So likewise for our friends, why should their\ndeparture so much trouble us? They are better as we hope, and for what then\ndost thou lament, as those do whom Paul taxed in his time, 1 Thes. iv. 13.\n\"that have no hope\"? 'Tis fit there should be some solemnity.\n\n[3884] \"Sed sepelire decet defunctum, pectore forti,\n        Constantes, unumque diem fletui indulgentes.\"\n\nJob's friends said not a word to him the first seven days, but let sorrow\nand discontent take their course, themselves sitting sad and silent by him.\nWhen Jupiter himself wept for Sarpedon, what else did the poet insinuate,\nbut that some sorrow is good\n\n[3885] \"Quis matrem nisi mentis inops in funere nati\n        Flere vetat?\"------\n\nwho can blame a tender mother if she weep for her children? Beside, as\n[3886]Plutarch holds, 'tis not in our power not to lament, _Indolentia non\ncuivis contingit_, it takes away mercy and pity, not to be sad; 'tis a\nnatural passion to weep for our friends, an irresistible passion to lament\nand grieve. \"I know not how\" (saith Seneca) \"but sometimes 'tis good to be\nmiserable in misery: and for the most part all grief evacuates itself by\ntears,\"\n\n[3887]  ------\"est quaedam flere voluptas,\n        Expletur lachrymis egeriturque dolor:\"\n\n\"yet after a day's mourning or two, comfort thyself for thy heaviness,\"\nEccles. xxxviii. 17. [3888]_Non decet defunctum ignavo quaestu prosequi_;\n'twas Germanicus' advice of old, that we should not dwell too long upon our\npassions, to be desperately sad, immoderate grievers, to let them\ntyrannise, there's _indolentiae, ars_, a medium to be kept: we do not\n(saith [3889]Austin) forbid men to grieve, but to grieve overmuch. \"I\nforbid not a man to be angry, but I ask for what cause he is so? Not to be\nsad, but why is he sad? Not to fear, but wherefore is he afraid?\" I require\na moderation as well as a just reason. [3890]The Romans and most civil\ncommonwealths have set a time to such solemnities, they must not mourn\nafter a set day, \"or if in a family a child be born, a daughter or son\nmarried, some state or honour be conferred, a brother be redeemed from his\nbands, a friend from his enemies,\" or the like, they must lament no more.\nAnd 'tis fit it should be so; to what end is all their funeral pomp,\ncomplaints, and tears? When Socrates was dying, his friends Apollodorus and\nCrito, with some others, were weeping by him, which he perceiving, asked\nthem what they meant: [3891]\"for that very cause he put all the women out\nof the room, upon which words of his they were abashed, and ceased from\ntheir tears.\" Lodovicus Cortesius, a rich lawyer of Padua (as [3892]\nBernardinus Scardeonius relates) commanded by his last will, and a great\nmulct if otherwise to his heir, that no funeral should be kept for him, no\nman should lament: but as at a wedding, music and minstrels to be provided;\nand instead of black mourners, he took order, [3893]\"that twelve virgins\nclad in green should carry him to the church.\" His will and testament was\naccordingly performed, and he buried in St. Sophia's church. [3894]Tully\nwas much grieved for his daughter Tulliola's death at first, until such\ntime that he had confirmed his mind with some philosophical precepts,\n[3895]\"then he began to triumph over fortune and grief, and for her\nreception into heaven to be much more joyed than before he was troubled for\nher loss.\" If a heathen man could so fortify himself from philosophy, what\nshall a Christian from divinity? Why dost thou so macerate thyself? 'Tis an\ninevitable chance, the first statute in Magna Charta, an everlasting Act of\nParliament, all must [3896]die.\n\n[3897] \"Constat aeterna positumque lege est,\n        Ut constet genitum nihil.\"\n\nIt cannot be revoked, we are all mortal, and these all commanding gods and\nprinces \"die like men:\"[3898]--_involvit humile pariter et celsum caput,\naquatque summis infima_. \"O weak condition of human estate,\" Sylvius\nexclaims: [3899]Ladislaus, king of Bohemia, eighteen years of age, in the\nflower of his youth, so potent, rich, fortunate and happy, in the midst of\nall his friends, amongst so many [3900]physicians, now ready to be [3901]\nmarried, in thirty-six hours sickened and died. We must so be gone sooner\nor later all, and as Calliopeius in the comedy took his leave of his\nspectators and auditors, _Vos valete et plaudite, Calliopeius recensui_,\nmust we bid the world farewell (_Exit Calliopeius_), and having now played\nour parts, for ever be gone. Tombs and monuments have the like fate, _data\nsunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris_, kingdoms, provinces, towns, and cities\nhave their periods, and are consumed. In those flourishing times of Troy,\nMycenae was the fairest city in Greece, _Graeciae cunctae imperitabat_, but\nit, alas, and that [3902]\"Assyrian Nineveh are quite overthrown:\" the like\nfate hath that Egyptian and Boeotian Thebes, Delos, _commune Graeciae,\nconciliabulum_, the common council-house of Greece, [3903]and Babylon, the\ngreatest city that ever the sun shone on, hath now nothing but walls and\nrubbish left. [3904]_Quid Pandioniae restat nisi nomen Athenae_? Thus\n[3905]Pausanias complained in his times. And where is Troy itself now,\nPersepolis, Carthage, Cizicum, Sparta, Argos, and all those Grecian cities?\nSyracuse and Agrigentum, the fairest towns in Sicily, which had sometimes\n700,000 inhabitants, are now decayed: the names of Hieron, Empedocles, &c.,\nof those mighty numbers of people, only left. One Anacharsis is remembered\namongst the Scythians; the world itself must have an end; and every part of\nit. _Caeterae igitur urbes sunt mortales_, as Peter [3906]Gillius concludes\nof Constantinople, _haec sane quamdiu erunt homines, futura mihi videtur\nimmortalis_; but 'tis not so: nor site, nor strength, nor sea nor land, can\nvindicate a city, but it and all must vanish at last. And as to a traveller\ngreat mountains seem plains afar off, at last are not discerned at all;\ncities, men, monuments decay,--_nec solidis prodest sua machina terris_,\n[3907]the names are only left, those at length forgotten, and are involved\nin perpetual night.\n\n[3908]\"Returning out of Asia, when I sailed from Aegina toward Megara, I\nbegan\" (saith Servius Sulpicius, in a consolatory epistle of his to Tully)\n\"to view the country round about. Aegina was behind me, Megara before,\nPiraeus on the right hand, Corinth on the left, what flourishing towns\nheretofore, now prostrate and overwhelmed before mine eyes? I began to\nthink with myself, alas, why are we men so much disquieted with the\ndeparture of a friend, whose life is much shorter? [3909]When so many\ngoodly cities lie buried before us. Remember, O Servius, thou art a man;\nand with that I was much confirmed, and corrected myself.\" Correct then\nlikewise, and comfort thyself in this, that we must necessarily die, and\nall die, that we shall rise again: as Tully held; _Jucundiorque multo\ncongressus noster futurus, quam insuavis et acerbus digressus_, our second\nmeeting shall be much more pleasant than our departure was grievous.\n\nAye, but he was my most dear and loving friend, my sole friend,\n\n[3910] \"Quis deciderio sit pudor aut modus\n        Tam chari capitis?\"------\n\n       \"And who can blame my woe?\"\n\nThou mayst be ashamed, I say with [3911]Seneca, to confess it, \"in such a\n[3912]tempest as this to have but one anchor,\" go seek another: and for his\npart thou dost him great injury to desire his longer life. [3913]\"Wilt thou\nhave him crazed and sickly still,\" like a tired traveller that comes weary\nto his inn, begin his journey afresh, \"or to be freed from his miseries;\nthou hast more need rejoice that he is gone.\" Another complains of a most\nsweet wife, a young wife, _Nondum sustulerat flavum Proserpina crinem_,\nsuch a wife as no mortal man ever had, so good a wife, but she is now dead\nand gone, _laethaeoque jacet condita sarcophago_. I reply to him in\nSeneca's words, if such a woman at least ever was to be had, [3914]\"He did\neither so find or make her; if he found her, he may as happily find\nanother;\" if he made her, as Critobulus in Xenophon did by his, he may as\ngood cheap inform another, _et bona tam sequitur, quam bona prima fuit_; he\nneed not despair, so long as the same master is to be had. But was she\ngood? Had she been so tired peradventure as that Ephesian widow in\nPetronius, by some swaggering soldier, she might not have held out. Many a\nman would have been willingly rid of his: before thou wast bound, now thou\nart free; [3915]\"and 'tis but a folly to love thy fetters though they be of\ngold.\" Come into a third place, you shall have an aged father sighing for a\nson, a pretty child;\n\n[3916] \"Impube pectus quale vel impia\n        Molliret Thracum pectora.\"\n\n        ------\"He now lies asleep,\n        Would make an impious Thracian weep.\"\n\nOr some fine daughter that died young, _Nondum experta novi gaudia prima\ntori_. Or a forlorn son for his deceased father. But why? _Prior exiit,\nprior intravit_, he came first, and he must go first. [3917]_Tu frustra\npius, heu_, &c. What, wouldst thou have the laws of nature altered, and him\nto live always? Julius Caesar, Augustus, Alcibiades, Galen, Aristotle, lost\ntheir fathers young. And why on the other side shouldst thou so heavily\ntake the death of thy little son?\n\n[3918] \"Num quia nec fato, merita nec morte peribat,\n        Sed miser ante diem\"------\n\nhe died before his time, perhaps, not yet come to the solstice of his age,\nyet was he not mortal? Hear that divine [3919]Epictetus, \"If thou covet thy\nwife, friends, children should live always, thou art a fool.\" He was a fine\nchild indeed, _dignus Apollineis lachrymis_, a sweet, a loving, a fair, a\nwitty child, of great hope, another Eteoneus, whom Pindarus the poet and\nAristides the rhetorician so much lament; but who can tell whether he would\nhave been an honest man? He might have proved a thief, a rogue, a\nspendthrift, a disobedient son, vexed and galled thee more than all the\nworld beside, he might have wrangled with thee and disagreed, or with his\nbrothers, as Eteocles and Polynices, and broke thy heart; he is now gone to\neternity, as another Ganymede, in the [3920]flower of his youth, \"as if he\nhad risen,\" saith [3921]Plutarch, \"from the midst of a feast\" before he was\ndrunk, \"the longer he had lived, the worse he would have been,\" _et quo\nvita longior_, (Ambrose thinks) _culpa numerosior_, more sinful, more to\nanswer he would have had. If he was naught, thou mayst be glad he is gone;\nif good, be glad thou hadst such a son. Or art thou sure he was good? It\nmay be he was an hypocrite, as many are, and howsoever he spake thee fair,\nperadventure he prayed, amongst the rest that Icaro Menippus heard at\nJupiter's whispering place in Lucian, for his father's death, because he\nnow kept him short, he was to inherit much goods, and many fair manors\nafter his decease. Or put case he was very good, suppose the best, may not\nthy dead son expostulate with thee, as he did in the same [3922]Lucian,\n\"why dost thou lament my death, or call me miserable that am much more\nhappy than thyself? what misfortune is befallen me? Is it because I am not\nso bald, crooked, old, rotten, as thou art? What have I lost, some of your\ngood cheer, gay clothes, music, singing, dancing, kissing, merry-meetings,\n_thalami lubentias_, &c., is that it? Is it not much better not to hunger\nat all than to eat: not to thirst than to drink to satisfy thirst: not to\nbe cold than to put on clothes to drive away cold? You had more need\nrejoice that I am freed from diseases, agues, cares, anxieties, livor,\nlove, covetousness, hatred, envy, malice, that I fear no more thieves,\ntyrants, enemies, as you do.\" [3923]_Ad cinerem et manes credis curare\nsepultos_? \"Do they concern us at all, think you, when we are once dead?\"\nCondole not others then overmuch, \"wish not or fear thy death.\" [3924]\n_Summum nec optes diem nec metuas_; 'tis to no purpose.\n\n       \"Excessi e vitae aerumnis facilisque lubensque\n        Ne perjora ipsa morte dehinc videam.\"\n\n       \"I left this irksome life with all mine heart,\n        Lest worse than death should happen to my part.\"\n\n[3925]Cardinal Brundusinus caused this epitaph in Rome to be inscribed on\nhis tomb, to show his willingness to die, and tax those that were so both\nto depart. Weep and howl no more then, 'tis to small purpose; and as Tully\nadviseth us in the like case, _Non quos amisimus, sed quantum lugere par\nsit cogitemus_: think what we do, not whom we have lost. So David did, 2\nSam. xxii., \"While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; but being\nnow dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him again? I shall go to him, but\nhe cannot return to me.\" He that doth otherwise is an intemperate, a weak,\na silly, and indiscreet man. Though Aristotle deny any part of intemperance\nto be conversant about sorrow, I am of [3926]Seneca's mind, \"he that is\nwise is temperate, and he that is temperate is constant, free from passion,\nand he that is such a one, is without sorrow,\" as all wise men should be.\nThe [3927]Thracians wept still when a child was born, feasted and made\nmirth when any man was buried: and so should we rather be glad for such as\ndie well, that they are so happily freed from the miseries of this life.\nWhen Eteoneus, that noble young Greek, was so generally lamented by his\nfriends, Pindarus the poet feigns some god saying, _Silete homines, non\nenim miser est_, &c. be quiet good folks, this young man is not so\nmiserable as you think; he is neither gone to Styx nor Acheron, _sed\ngloriosus et senii expers heros_, he lives for ever in the Elysian fields.\nHe now enjoys that happiness which your great kings so earnestly seek, and\nwears that garland for which ye contend. If our present weakness is such,\nwe cannot moderate our passions in this behalf, we must divert them by all\nmeans, by doing something else, thinking of another subject. The Italians\nmost part sleep away care and grief, if it unseasonably seize upon them,\nDanes, Dutchmen, Polanders and Bohemians drink it down, our countrymen go\nto plays: do something or other, let it not transpose thee, or by [3928]\n\"premeditation make such accidents familiar,\" as Ulysses that wept for his\ndog, but not for his wife, _quod paratus esset animo obfirmato_, (Plut. _de\nanim. tranq._) \"accustom thyself, and harden beforehand by seeing other\nmen's calamities, and applying them to thy present estate;\" _Praevisum est\nlevius quod fuit ante malum_. I will conclude with [3929]Epictetus, \"If\nthou lovest a pot, remember 'tis but a, pot thou lovest, and thou wilt not\nbe troubled when 'tis broken: if thou lovest a son or wife, remember they\nwere mortal, and thou wilt not be so impatient.\" And for false fears and\nall other fortuitous inconveniences, mischances, calamities, to resist and\nprepare ourselves, not to faint is best: [3930]_Stultum est timere quod\nvitari non potest_, 'tis a folly to fear that which cannot be avoided, or\nto be discouraged at all.\n\n[3931] \"Nam quisquis trepidus pavet vel optat,\n        Abjecit clypeum, locoque motus\n        Nectit qua valeat trahi catenam.\"\n\n\"For he that so faints or fears, and yields to his passion, flings away his\nown weapons, makes a cord to bind himself, and pulls a beam upon his own\nhead.\"\n\n\nMEMB. VI.\n_Against Envy, Livor, Emulation, Hatred, Ambition, Self-love, and all other\nAffections_.\n\nAgainst those other [3932]passions and affections, there is no better\nremedy than as mariners when they go to sea, provide all things necessary\nto resist a tempest: to furnish ourselves with philosophical and Divine\nprecepts, other men's examples, [3933]_Periculum ex aliis facere, sibi quod\nex usu siet_: To balance our hearts with love, charity, meekness, patience,\nand counterpoise those irregular motions of envy, livor, spleen, hatred,\nwith their opposite virtues, as we bend a crooked staff another way, to\noppose [3934]\"sufferance to labour, patience to reproach,\" bounty to\ncovetousness, fortitude to pusillanimity, meekness to anger, humility to\npride, to examine ourselves for what cause we are so much disquieted, on\nwhat ground, what occasion, is it just or feigned? And then either to\npacify ourselves by reason, to divert by some other object, contrary\npassion, or premeditation. [3935]_Meditari secum oportet quo pacto adversam\naerumnam ferat, Paricla, damna, exilia peregre rediens semper cogitet, aut\nfilii peccatum, aut uxoris mortem, aut morbum filiae, communia esse haec:\nfieri posse, ut ne quid animo sit novum_. To make them familiar, even all\nkind of calamities, that when they happen they may be less troublesome unto\nus. _In secundis meditare, quo pacto feras adversa_: or out of mature\njudgment to avoid the effect, or disannul the cause, as they do that are\ntroubled with toothache, pull them quite out.\n\n[3936] \"Ut vivat castor, sibi testes amputat ipse;\n        Tu quoque siqua nocent, abjice, tutus eris.\"\n\n       \"The beaver bites off's stones to save the rest:\n        Do thou the like with that thou art opprest.\"\n\nOr as they that play at wasters, exercise themselves by a few cudgels how\nto avoid an enemy's blows: let us arm ourselves against all such violent\nincursions, which may invade our minds. A little experience and practice\nwill inure us to it; _vetula vulpes_, as the proverb saith, _laqueo haud\ncapitur_, an old fox is not so easily taken in a snare; an old soldier in\nthe world methinks should not be disquieted, but ready to receive all\nfortunes, encounters, and with that resolute captain, come what may come,\nto make answer,\n\n[3937]  ------\"non ulla laborum\n        O virgo nova mi facies inopinaque surgit,\n        Omnia percepi atque animo mecum ante peregi.\"\n\n       \"No labour comes at unawares to me,\n        For I have long before cast what may be.\"\n\n[3938]  ------\"non hoc primum mea pectora vulnus\n        Senserunt, graviora tuli\"------\n\nThe commonwealth of [3939]Venice in their armoury have this inscription,\n\"Happy is that city which in time of peace thinks of war,\" a fit motto for\nevery man's private house; happy is the man that provides for a future\nassault. But many times we complain, repine and mutter without a cause, we\ngive way to passions we may resist, and will not. Socrates was bad by\nnature, envious, as he confessed to Zophius the physiognomer, accusing him\nof it, froward and lascivious: but as he was Socrates, he did correct and\namend himself. Thou art malicious, envious, covetous, impatient, no doubt,\nand lascivious, yet as thou art a Christian, correct and moderate thyself.\n'Tis something, I confess, and able to move any man, to see himself\ncontemned, obscure, neglected, disgraced, undervalued, [3940]\"left behind;\"\nsome cannot endure it, no not constant Lipsius, a man discreet otherwise,\nyet too weak and passionate in this, as his words express, [3941]_collegas\nolim, quos ego sine fremitu non intueor, nuper terrae filios, nunc\nMaecenates et Agrippas habeo,--summo jam monte potitos_. But he was much to\nblame for it: to a wise staid man this is nothing, we cannot all be\nhonoured and rich, all Caesars; if we will be content, our present state is\ngood, and in some men's opinion to be preferred. Let them go on, get\nwealth, offices, titles, honours, preferments, and what they will\nthemselves, by chance, fraud, imposture, simony, and indirect means, as too\nmany do, by bribery, flattery, and parasitical insinuation, by impudence\nand time-serving, let them climb up to advancement in despite of virtue,\nlet them \"go before, cross me on every side,\" _me non offendunt modo non\nin, oculos incurrant_, [3942]as he said, correcting his former error, they\ndo not offend me, so long as they run not into mine eyes. I am inglorious\nand poor, _composita paupertate_, but I live secure and quiet: they are\ndignified, have great means, pomp, and state, they are glorious; but what\nhave they with it? [3943]\"Envy, trouble, anxiety, as much labour to\nmaintain their place with credit, as to get it at first.\" I am contented\nwith my fortunes, _spectator e longinquo_, and love _Neptunum procul a\nterra spectare furentem_: he is ambitious, and not satisfied with his: \"but\nwhat [3944]gets he by it? to have all his life laid open, his reproaches\nseen: not one of a thousand but he hath done more worthy of dispraise and\nanimadversion than commendation; no better means to help this than to be\nprivate.\" Let them run, ride, strive as so many fishes for a crumb, scrape,\nclimb, catch, snatch, cozen, collogue, temporise and fleer, take all\namongst them, wealth, honour, [3945]and get what they can, it offends me\nnot:\n\n[3946]  ------\"me mea tellus\n        Lare secreto tutoque tegat,\"\n\n\"I am well pleased with my fortunes,\" [3947]_Vivo et regno simul ista\nrelinquens_.\n\nI have learned \"in what state soever I am, therewith to be contented,\"\nPhilip, iv 11. Come what can come, I am prepared. _Nave ferar magna an\nparva, ferar unus et idem_. I am the same. I was once so mad to bustle\nabroad, and seek about for preferment, tire myself, and trouble all my\nfriends, _sed nihil labor tantus profecit nam dum alios amicorum mors\navocat, aliis ignotus sum, his invisus, alii large promittunt, intercedunt\nilli mecum soliciti, hi vana spe lactant; dum alios ambio, hos capto, illis\ninnotesco, aetas perit, anni defluunt, amici fatigantur, ego deferor, et\njam, mundi taesus, humanaeque satur infidelitatis acquiesco_. [3948]And so\nI say still; although I may not deny, but that I have had some [3949]\nbountiful patrons, and noble benefactors, _ne sim interim ingratus_, and I\ndo thankfully acknowledge it, I have received some kindness, _quod Deus\nillis beneficium rependat, si non pro votis, fortasse pro meritis_, more\nperadventure than I deserve, though not to my desire, more of them than I\ndid expect, yet not of others to my desert; neither am I ambitious or\ncovetous, for this while, or a Suffenus to myself; what I have said,\nwithout prejudice or alteration shall stand. And now as a mired horse that\nstruggles at first with all his might and main to get out, but when he sees\nno remedy, that his beating will not serve, lies still, I have laboured in\nvain, rest satisfied, and if I may usurp that of [3950]Prudentius,\n\n       \"Inveni portum; spes et fortuna valete,\n        Nil mihi vobiscum, ludite nunc alios.\"\n\n       \"Mine haven's found, fortune and hope adieu,\n        Mock others now, for I have done with you.\"\n\n\nMEMB. VII.\n_Against Repulse, Abuses, Injuries, Contempts, Disgraces, Contumelies,\nSlanders, Scoffs, &c._\n\nI may not yet conclude, think to appease passions, or quiet the mind, till\nsuch time as I have likewise removed some other of their more eminent and\nordinary causes, which produce so grievous tortures and discontents: to\ndivert all, I cannot hope; to point alone at some few of the chiefest, is\nthat which I aim at.\n\n_Repulse_.] Repulse and disgrace are two main causes of discontent, but to\nan understanding man not so hardly to be taken. Caesar himself hath been\ndenied, [3951]and when two stand equal in fortune, birth, and all other\nqualities alike, one of necessity must lose. Why shouldst thou take it so\ngrievously? It hath a familiar thing for thee thyself to deny others. If\nevery man might have what he would, we should all be deified, emperors,\nkings, princes; if whatsoever vain hope suggests, insatiable appetite\naffects, our preposterous judgment thinks fit were granted, we should have\nanother chaos in an instant, a mere confusion. It is some satisfaction to\nhim that is repelled, that dignities, honours, offices, are not always\ngiven by desert or worth, but for love, affinity, friendship, affection,\n[3952]great men's letters, or as commonly they are bought and sold.\n[3953]\"Honours in court are bestowed not according to men's virtues and\ngood conditions\" (as an old courtier observes), \"but as every man hath\nmeans, or more potent friends, so he is preferred.\" With us in France\n([3954]for so their own countryman relates) \"most part the matter is\ncarried by favour and grace; he that can get a great man to be his\nmediator, runs away with all the preferment.\" _Indignissimus plerumque\npraefertur, Vatinius Catoni, illaudatus laudatissimo_;\n\n[3955]  ------\"servi dominantur; aselli\n        Ornantur phaleris, dephalerantur equi.\"\n\nAn illiterate fool sits in a man's seat, and the common people hold him\nlearned, grave and wise. \"One professeth\" ([3956]Cardan well notes) \"for a\nthousand crowns, but he deserves not ten, when as he that deserves a\nthousand cannot get ten.\" _Solarium non dat multis salem._ As good horses\ndraw in carts, as coaches. And oftentimes, which Machiavel seconds, [3957]\n_Principes non sunt qui ob insignem virtutem principatu digni sunt_, he\nthat is most worthy wants employment; he that hath skill to be a pilot\nwants a ship, and he that could govern a commonwealth, a world itself, a\nking in conceit, wants means to exercise his worth, hath not a poor office\nto manage, and yet all this while he is a better man that is fit to reign,\n_etsi careat regno_, though he want a kingdom, [3958]\"than he that hath\none, and knows not how to rule it:\" a lion serves not always his keeper,\nbut oftentimes the keeper the lion, and as [3959]Polydore Virgil hath it,\n_multi reges ut pupilli ob inscitiam non regunt sed reguntur_. Hieron of\nSyracuse was a brave king, but wanted a kingdom; Perseus of Macedon had\nnothing of a king, but the bare name and title, for he could not govern it:\nso great places are often ill bestowed, worthy persons unrespected. Many\ntimes, too, the servants have more means than the masters whom they serve,\nwhich [3960]Epictetus counts an eyesore and inconvenient. But who can help\nit? It is an ordinary thing in these days to see a base impudent ass,\nilliterate, unworthy, insufficient, to be preferred before his betters,\nbecause he can put himself forward, because he looks big, can bustle in the\nworld, hath a fair outside, can temporise, collogue, insinuate, or hath\ngood store of friends and money, whereas a more discreet, modest, and\nbetter-deserving man shall lie hid or have a repulse. 'Twas so of old, and\never will be, and which Tiresias advised Ulysses in the [3961]\npoet,--_Accipe qua ratione queas ditescere_, &c., is still in use; lie,\nflatter, and dissemble: if not, as he concludes,--_Ergo pauper eris_, then\ngo like a beggar as thou art. Erasmus, Melancthon, Lipsius, Budaeus,\nCardan, lived and died poor. Gesner was a silly old man, _baculo innixus_,\namongst all those huffing cardinals, swelling bishops that flourished in\nhis time, and rode on foot-clothes. It is not honesty, learning, worth,\nwisdom, that prefers men, \"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to\nthe strong,\" but as the wise man said, [3962]Chance, and sometimes a\nridiculous chance. [3963]_Casus plerumque ridiculus multos elevavit._ 'Tis\nfortune's doings, as they say, which made Brutus now dying exclaim, _O\nmisera virtus, ergo nihil quam verba eras, atqui ego te tanquam rem\nexercebam, sed tu serviebas fortunae._ [3964]Believe it hereafter, O my\nfriends! virtue serves fortune. Yet be not discouraged (O my well deserving\nspirits) with this which I have said, it may be otherwise, though seldom I\nconfess, yet sometimes it is. But to your farther content, I'll tell you a\n[3965]tale. In Maronia pia, or Maronia felix, I know not whether, nor how\nlong since, nor in what cathedral church, a fat prebend fell void. The\ncarcass scarce cold, many suitors were up in an instant. The first had rich\nfriends, a good purse, and he was resolved to outbid any man before he\nwould lose it, every man supposed he should carry it. The second was my\nlord Bishop's chaplain (in whose gift it was), and he thought it his due to\nhave it. The third was nobly born, and he meant to get it by his great\nparents, patrons, and allies. The fourth stood upon his worth, he had newly\nfound out strange mysteries in chemistry, and other rare inventions, which\nhe would detect to the public good. The fifth was a painful preacher, and\nhe was commended by the whole parish where he dwelt, he had all their hands\nto his certificate. The sixth was the prebendary's son lately deceased, his\nfather died in debt (for it, as they say), left a wife and many poor\nchildren. The seventh stood upon fair promises, which to him and his noble\nfriends had been formerly made for the next place in his lordship's gift.\nThe eighth pretended great losses, and what he had suffered for the church,\nwhat pains he had taken at home and abroad, and besides he brought\nnoblemen's letters. The ninth had married a kinswoman, and he sent his wife\nto sue for him. The tenth was a foreign doctor, a late convert, and wanted\nmeans. The eleventh would exchange for another, he did not like the\nformer's site, could not agree with his neighbours and fellows upon any\nterms, he would be gone. The twelfth and last was (a suitor in conceit) a\nright honest, civil, sober man, an excellent scholar, and such a one as\nlived private in the university, but he had neither means nor money to\ncompass it; besides he hated all such courses, he could not speak for\nhimself, neither had he any friends to solicit his cause, and therefore\nmade no suit, could not expect, neither did he hope for, or look after it.\nThe good bishop amongst a jury of competitors thus perplexed, and not yet\nresolved what to do, or on whom to bestow it, at the last, of his own\naccord, mere motion, and bountiful nature, gave it freely to the university\nstudent, altogether unknown to him but by fame; and to be brief, the\nacademical scholar had the prebend sent him for a present. The news was no\nsooner published abroad, but all good students rejoiced, and were much\ncheered up with it, though some would not believe it; others, as men\namazed, said it was a miracle; but one amongst the rest thanked God for it,\nand said, _Nunc juvat tandem studiosum esse, et Deo integro corde servire_.\nYou have heard my tale: but alas it is but a tale, a mere fiction, 'twas\nnever so, never like to be, and so let it rest. Well, be it so then, they\nhave wealth and honour, fortune and preferment, every man (there's no\nremedy) must scramble as he may, and shift as he can; yet Cardan comforted\nhimself with this, [3966]\"the star Fomahant would make him immortal,\" and\nthat [3967]after his decease his books should be found in ladies' studies:\n[3968]_Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori_. But why shouldst thou take thy\nneglect, thy canvas so to heart? It may be thou art not fit; but a\n[3969]child that puts on his father's shoes, hat, headpiece, breastplate,\nbreeches, or holds his spear, but is neither able to wield the one, or wear\nthe other; so wouldst thou do by such an office, place, or magistracy: thou\nart unfit: \"And what is dignity to an unworthy man, but (as [3970]\nSalvianus holds) a gold ring in a swine's snout?\" Thou art a brute. Like a\nbad actor (so [3971]Plutarch compares such men in a tragedy, _diadema fert,\nat vox non auditur_: Thou wouldst play a king's part, but actest a clown,\nspeakest like an ass. [3972]_Magna petis Phaeton et quae non viribus\nistis_, &c., as James and John, the sons of Zebedee, did ask they knew not\nwhat: _nescis temerarie nescis_; thou dost, as another Suffenus, overween\nthyself; thou art wise in thine own conceit, but in other more mature\njudgment altogether unfit to manage such a business. Or be it thou art more\ndeserving than any of thy rank, God in his providence hath reserved thee\nfor some other fortunes, _sic superis visum_. Thou art humble as thou art,\nit may be; hadst thou been preferred, thou wouldst have forgotten God and\nthyself, insulted over others, contemned thy friends, [3973]been a block, a\ntyrant, or a demigod, _sequiturque superbia formam_: [3974]\"Therefore,\"\nsaith Chrysostom, \"good men do not always find grace and favour, lest they\nshould be puffed up with turgent titles, grow insolent and proud.\"\n\nInjuries, abuses, are very offensive, and so much the more in that they\nthink _veterem ferendo invitant novam_, \"by taking one they provoke\nanother:\" but it is an erroneous opinion, for if that were true, there\nwould be no end of abusing each other; _lis litem generat_; 'tis much\nbetter with patience to bear, or quietly to put it up. If an ass kick me,\nsaith Socrates, shall I strike him again? And when [3975]his wife Xantippe\nstruck and misused him, to some friends that would have had him strike her\nagain, he replied, that he would not make them sport, or that they should\nstand by and say, _Eia Socrates, eia Xantippe_, as we do when dogs fight,\nanimate them the more by clapping of hands. Many men spend themselves,\ntheir goods, friends, fortunes, upon small quarrels, and sometimes at other\nmen's procurements, with much vexation of spirit and anguish of mind, all\nwhich with good advice, or mediation of friends, might have been happily\ncomposed, or if patience had taken place. Patience in such cases is a most\nsovereign remedy, to put up, conceal, or dissemble it, to [3976]forget and\nforgive, [3977]\"not seven, but seventy-seven times, as often as he repents\nforgive him;\" Luke xvii. 3. as our Saviour enjoins us, stricken, \"to turn\nthe other side:\" as our [3978]Apostle persuades us, \"to recompense no man\nevil for evil, but as much as is possible to have peace with all men: not\nto avenge ourselves, and we shall heap burning coals upon our adversary's\nhead.\" \"For [3979]if you put up wrong\" (as Chrysostom comments), \"you get\nthe victory; he that loseth his money, loseth not the conquest in this our\nphilosophy.\" If he contend with thee, submit thyself unto him first, yield\nto him. _Durum et durum non faciunt murum_, as the diverb is, two\nrefractory spirits will never agree, the only means to overcome is to\nrelent, _obsequio vinces_. Euclid in Plutarch, when his brother had angered\nhim, swore he would be revenged; but he gently replied, [3980]\"Let me not\nlive if I do not make thee to love me again,\" upon which meek answer he was\npacified.\n\n[3981] \"Flectitur obsequio curvatus ab arbore ramus,\n        Frangis si vires experire tuas.\"\n\n       \"A branch if easily bended yields to thee,\n        Pull hard it breaks: the difference you see.\"\n\nThe noble family of the Colonni in Rome, when they were expelled the city\nby that furious Alexander the Sixth, gave the bending branch therefore as\nan impress, with this motto, _Flecti potest, frangi non potest_, to signify\nthat he might break them by force, but so never make them stoop, for they\nfled in the midst of their hard usage to the kingdom of Naples, and were\nhonourably entertained by Frederick the king, according to their callings.\nGentleness in this case might have done much more, and let thine adversary\nbe never so perverse, it may be by that means thou mayst win him; [3982]\n_favore et benevolentia etiam immanis animus mansuescit_, soft words pacify\nwrath, and the fiercest spirits are so soonest overcome; [3983]a generous\nlion will not hurt a beast that lies prostrate, nor an elephant an\ninnocuous creature, but is _infestus infestis_, a terror and scourge alone\nto such as are stubborn, and make resistance. It was the symbol of Emanuel\nPhilibert, Duke of Savoy, and he was not mistaken in it, for\n\n[3984] \"Quo quisque est major, magis est placabilis irae,\n        Et faciles motus mens generosa capit.\"\n\n       \"A greater man is soonest pacified,\n        A noble spirit quickly satisfied.\"\n\nIt is reported by [3985]Gualter Mapes, an old historiographer of ours (who\nlived 400 years since), that King Edward senior, and Llewellyn prince of\nWales, being at an interview near Aust upon Severn, in Gloucestershire, and\nthe prince sent for, refused to come to the king; he would needs go over to\nhim; which Llewellyn perceiving, [3986]\"went up to the arms in water, and\nembracing his boat, would have carried him out upon his shoulders, adding\nthat his humility and wisdom had triumphed over his pride and folly,\" and\nthereupon he was reconciled unto him and did his homage. If thou canst not\nso win him, put it up, if thou beest a true Christian, a good divine, an\nimitator of Christ, [3987](\"for he was reviled and put it up, whipped and\nsought no revenge,\") thou wilt pray for thine enemies, [3988]\"and bless\nthem that persecute thee;\" be patient, meek, humble, &c. An honest man will\nnot offer thee injury, _probus non vult_; if he were a brangling knave,\n'tis his fashion so to do; where is least heart is most tongue; _quo\nquisque stultior, eo magis insolescit_, the more sottish he is, still the\nmore insolent: [3989]\"Do not answer a fool according to his folly.\" If he\nbe thy superior, [3990]bear it by all means, grieve not at it, let him take\nhis course; Anitus and Melitus [3991]\"may kill me, they cannot hurt me;\" as\nthat generous Socrates made answer in like case. _Mens immota manet_,\nthough the body be torn in pieces with wild horses, broken on the wheel,\npinched with fiery tongs, the soul cannot be distracted. 'Tis an ordinary\nthing for great men to vilify and insult, oppress, injure, tyrannise, to\ntake what liberty they list, and who dare speak against? _Miserum est ab eo\nlaedi, a quo non possis queri_, a miserable thing 'tis to be injured of\nhim, from whom is no appeal: [3992]and not safe to write against him that\ncan proscribe and punish a man at his pleasure, which Asinius Pollio was\naware of, when Octavianus provoked him. 'Tis hard I confess to be so\ninjured: one of Chilo's three difficult things: [3993]\"To keep counsel;\nspend his time well; put up injuries:\" but be thou patient, and [3994]leave\nrevenge unto the Lord. [3995]\"Vengeance is mine and I will repay, saith the\nLord\"--\"I know the Lord,\" saith [3996]David, \"will avenge the afflicted and\njudge the poor.\"--\"No man\" (as [3997]Plato farther adds) \"can so severely\npunish his adversary, as God will such as oppress miserable men.\"\n\n[3998] \"Iterum ille rem judicatam judicat,\n        Majoreque mulcta mulctat.\"\n\nIf there be any religion, any God, and that God be just, it shall be so; if\nthou believest the one, believe the other: _Erit, erit_, it shall be so.\nNemesis comes after, _sero sed serio_, stay but a little and thou shalt see\nGod's just judgment overtake him.\n\n[3999] \"Raro antecedentem scelestum\n        Deseruit pede poena claudo.\"\n\n       \"Yet with sure steps, though lame and slow,\n        Vengeance o'ertakes the trembling villain's speed.\"\n\nThou shalt perceive that verified of Samuel to Agag, 1 Sam. xv. 33. \"Thy\nsword hath made many women childless, so shall thy mother be childless\namongst other women.\" It shall be done to them as they have done to others.\nConradinus, that brave Suevian prince, came with a well-prepared army into\nthe kingdom of Naples, was taken prisoner by king Charles, and put to death\nin the flower of his youth; a little after (_ultionem Conradini mortis_,\nPandulphus Collinutius _Hist. Neap. lib. 5._ calls it), King Charles's own\nson, with two hundred nobles, was so taken prisoner, and beheaded in like\nsort. Not in this only, but in all other offences, _quo quisque peccat in\neo punietur_, [4000]they shall be punished in the same kind, in the same\npart, like nature, eye with or in the eye, head with or in the head,\npersecution with persecution, lust with effects of lust; let them march on\nwith ensigns displayed, let drums beat on, trumpets sound taratantarra, let\nthem sack cities, take the spoil of countries, murder infants, deflower\nvirgins, destroy, burn, persecute, and tyrannise, they shall be fully\nrewarded at last in the same measure, they and theirs, and that to their\ndesert.\n\n[4001] \"Ad generum Cereris sine caede et sanguine pauci\n        Descendunt reges et sicca morte tyranni.\"\n\n       \"Few tyrants in their beds do die,\n        But stabb'd or maim'd to hell they hie.\"\n\nOftentimes too a base contemptible fellow is the instrument of God's\njustice to punish, to torture, and vex them, as an ichneumon doth a\ncrocodile. They shall be recompensed according to the works of their hands,\nas Haman was hanged on the gallows he provided for Mordecai; \"They shall\nhave sorrow of heart, and be destroyed from under the heaven,\" Thre. iii.\n64, 65, 66. Only be thou patient: [4002]_vincit qui patitur_: and in the\nend thou shalt be crowned. Yea, but 'tis a hard matter to do this, flesh\nand blood may not abide it; 'tis _grave, grave_! no (Chrysostom replies)\n_non est grave, o homo_! 'tis not so grievous, [4003]\"neither had God\ncommanded it, if it had been so difficult.\" But how shall it be done?\n\"Easily,\" as he follows it, \"if thou shalt look to heaven, behold the\nbeauty of it, and what God hath promised to such as put up injuries.\" But\nif thou resist and go about _vim vi repellere_, as the custom of the world\nis, to right thyself, or hast given just cause of offence, 'tis no injury\nthen but a condign punishment; thou hast deserved as much: _A te\nprincipium, in te recredit crimen quod a te fuit; peccasti, quiesce_, as\nAmbrose expostulates with Cain, _lib. 3. de Abel et Cain_. [4004]Dionysius\nof Syracuse, in his exile, was made to stand without door, _patienter\nferendum, fortasse nos tale quid fecimus, quum in honore essemus_, he\nwisely put it up, and laid the fault where it was, on his own pride and\nscorn, which in his prosperity he had formerly showed others. 'Tis [4005]\nTully's axiom, _ferre ea molestissime homines non debent, quae ipsorum\nculpa contracta sunt_, self do, self have, as the saying is, they may thank\nthemselves. For he that doth wrong must look to be wronged again; _habet et\nmusca splenem, et formicae sua bills inest_. The least fly hath a spleen,\nand a little bee a sting. [4006]An ass overwhelmed a thistlewarp's nest,\nthe little bird pecked his galled back in revenge; and the humble-bee in\nthe fable flung down the eagle's eggs out of Jupiter's lap. Bracides, in\nPlutarch, put his hand into a mouse's nest and hurt her young ones, she bit\nhim by the finger: [4007]I see now (saith he) there is no creature so\ncontemptible, that will not be revenged. 'Tis _lex talionis_, and the\nnature of all things so to do: if thou wilt live quietly thyself, [4008]do\nno wrong to others; if any be done thee, put it up, with patience endure\nit, for [4009]\"this is thankworthy,\" saith our apostle, \"if any man for\nconscience towards God endure grief, and suffer wrong undeserved; for what\npraise is it, if when ye be buffeted for you faults, ye take it patiently?\nBut if when you do well, ye suffer wrong, and take it patiently, there is\nthanks with God; for hereunto verily we are called.\" _Qui mala non fert,\nipse sibi testis est per impatientiam quod bonus non est_, \"he that cannot\nbear injuries, witnesseth against himself that he is no good man,\" as\nGregory holds. [4010]\"'Tis the nature of wicked men to do injuries, as it\nis the property of all honest men patiently to bear them.\" _Improbitas\nnullo flectitur obsequio_. The wolf in the [4011]emblem sucked the goat (so\nthe shepherd would have it), but he kept nevertheless a wolf's nature;\n[4012]a knave will be a knave. Injury is on the other side a good man's\nfootboy, his _fidus Acliates_, and as a lackey follows him wheresoever he\ngoes. Besides, _misera est fortuna quae caret inimico_, he is in a\nmiserable estate that wants enemies: [4013]it is a thing not to be avoided,\nand therefore with more patience to be endured. Cato Censorius, that\nupright Cato of whom Paterculus gives that honourable eulogium, _bene fecit\nquod aliter facere non potuit_, was [4014]fifty times indicted and accused\nby his fellow citizens, and as [4015]Ammianus well hath it, _Quis erit\ninnocens si clam vel palam accusasse sufficiat_? if it be sufficient to\naccuse a man openly or in private, who shall be free? If there were no\nother respect than that of Christianity, religion and the like, to induce\nmen to be long-suffering and patient, yet methinks the nature of injury\nitself is sufficient to keep them quiet, the tumults, uproars, miseries,\ndiscontents, anguish, loss, dangers that attend upon it might restrain the\ncalamities of contention: for as it is with ordinary gamesters, the gains\ngo to the box, so falls it out to such as contend; the lawyers get all; and\ntherefore if they would consider of it, _aliena pericula cantos_, other\nmen's misfortunes in this kind, and common experience might detain them.\n[4016]The more they contend, the more they are involved in a labyrinth of\nwoes, and the catastrophe is to consume one another, like the elephant and\ndragon's conflict in Pliny; [4017]the dragon got under the elephant's\nbelly, and sucked his blood so long, till he fell down dead upon the\ndragon, and killed him with the fall, so both were ruined. 'Tis a hydra's\nhead, contention; the more they strive, the more they may: and as\nPraxiteles did by his glass, when he saw a scurvy face in it, brake it in\npieces: but for that one he saw many more as bad in a moment: for one\ninjury done they provoke another _cum foenore_, and twenty enemies for one.\n_Noli irritare crabrones_, oppose not thyself to a multitude: but if thou\nhast received a wrong, wisely consider of it, and if thou canst possibly,\ncompose thyself with patience to bear it. This is the safest course, and\nthou shalt find greatest ease to be quiet.\n\n[4018]I say the same of scoffs, slanders, contumelies, obloquies,\ndefamations, detractions, pasquilling libels, and the like, which may tend\nany way to our disgrace: 'tis but opinion; if we could neglect, contemn, or\nwith patience digest them, they would reflect on them that offered them at\nfirst. A wise citizen, I know not whence, had a scold to his wife: when she\nbrawled, he played on his drum, and by that means madded her more, because\nshe saw that he would not be moved. Diogenes in a crowd when one called him\nback, and told him how the boys laughed him to scorn, _Ego, inquit, non\nrideor_, took no notice of it. Socrates was brought upon the stage by\nAristophanes, and misused to his face, but he laughed as if it concerned\nhim not: and as Aelian relates of him, whatsoever good or bad accident or\nfortune befel him going in or coming out, Socrates still kept the same\ncountenance; even so should a Christian do, as Hierom describes him, _per\ninfamiam et bonam famam grassari ad immortalitatem_, march on through good\nand bad reports to immortality, [4019]not to be moved: for honesty is a\nsufficient reward, probitas sibi, praemium; and in our times the sole\nrecompense to do well, is, to do well: but naughtiness will punish itself\nat last, [4020]_Improbis ipsa nequitia supplicium_. As the diverb is,\n\n       \"Qui bene fecerunt, illi sua facta sequentur;\n        Qui male fecerunt, facta sequentur eos:\"\n\n       \"They that do well, shall have reward at last:\n        But they that ill, shall suffer for that's past.\"\n\nYea, but I am ashamed, disgraced, dishonoured, degraded, exploded: my\nnotorious crimes and villainies are come to light (_deprendi miserum est_),\nmy filthy lust, abominable oppression and avarice lies open, my good name's\nlost, my fortune's gone, I have been stigmatised, whipped at post,\narraigned and condemned, I am a common obloquy, I have lost my ears,\nodious, execrable, abhorred of God and men. Be content, 'tis but a nine\ndays' wonder, and as one sorrow drives out another, one passion another,\none cloud another, one rumour is expelled by another; every day almost,\ncome new news unto our ears, as how the sun was eclipsed, meteors seen in\nthe air, monsters born, prodigies, how the Turks were overthrown in Persia,\nan earthquake in Helvetia, Calabria, Japan, or China, an inundation in\nHolland, a great plague in Constantinople, a fire at Prague, a dearth in\nGermany, such a man is made a lord, a bishop, another hanged, deposed,\npressed to death, for some murder, treason, rape, theft, oppression, all\nwhich we do hear at first with a kind of admiration, detestation,\nconsternation, but by and by they are buried in silence: thy father's dead,\nthy brother robbed, wife runs mad, neighbour hath killed himself; 'tis\nheavy, ghastly, fearful news at first, in every man's mouth, table talk;\nbut after a while who speaks or thinks of it? It will be so with thee and\nthine offence, it will be forgotten in an instant, be it theft, rape,\nsodomy, murder, incest, treason, &c., thou art not the first offender, nor\nshalt not be the last, 'tis no wonder, every hour such malefactors are\ncalled in question, nothing so common, _Quocunque in populo, quocunque sub\naxe_? [4021]Comfort thyself, thou art not the sole man. If he that were\nguiltless himself should fling the first stone at thee, and he alone should\naccuse thee that were faultless, how many executioners, how many accusers\nwouldst thou have? If every man's sins were written in his forehead, and\nsecret faults known, how many thousands would parallel, if not exceed thine\noffence? It may be the judge that gave sentence, the jury that condemned\nthee, the spectators that gazed on thee, deserved much more, and were far\nmore guilty than thou thyself. But it is thine infelicity to be taken, to\nbe made a public example of justice, to be a terror to the rest; yet should\nevery man have his desert, thou wouldst peradventure be a saint in\ncomparison; _vexat censura columbas_, poor souls are punished; the great\nones do twenty thousand times worse, and are not so much as spoken of.\n\n[4022] \"Non rete accipitri tenditur neque milvio,\n        Qui male faciunt nobis; illis qui nil faciunt tenditur.\"\n\n       \"The net's not laid for kites or birds of prey,\n        But for the harmless still our gins we lay.\"\n\nBe not dismayed then, _humanum est errare_, we are all sinners, daily and\nhourly subject to temptations, the best of us is a hypocrite, a grievous\noffender in God's sight, Noah, Lot, David, Peter, &c., how many mortal sins\ndo we commit? Shall I say, be penitent, ask forgiveness, and make amends by\nthe sequel of thy life, for that foul offence thou hast committed? recover\nthy credit by some noble exploit, as Themistocles did, for he was a most\ndebauched and vicious youth, _sed juventae maculas praeclaris factis\ndelevit_, but made the world amends by brave exploits; at last become a new\nman, and seek to be reformed. He that runs away in a battle, as Demosthenes\nsaid, may fight again; and he that hath a fall may stand as upright as ever\nhe did before. _Nemo desperet meliora lapsus_, a wicked liver may be\nreclaimed, and prove an honest man; he that is odious in present, hissed\nout, an exile, may be received again with all men's favours, and singular\napplause; so Tully was in Rome, Alcibiades in Athens. Let thy disgrace then\nbe what it will, _quod fit, infectum non potest esse_, that which is past\ncannot be recalled; trouble not thyself, vex and grieve thyself no more, be\nit obloquy, disgrace, &c. No better way, than to neglect, contemn, or seem\nnot to regard it, to make no reckoning of it, _Deesse robur arguit\ndicacitas_: if thou be guiltless it concerns thee not:\n\n[4023] \"Irrita vaniloquae quid curas spicula linguae,\n        Latrantem curatne alta Diana canem?\"\n\nDoth the moon care for the barking of a dog? They detract, scoff and rail,\nsaith one, [4024]and bark at me on every side, but I, like that Albanian\ndog sometimes given to Alexander for a present, _vindico me ab illis solo\ncontemptu_, I lie still and sleep, vindicate myself by contempt alone.\n[4025]_Expers terroris Achilles armatus_: as a tortoise in his shell,\n[4026]_virtute mea me involvo_, or an urchin round, _nil moror ictus_\n[4027]a lizard in camomile, I decline their fury and am safe.\n\n       \"Integritas virtusque suo munimine tuta,\n        Non patet adversae morsibus invidiae:\"\n\n       \"Virtue and integrity are their own fence,\n        Care not for envy or what comes from thence.\"\n\nLet them rail then, scoff, and slander, _sapiens contumelia non afficitur_,\na wise man, Seneca thinks, is not moved, because he knows, _contra\nSycophantae morsum non est remedium_, there is no remedy for it: kings and\nprinces, wise, grave, prudent, holy, good men, divine, are all so served\nalike. [4028]_O Jane a tergo quem nulla ciconia pinsit_, Antevorta and\nPostvorta, Jupiter's guardians, may not help in this case, they cannot\nprotect; Moses had a Dathan, a Corath, David a Shimei, God himself is\nblasphemed: _nondum felix es si te nondum turba deridet_. It is an ordinary\nthing so to be misused. [4029]_Regium est cum bene faceris male audire_,\nthe chiefest men and most understanding are so vilified; let him take his\n[4030]course. And as that lusty courser in Aesop, that contemned the poor\nass, came by and by after with his bowels burst, a pack on his back, and\nwas derided of the same ass: _contemnentur ab iis quos ipsi prius\ncontempsere, et irridebuntur ab iis quos ipsi prius irrisere_, they shall\nbe contemned and laughed to scorn of those whom they have formerly derided.\nLet them contemn, defame, or undervalue, insult, oppress, scoff, slander,\nabuse, wrong, curse and swear, feign and lie, do thou comfort thyself with\na good conscience, _in sinu gaudeas_, when they have all done, [4031]\"a\ngood conscience is a continual feast,\" innocency will vindicate itself: and\nwhich the poet gave out of Hercules, _diis fruitur iratis_, enjoy thyself,\nthough all the world be set against thee, contemn and say with him,\n_Elogium mihi prae, foribus_, my posy is, \"not to be moved, that [4032]my\npalladium, my breastplate, my buckler, with which I ward all injuries,\noffences, lies, slanders; I lean upon that stake of modesty, so receive and\nbreak asunder all that foolish force of liver and spleen.\" And whosoever he\nis that shall observe these short instructions, without all question he\nshall much ease and benefit himself.\n\nIn fine, if princes would do justice, judges be upright, clergymen truly\ndevout, and so live as they teach, if great men would not be so insolent,\nif soldiers would quietly defend us, the poor would be patient, rich men.\nwould be liberal and humble, citizens honest, magistrates meek, superiors\nwould give good example, subjects peaceable, young men would stand in awe:\nif parents would be kind to their children, and they again obedient to\ntheir parents, brethren agree amongst themselves, enemies be reconciled,\nservants trusty to their masters, virgins chaste, wives modest, husbands\nwould be loving and less jealous: if we could imitate Christ and his\napostles, live after God's laws, these mischiefs would not so frequently\nhappen amongst us; but being most part so irreconcilable as we are,\nperverse, proud, insolent, factious, and malicious, prone to contention,\nanger and revenge, of such fiery spirits, so captious, impious,\nirreligious, so opposite to virtue, void of grace, how should it otherwise\nbe? Many men are very testy by nature, apt to mistake, apt to quarrel, apt\nto provoke and misinterpret to the worst, everything that is said or done,\nand thereupon heap unto themselves a great deal of trouble, and\ndisquietness to others, smatterers in other men's matters, tale-bearers,\nwhisperers, liars, they cannot speak in season, or hold their tongues when\nthey should, [4033]_Et suam partem itidem tacere cum aliena est oratio_:\nthey will speak more than comes to their shares, in all companies, and by\nthose bad courses accumulate much evil to their own souls (_qui contendit,\nsibi convicium facit_) their life is a perpetual brawl, they snarl like so\nmany dogs, with their wives, children, servants, neighbours, and all the\nrest of their friends, they can agree with nobody. But to such as are\njudicious, meek, submissive, and quiet, these matters are easily remedied:\nthey will forbear upon all such occasions, neglect, contemn, or take no\nnotice of them, dissemble, or wisely turn it off. If it be a natural\nimpediment, as a red nose, squint eyes, crooked legs, or any such\nimperfection, infirmity, disgrace, reproach, the best way is to speak of it\nfirst thyself, [4034]and so thou shalt surely take away all occasions from\nothers to jest at, or contemn, that they may perceive thee to be careless\nof it. Vatinius was wont to scoff at his own deformed feet, to prevent his\nenemies' obloquies and sarcasms in that kind; or else by prevention, as\nCotys, king of Thrace, that brake a company of fine glasses presented to\nhim, with his own hands, lest he should be overmuch moved when they were\nbroken by chance. And sometimes again, so that it be discreetly and\nmoderately done, it shall not be amiss to make resistance, to take down\nsuch a saucy companion, no better means to vindicate himself to purchase\nfinal peace: for he that suffers himself to be ridden, or through\npusillanimity or sottishness will let every man baffle him, shall be a\ncommon laughing stock to flout at. As a cur that goes through a village, if\nhe clap his tail between his legs, and run away, every cur will insult over\nhim: but if he bristle up himself, and stand to it, give but a\ncounter-snarl, there's not a dog dares meddle with him: much is in a man's\ncourage and discreet carriage of himself.\n\nMany other grievances there are, which happen to mortals in this life, from\nfriends, wives, children, servants, masters, companions, neighbours, our\nown defaults, ignorance, errors, intemperance, indiscretion, infirmities,\n&c., and many good remedies to mitigate and oppose them, many divine\nprecepts to counterpoise our hearts, special antidotes both in Scriptures\nand human authors, which, whoso will observe, shall purchase much ease and\nquietness unto himself: I will point out a few. Those prophetical,\napostolical admonitions are well known to all; what Solomon, Siracides, our\nSaviour Christ himself hath said tending to this purpose, as \"fear God:\nobey the prince: be sober and watch: pray continually: be angry but sin\nnot: remember thy last: fashion not yourselves to this world, &c., apply\nyourselves to the times: strive not with a mighty man: recompense good for\nevil, let nothing be done through contention or vainglory, but with\nmeekness of mind, every man esteeming of others better than himself: love\none another;\" or that epitome of the law and the prophets, which our\nSaviour inculcates, \"love God above all, thy neighbour as thyself:\" and\n\"whatsoever you would that men should do unto you, so do unto them,\" which\nAlexander Severus writ in letters of gold, and used as a motto, [4035]\nHierom commends to Celantia as an excellent way, amongst so many\nenticements and worldly provocations, to rectify her life. Out of human\nauthors take these few cautions, [4036]\"know thyself. [4037]Be contented\nwith thy lot. [4038]Trust not wealth, beauty, nor parasites, they will\nbring thee to destruction. [4039]Have peace with all men, war with vice.\n[4040]Be not idle. [4041]Look before you leap. [4042]Beware of 'had I\nwist.' [4043]Honour thy parents, speak well of friends. Be temperate in\nfour things, _lingua, locis, oculis, et poculis_. Watch thine eye.[4044]\nModerate thine expenses. Hear much, speak little, [4045]_sustine et\nabstine_. If thou seest ought amiss in another, mend it in thyself. Keep\nthine own counsel, reveal not thy secrets, be silent in thine intentions.\n[4046]Give not ear to tale-tellers, babblers, be not scurrilous in\nconversation: [4047]jest without bitterness: give no man cause of offence:\nset thine house in order: [4048]take heed of suretyship. [4049]_Fide et\ndiffide_, as a fox on the ice, take heed whom you trust. [4050]Live not\nbeyond thy means. [4051]Give cheerfully. Pay thy dues willingly. Be not a\nslave to thy money; [4052]omit not occasion, embrace opportunity, lose no\ntime. Be humble to thy superiors, respective to thine equals, affable to\nall, [4053]but not familiar. Flatter no man. [4054]Lie not, dissemble not.\nKeep thy word and promise, be constant in a good resolution. Speak truth.\nBe not opiniative, maintain no factions. Lay no wagers, make no\ncomparisons. [4055]Find no faults, meddle not with other men's matters.\nAdmire not thyself. [4056]Be not proud or popular. Insult not. _Fortunam\nreverentur habe_. [4057]Fear not that which cannot be avoided. [4058]\nGrieve not for that which cannot be recalled. [4059]Undervalue not thyself.\n[4060]Accuse no man, commend no man rashly. Go not to law without great\ncause. Strive not with a greater man. Cast not off an old friend, take heed\nof a reconciled enemy. [4061]If thou come as a guest stay not too long. Be\nnot unthankful. Be meek, merciful, and patient. Do good to all. Be not fond\nof fair words. [4062]Be not a neuter in a faction; moderate thy passions.\n[4063]Think no place without a witness. [4064] Admonish thy friend in\nsecret, commend him in public. Keep good company. [4065]Love others to be\nbeloved thyself. _Ama tanquam osurus_. _Amicus tardo fias_. Provide for a\ntempest. _Noli irritare crabrones_. Do not prostitute thy soul for gain.\nMake not a fool of thyself to make others merry. Marry not an old crony or\na fool for money. Be not over solicitous or curious. Seek that which may be\nfound. Seem not greater than thou art. Take thy pleasure soberly. _Ocymum\nne terito_. [4066]Live merrily as thou canst. [4067]Take heed by other\nmen's examples. Go as thou wouldst be met, sit as thou wouldst be found,\n[4068]yield to the time, follow the stream. Wilt thou live free from fears\nand cares? [4069]Live innocently, keep thyself upright, thou needest no\nother keeper,\" &c. Look for more in Isocrates, Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus,\n&c., and for defect, consult with cheese-trenchers and painted cloths.\n\n\nMEMB. VIII.\n_Against Melancholy itself_.\n\n\"Every man,\" saith [4070]Seneca, \"thinks his own burthen the heaviest,\" and\na melancholy man above all others complains most; weariness of life,\nabhorring all company and light, fear, sorrow, suspicion, anguish of mind,\nbashfulness, and those other dread symptoms of body and mind, must needs\naggravate this misery; yet compared to other maladies, they are not so\nheinous as they be taken. For first this disease is either in habit or\ndisposition, curable or incurable. If new and in disposition, 'tis commonly\npleasant, and it may be helped. If inveterate, or a habit, yet they have\n_lucida intervalla_, sometimes well, and sometimes ill; or if more\ncontinuate, as the [4071]Vejentes were to the Romans, 'tis _hostis magis\nassiduus quam gravis_, a more durable enemy than dangerous: and amongst\nmany inconveniences, some comforts are annexed to it. First it is not\ncatching, and as Erasmus comforted himself, when he was grievously sick of\nthe stone, though it was most troublesome, and an intolerable pain to him,\nyet it was no whit offensive to others, not loathsome to the spectators,\nghastly, fulsome, terrible, as plagues, apoplexies, leprosies, wounds,\nsores, tetters, pox, pestilent agues are, which either admit of no company,\nterrify or offend those that are present. In this malady, that which is, is\nwholly to themselves: and those symptoms not so dreadful, if they be\ncompared to the opposite extremes. They are most part bashful, suspicious,\nsolitary, &c., therefore no such ambitious, impudent intruders as some are,\nno sharkers, no cony-catchers, no prowlers, no smell-feasts, praters,\npanders, parasites, bawds, drunkards, whoremasters; necessity and defect\ncompel them to be honest; as Mitio told Demea in the [4072]comedy,\n\n       \"Haec si neque ego neque tu fecimus,\n        Non sinit egestas facere nos.\"\n\n\"If we be honest 'twas poverty made us so:\" if we melancholy men be not as\nbad as he that is worst, 'tis our dame melancholy kept us so: _Non deerat\nvoluntas sed facultas_. [4073]\n\nBesides they are freed in this from many other infirmities, solitariness\nmakes them more apt to contemplate, suspicion wary, which is a necessary\nhumour in these times, [4074]_Nam pol que maxime cavet, is saepe cautor\ncaptus est_, \"he that takes most heed, is often circumvented, and\novertaken.\" Fear and sorrow keep them temperate and sober, and free them\nfrom any dissolute acts, which jollity and boldness thrust men upon: they\nare therefore no _sicarii_, roaring boys, thieves or assassins. As they are\nsoon dejected, so they are as soon, by soft words and good persuasions,\nreared. Wearisomeness of life makes them they are not so besotted on the\ntransitory vain pleasures of the world. If they dote in one thing, they are\nwise and well understanding in most other. If it be inveterate, they are\n_insensati_, most part doting, or quite mad, insensible of any wrongs,\nridiculous to others, but most happy and secure to themselves. Dotage is a\nstate which many much magnify and commend: so is simplicity, and folly, as\nhe said, [4075]_sic hic furor o superi, sit mihi perpetuus_. Some think\nfools and dizzards live the merriest lives, as Ajax in Sophocles, _Nihil\nscire vita jucundissima_, \"'tis the pleasantest life to know nothing;\"\n_iners malorum remedium ignorantia_, \"ignorance is a downright remedy of\nevils.\" These curious arts and laborious sciences, Galen's, Tully's,\nAristotle's, Justinian's, do but trouble the world some think; we might\nlive better with that illiterate Virginian simplicity, and gross ignorance;\nentire idiots do best, they are not macerated with cares, tormented with\nfears, and anxiety, as other wise men are: for as [4076]he said, if folly\nwere a pain, you should hear them howl, roar, and cry out in every house,\nas you go by in the street, but they are most free, jocund, and merry, and\nin some [4077]countries, as amongst the Turks, honoured for saints, and\nabundantly maintained out of the common stock. [4078]They are no\ndissemblers, liars, hypocrites, for fools and madmen tell commonly truth.\nIn a word, as they are distressed, so are they pitied, which some hold\nbetter than to be envied, better to be sad than merry, better to be foolish\nand quiet, _quam sapere et ringi_, to be wise and still vexed; better to be\nmiserable than happy: of two extremes it is the best.\n\n\nSECT. IV. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Of Physic which cureth with Medicines_.\n\nAfter a long and tedious discourse of these six non-natural things and\ntheir several rectifications, all which are comprehended in diet, I am come\nnow at last to _Pharmaceutice_, or that kind of physic which cureth by\nmedicines, which apothecaries most part make, mingle, or sell in their\nshops. Many cavil at this kind of physic, and hold it unnecessary,\nunprofitable to this or any other disease, because those countries which\nuse it least, live longest, and are best in health, as [4079]Hector\nBoethius relates of the isles of Orcades, the people are still sound of\nbody and mind, without any use of physic, they live commonly 120 years, and\nOrtelius in his itinerary of the inhabitants of the Forest of Arden, [4080]\n\"they are very painful, long-lived, sound,\" &c. [4081]Martianus Capella,\nspeaking of the Indians of his time, saith, they were (much like our\nwestern Indians now) \"bigger than ordinary men, bred coarsely, very\nlong-lived, insomuch, that he that died at a hundred years of age, went\nbefore his time,\" &c. Damianus A-Goes, Saxo Grammaticus, Aubanus Bohemus,\nsay the like of them that live in Norway, Lapland, Finmark, Biarmia,\nCorelia, all over Scandia, and those northern countries, they are most\nhealthful, and very long-lived, in which places there is no use at all of\nphysic, the name of it is not once heard. Dithmarus Bleskenius in his\naccurate description of Iceland, 1607, makes mention, amongst other\nmatters, of the inhabitants, and their manner of living, [4082]\"which is\ndried fish instead of bread, butter, cheese, and salt meats, most part they\ndrink water and whey, and yet without physic or physician, they live many\nof them 250 years.\" I find the same relation by Lerius, and some other\nwriters, of Indians in America. Paulus Jovius in his description of\nBritain, and Levinus Lemnius, observe as much of this our island, that\nthere was of old no use of [4083]physic amongst us, and but little at this\nday, except it be for a few nice idle citizens, surfeiting courtiers, and\nstall-fed gentlemen lubbers. The country people use kitchen physic, and\ncommon experience tells vis, that they live freest from all manner of\ninfirmities, that make least use of apothecaries' physic. Many are\noverthrown by preposterous use of it, and thereby get their bane, that\nmight otherwise have escaped: [4084]some think physicians kill as many as\nthey save, and who can tell, [4085]_Quot Themison aegros autumno occiderit\nuno_? \"How many murders they make in a year,\" _quibus impune licet hominem\noccidere_, \"that may freely kill folks,\" and have a reward for it, and\naccording to the Dutch proverb, a new physician must have a new churchyard;\nand who daily observes it not? Many that did ill under physicians' hands,\nhave happily escaped, when they have been given over by them, left to God\nand nature, and themselves; 'twas Pliny's dilemma of old, [4086]\"every\ndisease is either curable or incurable, a man recovers of it or is killed\nby it; both ways physic is to be rejected. If it be deadly, it cannot be\ncured; if it may be helped, it requires no physician, nature will expel it\nof itself.\" Plato made it a great sign of an intemperate and corrupt\ncommonwealth, where lawyers and physicians did abound; and the Romans\ndistasted them so much that they were often banished out of their city, as\nPliny and Celsus relate, for 600 years not admitted. It is no art at all,\nas some hold, no not worthy the name of a liberal science (nor law\nneither), as [4087]Pet. And. Canonherius a patrician of Rome and a great\ndoctor himself, \"one of their own tribe,\" proves by sixteen arguments,\nbecause it is mercenary as now used, base, and as fiddlers play for a\nreward. _Juridicis, medicis, fisco, fas vivere rapto_, 'tis a corrupt\ntrade, no science, art, no profession; the beginning, practice, and\nprogress of it, all is naught, full of imposture, uncertainty, and doth\ngenerally more harm than good. The devil himself was the first inventor of\nit: _Inventum est medicina meum_, said Apollo, and what was Apollo, but the\ndevil? The Greeks first made an art of it, and they were all deluded by\nApollo's sons, priests, oracles. If we may believe Varro, Pliny, Columella,\nmost of their best medicines were derived from his oracles. Aesculapius his\nson had his temples erected to his deity, and did many famous cures; but,\nas Lactantius holds, he was a magician, a mere impostor, and as his\nsuccessors, Phaon, Podalirius, Melampius, Menecrates, (another God), by\ncharms, spells, and ministry of bad spirits, performed most of their cures.\nThe first that ever wrote in physic to any purpose, was Hippocrates, and\nhis disciple and commentator Galen, whom Scaliger calls _Fimbriam\nHippocratis_; but as [4088]Cardan censures them, both immethodical and\nobscure, as all those old ones are, their precepts confused, their\nmedicines obsolete, and now most part rejected. Those cures which they did,\nParacelsus holds, were rather done out of their patients' confidence,\n[4089]and good opinion they had of them, than out of any skill of theirs,\nwhich was very small, he saith, they themselves idiots and infants, as are\nall their academical followers. The Arabians received it from the Greeks,\nand so the Latins, adding new precepts and medicines of their own, but so\nimperfect still, that through ignorance of professors, impostors,\nmountebanks, empirics, disagreeing of sectaries, (which are as many almost\nas there be diseases) envy, covetousness, and the like, they do much harm\namongst us. They are so different in their consultations, prescriptions,\nmistaking many times the parties' constitution, [4090]disease, and causes\nof it, they give quite contrary physic; [4091]\"one saith this, another\nthat,\" out of singularity or opposition, as he said of Adrian, _multitudo\nmedicorum principem interfecit_, \"a multitude of physicians hath killed the\nemperor;\" _plus a medico quam a morbo periculi_, \"more danger there is from\nthe physician, than from the disease.\" Besides, there is much imposture and\nmalice amongst them. \"All arts\" (saith [4092]Cardan) \"admit of cozening,\nphysic, amongst the rest, doth appropriate it to herself;\" and tells a\nstory of one Curtius, a physician in Venice: because he was a stranger, and\npractised amongst them, the rest of the physicians did still cross him in\nall his precepts. If he prescribed hot medicines they would prescribe cold,\n_miscentes pro calidis frigida, pro frigidis humida, pro purgantibus\nastringentia_, binders for purgatives, _omnia perturbabant_. If the party\nmiscarried, _Curtium damnabant_, Curtius killed him, that disagreed from\nthem: if he recovered, then [4093]they cured him themselves. Much\nemulation, imposture, malice, there is amongst them: if they be honest and\nmean well, yet a knave apothecary that administers the physic, and makes\nthe medicine, may do infinite harm, by his old obsolete doses, adulterine\ndrugs, bad mixtures, _quid pro quo_, &c. See Fuchsius _lib. 1. sect. 1.\ncap. 8._ Cordus' _Dispensatory_, and Brassivola's _Examen simpl._, &c. But\nit is their ignorance that doth more harm than rashness, their art is\nwholly conjectural, if it be an art, uncertain, imperfect, and got by\nkilling of men, they are a kind of butchers, leeches, men-slayers;\nchirurgeons and apothecaries especially, that are indeed the physicians'\nhangman, _carnifices_, and common executioners; though to say truth,\nphysicians themselves come not far behind; for according to that facete\nepigram of Maximilianus Urentius, what's the difference?\n\n[4094] \"Chirurgicus medico quo differt? scilicet isto,\n          Enecat hic succis, enecat ille manu:\n        Carnifice hoc ambo tantum differre videntur,\n          Tardius hi faciunt, quod facit ille cito.\"\n\nBut I return to their skill; many diseases they cannot cure at all, as\napoplexy, epilepsy, stone, strangury, gout, _Tollere nodosam nescit\nmedicina Podagram_; [4095]quartan agues, a common ague sometimes stumbles\nthem all, they cannot so much as ease, they know not how to judge of it. If\nby pulses, that doctrine, some hold, is wholly superstitious, and I dare\nboldly say with [4096]Andrew Dudeth, \"that variety of pulses described by\nGalen, is neither observed nor understood of any.\" And for urine, that is\n_meretrix medicorum_, the most deceitful thing of all, as Forestus and some\nother physicians have proved at large: I say nothing of critic days, errors\nin indications, &c. The most rational of them, and skilful, are so often\ndeceived, that as [4097]Tholosanus infers, \"I had rather believe and commit\nmyself to a mere empiric, than to a mere doctor, and I cannot sufficiently\ncommend that custom of the Babylonians, that have no professed physicians,\nbut bring all their patients to the market to be cured:\" which Herodotus\nrelates of the Egyptians: Strabo, Sardus, and Aubanus Bohemus of many other\nnations. And those that prescribed physic, amongst them, did not so\narrogantly take upon them to cure all diseases, as our professors do, but\nsome one, some another, as their skill and experience did serve; [4098]\n\"One cured the eyes, a second the teeth, a third the head, another the\nlower parts,\" &c., not for gain, but in charity, to do good, they made\nneither art, profession, nor trade of it, which in other places was\naccustomed: and therefore Cambyses in [4099]Xenophon told Cyrus, that to\nhis thinking, physicians \"were like tailors and cobblers, the one mended\nour sick bodies, as the other did our clothes.\" But I will urge these\ncavilling and contumelious arguments no farther, lest some physician should\nmistake me, and deny me physic when I am sick: for my part, I am well\npersuaded of physic: I can distinguish the abuse from the use, in this and\nmany other arts and sciences: [4100]_Alliud vinum, aliud ebrietas_, wine\nand drunkenness are two distinct things. I acknowledge it a most noble and\ndivine science, in so much that Apollo, Aesculapius, and the first founders\nof it, _merito pro diis habiti_, were worthily counted gods by succeeding\nages, for the excellency of their invention. And whereas Apollo at Delos,\nVenus at Cyprus, Diana at Ephesus, and those other gods were confined and\nadored alone in some peculiar places: Aesculapius and his temple and altars\neverywhere, in Corinth, Lacedaemon, Athens, Thebes, Epidaurus, &c.\nPausanius records, for the latitude of his art, deity, worth, and\nnecessity. With all virtuous and wise men therefore I honour the name and\ncalling, as I am enjoined \"to honour the physician for necessity's sake.\nThe knowledge of the physician lifteth up his head, and in the sight of\ngreat men he shall be admired. The Lord hath created medicines of the\nearth, and he that is wise will not abhor them,\" Eccles. lviii 1. But of\nthis noble subject, how many panegyrics are worthily written? For my part,\nas Sallust said of Carthage, _praestat silere, quam pauca dicere_; I have\nsaid, yet one thing I will add, that this kind of physic is very moderately\nand advisedly to be used, upon good occasion, when the former of diet will\nnot take place. And 'tis no other which I say, than that which Arnoldus\nprescribes in his 8. Aphoris. [4101]\"A discreet and goodly physician doth\nfirst endeavour to expel a disease by medicinal diet, than by pure\nmedicine:\" and in his ninth, [4102]\"he that may be cured by diet, must not\nmeddle with physic.\" So in 11. Aphoris. [4103]\"A modest and wise physician\nwill never hasten to use medicines, but upon urgent necessity, and that\nsparingly too:\" because (as he adds in his 13. Aphoris.) [4104]\"Whosoever\ntakes much physic in his youth, shall soon bewail it in his old age:\"\npurgative physic especially, which doth much debilitate nature. For which\ncauses some physicians refrain from the use of purgatives, or else\nsparingly use them. [4105]Henricus Ayrerus in a consultation for a\nmelancholy person, would have him take as few purges as he could, \"because\nthere be no such medicines, which do not steal away some of our strength,\nand rob the parts of our body, weaken nature, and cause that cacochymia,\"\nwhich [4106]Celsus and others observe, or ill digestion, and bad juice\nthrough all the parts of it. Galen himself confesseth, [4107]\"that\npurgative physic is contrary to nature, takes away some of our best\nspirits, and consumes the very substance of our bodies:\" But this, without\nquestion, is to be understood of such purges as are unseasonably or\nimmoderately taken: they have their excellent use in this, as well as most\nother infirmities. Of alteratives and cordials no man doubts, be they\nsimples or compounds. I will amongst that infinite variety of medicines,\nwhich I find in every pharmacopoeia, every physician, herbalist, &c.,\nsingle out some of the chiefest.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Simples proper to Melancholy, against Exotic Simples_.\n\nMedicines properly applied to melancholy, are either simple or compound.\nSimples are alterative or purgative. Alteratives are such as correct,\nstrengthen nature, alter, any way hinder or resist the disease; and they be\nherbs, stones, minerals, &c. all proper to this humour. For as there be\ndiverse distinct infirmities continually vexing us,\n\n[4108] \"[Greek: nousoi d' anthropoisi eph aemerae aed' epi nukti\n        automatoi phoitosi kaka thnaetoisi pherousai\n        sigae, epei phonaen aexeileto maetieta zeus.]\"\n\n       \"Diseases steal both day and night on men,\n        For Jupiter hath taken voice from them.\"\n\nSo there be several remedies, as [4109]he saith, \"each disease a medicine,\nfor every humour;\" and as some hold, every clime, every country, and more\nthan that, every private place hath his proper remedies growing in it,\npeculiar almost to the domineering and most frequent maladies of it, As\n[4110]one discourseth, \"wormwood grows sparingly in Italy, because most\npart there they be misaffected with hot diseases: but henbane, poppy, and\nsuch cold herbs: with us in Germany and Poland, great store of it in every\nwaste.\" Baracellus _Horto geniali_, and Baptista Porta _Physiognomicae,\nlib. 6. cap. 23_, give many instances and examples of it, and bring many\nother proofs. For that cause belike that learned Fuchsius of Nuremberg,\n[4111]\"when he came into a village, considered always what herbs did grow\nmost frequently about it, and those he distilled in a silver alembic,\nmaking use of others amongst them as occasion served.\" I know that many are\nof opinion, our northern simples are weak, imperfect, not so well\nconcocted, of such force, as those in the southern parts, not so fit to be\nused in physic, and will therefore fetch their drugs afar off: senna,\ncassia out of Egypt, rhubarb from Barbary, aloes from Socotra; turbith,\nagaric, mirabolanes, hermodactils, from the East Indies, tobacco from the\nwest, and some as far as China, hellebore from the Anticyrae, or that of\nAustria which bears the purple flower, which Mathiolus so much approves,\nand so of the rest. In the kingdom of Valencia, in Spain, [4112]Maginus\ncommends two mountains, Mariola and Renagolosa, famous for simples; [4113]\nLeander Albertus, [4114]Baldus a mountain near the Lake Benacus in the\nterritory of Verona, to which all the herbalists in the country continually\nflock; Ortelius one in Apulia, Munster Mons major in Istria; others\nMontpelier in France; Prosper Altinus prefers Egyptian simples, Garcias ab\nHorto Indian before the rest, another those of Italy, Crete, &c. Many times\nthey are over-curious in this kind, whom Fuchsius taxeth, _Instit. l. 1.\nsec. 1. cap. 1._ [4115]\"that think they do nothing, except they rake all\nover India, Arabia, Ethiopia for remedies, and fetch their physic from the\nthree quarters of the world, and from beyond the Garamantes. Many an old\nwife or country woman doth often more good with a few known and common\ngarden herbs, than our bombast physicians, with all their prodigious,\nsumptuous, far-fetched, rare, conjectural medicines:\" without all question\nif we have not these rare exotic simples, we hold that at home, which is in\nvirtue equivalent unto them, ours will serve as well as theirs, if they be\ntaken in proportionable quantity, fitted and qualified aright, if not much\nbetter, and more proper to our constitutions. But so 'tis for the most\npart, as Pliny writes to Gallus, [4116]\"We are careless of that which is\nnear us, and follow that which is afar off, to know which we will travel\nand sail beyond the seas, wholly neglecting that which is under our eyes.\"\nOpium in Turkey doth scarce offend, with us in a small quantity it\nstupefies; cicuta or hemlock is a strong poison in Greece, but with us it\nhath no such violent effects: I conclude with I. Voschius, who as he much\ninveighs against those exotic medicines, so he promiseth by our European, a\nfull cure and absolute of all diseases; _a capite ad calcem, nostrae\nregionis herbae nostris corporibus magis conducunt_, our own simples agree\nbest with us. It was a thing that Fernelius much laboured in his French\npractice, to reduce all his cure to our proper and domestic physic; so did\n[4117]Janus Cornarius, and Martin Rulandus in Germany. T. B. with us, as\nappeareth by a treatise of his divulged in our tongue 1615, to prove the\nsufficiency of English medicines, to the cure of all manner of diseases. If\nour simples be not altogether of such force, or so apposite, it may be, if\nlike industry were used, those far fetched drugs would prosper as well with\nus, as in those countries whence now we have them, as well as cherries,\nartichokes, tobacco, and many such. There have been diverse worthy\nphysicians, which have tried excellent conclusions in this kind, and many\ndiligent, painful apothecaries, as Gesner, Besler, Gerard, &c., but amongst\nthe rest those famous public gardens of Padua in Italy, Nuremberg in\nGermany, Leyden in Holland, Montpelier in France, (and ours in Oxford now\nin _fieri_, at the cost and charges for the Right Honourable the Lord\nDanvers Earl of Danby) are much to be commended, wherein all exotic plants\nalmost are to be seen, and liberal allowance yearly made for their better\nmaintenance, that young students may be the sooner informed in the\nknowledge of them: which as [4118]Fuchsius holds, \"is most necessary for\nthat exquisite manner of curing,\" and as great a shame for a physician not\nto observe them, as for a workman not to know his axe, saw, square, or any\nother tool which he must of necessity use.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Alteratives, Herbs, other Vegetables, &c._\n\nAmongst these 800 simples, which Galeottus reckons up, _lib. 3. de promise,\ndoctor, cap. 3_, and many exquisite herbalists have written of, these few\nfollowing alone I find appropriated to this humour: of which some be\nalteratives; [4119]\"which by a secret force,\" saith Renodeus, \"and special\nquality expel future diseases, perfectly cure those which are, and many\nsuch incurable effects.\" This is as well observed in other plants, stones,\nminerals, and creatures, as in herbs, in other maladies as in this. How\nmany things are related of a man's skull? What several virtues of corns in\na horse-leg, [4120]of a wolf's liver, &c. Of [4121]diverse excrements of\nbeasts, all good against several diseases? What extraordinary virtues are\nascribed unto plants? [4122]_Satyrium et eruca penem erigunt, vitex et\nnymphea semen extinguunt_, [4123]some herbs provoke lust, some again, as\nagnus castus, water-lily, quite extinguisheth seed; poppy causeth sleep,\ncabbage resisteth drunkenness, &c., and that which is more to be admired,\nthat such and such plants should have a peculiar virtue to such particular\nparts, [4124]as to the head aniseeds, foalfoot, betony, calamint,\neye-bright, lavender, bays, roses, rue, sage, marjoram, peony, &c. For the\nlungs calamint, liquorice, ennula campana, hyssop, horehound, water\ngermander, &c. For the heart, borage, bugloss, saffron, balm, basil,\nrosemary, violet, roses, &c. For the stomach, wormwood, mints, betony,\nbalm, centaury, sorrel, parslan. For the liver, darthspine or camaepitis,\ngermander, agrimony, fennel, endive, succory, liverwort, barberries. For\nthe spleen, maidenhair, finger-fern, dodder of thyme, hop, the rind of ash,\nbetony. For the kidneys, grumel, parsley, saxifrage, plaintain, mallow. For\nthe womb, mugwort, pennyroyal, fetherfew, savine, &c. For the joints,\ncamomile, St. John's wort, organ, rue, cowslips, centaury the less, &c. And\nso to peculiar diseases. To this of melancholy you shall find a catalogue\nof herbs proper, and that in every part. See more in Wecker, Renodeus,\nHeurnius _lib. 2. cap. 19._ &c. I will briefly speak of them, as first of\nalteratives, which Galen, in his third book of diseased parts, prefers\nbefore diminutives, and Trallianus brags, that he hath done more cures on\nmelancholy men [4125]by moistening, than by purging of them.\n\n_Borage_.] In this catalogue, borage and bugloss may challenge the chiefest\nplace, whether in substance, juice, roots, seeds, flowers, leaves,\ndecoctions, distilled waters, extracts, oils, &c., for such kind of herbs\nbe diversely varied. Bugloss is hot and moist, and therefore worthily\nreckoned up amongst those herbs which expel melancholy, and [4126]\nexhilarate the heart, Galen, _lib. 6. cap. 80. de simpl. med._ Dioscorides,\n_lib. 4. cap. 123._ Pliny much magnifies this plant. It may be diversely\nused; as in broth, in [4127]wine, in conserves, syrups, &c. It is an\nexcellent cordial, and against this malady most frequently prescribed; a\nherb indeed of such sovereignty, that as Diodorus, _lib. 7. bibl._ Plinius,\n_lib. 25. cap. 2. et lib. 21. cap. 22._ Plutarch, _sympos. lib. 1. cap. 1._\nDioscorides, _lib. 5. cap. 40._ Caelius, _lib. 19. c. 3._ suppose it was\nthat famous Nepenthes of [4128]Homer, which Polydaenna, Thonis's wife (then\nking of Thebes in Egypt), sent Helena for a token, of such rare virtue,\n\"that if taken steeped in wine, if wife and children, father and mother,\nbrother and sister, and all thy dearest friends should die before thy face,\nthou couldst not grieve or shed a tear for them.\"\n\n       \"Qui semel id patera mistum Nepenthes Iaccho\n        Hauserit, hic lachrymam, non si suavissima proles,\n        Si germanus ei charus, materque paterque\n        Oppetat, ante oculos ferro confossus atroci.\"\n\nHelena's commended bowl to exhilarate the heart, had no other ingredient,\nas most of our critics conjecture, than this of borage.\n\n_Balm_.] Melissa balm hath an admirable virtue to alter melancholy, be it\nsteeped in our ordinary drink, extracted, or otherwise taken. Cardan, _lib.\n8._ much admires this herb. It heats and dries, saith [4129] Heurnius, in\nthe second degree, with a wonderful virtue comforts the heart, and purgeth\nall melancholy vapours from the spirits, Matthiol. _in lib. 3. cap. 10. in\nDioscoridem_. Besides they ascribe other virtues to it, [4130]\"as to help\nconcoction, to cleanse the brain, expel all careful thoughts, and anxious\nimaginations:\" the same words in effect are in Avicenna, Pliny, Simon\nSethi, Fuchsius, Leobel, Delacampius, and every herbalist. Nothing better\nfor him that is melancholy than to steep this and borage in his ordinary\ndrink.\n\nMathiolus, in his fifth book of Medicinal Epistles, reckons up scorzonera,\n[4131]\"not against poison only, falling sickness, and such as are\nvertiginous, but to this malady; the root of it taken by itself expels\nsorrow, causeth mirth and lightness of heart.\"\n\nAntonius Musa, that renowned physician to Caesar Augustus, in his book\nwhich he writ of the virtues of betony, _cap. 6._ wonderfully commends that\nherb, _animas hominum et corpora custodit, securas de metu reddit_, it\npreserves both body and mind, from fears, cares, griefs; cures falling\nsickness, this and many other diseases, to whom Galen subscribes, _lib. 7.\nsimp. med._ Dioscorides, _lib. 4. cap. 1. &c._\n\nMarigold is much approved against melancholy, and often used therefore in\nour ordinary broth, as good against this and many other diseases.\n\n_Hop_.] Lupulus, hop, is a sovereign remedy; Fuchsius, _cap. 58. Plant.\nhist_. much extols it; [4132]\"it purgeth all choler, and purifies the\nblood.\" Matthiol. _cap. 140. in 4. Dioscor._ wonders the physicians of his\ntime made no more use of it, because it rarefies and cleanseth: we use it\nto this purpose in our ordinary beer, which before was thick and fulsome.\n\nWormwood, centaury, pennyroyal, are likewise magnified and much prescribed\n(as I shall after show), especially in hypochondriac melancholy, daily to\nbe used, sod in whey: and as Ruffus Ephesias, [4133]Areteus relate, by\nbreaking wind, helping concoction, many melancholy men have been cured with\nthe frequent use of them alone.\n\nAnd because the spleen and blood are often misaffected in melancholy, I may\nnot omit endive, succory, dandelion, fumitory, &c., which cleanse the\nblood, Scolopendria, cuscuta, ceterache, mugwort, liverwort, ash, tamarisk,\ngenist, maidenhair, &c., which must help and ease the spleen.\n\nTo these I may add roses, violets, capers, featherfew, scordium, staechas,\nrosemary, ros solis, saffron, ochyme, sweet apples, wine, tobacco, sanders,\n&c. That Peruvian chamico, _monstrosa facultate &c._, Linshcosteus Datura;\nand to such as are cold, the [4134]decoction of guiacum, China\nsarsaparilla, sassafras, the flowers of carduus benedictus, which I find\nmuch used by Montanus in his Consultations, Julius Alexandrinus, Lelius,\nEgubinus, and others. [4135]Bernardus Penottus prefers his herba solis, or\nDutch sindaw, before all the rest in this disease, \"and will admit of no\nherb upon the earth to be comparable to it.\" It excels Homer's moly, cures\nthis, falling sickness, and almost all other infirmities. The same Penottus\nspeaks of an excellent balm out of Aponensis, which, taken to the quantity\nof three drops in a cup of wine, [4136]\"will cause a sudden alteration,\ndrive away dumps, and cheer up the heart.\" Ant. Guianerius, in his\nAntidotary, hath many such. [4137]Jacobus de Dondis the aggregator, repeats\nambergris, nutmegs, and allspice amongst the rest. But that cannot be\ngeneral. Amber and spice will make a hot brain mad, good for cold and\nmoist. Garcias ab Horto hath many Indian plants, whose virtues he much\nmagnifies in this disease. Lemnius, _instit. cap. 58._ admires rue, and\ncommends it to have excellent virtue, [4138]\"to expel vain imaginations,\ndevils, and to ease afflicted souls.\" Other things are much magnified\n[4139]by writers, as an old cock, a ram's head, a wolf's heart borne or\neaten, which Mercurialis approves; Prosper Altinus the water of Nilus;\nGomesius all seawater, and at seasonable times to be seasick: goat's milk,\nwhey, &c.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Precious Stones, Metals, Minerals, Alteratives_.\n\nPrecious stones are diversely censured; many explode the use of them or any\nminerals in physic, of whom Thomas Erastus is the chief, in his tract\nagainst Paracelsus, and in an epistle of his to Peter Monavius, [4140]\n\"That stones can work any wonders, let them believe that list, no man shall\npersuade me; for my part, I have found by experience there is no virtue in\nthem.\" But Matthiolus, in his comment upon [4141]Dioscorides, is as profuse\non the other side, in their commendation; so is Cardan, Renodeus, Alardus,\nRueus, Encelius, Marbodeus, &c. [4142]Matthiolus specifies in coral: and\nOswaldus Crollius, _Basil. Chym_. prefers the salt of coral.\n[4143]Christoph. Encelius, _lib. 3. cap. 131._ will have them to be as so\nmany several medicines against melancholy, sorrow, fear, dullness, and the\nlike; [4144]Renodeus admires them, \"besides they adorn kings' crowns, grace\nthe fingers, enrich our household stuff, defend us from enchantments,\npreserve health, cure diseases, they drive away grief, cares, and\nexhilarate the mind.\" The particulars be these.\n\nGranatus, a precious stone so called, because it is like the kernels of a\npomegranate, an imperfect kind of ruby, it comes from Calecut; [4145]\"if\nhung about the neck, or taken in drink, it much resisteth sorrow, and\nrecreates the heart.\" The same properties I find ascribed to the hyacinth\nand topaz. [4146]They allay anger, grief, diminish madness, much delight\nand exhilarate the mind. [4147]\"If it be either carried about, or taken in\na potion, it will increase wisdom,\" saith Cardan, \"expel fear; he brags\nthat he hath cured many madmen with it, which, when they laid by the stone,\nwere as mad again as ever they were at first.\" Petrus Bayerus, _lib. 2.\ncap. 13. veni mecum_, Fran. Rueus, _cap. 19. de geminis_, say as much of\nthe chrysolite, [4148]a friend of wisdom, an enemy to folly. Pliny, _lib.\n37._ Solinus, _cap. 52._ Albertus _de Lapid._ Cardan. Encelius, _lib. 3.\ncap. 66._ highly magnifies the virtue of the beryl, [4149]\"it much avails\nto a good understanding, represseth vain conceits, evil thoughts, causeth\nmirth,\" &c. In the belly of a swallow there is a stone found called\nchelidonius, [4150]\"which if it be lapped in a fair cloth, and tied to the\nright arm, will cure lunatics, madmen, make them amiable and merry.\"\n\nThere is a kind of onyx called a chalcedony, which hath the same qualities,\n[4151]\"avails much against fantastic illusions which proceed from\nmelancholy,\" preserves the vigour and good estate of the whole body.\n\nThe Eban stone, which goldsmiths use to sleeken their gold with, borne\nabout or given to drink, [4152]hath the same properties, or not much\nunlike.\n\nLevinus Lemnius, _Institui. ad vit. cap. 58._ amongst other jewels, makes\nmention of two more notable; carbuncle and coral, [4153]\"which drive away\nchildish fears, devils, overcome sorrow, and hung about the neck repress\ntroublesome dreams,\" which properties almost Cardan gives to that\ngreen-coloured [4154]emmetris if it be carried about, or worn in a ring;\nRueus to the diamond.\n\nNicholas Cabeus, a Jesuit of Ferrara, in the first book of his Magnetical\nPhilosophy, _cap. 3._ speaking of the virtues of a loadstone, recites many\nseveral opinions; some say that if it be taken in parcels inward, _si quis\nper frustra voret, juventutem restituet_, it will, like viper's wine,\nrestore one to his youth; and yet if carried about them, others will have\nit to cause melancholy; let experience determine.\n\nMercurialis admires the emerald for its virtues in pacifying all affections\nof the mind; others the sapphire, which is \"the [4155]fairest of all\nprecious stones, of sky colour, and a great enemy to black choler, frees\nthe mind, mends manners,\" &c. Jacobus de Dondis, in his catalogue of\nsimples, hath ambergris, _os in corde cervi_, [4156]the bone in a stag's\nheart, a monocerot's horn, bezoar's stone [4157](of which elsewhere), it is\nfound in the belly of a little beast in the East Indies, brought into\nEurope by Hollanders, and our countrymen merchants. Renodeus, _cap. 22.\nlib. 3. de ment. med_. saith he saw two of these beasts alive, in the\ncastle of the Lord of Vitry at Coubert.\n\nLapis lazuli and armenus, because they purge, shall be mentioned in their\nplace.\n\nOf the rest in brief thus much I will add out of Cardan, Renodeus, _cap.\n23. lib. 3._ Rondoletius, _lib. 1. de Testat. c. 15. &c._ [4158]\"That\nalmost all jewels and precious stones have excellent virtues\" to pacify the\naffections of the mind, for which cause rich men so much covet to have\nthem: [4159]\"and those smaller unions which are found in shells amongst the\nPersians and Indians, by the consent of all writers, are very cordial, and\nmost part avail to the exhilaration of the heart.\"\n\n_Minerals._] Most men say as much of gold and some other minerals, as these\nhave done of precious stones. Erastus still maintains the opposite part.\n_Disput. in Paracelsum. cap. 4. fol. 196._ he confesseth of gold, [4160]\n\"that it makes the heart merry, but in no other sense but as it is in a\nmiser's chest:\" _at mihi plaudo simul ac nummos contemplor in arca_, as he\nsaid in the poet, it so revives the spirits, and is an excellent recipe\nagainst melancholy,\n\n[4161] _For gold in physic is a cordial,\n        Therefore he loved gold in special._\n\n_Aurum potabile_, [4162]he discommends and inveighs against it, by reason\nof the corrosive waters which are used in it: which argument our Dr. Guin\nurgeth against D. Antonius. [4163]Erastus concludes their philosophical\nstones and potable gold, &c. \"to be no better than poison,\" a mere\nimposture, a _non ens_; dug out of that broody hill belike this golden\nstone is, _ubi nascetur ridiculus mus_. Paracelsus and his chemistical\nfollowers, as so many Promethei, will fetch fire from heaven, will cure all\nmanner of diseases with minerals, accounting them the only physic on the\nother side. [4164]Paracelsus calls Galen, Hippocrates, and all their\nadherents, infants, idiots, sophisters, &c. _Apagesis istos qui Vulcanias\nistas metamorphoses sugillant, inscitiae soboles, supinae pertinaciae\nalumnos_, &c., not worthy the name of physicians, for want of these\nremedies: and brags that by them he can make a man live 160 years, or to\nthe world's end, with their [4165]_Alexipharmacums, Panaceas, Mummias,\nunguentum Armarium_, and such magnetical cures, _Lampas vitae et mortis,\nBalneum Dianae, Balsamum, Electrum Magico-physicum, Amuleta Martialia_, &c.\nWhat will not he and his followers effect? He brags, moreover, that he was\n_primus medicorum_, and did more famous cures than all the physicians in\nEurope besides, [4166]\"a drop of his preparations should go farther than a\ndram, or ounce of theirs,\" those loathsome and fulsome filthy potions,\nheteroclitical pills (so he calls them), horse medicines, _ad quoram\naspectum Cyclops Polyphemus exhorresceret_. And though some condemn their\nskill and magnetical cures as tending to magical superstition, witchery,\ncharms, &c., yet they admire, stiffly vindicate nevertheless, and\ninfinitely prefer them. But these are both in extremes, the middle sort\napprove of minerals, though not in so high a degree. Lemnius _lib. 3. cap.\n6. de occult. nat. mir_. commends gold inwardly and outwardly used, as in\nrings, excellent good in medicines; and such mixtures as are made for\nmelancholy men, saith Wecker, _antid. spec. lib. 1._ to whom Renodeus\nsubscribes, _lib. 2. cap. 2._ Ficinus, _lib. 2. cap. 19._ Fernel. _meth.\nmed. lib. 5. cap. 21. de Cardiacis_. Daniel Sennertus, _lib. 1. part. 2.\ncap. 9._ Audernacus, Libavius, Quercetanus, Oswaldus Crollius, Euvonymus,\nRubeus, and Matthiolus in the fourth book of his Epistles, Andreas a Blawen\n_epist. ad Matthiolum_, as commended and formerly used by Avicenna,\nArnoldus, and many others: [4167]Matthiolus in the same place approves of\npotable gold, mercury, with many such chemical confections, and goes so far\nin approbation of them, that he holds [4168] \"no man can be an excellent\nphysician that hath not some skill in chemistical distillations, and that\nchronic diseases can hardly be cured without mineral medicines:\" look for\nantimony among purgers.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Compound Alteratives; censure of Compounds, and mixed\nPhysic_.\n\nPliny, _lib. 24. c. 1_, bitterly taxeth all compound medicines, [4169]\n\"Men's knavery, imposture, and captious wits, have invented those shops, in\nwhich every man's life is set to sale: and by and by came in those\ncompositions and inexplicable mixtures, far-fetched out of India and\nArabia; a medicine for a botch must be had as far as the Red Sea.\" And 'tis\nnot without cause which he saith; for out of question they are much to\n[4170]blame in their compositions, whilst they make infinite variety of\nmixtures, as [4171]Fuchsius notes. \"They think they get themselves great\ncredit, excel others, and to be more learned than the rest, because they\nmake many variations; but he accounts them fools, and whilst they brag of\ntheir skill, and think to get themselves a name, they become ridiculous,\nbetray their ignorance and error.\" A few simples well prepared and\nunderstood, are better than such a heap of nonsense, confused compounds,\nwhich are in apothecaries' shops ordinarily sold. \"In which many vain,\nsuperfluous, corrupt, exolete, things out of date are to be had\" (saith\nCornarius); \"a company of barbarous names given to syrups, juleps, an\nunnecessary company of mixed medicines;\" _rudis indigestaque moles_. Many\ntimes (as Agrippa taxeth) there is by this means [4172]\"more danger from\nthe medicine than from the disease,\" when they put together they know not\nwhat, or leave it to an illiterate apothecary to be made, they cause death\nand horror for health. Those old physicians had no such mixtures; a simple\npotion of hellebore in Hippocrates' time was the ordinary purge; and at\nthis day, saith [4173]Mat. Riccius, in that flourishing commonwealth of\nChina, \"their physicians give precepts quite opposite to ours, not unhappy\nin their physic; they use altogether roots, herbs, and simples in their\nmedicines, and all their physic in a manner is comprehended in a herbal: no\nscience, no school, no art, no degree, but like a trade, every man in\nprivate is instructed of his master.\" [4174]Cardan cracks that he can cure\nall diseases with water alone, as Hippocrates of old did most infirmities\nwith one medicine. Let the best of our rational physicians demonstrate and\ngive a sufficient reason for those intricate mixtures, why just so many\nsimples in mithridate or treacle, why such and such quantity; may they not\nbe reduced to half or a quarter? _Frustra fit per plura_ (as the saying is)\n_quod fieri potest per pauciora_; 300 simples in a julep, potion, or a\nlittle pill, to what end or purpose? I know not what [4175]Alkindus,\nCapivaccius, Montagna, and Simon Eitover, the best of them all and most\nrational, have said in this kind; but neither he, they, nor any one of\nthem, gives his reader, to my judgment, that satisfaction which he ought;\nwhy such, so many simples? Rog. Bacon hath taxed many errors in his tract\n_de graduationibus_, explained some things, but not cleared. Mercurialis in\nhis book _de composit. medicin._ gives instance in Hamech, and Philonium\nRomanum, which Hamech an Arabian, and Philonius a Roman, long since\ncomposed, but _crasse_ as the rest. If they be so exact, as by him it seems\nthey were, and those mixtures so perfect, why doth Fernelius alter the one,\nand why is the other obsolete? [4176]Cardan taxeth Galen for presuming out\nof his ambition to correct Theriachum Andromachi, and we as justly may carp\nat all the rest. Galen's medicines are now exploded and rejected; what\nNicholas Meripsa, Mesue, Celsus, Scribanius, Actuarius, &c. writ of old,\nare most part contemned. Mellichius, Cordus, Wecker, Quercetan, Renodeus,\nthe Venetian, Florentine states have their several receipts, and\nmagistrals: they of Nuremberg have theirs, and Augustana Pharmacopoeia,\npeculiar medicines to the meridian of the city: London hers, every city,\ntown, almost every private man hath his own mixtures, compositions,\nreceipts, magistrals, precepts, as if he scorned antiquity, and all others\nin respect of himself. But each man must correct and alter to show his\nskill, every opinionative fellow must maintain his own paradox, be it what\nit will; _Delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi_: they dote, and in the\nmeantime the poor patients pay for their new experiments, the commonalty\nrue it.\n\nThus others object, thus I may conceive out of the weakness of my\napprehension; but to say truth, there is no such fault, no such ambition,\nno novelty, or ostentation, as some suppose; but as [4177]one answers, this\nof compound medicines, \"is a most noble and profitable invention found out,\nand brought into physic with great judgment, wisdom, counsel and\ndiscretion.\" Mixed diseases must have mixed remedies, and such simples are\ncommonly mixed as have reference to the part affected, some to qualify, the\nrest to comfort, some one part, some another. Cardan and Brassavola both\nhold that _Nullum simplex medicamentum sine noxa_, no simple medicine is\nwithout hurt or offence; and although Hippocrates, Erasistratus, Diocles of\nold, in the infancy of this art, were content with ordinary simples: yet\nnow, saith [4178]Aetius, \"necessity compelleth to seek for new remedies,\nand to make compounds of simples, as well to correct their harms if cold,\ndry, hot, thick, thin, insipid, noisome to smell, to make them savoury to\nthe palate, pleasant to taste and take, and to preserve them for\ncontinuance, by admixtion of sugar, honey, to make them last months and\nyears for several uses.\" In such cases, compound medicines may be approved,\nand Arnoldus in his 18. aphorism, doth allow of it. [4179]\"If simples\ncannot, necessity compels us to use compounds;\" so for receipts and\nmagistrals, _dies diem docet_, one day teacheth another, and they are as so\nmany words or phrases, _Que nunc sunt in honore vocabula si volet usus_,\nebb and flow with the season, and as wits vary, so they may be infinitely\nvaried. _Quisque suum placitum quo capiatur habet._ \"Every man as he likes,\nso many men so many minds,\" and yet all tending to good purpose, though not\nthe same way. As arts and sciences, so physic is still perfected amongst\nthe rest; _Horae musarum nutrices_, and experience teacheth us every day\n[4180]many things which our predecessors knew not of. Nature is not effete,\nas he saith, or so lavish, to bestow all her gifts upon an age, but hath\nreserved some for posterity, to show her power, that she is still the same,\nand not old or consumed. Birds and beasts can cure themselves by nature,\n[4181]_naturae usu ea plerumque cognoscunt quae homines vix longo labore et\ndoctrina assequuntur_, but \"men must use much labour and industry to find\nit out.\" But I digress.\n\nCompound medicines are inwardly taken, or outwardly applied. Inwardly\ntaken, be either liquid or solid: liquid, are fluid or consisting. Fluid,\nas wines and syrups. The wines ordinarily used to this disease are wormwood\nwine, tamarisk, and buglossatum, wine made of borage and bugloss, the\ncomposition of which is specified in Arnoldus Villanovanus, _lib. de\nvinis_, of borage, balm, bugloss, cinnamon, &c. and highly commended for\nits virtues: [4182]\"it drives away leprosy, scabs, clears the blood,\nrecreates the spirits, exhilarates the mind, purgeth the brain of those\nanxious black melancholy fumes, and cleanseth the whole body of that black\nhumour by urine. To which I add,\" saith Villanovanus, \"that it will bring\nmadmen, and such raging bedlamites as are tied in chains, to the use of\ntheir reason again. My conscience bears me witness, that I do not lie, I\nsaw a grave matron helped by this means; she was so choleric, and so\nfurious sometimes, that she was almost mad, and beside herself; she said,\nand did she knew not what, scolded, beat her maids, and was now ready to be\nbound till she drank of this borage wine, and by this excellent remedy was\ncured, which a poor foreigner, a silly beggar, taught her by chance, that\ncame to crave an alms from door to door.\" The juice of borage, if it be\nclarified, and drunk in wine, will do as much, the roots sliced and\nsteeped, &c. saith Ant. Mizaldus, _art. med._ who cities this story\nverbatim out of Villanovanus, and so doth Magninus a physician of Milan, in\nhis regimen of health. Such another excellent compound water I find in\nRubeus _de distill. sect. 3._ which he highly magnifies out of Savanarola,\n[4183]\"for such as are solitary, dull, heavy or sad without a cause, or be\ntroubled with trembling of heart.\" Other excellent compound waters for\nmelancholy, he cites in the same place. [4184]\"If their melancholy be not\ninflamed, or their temperature over-hot.\" Evonimus hath a precious\n_aquavitae_ to this purpose, for such as are cold. But he and most commend\n_aurum potabile_, and every writer prescribes clarified whey, with borage,\nbugloss, endive, succory, &c. of goat's milk especially, some indefinitely\nat all times, some thirty days together in the spring, every morning\nfasting, a good draught. Syrups are very good, and often used to digest\nthis humour in the heart, spleen, liver, &c. As syrup of borage (there is a\nfamous syrup of borage highly commended by Laurentius to this purpose in\nhis tract of melancholy), _de pomis_ of king Sabor, now obsolete, of thyme\nand epithyme, hops, scolopendria, fumitory, maidenhair, bizantine, &c.\nThese are most used for preparatives to other physic, mixed with distilled\nwaters of like nature, or in juleps otherwise.\n\nConsisting, are conserves or confections; conserves of borage, bugloss,\nbalm, fumitory, succory, maidenhair, violets, roses, wormwood, &c.\nConfections, treacle, mithridate, eclegms, or linctures, &c. Solid, as\naromatical confections: hot, _diambra, diamargaritum calidum, dianthus,\ndiamoschum dulce, electuarium de gemmis laetificans Galeni et Rhasis,\ndiagalanga, diaciminum dianisum, diatrion piperion, diazinziber, diacapers,\ndiacinnamonum_: Cold, as _diamargaritum frigidum, diacorolli, diarrhodon\nabbatis, diacodion_, &c. as every _pharmacopoeia_ will show you, with their\ntables or losings that are made out of them: with condites and the like.\n\nOutwardly used as occasion serves, as amulets, oils hot and cold, as of\ncamomile, staechados, violets, roses, almonds, poppy, nymphea, mandrake,\n&c. to be used after bathing, or to procure sleep.\n\nOintments composed of the said species, oils and wax, &c., as\n_Alablastritum Populeum_, some hot, some cold, to moisten, procure sleep,\nand correct other accidents.\n\nLiniments are made of the same matter to the like purpose: emplasters of\nherbs, flowers, roots, &c., with oils, and other liquors mixed and boiled\ntogether.\n\nCataplasms, salves, or poultices made of green herbs, pounded, or sod in\nwater till they be soft, which are applied to the hypochondries, and other\nparts, when the body is empty.\n\nCerotes are applied to several parts and frontals, to take away pain,\ngrief, heat, procure sleep. Fomentations or sponges, wet in some\ndecoctions, &c., epithemata, or those moist medicines, laid on linen, to\nbathe and cool several parts misaffected.\n\nSacculi, or little bags of herbs, flowers, seeds, roots, and the like,\napplied to the head, heart, stomach, &c., odoraments, balls, perfumes,\nposies to smell to, all which have their several uses in melancholy, as\nshall be shown, when I treat of the cure of the distinct species by\nthemselves.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Purging Simples upward_.\n\nMelanagoga, or melancholy purging medicines, are either simple or compound,\nand that gently, or violently, purging upward or downward. These following\npurge upward. [4185]Asarum, or Asrabecca, which, as Mesue saith, is hot in\nthe second degree, and dry in the third, \"it is commonly taken in wine,\nwhey,\" or as with us, the juice of two or three leaves or more sometimes,\npounded in posset drink qualified with a little liquorice, or aniseed, to\navoid the fulsomeness of the taste, or as _Diaserum Fernelii_. Brassivola\n_in Catart_. reckons it up amongst those simples that only purge\nmelancholy, and Ruellius confirms as much out of his experience, that it\npurgeth [4186]black choler, like hellebore itself. Galen, _lib. G.\nsimplic_. and [4187]Matthiolus ascribe other virtues to it, and will have\nit purge other humours as well as this.\n\nLaurel, by Heurnius's method, _ad prax. lib. 2. cap. 24._ is put amongst\nthe strong purgers of melancholy; it is hot and dry in the fourth degree.\nDioscorides, _lib. 11. cap. 114._ adds other effects to it. [4188]Pliny\nsets down fifteen berries in drink for a sufficient potion: it is commonly\ncorrected with his opposites, cold and moist, as juice of endive, purslane,\nand is taken in a potion to seven grains and a half. But this and\nasrabecca, every gentlewoman in the country knows how to give, they are two\ncommon vomits.\n\nScilla, or sea-onion, is hot and dry in the third degree. Brassivola _in\nCatart_. out of Mesue, others, and his own experience, will have this\nsimple to purge [4189]melancholy alone. It is an ordinary vomit, _vinum\nscilliticum_ mixed with rubel in a little white wine.\n\nWhite hellebore, which some call sneezing-powder, a strong purger upward,\nwhich many reject, as being too violent: Mesue and Averroes will not admit\nof it, [4190]\"by reason of danger of suffocation,\" [4191]\"great pain and\ntrouble it puts the poor patient to,\" saith Dodonaeus. Yet Galen, _lib. 6.\nsimpl. med._ and Dioscorides, _cap. 145._ allow of it. It was indeed [4192]\n\"terrible in former times,\" as Pliny notes, but now familiar, insomuch that\nmany took it in those days, [4193]\"that were students, to quicken their\nwits,\" which Persius _Sat. 1._ objects to Accius the poet, _Illas Acci\nebria veratro_. [4194]\"It helps melancholy, the falling sickness, madness,\ngout, &c., but not to be taken of old men, youths, such as are weaklings,\nnice, or effeminate, troubled with headache, high-coloured, or fear\nstrangling,\" saith Dioscorides. [4195]Oribasius, an old physician, hath\nwritten very copiously, and approves of it, \"in such affections which can\notherwise hardly be cured.\" Hernius, _lib. 2. prax. med. de vomitoriis_,\nwill not have it used [4196]\"but with great caution, by reason of its\nstrength, and then when antimony will do no good,\" which caused Hermophilus\nto compare it to a stout captain (as Codroneus observes _cap. 7. comment.\nde Helleb._) that will see all his soldiers go before him and come _post\nprincipia_, like the bragging soldier, last himself; [4197]when other helps\nfail in inveterate melancholy, in a desperate case, this vomit is to be\ntaken. And yet for all this, if it be well prepared, it may be [4198]\nsecurely given at first. [4199]Matthiolus brags, that he hath often, to the\ngood of many, made use of it, and Heurnius, [4200]\"that he hath happily\nused it, prepared after his own prescript,\" and with good success.\nChristophorus a Vega, _lib. 3. c. 41_, is of the same opinion, that it may\nbe lawfully given; and our country gentlewomen find it by their common\npractice, that there is no such great danger in it. Dr. Turner, speaking of\nthis plant in his Herbal, telleth us, that in his time it was an ordinary\nreceipt among good wives, to give hellebore in powder to ii'd weight, and\nhe is not much against it. But they do commonly exceed, for who so bold as\nblind Bayard, and prescribe it by pennyworths, and such irrational ways, as\nI have heard myself market folks ask for it in an apothecary's shop: but\nwith what success God knows; they smart often for their rash boldness and\nfolly, break a vein, make their eyes ready to start out of their heads, or\nkill themselves. So that the fault is not in the physic, but in the rude\nand indiscreet handling of it. He that will know, therefore, when to use,\nhow to prepare it aright, and in what dose, let him read Heurnius _lib. 2.\nprax. med_. Brassivola _de Catart_. Godefridus Stegius the emperor\nRudolphus' physician, _cap. 16._ Matthiolus in Dioscor. and that excellent\ncommentary of Baptista Codroncus, which is _instar omnium de Helleb. alb._\nwhere we shall find great diversity of examples and receipts.\n\nAntimony or stibium, which our chemists so much magnify, is either taken in\nsubstance or infusion, &c., and frequently prescribed in this disease. \"It\nhelps all infirmities,\" saith [4201]Matthiolus, \"which proceed from black\ncholer, falling sickness, and hypochondriacal passions;\" and for farther\nproof of his assertion, he gives several instances of such as have been\nfreed with it: [4202]one of Andrew Gallus, a physician of Trent, that after\nmany other essays, \"imputes the recovery of his health, next after God, to\nthis remedy alone.\" Another of George Handshius, that in like sort, when\nother medicines failed, [4203]\"was by this restored to his former health,\nand which of his knowledge others have likewise tried, and by the help of\nthis admirable medicine, been recovered.\" A third of a parish priest at\nPrague in Bohemia, [4204]\"that was so far gone with melancholy, that he\ndoted, and spake he knew not what; but after he had taken twelve grains of\nstibium, (as I myself saw, and can witness, for I was called to see this\nmiraculous accident) he was purged of a deal of black choler, like little\ngobbets of flesh, and all his excrements were as black blood (a medicine\nfitter for a horse than a man), yet it did him so much good, that the next\nday he was perfectly cured.\" This very story of the Bohemian priest,\nSckenkius relates _verbatim, Exoter. experiment. ad. var. morb. cent. 6.\nobserv. 6._ with great approbation of it. Hercules de Saxonia calls it a\nprofitable medicine, if it be taken after meat to six or eight grains, of\nsuch as are apt to vomit. Rodericus a Fonseca the Spaniard, and late\nprofessor of Padua in Italy, extols it to this disease, Tom. 2. consul. 85.\nso doth Lod. Mercatus _de inter. morb. cur. lib. 1. cap. 17._ with many\nothers. Jacobus Gervinus a French physician, on the other side, _lib. 2. de\nvenemis confut._ explodes all this, and saith he took three grains only\nupon Matthiolus and some others' commendation, but it almost killed him,\nwhereupon he concludes, [4205]\"antimony is rather poison than a medicine.\"\nTh. Erastus concurs with him in his opinion, and so doth Aelian Montaltus\n_cap. 30 de melan._ But what do I talk? 'tis the subject of whole books; I\nmight cite a century of authors _pro_ and _con_. I will conclude with\n[4206]Zuinger, antimony is like Scanderbeg's sword, which is either good or\nbad, strong or weak, as the party is that prescribes, or useth it: \"a\nworthy medicine if it be rightly applied to a strong man, otherwise\npoison.\" For the preparing of it, look in _Evonimi thesaurus_, Quercetan,\nOswaldus Crollius, Basil. _Chim. Basil._ Valentius, &c.\n\nTobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes far beyond all\nthe panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher's stones, a sovereign remedy to\nall diseases. A good vomit, I confess, a virtuous herb, if it be well\nqualified, opportunely taken, and medicinally used; but as it is commonly\nabused by most men, which take it as tinkers do ale, 'tis a plague, a\nmischief, a violent purger of goods, lands, health, hellish, devilish and\ndamned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Simples purging Melancholy downward_.\n\nPolypody and epithyme are, without all exceptions, gentle purgers of\nmelancholy. Dioscorides will have them void phlegm; but Brassivola out of\nhis experience averreth, that they purge this humour; they are used in\ndecoction, infusion, &c. simple, mixed, &c.\n\nMirabolanes, all five kinds, are happily [4207]prescribed against\nmelancholy and quartan agues; Brassivola speaks out [4208]\"of a thousand\"\nexperiences, he gave them in pills, decoctions, &c., look for peculiar\nreceipts in him.\n\nStoechas, fumitory, dodder, herb mercury, roots of capers, genista or\nbroom, pennyroyal and half-boiled cabbage, I find in this catalogue of\npurgers of black choler, origan, featherfew, ammoniac [4209]salt,\nsaltpetre. But these are very gentle; alyppus, dragon root, centaury,\nditany, colutea, which Fuchsius _cap. 168_ and others take for senna, but\nmost distinguish. Senna is in the middle of violent and gentle purgers\ndownward, hot in the second degree, dry in the first. Brassivola calls it\n[4210]\"a wonderful herb against melancholy, it scours the blood, lightens\nthe spirits, shakes off sorrow, a most profitable medicine,\" as [4211]\nDodonaeus terms it, invented by the Arabians, and not heard of before. It\nis taken diverse ways, in powder, infusion, but most commonly in the\ninfusion, with ginger, or some cordial flowers added to correct it.\nActuarius commends it sodden in broth, with an old cock, or in whey, which\nis the common conveyor of all such things as purge black choler; or steeped\nin wine, which Heurnius accounts sufficient, without any farther\ncorrection.\n\nAloes by most is said to purge choler, but Aurelianus _lib. 2. c. 6. de\nmorb. chron._ Arculanus _cap. 6. in 9. Rhasis_ Julius Alexandrinus,\n_consil. 185._ Scoltz. Crato _consil 189._ Scoltz. prescribe it to this\ndisease; as good for the stomach and to open the haemorrhoids, out of\nMesue, Rhasis, Serapio, Avicenna: Menardus _ep. lib. 1. epist. 1._ opposeth\nit, aloes [4212]\"doth not open the veins,\" or move the haemorrhoids, which\nLeonhartus Fuchsius _paradox. lib. 1._ likewise affirms; but Brassivola and\nDodonaeus defend Mesue out of their experience; let [4213]Valesius end the\ncontroversy.\n\nLapis armenus and lazuli are much magnified by [4214]Alexander _lib. 1.\ncap. 16._ Avicenna, Aetius, and Actuarius, if they be well washed, that the\nwater be no more coloured, fifty times some say. [4215]\"That good\nAlexander\" (saith Guianerus) \"puts such confidence in this one medicine,\nthat he thought all melancholy passions might be cured by it; and I for my\npart have oftentimes happily used it, and was never deceived in the\noperation of it.\" The like may be said of lapis lazuli, though it be\nsomewhat weaker than the other. Garcias ab Horto, _hist. lib. 1. cap. 65._\nrelates, that the [4216]physicians of the Moors familiarly prescribe it to\nall melancholy passions, and Matthiolus _ep. lib. 3._ [4217]brags of that\nhappy success which he still had in the administration of it. Nicholas\nMeripsa puts it amongst the best remedies, _sect. 1. cap. 12._ in\nAntidotis; [4218]\"and if this will not serve\" (saith Rhasis) \"then there\nremains nothing but lapis armenus and hellebore itself.\" Valescus and Jason\nPratensis much commend pulvis hali, which is made of it. James Damascen.\n_2. cap. 12._ Hercules de Saxonia, &c., speaks well of it. Crato will not\napprove this; it and both hellebores, he saith, are no better than poison.\nVictor Trincavelius, _lib. 2. cap. 14_, found it in his experience,\n[4219]\"to be very noisome, to trouble the stomach, and hurt their bodies\nthat take it overmuch.\"\n\nBlack hellebore, that most renowned plant, and famous purger of melancholy,\nwhich all antiquity so much used and admired, was first found out by\nMelanpodius a shepherd, as Pliny records, _lib. 25. cap. 5._ [4220]who,\nseeing it to purge his goats when they raved, practised it upon Elige and\nCalene, King Praetus' daughters, that ruled in Arcadia, near the fountain\nClitorius, and restored them to their former health. In Hippocrates's time\nit was in only request, insomuch that he writ a book of it, a fragment of\nwhich remains yet. Theophrastus, [4221]Galen, Pliny, Caelius Aurelianus, as\nancient as Galen, _lib. 1, cap. 6._ Aretus _lib. 1. cap. 5._ Oribasius\n_lib. 7. collect._ a famous Greek, Aetius _ser. 3. cap. 112 & 113 p._\nAegineta, Galen's Ape, _lib. 7. cap. 4._ Actuarius, Trallianus _lib. 5.\ncap. 15._ Cornelius Celsus only remaining of the old Latins, _lib. 3. cap.\n23_, extol and admire this excellent plant; and it was generally so much\nesteemed of the ancients for this disease amongst the rest, that they sent\nall such as were crazed, or that doted, to the Anticyrae, or to Phocis in\nAchaia, to be purged, where this plant was in abundance to be had. In\nStrabo's time it was an ordinary voyage, _Naviget Anticyras_; a common\nproverb among the Greeks and Latins, to bid a dizzard or a mad man go take\nhellebore; as in Lucian, Menippus to Tantalus, _Tantale desipis, helleboro\nepoto tibi opus est, eoque sane meraco_, thou art out of thy little wit, O\nTantalus, and must needs drink hellebore, and that without mixture.\nAristophanes _in Vespis_, drink hellebore, &c. and Harpax in the [4222]\nComoedian, told Simo and Ballio, two doting fellows, that they had need to\nbe purged with this plant. When that proud Menacrates [Greek: o zeus], had\nwrit an arrogant letter to Philip of Macedon, he sent back no other answer\nbut this, _Consulo tibi ut ad Anticyram te conferas_, noting thereby that\nhe was crazed, _atque ellebore indigere_, had much need of a good purge.\nLilius Geraldus saith, that Hercules, after all his mad pranks upon his\nwife and children, was perfectly cured by a purge of hellebore, which an\nAnticyrian administered unto him. They that were sound commonly took it to\nquicken their wits, (as Ennis of old, [4223]_Qui non nisi potus ad\narma--prosiluit dicenda_, and as our poets drink sack to improve their\ninventions (I find it so registered by Agellius _lib. 17. cap. 15._)\nCameades the academic, when he was to write against Zeno the stoic, purged\nhimself with hellebore first, which [4224]Petronius puts upon Chrysippus.\nIn such esteem it continued for many ages, till at length Mesue and some\nother Arabians began to reject and reprehend it, upon whose authority for\nmany following lustres, it was much debased and quite out of request, held\nto be poison and no medicine; and is still oppugned to this day by [4225]\nCrato and some junior physicians. Their reasons are, because Aristotle _l.\n1. de plant. c. 3._ said, henbane and hellebore were poison; and Alexander\nAphrodiseus, in the preface of his problems, gave out, that (speaking of\nhellebore) [4226]\"Quails fed on that which was poison to men.\" Galen. _l.\n6. Epid. com. 5. Text. 35._ confirms as much: [4227]Constantine the emperor\nin his Geoponicks, attributes no other virtue to it, than to kill mice and\nrats, flies and mouldwarps, and so Mizaldus, Nicander of old, Gervinus,\nSckenkius, and some other Neoterics that have written of poisons, speak of\nhellebore in a chief place. [4228]Nicholas Leonicus hath a story of Solon,\nthat besieging, I know not what city, steeped hellebore in a spring of\nwater, which by pipes was conveyed into the middle of the town, and so\neither poisoned, or else made them so feeble and weak by purging, that they\nwere not able to bear arms. Notwithstanding all these cavils and\nobjections, most of our late writers do much approve of it. [4229]\nGariopontus _lib. 1. cap. 13._ Codronchus _com. de helleb._ Fallopius _lib.\nde med. purg. simpl. cap. 69. et consil. 15._ Trincavelii, Montanus 239.\nFrisemelica _consil. 14._ Hercules de Saxonia, so that it be opportunely\ngiven. Jacobus de Dondis, Agg. Amatus, Lucet. _cent. 66._ Godef. Stegius\n_cap. 13._ Hollerius, and all our herbalists subscribe. Fernelius _meth.\nmed. lib. 5. cap. 16._ \"confesseth it to be a [4230] terrible purge and\nhard to take, yet well given to strong men, and such as have able bodies.\"\nP. Forestus and Capivaccius forbid it to be taken in substance, but allow\nit in decoction or infusion, both which ways P. Monavius approves above all\nothers, _Epist. 231. Scoltzii_, Jacchinus in _9. Rhasis_, commends a\nreceipt of his own preparing; Penottus another of his chemically prepared,\nEvonimus another. Hildesheim _spicel. 2. de mel._ hath many examples how it\nshould be used, with diversity of receipts. Heurnius _lib. 7. prax. med.\ncap. 14._ \"calls it an [4231]innocent medicine howsoever, if it be well\nprepared.\" The root of it is only in use, which may be kept many years, and\nby some given in substance, as by Fallopius and Brassivola amongst the\nrest, who [4232]brags that he was the first that restored it again to its\nuse, and tells a story how he cured one Melatasta, a madman, that was\nthought to be possessed, in the Duke of Ferrara's court, with one purge of\nblack hellebore in substance: the receipt is there to be seen; his\nexcrements were like ink, [4233]he perfectly healed at once; Vidus Vidius,\na Dutch physician, will not admit of it in substance, to whom most\nsubscribe, but as before, in the decoction, infusion, or which is all in\nall, in the extract, which he prefers before the rest, and calls _suave\nmedicamentum_, a sweet medicine, an easy, that may be securely given to\nwomen, children, and weaklings. Baracellus, _horto geniali_, terms it\n_maximae praestantia medicamentum_, a medicine of great worth and note.\nQuercetan in his _Spagir Phar_. and many others, tell wonders of the\nextract. Paracelsus, above all the rest, is the greatest admirer of this\nplant; and especially the extract, he calls it _Theriacum, terrestre\nBalsamum_, another treacle, a terrestrial balm, _instar omnium_, \"all in\nall, the [4234]sole and last refuge to cure this malady, the gout,\nepilepsy, leprosy,\" &c. If this will not help, no physic in the world can\nbut mineral, it is the upshot of all. Matthiolus laughs at those that\nexcept against it, and though some abhor it out of the authority of Mesue,\nand dare not adventure to prescribe it, [4235]\"yet I\" (saith he) \"have\nhappily used it six hundred times without offence, and communicated it to\ndivers worthy physicians, who have given me great thanks for it.\" Look for\nreceipts, dose, preparation, and other cautions concerning this simple, in\nhim, Brassivola, Baracelsus, Codronchus, and the rest.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Compound Purgers_.\n\nCompound medicines which purge melancholy, are either taken in the superior\nor inferior parts: superior at mouth or nostrils. At the mouth swallowed or\nnot swallowed: If swallowed liquid or solid: liquid, as compound wine of\nhellebore, scilla or sea-onion, senna, _Vinum Scilliticum, Helleboratum_,\nwhich [4236]Quercetan so much applauds \"for melancholy and madness, either\ninwardly taken, or outwardly applied to the head, with little pieces of\nlinen dipped warm in it.\" _Oxymel. Scilliticum, Syrupus Helleboratus_ major\nand minor in Quercetan, and _Syrupus Genistae_ for hypochondriacal\nmelancholy in the same author, compound syrup of succory, of fumitory,\npolypody, &c. Heurnius his purging cock-broth. Some except against these\nsyrups, as appears by [4237]Udalrinus Leonoras his epistle to Matthiolus,\nas most pernicious, and that out of Hippocrates, _cocta movere, et\nmedicari, non cruda_, no raw things to be used in physic; but this in the\nfollowing epistle is exploded and soundly confuted by Matthiolus: many\njuleps, potions, receipts, are composed of these, as you shall find in\nHildesheim _spicel. 2._ Heurnius _lib. 2. cap. 14._ George Sckenkius _Ital.\nmed. prax._ &c.\n\nSolid purges are confections, electuaries, pills by themselves, or compound\nwith others, as _de lapide lazulo, armeno, pil. indae, of fumitory_, &c.\nConfection of Hamech, which though most approve, Solenander _sec. 5.\nconsil. 22._ bitterly inveighs against, so doth Rondoletius _Pharmacop.\nofficina_, Fernelius and others; diasena, diapolypodium, diacassia,\ndiacatholicon, Wecker's electuary de Epithymo, Ptolemy's hierologadium, of\nwhich divers receipts are daily made.\n\nAetius _22. 23._ commends _Hieram Ruffi._ Trincavelius _consil. 12. lib.\n4._ approves of hiera; _non, inquit, invenio melius medicamentum_, I find\nno better medicine, he saith. Heurnius adds _pil. aggregat. pills de\nEpithymo. pil. Ind._ Mesue describes in the _Florentine Antidotary_,\n_Pilulae sine quibus esse nolo, Pilulae, Cochics, cum Helleboro, Pil.\nArabicae, Faetida, de quinque generibus mirabolanorum_, &c. More proper to\nmelancholy, not excluding in the meantime, turbith, manna, rhubarb, agaric,\nelescophe, &c. which are not so proper to this humour. For, as Montaltus\nholds _cap. 30._ and Montanus _cholera etiam purganda, quod atrae, sit\npabulum_, choler is to be purged because it feeds the other: and some are\nof an opinion, as Erasistratus and Asclepiades maintained of old, against\nwhom Galen disputes, [4238]\"that no physic doth purge one humour alone, but\nall alike or what is next.\" Most therefore in their receipts and magistrals\nwhich are coined here, make a mixture of several simples and compounds to\npurge all humours in general as well as this. Some rather use potions than\npills to purge this humour, because that as Heurnius and Crato observe,\n_hic succus a sicco remedio agre trahitur_, this juice is not so easily\ndrawn by dry remedies, and as Montanus adviseth _25 cons._ \"All\n[4239]drying medicines are to be repelled, as aloe, hiera,\" and all pills\nwhatsoever, because the disease is dry of itself.\n\nI might here insert many receipts of prescribed potions, boles, &c. The\ndoses of these, but that they are common in every good physician, and that\nI am loath to incur the censure of Forestus, _lib. 3. cap. 6. de urinis_,\n[4240]\"against those that divulge and publish medicines in their\nmother-tongue,\" and lest I should give occasion thereby to some ignorant\nreader to practise on himself, without the consent of a good physician.\n\nSuch as are not swallowed, but only kept in the mouth, are gargarisms used\ncommonly after a purge, when the body is soluble and loose. Or\napophlegmatisms, masticatories, to be held and chewed in the mouth, which\nare gentle, as hyssop, origan, pennyroyal, thyme, mustard; strong, as\npellitory, pepper, ginger, &c.\n\nSuch as are taken into the nostrils, errhina are liquid or dry, juice of\npimpernel, onions, &c., castor, pepper, white hellebore, &c. To these you\nmay add odoraments, perfumes, and suffumigations, &c.\n\nTaken into the inferior parts are clysters strong or weak, suppositories of\nCastilian soap, honey boiled to a consistence; or stronger of scammony,\nhellebore, &c.\n\nThese are all used, and prescribed to this malady upon several occasions,\nas shall be shown in its place.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Chirurgical Remedies_.\n\nIn letting of blood three main circumstances are to be considered, [4241]\n\"Who, how much, when.\" That is, that it be done to such a one as may endure\nit, or to whom it may belong, that he be of a competent age, not too young,\nnor too old, overweak, fat, or lean, sore laboured, but to such as have\nneed, are full of bad blood, noxious humours, and may be eased by it.\n\nThe quantity depends upon the party's habit of body, as he is strong or\nweak, full or empty, may spare more or less.\n\nIn the morning is the fittest time: some doubt whether it be best fasting,\nor full, whether the moon's motion or aspect of planets be to be observed;\nsome affirm, some deny, some grant in acute, but not in chronic diseases,\nwhether before or after physic. 'Tis Heurnius' aphorism _a phlebotomia\nauspicandum esse curiationem, non a pharmacia_, you must begin with\nbloodletting and not physic; some except this peculiar malady. But what do\nI? Horatius Augenius, a physician of Padua, hath lately writ 17 books of\nthis subject, Jobertus, &c.\n\nParticular kinds of bloodletting in use [4242]are three, first is that\nopening a vein in the arm with a sharp knife, or in the head, knees, or any\nother parts, as shall be thought fit.\n\nCupping-glasses with or without scarification, _ocyssime compescunt_, saith\nFernelius, they work presently, and are applied to several parts, to divert\nhumours, aches, winds, &c.\n\nHorseleeches are much used in melancholy, applied especially to the\nhaemorrhoids. Horatius Augenius, _lib. 10. cap. 10._ Platerus _de mentis\nalienat. cap. 3._ Altomarus, Piso, and many others, prefer them before any\nevacuations in this kind.\n\n[4243]Cauteries, or searing with hot irons, combustions, borings, lancings,\nwhich, because they are terrible, _Dropax_ and _Sinapismus_ are invented by\nplasters to raise blisters, and eating medicines of pitch, mustard-seed,\nand the like.\n\nIssues still to be kept open, made as the former, and applied in and to\nseveral parts, have their use here on divers occasions, as shall be shown.\n\n\nSECT. V. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Particular Cure of the three several Kinds; of Head\nMelancholy_.\n\nThe general cures thus briefly examined and discussed, it remains now to\napply these medicines to the three particular species or kinds, that,\naccording to the several parts affected, each man may tell in some sort how\nto help or ease himself. I will treat of head melancholy first, in which,\nas in all other good cures, we must begin with diet, as a matter of most\nmoment, able oftentimes of itself to work this effect. I have read, saith\nLaurentius, _cap. 8. de Melanch_. that in old diseases which have gotten\nthe upper hand or a habit, the manner of living is to more purpose, than\nwhatsoever can be drawn out of the most precious boxes of the apothecaries.\nThis diet, as I have said, is not only in choice of meat and drink, but of\nall those other non-natural things. Let air be clear and moist most part:\ndiet moistening, of good juice, easy of digestion, and not windy: drink\nclear, and well brewed, not too strong, nor too small. \"Make a melancholy\nman fat,\" as [4244]Rhasis saith, \"and thou hast finished the cure.\"\nExercise not too remiss, nor too violent. Sleep a little more than\nordinary. [4245]Excrements daily to be voided by art or nature; and which\nFernelius enjoins his patient, _consil. 44_, above the rest, to avoid all\npassions and perturbations of the mind. Let him not be alone or idle (in\nany kind of melancholy), but still accompanied with such friends and\nfamiliars he most affects, neatly dressed, washed, and combed, according to\nhis ability at least, in clean sweet linen, spruce, handsome, decent, and\ngood apparel; for nothing sooner dejects a man than want, squalor, and\nnastiness, foul, or old clothes out of fashion. Concerning the medicinal\npart, he that will satisfy himself at large (in this precedent of diet) and\nsee all at once the whole cure and manner of it in every distinct species,\nlet him consult with Gordonius, Valescus, with Prosper Calenius, _lib. de\natra bile ad Card._ Caesium, Laurentius, _cap. 8. et 9. de mela._ Aelian\nMontaltus, _de mel. cap. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30._ Donat. ab Altomari, _cap. 7.\nartis med_.

Wherein he\nshall find particular receipts, the whole method, preparatives, purgers,\ncorrectors, averters, cordials in great variety and abundance: out of\nwhich, because every man cannot attend to read or peruse them, I will\ncollect for the benefit of the reader, some few more notable medicines.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Bloodletting_.\n\nPhlebotomy is promiscuously used before and after physic, commonly before,\nand upon occasion is often reiterated, if there be any need at least of it.\nFor Galen, and many others, make a doubt of bleeding at all in this kind of\nhead-melancholy. If the malady, saith Piso, _cap. 23._ and Altomarus, _cap.\n7._ Fuchsius, _cap. 33._ [4246]\"shall proceed primarily from the\nmisaffected brain, the patient in such case shall not need at all to bleed,\nexcept the blood otherwise abound, the veins be full, inflamed blood, and\nthe party ready to run mad.\" In immaterial melancholy, which especially\ncomes from a cold distemperature of spirits, Hercules de Saxonia, _cap.\n17._ will not admit of phlebotomy; Laurentius, _cap. 9_, approves it out of\nthe authority of the Arabians; but as Mesue, Rhasis, Alexander appoint,\n[4247]\"especially in the head,\" to open the veins of the forehead, nose and\nears is good. They commonly set cupping-glasses on the party's shoulders,\nhaving first scarified the place, they apply horseleeches on the head, and\nin all melancholy diseases, whether essential or accidental, they cause the\nhaemorrhoids to be opened, having the eleventh aphorism of the sixth book\nof Hippocrates for their ground and warrant, which saith, \"That in\nmelancholy and mad men, the varicose tumour or haemorrhoids appearing doth\nheal the same.\" Valescus prescribes bloodletting in all three kinds, whom\nSallust. Salvian follows. [4248]\"If the blood abound, which is discerned by\nthe fullness of the veins, his precedent diet, the party's laughter, age,\n&c., begin with the median or middle vein of the arm; if the blood be ruddy\nand clear, stop it, but if black in the spring time, or a good season, or\nthick, let it run, according to the party's strength: and some eight or\ntwelve days after, open the head vein, and the veins in the forehead, or\nprovoke it out of the nostrils, or cupping-glasses,\" &c. Trallianus allows\nof this, [4249]\"If there have been any suppression or stopping of blood at\nnose, or haemorrhoids, or women's months, then to open a vein in the head\nor about the ankles.\" Yet he doth hardly approve of this course, if\nmelancholy be situated in the head alone, or in any other dotage,\n[4250]\"except it primarily proceed from blood, or that the malady be\nincreased by it; for bloodletting refrigerates and dries up, except the\nbody be very full of blood, and a kind of ruddiness in the face.\" Therefore\nI conclude with Areteus, [4251]\"before you let blood, deliberate of it,\"\nand well consider all circumstances belonging to it.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Preparatives and Purgers_.\n\nAfter bloodletting we must proceed to other medicines; first prepare, and\nthen purge, _Augeae stabulum purgare_, make the body clean before we hope\nto do any good. Walter Bruel would have a practitioner begin first with a\nclyster of his, which he prescribes before bloodletting: the common sort,\nas Mercurialis, Montaltus _cap. 30._ &c. proceed from lenitives to\npreparatives, and so to purgers. Lenitives are well known, _electuarium\nlenitivum, diaphenicum diacatholicon_, &c. Preparatives are usually syrups\nof borage, bugloss, apples, fumitory, thyme and epithyme, with double as\nmuch of the same decoction or distilled water, or of the waters of bugloss,\nbalm, hops, endive, scolopendry, fumitory, &c. or these sodden in whey,\nwhich must be reiterated and used for many days together. Purges come last,\n\"which must not be used at all, if the malady may be otherwise helped,\"\nbecause they weaken nature and dry so much, and in giving of them, [4252]\n\"we must begin with the gentlest first.\" Some forbid all hot medicines, as\nAlexander, and Salvianus, &c. _Ne insaniores inde fiant_, hot medicines\nincrease the disease [4253]\"by drying too much.\" Purge downward rather than\nupward, use potions rather than pills, and when you begin physic, persevere\nand continue in a course; for as one observes, [4254]_movere et non educere\nin omnibus malum est_; to stir up the humour (as one purge commonly doth)\nand not to prosecute, doth more harm than good. They must continue in a\ncourse of physic, yet not so that they tire and oppress nature, _danda\nquies naturae_, they must now and then remit, and let nature have some\nrest. The most gentle purges to begin with, are [4255]senna, cassia,\nepithyme, myrabolanea, catholicon: if these prevail not, we may proceed to\nstronger, as the confection of hamech, pil. Indae, fumitoriae, de\nassaieret, of lapis armenus and lazuli, diasena. Or if pills be too dry;\n[4256]some prescribe both hellebores in the last place, amongst the rest\nAretus, [4257]\"because this disease will resist a gentle medicine.\"\nLaurentius and Hercules de Saxonia would have antimony tried last, \"if the\n[4258]party be strong, and it warily given.\" [4259]Trincavelius prefers\nhierologodium, to whom Francis Alexander in his _Apol. rad. 5._ subscribes,\na very good medicine they account it. But Crato in a counsel of his, for\nthe duke of Bavaria's chancellor, wholly rejects it.\n\nI find a vast chaos of medicines, a confusion of receipts and magistrals,\namongst writers, appropriated to this disease; some of the chiefest I will\nrehearse. [4260]To be seasick first is very good at seasonable times.\nHelleborismus Matthioli, with which he vaunts and boasts he did so many\nseveral cures, [4261]\"I never gave it\" (saith he), \"but after once or\ntwice, by the help of God, they were happily cured.\" The manner of making\nit he sets down at large in his third book of Epist. to George Hankshius a\nphysician. Walter Bruel, and Heurnius, make mention of it with great\napprobation; so doth Sckenkius in his memorable cures, and experimental\nmedicines, _cen. 6. obser. 37._ That famous Helleborisme of Montanus, which\nhe so often repeats in his consultations and counsels, as _28. pro. melan.\nsacerdote, et consil. 148. pro hypochondriaco_, and cracks, [4262] \"to be a\nmost sovereign remedy for all melancholy persons, which he hath often given\nwithout offence, and found by long experience and observations to be such.\"\n\nQuercetan prefers a syrup of hellebore in his _Spagirica Pharmac._ and\nHellebore's extract _cap. 5._ of his invention likewise (\"a most safe\nmedicine and not unfit to be given children\") before all remedies\nwhatsoever. [4263]\n\nParacelsus, in his book of black hellebore, admits this medicine, but as it\nis prepared by him. [4264]\"It is most certain\" (saith he) \"that the virtue\nof this herb is great, and admirable in effect, and little differing from\nbalm itself; and he that knows well how to make use of it, hath more art\nthan all their books contain, or all the doctors in Germany can show.\"\n\nAelianus Montaltus in his exquisite work _de morb. capitis, cap. 31. de\nmel._ sets a special receipt of his own, which, in his practice [4265]\"he\nfortunately used; because it is but short I will set it down.\"\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx]. Syrupe de pomis [Symbol: Ounce]ij, aquae borag.\n        [Symbol: Ounce]iiij. Ellebori nigri per noctem infusi in ligatura 6\n        vel 8 gr. mane facta collatura exhibe.\"\n\nOther receipts of the same to this purpose you shall find in him. Valescus\nadmires _pulvis Hali_, and Jason Pratensis after him: the confection of\nwhich our new London Pharmacopoeia hath lately revived. [4266]\"Put case\"\n(saith he) \"all other medicines fail, by the help of God this alone shall\ndo it, and 'tis a crowned medicine which must be kept in secret.\"\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx].

Rubeus\nhis [4268]compound water out of Savanarola; Pinetus his balm; Cardan's\n_Pulvis Hyacinthi_, with which, in his book _de curis admirandis_, he\nboasts that he had cured many melancholy persons in eight days, which\n[4269]Sckenkius puts amongst his observable medicines; Altomarus his syrup,\nwith which [4270]he calls God so solemnly to witness, he hath in his kind\ndone many excellent cures, and which Sckenkius _cent. 7. observ. 80._\nmentioneth, Daniel Sennertus _lib. 1. part. 2. cap. 12._ so much commends;\nRulandus' admirable water for melancholy, which _cent. 2. cap. 96._ he\nnames _Spiritum vitae aureum, Panaceam_, what not, and his absolute\nmedicine of 50 eggs, _curat. Empir. cent. 1. cur. 5._ to be taken three in\na morning, with a powder of his. [4271]Faventinus _prac. Emper_. doubles\nthis number of eggs, and will have 101 to be taken by three and three in\nlike sort, which Sallust Salvian approves _de red. med. lib. 2. c. 1._ with\nsome of the same powder, till all be spent, a most excellent remedy for all\nmelancholy and mad men.\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx]. Epithymi, thymi, ana drachmas duas, sacchari albi\n        unciam unam, croci grana tria, Cinamomi drachmam unam; misce, fiat\n        pulvis.\"\n\nAll these yet are nothing to those [4272]chemical preparatives of _Aqua\nChalidonia_, quintessence of hellebore, salts, extracts, distillations,\noils, _Aurum potabile_, &c. Dr. Anthony in his book _de auro potab. edit.\n1600._ is all in all for it. [4273]\"And though all the schools of\nGalenists, with a wicked and unthankful pride and scorn, detest it in their\npractice, yet in more grievous diseases, when their vegetals will do no\ngood,\" they are compelled to seek the help of minerals, though they \"use\nthem rashly, unprofitably, slackly, and to no purpose.\" Rhenanus, a Dutch\nchemist, in his book _de Sale e puteo emergente_, takes upon him to\napologise for Anthony, and sets light by all that speak against him. But\nwhat do I meddle with this great controversy, which is the subject of many\nvolumes? Let Paracelsus, Quercetan, Crollius, and the brethren of the rosy\ncross, defend themselves as they may. Crato, Erastus, and the Galenists\noppugn Paracelsus, he brags on the other side, he did more famous cures by\nthis means, than all the Galenists in Europe, and calls himself a monarch;\nGalen, Hippocrates, infants, illiterate, &c. As Thessalus of old railed\nagainst those ancient Asclepiadean writers, [4274]\"he condemns others,\ninsults, triumphs, overcomes all antiquity\" (saith Galen as if he spake to\nhim) \"declares himself a conqueror, and crowns his own doings. [4275]One\ndrop of their chemical preparatives shall do more good than all their\nfulsome potions.\" Erastus, and the rest of the Galenists vilify them on the\nother side, as heretics in physic; [4276]\"Paracelsus did that in physic,\nwhich Luther in Divinity. [4277]A drunken rogue he was, a base fellow, a\nmagician, he had the devil for his master, devils his familiar companions,\nand what he did, was done by the help of the devil.\" Thus they contend and\nrail, and every mart write books _pro_ and _con, et adhuc sub judice lis\nest_: let them agree as they will, I proceed.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Averters_.\n\nAverters and purgers must go together, as tending all to the same purpose,\nto divert this rebellious humour, and turn it another way. In this range,\nclysters and suppositories challenge a chief place, to draw this humour\nfrom the brain and heart, to the more ignoble parts. Some would have them\nstill used a few days between, and those to be made with the boiled seeds\nof anise, fennel, and bastard saffron, hops, thyme, epithyme, mallows,\nfumitory, bugloss, polypody, senna, diasene, hamech, cassia, diacatholicon,\nhierologodium, oil of violets, sweet almonds, &c. For without question, a\nclyster opportunely used, cannot choose in this, as most other maladies,\nbut to do very much good; _Clysteres nutriunt_, sometimes clysters nourish,\nas they may be prepared, as I was informed not long since by a learned\nlecture of our natural philosophy [4278]reader, which he handled by way of\ndiscourse, out of some other noted physicians. Such things as provoke urine\nmost commend, but not sweat. Trincavelius _consil. 16. cap. 1._ in\nhead-melancholy forbids it. P. Byarus and others approve frictions of the\noutward parts, and to bathe them with warm water. Instead of ordinary\nfrictions, Cardan prescribes rubbing with nettles till they blister the\nskin, which likewise [4279]Basardus Visontinus so much magnifies.\n\nSneezing, masticatories, and nasals are generally received. Montaltus _c.\n34._ Hildesheim _spicel. 3. fol. 136 and 238._ give several receipts of all\nthree. Hercules de Saxonia relates of an empiric in Venice [4280]\"that had\na strong water to purge by the mouth and nostrils, which he still used in\nhead-melancholy, and would sell for no gold.\"\n\nTo open months and haemorrhoids is very good physic, [4281]\"If they have\nbeen formerly stopped.\" Faventinus would have them opened with\nhorseleeches, so would Hercul. de Sax. Julius Alexandrinus _consil. 185.\nScoltzii_ thinks aloes fitter: [4282]most approve horseleeches in this\ncase, to be applied to the forehead, [4283]nostrils, and other places.\n\nMontaltus _cap. 29._ out of Alexander and others, prescribes [4284]\n\"cupping-glasses, and issues in the left thigh.\" Aretus _lib. 7. cap. 5._\n[4285]Paulus Regolinus, Sylvius will have them without scarification,\n\"applied to the shoulders and back, thighs and feet:\" [4286]Montaltus _cap.\n34._ \"bids open an issue in the arm, or hinder part of the head.\"\n[4287]Piso enjoins ligatures, frictions, suppositories, and\ncupping-glasses, still without scarification, and the rest.\n\nCauteries and hot irons are to be used [4288]\"in the suture of the crown,\nand the seared or ulcerated place suffered to run a good while. 'Tis not\namiss to bore the skull with an instrument, to let out the fuliginous\nvapours.\" Sallus. Salvianus _de re medic. lib. 2. cap. 1._ [4289]\"because\nthis humour hardly yields to other physic, would have the leg cauterised,\nor the left leg, below the knee, [4290]and the head bored in two or three\nplaces,\" for that it much avails to the exhalation of the vapours; [4291]\n\"I saw\" (saith he) \"a melancholy man at Rome, that by no remedies could be\nhealed, but when by chance he was wounded in the head, and the skull\nbroken, he was excellently cured.\" Another, to the admiration of the\nbeholders, [4292]\"breaking his head with a fall from on high, was instantly\nrecovered of his dotage.\" Gordonius _cap. 13. part. 2._ would have these\ncauteries tried last, when no other physic will serve. [4293] \"The head to\nbe shaved and bored to let out fumes, which without doubt will do much\ngood. I saw a melancholy man wounded in the head with a sword, his brainpan\nbroken; so long as the wound was open he was well, but when his wound was\nhealed, his dotage returned again.\" But Alexander Messaria a professor in\nPadua, _lib. 1. pract. med. cap. 21. de melanchol_. will allow no cauteries\nat all, 'tis too stiff a humour and too thick as he holds, to be so\nevaporated.\n\nGuianerius _c. 8. Tract. 15._ cured a nobleman in Savoy, by boring alone,\n[4294]\"leaving the hole open a month together,\" by means of which, after\ntwo years' melancholy and madness, he was delivered. All approve of this\nremedy in the suture of the crown; but Arculanus would have the cautery to\nbe made with gold. In many other parts, these cauteries are prescribed for\nmelancholy men, as in the thighs, (_Mercurialis consil. 86._) arms, legs.\n_Idem consil. 6. & 19. & 25._ Montanus 86. Rodericus a Fonseca _tom. 2.\ncousult. 84. pro hypochond. coxa dextra_, &c., but most in the head, \"if\nother physic will do no good.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Alteratives and Cordials, corroborating, resolving the\nReliques, and mending the Temperament_.\n\nBecause this humour is so malign of itself, and so hard to be removed, the\nreliques are to be cleansed, by alteratives, cordials, and such means: the\ntemper is to be altered and amended, with such things as fortify and\nstrengthen the heart and brain, [4295]\"which are commonly both affected in\nthis malady, and do mutually misaffect one another:\" which are still to be\ngiven every other day, or some few days inserted after a purge, or like\nphysic, as occasion serves, and are of such force, that many times they\nhelp alone, and as [4296]Arnoldus holds in his Aphorisms, are to be\n\"preferred before all other medicines, in what kind soever.\"\n\nAmongst this number of cordials and alteratives, I do not find a more\npresent remedy, than a cup of wine or strong drink, if it be soberly and\nopportunely used. It makes a man bold, hardy, courageous, [4297]\"whetteth\nthe wit,\" if moderately taken, (and as Plutarch [4298]saith, _Symp. 7.\nquaest. 12._) \"it makes those which are otherwise dull, to exhale and\nevaporate like frankincense, or quicken\" (Xenophon adds) [4299]as oil doth\nfire. [4300]\"A famous cordial\" Matthiolus in Dioscoridum calls it, \"an\nexcellent nutriment to refresh the body, it makes a good colour, a\nflourishing age, helps concoction, fortifies the stomach, takes away\nobstructions, provokes urine, drives out excrements, procures sleep, clears\nthe blood, expels wind and cold poisons, attenuates, concocts, dissipates\nall thick vapours, and fuliginous humours.\" And that which is all in all to\nmy purpose, it takes away fear and sorrow. [4301]_Curas edaces dissipat\nEvius_. \"It glads the heart of man,\" Psal. civ. 15. _hilaritatis dulce\nseminarium_. Helena's bowl, the sole nectar of the gods, or that true\nnepenthes in [4302]Homer, which puts away care and grief, as Oribasius _5.\nCollect, cap. 7._ and some others will, was nought else but a cup of good\nwine. \"It makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless both one, of the\nbond and freeman, poor and rich; it turneth all his thoughts to joy and\nmirth, makes him remember no sorrow or debt, but enricheth his heart, and\nmakes him speak by talents,\" Esdras iii. 19, 20, 21. It gives life itself,\nspirits, wit, &c. For which cause the ancients called Bacchus, _Liber pater\na liberando_, and [4303]sacrificed to Bacchus and Pallas still upon an\naltar. [4304]\"Wine measurably drunk, and in time, brings gladness and\ncheerfulness of mind, it cheereth God and men,\" Judges ix. 13. _laetitiae\nBacchus dator_, it makes an old wife dance, and such as are in misery to\nforget evil, and be [4305]merry.\n\n       \"Bacchus et afflictis requiem mortalibus affert,\n        Crura licet duro compede vincta forent.\"\n\n       \"Wine makes a troubled soul to rest,\n        Though feet with fetters be opprest.\"\n\nDemetrius in Plutarch, when he fell into Seleucus's hands, and was prisoner\nin Syria, [4306]\"spent his time with dice and drink that he might so ease\nhis discontented mind, and avoid those continual cogitations of his present\ncondition wherewith he was tormented.\" Therefore Solomon, Prov. xxxi. 6,\nbids \"wine be given to him that is ready to [4307]perish, and to him that\nhath grief of heart, let him drink that he forget his poverty, and remember\nhis misery no more.\" _Sollicitis animis onus eximit_, it easeth a burdened\nsoul, nothing speedier, nothing better; which the prophet Zachariah\nperceived, when he said, \"that in the time of Messias, they of Ephraim\nshould be glad, and their heart should rejoice as through wine.\" All which\nmakes me very well approve of that pretty description of a feast in [4308]\nBartholomeus Anglicus, when grace was said, their hands washed, and the\nguests sufficiently exhilarated, with good discourse, sweet music, dainty\nfare, _exhilarationis gratia, pocula iterum atque iterum offeruntur_, as a\ncorollary to conclude the feast, and continue their mirth, a grace cup came\nin to cheer their hearts, and they drank healths to one another again and\nagain. Which as I. Fredericus Matenesius, _Crit. Christ. lib. 2. cap. 5, 6,\n& 7_, was an old custom in all ages in every commonwealth, so as they be\nnot enforced, _bibere per violentiam_, but as in that royal feast of [4309]\nAhasuerus, which lasted 180 days, \"without compulsion they drank by order\nin golden vessels,\" when and what they would themselves. This of drink is a\nmost easy and parable remedy, a common, a cheap, still ready against fear,\nsorrow, and such troublesome thoughts, that molest the mind; as brimstone\nwith fire, the spirits on a sudden are enlightened by it. \"No better\nphysic\" (saith [4310]Rhasis) \"for a melancholy man: and he that can keep\ncompany, and carouse, needs no other medicines,\" 'tis enough. His\ncountryman Avicenna, _31. doc. 2. cap. 8._ proceeds farther yet, and will\nhave him that is troubled in mind, or melancholy, not to drink only, but\nnow and then to be drunk: excellent good physic it is for this and many\nother diseases. _Magninus Reg. san. part. 3. c. 31._ will have them to be\nso once a month at least, and gives his reasons for it, [4311]\"because it\nscours the body by vomit, urine, sweat, of all manner of superfluities, and\nkeeps it clean.\" Of the same mind is Seneca the philosopher, in his book\n_de tranquil. lib. 1. c. 15._ _nonnunquam ut in aliis morbis ad ebrietatem\nusque veniendum; Curas deprimit, tristitiae medetur_, it is good sometimes\nto be drunk, it helps sorrow, depresseth cares, and so concludes this tract\nwith a cup of wine: _Habes, Serene charissime, quae ad, tranquillitatem\nanimae, pertinent_. But these are epicureal tenets, tending to looseness of\nlife, luxury and atheism, maintained alone by some heathens, dissolute\nArabians, profane Christians, and are exploded by Rabbi Moses, _tract. 4._\nGuliel, Placentius, _lib. 1. cap. 8._ Valescus de Taranta, and most\naccurately ventilated by Jo. Sylvaticus, a late writer and physician of\nMilan, _med. cont. cap. 14._ where you shall find this tenet copiously\nconfuted.\n\nHowsoever you say, if this be true, that wine and strong drink have such\nvirtue to expel fear and sorrow, and to exhilarate the mind, ever hereafter\nlet's drink and be merry.\n\n[4312] \"Prome reconditum, Lyde strenua, caecubum,\n        Capaciores puer huc affer Scyphos,\n        Et Chia vina aut Lesbia.\"\n\n       \"Come, lusty Lyda, fill's a cup of sack,\n        And, sirrah drawer, bigger pots we lack,\n        And Scio wines that have so good a smack.\"\n\nI say with him in [4313]A. Gellius, \"let us maintain the vigour of our\nsouls with a moderate cup of wine,\" [4314]_Natis in usum laetitiae\nscyphis_, \"and drink to refresh our mind; if there be any cold sorrow in\nit, or torpid bashfulness, let's wash it all away.\"--_Nunc vino pellite\ncuras_; so saith [4315]Horace, so saith Anacreon,\n\n       \"[Greek: Methuonta gar me keisthai\n        polu kreisson ae thanonta.]\"\n\nLet's drive down care with a cup of wine: and so say I too, (though I drink\nnone myself) for all this may be done, so that it be modestly, soberly,\nopportunely used: so that \"they be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"\nwhich our [4316]Apostle forewarns; for as Chrysostom well comments on that\nplace, _ad laetitiam datum est vinum, non ad ebrietatem_, 'tis for mirth\nwine, but not for madness: and will you know where, when, and how that is\nto be understood? _Vis discere ubi bonum sit vinum? Audi quid dicat\nScriptura_, hear the Scriptures, \"Give wine to them that are in sorrow,\" or\nas Paul bid Timothy drink wine for his stomach's sake, for concoction,\nhealth, or some such honest occasion. Otherwise, as [4317] Pliny telleth\nus; if singular moderation be not had, [4318]\"nothing so pernicious, 'tis\nmere vinegar, _blandus daemon_, poison itself.\" But hear a more fearful\ndoom, Habac. ii. 15. and 16. \"Woe be to him that makes his neighbour drunk,\nshameful spewing shall be upon his glory.\" Let not good fellows triumph\ntherefore (saith Matthiolus) that I have so much commended wine, if it be\nimmoderately taken, \"instead of making glad, it confounds both body and\nsoul, it makes a giddy head, a sorrowful heart.\" And 'twas well said of the\npoet of old, \"Vine causeth mirth and grief,\" [4319]nothing so good for\nsome, so bad for others, especially as [4320]one observes, _qui a causa\ncalida male habent_, that are hot or inflamed. And so of spices, they\nalone, as I have showed, cause head-melancholy themselves, they must not\nuse wine as an [4321]ordinary drink, or in their diet. But to determine\nwith Laurentius, _c. 8. de melan._ wine is bad for madmen, and such as are\ntroubled with heat in their inner parts or brains; but to melancholy, which\nis cold (as most is), wine, soberly used, may be very good.\n\nI may say the same of the decoction of China roots, sassafras,\nsarsaparilla, guaiacum: China, saith Manardus, makes a good colour in the\nface, takes away melancholy, and all infirmities proceeding from cold, even\nso sarsaparilla provokes sweat mightily, guaiacum dries, Claudinus,\n_consult. 89. & 46._ Montanus, Capivaccius, _consult. 188. Scoltzii_, make\nfrequent and good use of guaiacum and China, [4322]\"so that the liver be\nnot incensed,\" good for such as are cold, as most melancholy men are, but\nby no means to be mentioned in hot.\n\nThe Turks have a drink called coffee (for they use no wine), so named of a\nberry as black as soot, and as bitter, (like that black drink which was in\nuse amongst the Lacedaemonians, and perhaps the same,) which they sip still\nof, and sup as warm as they can suffer; they spend much time in those\ncoffeehouses, which are somewhat like our alehouses or taverns, and there\nthey sit chatting and drinking to drive away the time, and to be merry\ntogether, because they find by experience that kind of drink, so used,\nhelpeth digestion, and procureth alacrity. Some of them take opium to this\npurpose.\n\nBorage, balm, saffron, gold, I have spoken of; Montaltus, _c. 23._ commends\nscorzonera roots condite. Garcius ab Horto, _plant. hist. lib. 2. cap. 25._\nmakes mention of an herb called datura, [4323]\"which, if it be eaten for\ntwenty-four hours following, takes away all sense of grief, makes them\nincline to laughter and mirth:\" and another called bauge, like in effect to\nopium, \"which puts them for a time into a kind of ecstasy,\" and makes them\ngently to laugh. One of the Roman emperors had a seed, which he did\nordinarily eat to exhilarate himself. [4324]Christophorus Ayrerus prefers\nbezoar stone, and the confection of alkermes, before other cordials, and\namber in some cases. [4325]\"Alkermes comforts the inner parts;\" and bezoar\nstone hath an especial virtue against all melancholy affections, [4326]\"it\nrefresheth the heart, and corroborates the whole body.\" [4327]Amber\nprovokes urine, helps the body, breaks wind, &c. After a purge, 3 or 4\ngrains of bezoar stone, and 3 grains of ambergris, drunk or taken in borage\nor bugloss water, in which gold hot hath been quenched, will do much good,\nand the purge shall diminish less (the heart so refreshed) of the strength\nand substance of the body.\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx]. confect. Alkermes [Symbol: Ounce]ss lap. Bezor.\n        [Symbol: Scruple]j. Succini albi subtiliss. pulverisat. [Symbol:\n        Scruple]jj. cum Syrup, de cort. citri; fiat electuarium.\"\n\nTo bezoar stone most subscribe, Manardus, and [4328]many others; \"it takes\naway sadness, and makes him merry that useth it; I have seen some that have\nbeen much diseased with faintness, swooning, and melancholy, that taking\nthe weight of three grains of this stone, in the water of oxtongue, have\nbeen cured.\" Garcias ab Horto brags how many desperate cures he hath done\nupon melancholy men by this alone, when all physicians had forsaken them.\nBut alkermes many except against; in some cases it may help, if it be good\nand of the best, such as that of Montpelier in France, which [4329]Iodocus\nSincerus, _Itinerario Galliae_, so much magnifies, and would have no\ntraveller omit to see it made. But it is not so general a medicine as the\nother. Fernelius, _consil. 49_, suspects alkermes, by reason of its heat,\n[4330]\"nothing\" (saith he) \"sooner exasperates this disease, than the use\nof hot working meats and medicines, and would have them for that cause\nwarily taken.\" I conclude, therefore, of this and all other medicines, as\nThucydides of the plague at Athens, no remedy could be prescribed for it,\n_Nam quod uni profuit, hoc aliis erat exitio_: there is no Catholic\nmedicine to be had: that which helps one, is pernicious to another.\n\n_Diamargaritum frigidum, diambra, diaboraginatum, electuarium laetificans\nGaleni et Rhasis, de gemmis, dianthos, diamoscum dulce et amarum,\nelectuarium conciliatoris, syrup. Cidoniorum de pomis_, conserves of roses,\nviolets, fumitory, enula campana, satyrion, lemons, orange-pills, condite,\n&c., have their good use.\n\n[4331] \"[Symbol: Rx]. Diamoschi dulcis et amari ana [Symbol: Dram]jj.\n        Diabuglossati, Diaboraginati, sacchari violacei ana j. misce cum\n        syrupo de pomis.\"\n\nEvery physician is full of such receipts: one only I will add for the\nrareness of it, which I find recorded by many learned authors, as an\napproved medicine against dotage, head-melancholy, and such diseases of the\nbrain. Take a [4332]ram's head that never meddled with an ewe, cut off at a\nblow, and the horns only take away, boil it well, skin and wool together;\nafter it is well sod, take out the brains, and put these spices to it,\ncinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, mace, cloves, _ana_ [Symbol: Ounce]ss, mingle the\npowder of these spices with it, and heat them in a platter upon a\nchafing-dish of coals together, stirring them well, that they do not burn;\ntake heed it be not overmuch dried, or drier than a calf's brains ready to\nbe eaten. Keep it so prepared, and for three days give it the patient\nfasting, so that he fast two hours after it. It may be eaten with bread in\nan egg or broth, or any way, so it be taken. For fourteen days let him use\nthis diet, drink no wine, &c. Gesner, _hist. animal. lib. 1. pag. 917._\nCaricterius, _pract. 13. in Nich. de metri. pag. 129._ Iatro: _Wittenberg.\nedit. Tubing. pag. 62_, mention this medicine, though with some variation;\nhe that list may try it, [4333]and many such.\n\nOdoraments to smell to, of rosewater, violet flowers, balm, rose-cakes,\nvinegar, &c., do much recreate the brains and spirits, according to\nSolomon. Prov. xxvii. 9. \"They rejoice the heart,\" and as some say,\nnourish; 'tis a question commonly controverted in our schools, _an odores\nnutriant_; let Ficinus, _lib. 2. cap. 18._ decide it; [4334]many arguments\nhe brings to prove it; as of Democritus, that lived by the smell of bread\nalone, applied to his nostrils, for some few days, when for old age he\ncould eat no meat. Ferrerius, _lib. 2. meth._ speaks of an excellent\nconfection of his making, of wine, saffron, &c., which he prescribed to\ndull, weak, feeble, and dying men to smell to, and by it to have done very\nmuch good, _aeque fere profuisse olfactu, et potu_, as if he had given them\ndrink. Our noble and learned Lord [4335]Verulam, in his book _de vita et\nmorte_, commends, therefore, all such cold smells as any way serve to\nrefrigerate the spirits. Montanus, _consil. 31_, prescribes a form which he\nwould have his melancholy patient never to have out of his hands. If you\nwill have them spagirically prepared, look in Oswaldus Crollius, _basil.\nChymica_.\n\nIrrigations of the head shaven, [4336]\"of the flowers of water lilies,\nlettuce, violets, camomile, wild mallows, wether's-head, &c.,\" must be used\nmany mornings together. Montan. _consil. 31_, would have the head so washed\nonce a week. Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus _consult. 44_, for an Italian count,\ntroubled with head-melancholy, repeats many medicines which he tried,\n[4337]\"but two alone which did the cure; use of whey made of goat's milk,\nwith the extract of hellebore, and irrigations of the head with water\nlilies, lettuce, violets, camomile, &c., upon the suture of the crown.\"\nPiso commends a ram's lungs applied hot to the fore part of the head,\n[4338]or a young lamb divided in the back, exenterated, &c.; all\nacknowledge the chief cure in moistening throughout. Some, saith\nLaurentius, use powders and caps to the brain; but forasmuch as such\naromatical things are hot and dry, they must be sparingly administered.\n\nUnto the heart we may do well to apply bags, epithems, ointments, of which\nLaurentius, _c. 9. de melan._ gives examples. Bruel prescribes an epithem\nfor the heart, of bugloss, borage, water-lily, violet waters, sweet-wine,\nbalm leaves, nutmegs, cloves, &c.\n\nFor the belly, make a fomentation of oil, [4339]in which the seeds of\ncumin, rue, carrots, dill, have been boiled.\n\nBaths are of wonderful great force in this malady, much admired by [4340]\nGalen, [4341]Aetius, Rhasis, &c., of sweet water, in which is boiled the\nleaves of mallows, roses, violets, water-lilies, wether's-head, flowers of\nbugloss, camomile, melilot, &c. Guianer, _cap. 8. tract. 15_, would have\nthem used twice a day, and when they came forth of the baths, their back\nbones to be anointed with oil of almonds, violets, nymphea, fresh capon\ngrease, &c.\n\nAmulets and things to be borne about, I find prescribed, taxed by some,\napproved by Renodeus, Platerus, (_amuleta inquit non negligenda_) and\nothers; look for them in Mizaldus, Porta, Albertus, &c. Bassardus\nViscontinus, _ant. philos._ commends hypericon, or St. John's wort gathered\non a [4342]Friday in the hour of \"Jupiter, when it comes to his effectual\noperation (that is about the full moon in July); so gathered and borne, or\nhung about the neck, it mightily helps this affection, and drives away all\nfantastical spirits.\" [4343]Philes, a Greek author that flourished in the\ntime of Michael Paleologus, writes that a sheep or kid's skin, whom a wolf\nworried, [4344]_Haedus inhumani raptus ab ore lupi_, ought not at all to be\nworn about a man, \"because it causeth palpitation of the heart,\" not for\nany fear, but a secret virtue which amulets have. A ring made of the hoof\nof an ass's right fore foot carried about, &c. I say with [4345]Renodeus,\nthey are not altogether to be rejected. Paeony doth cure epilepsy; precious\nstones most diseases; [4346]a wolf's dung borne with one helps the colic,\n[4347]a spider an ague, &c. Being in the country in the vacation time not\nmany years since, at Lindley in Leicestershire, my father's house, I first\nobserved this amulet of a spider in a nut-shell lapped in silk, &c., so\napplied for an ague by [4348]my mother; whom, although I knew to have\nexcellent skill in chirurgery, sore eyes, aches, &c., and such experimental\nmedicines, as all the country where she dwelt can witness, to have done\nmany famous and good cures upon diverse poor folks, that were otherwise\ndestitute of help: yet among all other experiments, this methought was most\nabsurd and ridiculous, I could see no warrant for it. _Quid aranea cum\nfebre_? For what antipathy? till at length rambling amongst authors (as\noften I do) I found this very medicine in Dioscorides, approved by\nMatthiolus, repeated by Alderovandus, _cap. de Aranea, lib. de insectis_, I\nbegan to have a better opinion of it, and to give more credit to amulets,\nwhen I saw it in some parties answer to experience. Some medicines are to\nbe exploded, that consist of words, characters, spells, and charms, which\ncan do no good at all, but out of a strong conceit, as Pomponatius proves;\nor the devil's policy, who is the first founder and teacher of them.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Correctors of Accidents to procure Sleep. Against fearful\nDreams, Redness, &c._\n\nWhen you have used all good means and helps of alteratives, averters,\ndiminutives, yet there will be still certain accidents to be corrected and\namended, as waking, fearful dreams, flushing in the face to some ruddiness,\n&c.\n\nWaking, by reason of their continual cares, fears, sorrows, dry brains, is\na symptom that much crucifies melancholy men, and must therefore be\nspeedily helped, and sleep by all means procured, which sometimes is a\nsufficient [4349]remedy of itself without any other physic. Sckenkius, in\nhis observations, hath an example of a woman that was so cured. The means\nto procure it, are inward or outward. Inwardly taken, are simples, or\ncompounds; simples, as poppy, nymphea, violets, roses, lettuce, mandrake,\nhenbane, nightshade or solanum, saffron, hemp-seed, nutmegs, willows, with\ntheir seeds, juice, decoctions, distilled waters, &c. Compounds are syrups,\nor opiates, syrup of poppy, violets, verbasco, which are commonly taken\nwith distilled waters.\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx] diacodii [Symbol: Ounce]j. diascordii [Symbol: Dram]ss\n        aquae lactucae [Symbol: Ounce]iijss mista fiat potio ad horam somni\n        sumenda.\"\n\nRequies Nicholai, Philonium Romanum, Triphera magna, pilulae, de\nCynoglossa, Dioscordium, Laudanum Paracelsi, Opium, are in use, &c. Country\nfolks commonly make a posset of hemp-seed, which Fuchsius in his herbal so\nmuch discommends; yet I have seen the good effect, and it may be used where\nbetter medicines are not to be had.\n\nLaudanum Paracelsi is prescribed in two or three grains, with a dram of\nDiascordium, which Oswald. Crollius commends. Opium itself is most part\nused outwardly, to smell to in a ball, though commonly so taken by the\nTurks to the same quantity [4350]for a cordial, and at Goa in, the Indies;\nthe dose 40 or 50 grains.\n\nRulandus calls Requiem Nicholai _ultimum refugium_, the last refuge; but of\nthis and the rest look for peculiar receipts in Victorius Faventinus, _cap.\nde phrensi_. Heurnius _cap. de mania_. Hildesheim _spicel. 4. de somno et\nvigil_. &c. Outwardly used, as oil of nutmegs by extraction, or expression\nwith rosewater to anoint the temples, oils of poppy, nenuphar, mandrake,\npurslan, violets, all to the same purpose.\n\nMontan. _consil. 24 & 25._ much commends odoraments of opium, vinegar, and\nrosewater. Laurentius _cap. 9._ prescribes pomanders and nodules; see the\nreceipts in him; Codronchus [4351]wormwood to smell to.\n\n_Unguentum Alabastritum, populeum_ are used to anoint the temples,\nnostrils, or if they be too weak, they mix saffron and opium. Take a grain\nor two of opium, and dissolve it with three or four drops of rosewater in a\nspoon, and after mingle with it as much _Unguentum populeum_ as a nut, use\nit as before: or else take half a dram of opium, _Unguentum populeum_, oil\nof nenuphar, rosewater, rose-vinegar, of each half an ounce, with as much\nvirgin wax as a nut, anoint your temples with some of it, _ad horam somni_.\n\nSacks of wormwood, [4352]mandrake, [4353]henbane, roses made like pillows\nand laid under the patient's head, are mentioned by [4354]Cardan and\nMizaldus, \"to anoint the soles of the feet with the fat of a dormouse, the\nteeth with ear wax of a dog, swine's gall, hare's ears:\" charms, &c.\n\nFrontlets are well known to every good wife, rosewater and vinegar, with a\nlittle woman's milk, and nutmegs grated upon a rose-cake applied to both\ntemples.\n\nFor an emplaster, take of castorium a dram and a half, of opium half a\nscruple, mixed both together with a little water of life, make two small\nplasters thereof, and apply them to the temples.\n\nRulandus _cent. 1. cur. 17. cent. 3. cur. 94._ prescribes epithems and\nlotions of the head, with the decoction of flowers of nymphea,\nviolet-leaves, mandrake roots, henbane, white poppy. Herc. de Saxonia,\n_stillicidia_, or droppings, &c. Lotions of the feet do much avail of the\nsaid herbs: by these means, saith Laurentius, I think you may procure sleep\nto the most melancholy man in the world. Some use horseleeches behind the\nears, and apply opium to the place.\n\n[4355]Bayerus _lib. 2. c. 13._ sets down some remedies against fearful\ndreams, and such as walk and talk in their sleep. Baptista Porta _Mag. nat.\nl. 2. c. 6._ to procure pleasant dreams and quiet rest, would have you take\nhippoglossa, or the herb horsetongue, balm, to use them or their distilled\nwaters after supper, &c. Such men must not eat beans, peas, garlic, onions,\ncabbage, venison, hare, use black wines, or any meat hard of digestion at\nsupper, or lie on their backs, &c.\n\n_Rusticus pudor_, bashfulness, flushing in the face, high colour,\nruddiness, are common grievances, which much torture many melancholy men,\nwhen they meet a man, or come in [4356]company of their betters, strangers,\nafter a meal, or if they drink a cup of wine or strong drink, they are as\nred and fleet, and sweat as if they had been at a mayor's feast,\n_praesertim si metus accesserit_, it exceeds, [4357]they think every man\nobserves, takes notice of it: and fear alone will effect it, suspicion\nwithout any other cause. Sckenkius _observ. med. lib. 1._ speaks of a\nwaiting gentlewoman in the Duke of Savoy's court, that was so much offended\nwith it, that she kneeled down to him, and offered Biarus, a physician, all\nthat she had to be cured of it. And 'tis most true, that [4358]Antony\nLudovicus saith in his book _de Pudore_, \"bashfulness either hurts or\nhelps,\" such men I am sure it hurts. If it proceed from suspicion or fear,\n[4359]Felix Plater prescribes no other remedy but to reject and contemn it:\n_Id populus curat scilicet_, as a [4360]worthy physician in our town said\nto a friend of mine in like case, complaining without a cause, suppose one\nlook red, what matter is it, make light of it, who observes it?\n\nIf it trouble at or after meals, (as [4361]Jobertus observes _med. pract.\nl. 1. c. 7._) after a little exercise or stirring, for many are then hot\nand red in the face, or if they do nothing at all, especially women; he\nwould have them let blood in both arms, first one, then another, two or\nthree days between, if blood abound; to use frictions of the other parts,\nfeet especially, and washing of them, because of that consent which is\nbetween the head and the feet. [4362]And withal to refrigerate the face, by\nwashing it often with rose, violet, nenuphar, lettuce, lovage waters, and\nthe like: but the best of all is that _lac virginale_, or strained liquor\nof litargy: it is diversely prepared; by Jobertus thus; _[Symbol: Rx]\nlithar. argent. unc. j cerussae candidissimae, [Symbol: Dram]jjj. caphurae,\n[Symbol: Scruple]jj. dissolvantur aquarum solani, lactucae, et nenupharis\nana unc. jjj. aceti vini albi. unc. jj. aliquot horas resideat, deinde\ntransmittatur per philt. aqua servetur in vase vitreo, ac ea bis terve\nfacies quotidie irroretur_. [4363]Quercetan _spagir. phar. cap. 6._\ncommends the water of frog's spawn for ruddiness in the face. [4364]Crato\n_consil. 283. Scoltzii_ would fain have them use all summer the condite\nflowers of succory, strawberry water, roses (cupping-glasses are good for\nthe time), _consil. 285. et 286._ and to defecate impure blood with the\ninfusion of senna, savory, balm water. [4365]Hollerius knew one cured alone\nwith the use of succory boiled, and drunk for five months, every morning in\nthe summer. [4366]It is good overnight to anoint the face with hare's\nblood, and in the morning to wash it with strawberry and cowslip water, the\njuice of distilled lemons, juice of cucumbers, or to use the seeds of\nmelons, or kernels of peaches beaten small, or the roots of Aron, and mixed\nwith wheat bran to bake it in an oven, and to crumble it in strawberry\nwater, [4367] or to put fresh cheese curds to a red face.\n\nIf it trouble them at meal times that flushing, as oft it doth, with\nsweating or the like, they must avoid all violent passions and actions, as\nlaughing, &c., strong drink, and drink very little, [4368]one draught,\nsaith Crato, and that about the midst of their meal; avoid at all times\nindurate salt, and especially spice and windy meat.\n\n[4369]Crato prescribes the condite fruit of wild rose, to a nobleman his\npatient, to be taken before dinner or supper, to the quantity of a\nchestnut. It is made of sugar, as that of quinces. The decoction of the\nroots of sowthistle before meat, by the same author is much approved. To\neat of a baked apple some advice, or of a preserved quince, cuminseed\nprepared with meat instead of salt, to keep down fumes: not to study or to\nbe intentive after meals.\n\n       \"[Symbol: Rx]. Nucleorum persic. seminis melonum ana unc. [Symbol:\n        Scruple]ss aquae fragrorum l. ij. misce, utatur mane.\"\n\n[4370]To apply cupping glasses to the shoulders is very good. For the other\nkind of ruddiness which is settled in the face with pimples, &c., because\nit pertains not to my subject, I will not meddle with it. I refer you to\nCrato's counsels, Arnoldus _lib. 1. breviar. cap. 39. 1._ Rulande, Peter\nForestus de Fuco, _lib. 31. obser. 2._ To Platerus, Mercurialis, Ulmus,\nRondoletius, Heurnius, Menadous, and others that have written largely of\nit.\n\nThose other grievances and symptoms of headache, palpitation of heart,\n_Vertigo deliquium_, &c., which trouble many melancholy men, because they\nare copiously handled apart in every physician, I do voluntarily omit.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n_Cure of Melancholy over all the Body_.\n\nWhere the melancholy blood possesseth the whole body with the brain, [4371]\nit is best to begin with bloodletting. The Greeks prescribe the [4372]\nmedian or middle vein to be opened, and so much blood to be taken away as\nthe patient may well spare, and the cut that is made must be wide enough.\nThe Arabians hold it fittest to be taken from that arm on which side there\nis more pain and heaviness in the head: if black blood issue forth, bleed\non; if it be clear and good, let it be instantly suppressed, [4373]\n\"because the malice of melancholy is much corrected by the goodness of the\nblood.\" If the party's strength will not admit much evacuation in this kind\nat once, it must be assayed again and again: if it may not be conveniently\ntaken from the arm, it must be taken from the knees and ankles, especially\nto such men or women whose haemorrhoids or months have been stopped. [4374]\nIf the malady continue, it is not amiss to evacuate in a part in the\nforehead, and to virgins in the ankles, who are melancholy for love\nmatters; so to widows that are much grieved and troubled with sorrow and\ncares: for bad blood flows in the heart, and so crucifies the mind. The\nhaemorrhoids are to be opened with an instrument or horseleeches, &c. See\nmore in Montaltus, _cap. 29._ [4375]Sckenkius hath an example of one that\nwas cured by an accidental wound in his thigh, much bleeding freed him from\nmelancholy. Diet, diminutives, alteratives, cordials, correctors as before,\nintermixed as occasion serves, [4376]\"all their study must be to make a\nmelancholy man fat, and then the cure is ended.\" Diuretics, or medicines to\nprocure urine, are prescribed by some in this kind, hot and cold: hot where\nthe heat of the liver doth not forbid; cold where the heat of the liver is\nvery great: [4377]amongst hot are parsley roots, lovage, fennel, &c.: cold,\nmelon seeds, &c., with whey of goat's milk, which is the common conveyer.\n\nTo purge and [4378]purify the blood, use sowthistle, succory, senna,\nendive, carduus benedictus, dandelion, hop, maidenhair, fumitory, bugloss,\nborage, &c., with their juice, decoctions, distilled waters, syrups, &c.\n\nOswaldus, Crollius, _basil Chym._ much admires salt of corals in this case,\nand Aetius, _tetrabib. ser. 2. cap. 114._ Hieram Archigenis, which is an\nexcellent medicine to purify the blood, \"for all melancholy affections,\nfalling sickness, none to be compared to it.\"\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Cure of Hypochondriacal Melancholy_.\n\nIn this cure, as in the rest, is especially required the rectification of\nthose six non-natural things above all, as good diet, which Montanus,\n_consil. 27._ enjoins a French nobleman, \"to have an especial care of it,\nwithout which all other remedies are in vain.\" Bloodletting is not to be\nused, except the patient's body be very full of blood, and that it be\nderived from the liver and spleen to the stomach and his vessels, then\n[4379]to draw it back, to cut the inner vein of either arm, some say the\nsalvatella, and if the malady be continuate, [4380]to open a vein in the\nforehead.\n\nPreparatives and alteratives may be used as before, saving that there must\nbe respect had as well to the liver, spleen, stomach, hypochondries, as to\nthe heart and brain. To comfort the [4381]stomach and inner parts against\nwind and obstructions, by Areteus, Galen, Aetius, Aurelianus, &c., and many\nlatter writers, are still prescribed the decoctions of wormwood, centaury,\npennyroyal, betony sodden in whey, and daily drunk: many have been cured by\nthis medicine alone.\n\nProsper Altinus and some others as much magnify the water of Nile against\nthis malady, an especial good remedy for windy melancholy. For which reason\nbelike Ptolemeus Philadelphus, when he married his daughter Berenice to the\nking of Assyria (as Celsus, _lib. 2._ records), _magnis impensis Nili aquam\nafferri jussit_, to his great charge caused the water of Nile to be carried\nwith her, and gave command, that during her life she should use no other\ndrink. I find those that commend use of apples, in splenetic and this kind\nof melancholy (lamb's-wool some call it), which howsoever approved, must\ncertainly be corrected of cold rawness and wind.\n\nCodronchus in his book _de sale absyn._ magnifies the oil and salt of\nwormwood above all other remedies, [4382]\"which works better and speedier\nthan any simple whatsoever, and much to be preferred before all those\nfulsome decoctions and infusions, which must offend by reason of their\nquantity; this alone in a small measure taken, expels wind, and that most\nforcibly, moves urine, cleanseth the stomach of all gross humours,\ncrudities, helps appetite,\" &c. Arnoldus hath a wormwood wine which he\nwould have used, which every pharmacopoeia speaks of.\n\nDiminutives and purges may [4383]be taken as before, of hiera, manna,\ncassia, which Montanus _consil. 230._ for an Italian abbot, in this kind\nprefers before all other simples, [4384]\"And these must be often used,\nstill abstaining from those which are more violent, lest they do exasperate\nthe stomach, &c., and the mischief by that means be increased.\" Though in\nsome physicians I find very strong purgers, hellebore itself prescribed in\nthis affection. If it long continue, vomits may be taken after meat, or\notherwise gently procured with warm water, oxymel, &c., now and then.\nFuchsius _cap. 33._ prescribes hellebore; but still take heed in this\nmalady, which I have often warned, of hot medicines, [4385]\"because\" (as\nSalvianus adds) \"drought follows heat, which increaseth the disease:\" and\nyet Baptista Sylvaticus _controv. 32._ forbids cold medicines, [4386]\n\"because they increase obstructions and other bad symptoms.\" But this\nvaries as the parties do, and 'tis not easy to determine which to use.\n[4387]\"The stomach most part in this infirmity is cold, the liver hot;\nscarce therefore\" (which Montanus insinuates _consil. 229._ for the Earl of\nManfort) \"can you help the one and not hurt the other:\" much discretion\nmust be used; take no physic at all he concludes without great need.\nLaelius Aegubinus _consil._ for an hypochondriacal German prince, used many\nmedicines; \"but it was after signified to him in [4388]letters, that the\ndecoction of China and sassafras, and salt of sassafras wrought him an\nincredible good.\" In his _108 consult_, he used as happily the same\nremedies; this to a third might have been poison, by overheating his liver\nand blood.\n\nFor the other parts look for remedies in Savanarola, Gordonius, Massaria,\nMercatus, Johnson, &c. One for the spleen, amongst many other, I will not\nomit, cited by Hildesheim, _spicel. 2_, prescribed by Mat. Flaccus, and out\nof the authority of Benevenius. Antony Benevenius in a hypochondriacal\npassion, [4389]\"cured an exceeding great swelling of the spleen with capers\nalone, a meat befitting that infirmity, and frequent use of the water of a\nsmith's forge; by this physic he helped a sick man, whom all other\nphysicians had forsaken, that for seven years had been splenetic.\" And of\nsuch force is this water, [4390]\"that those creatures as drink of it, have\ncommonly little or no spleen.\" See more excellent medicines for the spleen\nin him and [4391]Lod. Mercatus, who is a great magnifier of this medicine.\nThis _Chalybs praeparatus_, or steel-drink, is much likewise commended to\nthis disease by Daniel Sennertus _l. 1. part. 2. cap. 12._ and admired by\nJ. Caesar Claudinus _Respons. 29._ he calls steel the proper\n[4392]alexipharmacum of this malady, and much magnifies it; look for\nreceipts in them. Averters must be used to the liver and spleen, and to\nscour the mesaraic veins: and they are either too open or provoke urine.\nYou can open no place better than the haemorrhoids, \"which if by\nhorseleeches they be made to flow, [4393]there may be again such an\nexcellent remedy,\" as Plater holds. Sallust. Salvian will admit no other\nphlebotomy but this; and by his experience in an hospital which he kept, he\nfound all mad and melancholy men worse for other bloodletting. Laurentius\n_cap. 15._ calls this of horseleeches a sure remedy to empty the spleen and\nmesaraic membrane. Only Montanus _consil. 241._ is against it; [4394] \"to\nother men\" (saith he) \"this opening of the haemorrhoids seems to be a\nprofitable remedy; for my part I do not approve of it, because it draws\naway the thinnest blood, and leaves the thickest behind.\"\n\nAetius, Vidus Vidius, Mercurialis, Fuchsius, recommend diuretics, or such\nthings as provoke urine, as aniseeds, dill, fennel, germander, ground pine,\nsodden in water, or drunk in powder: and yet [4395]P. Bayerus is against\nthem: and so is Hollerius; \"All melancholy men\" (saith he) \"must avoid such\nthings as provoke urine, because by them the subtile or thinnest is\nevacuated, the thicker matter remains.\"\n\nClysters are in good request. Trincavelius _lib. 3. cap. 38._ for a young\nnobleman, esteems of them in the first place, and Hercules de Saxonia\n_Panth. lib. 1. cap. 16._ is a great approver of them. [4396]\"I have found\n(saith he) by experience, that many hypochondriacal melancholy men have\nbeen cured by the sole use of clysters,\" receipts are to be had in him.\n\nBesides those fomentations, irrigations, inunctions, odoraments, prescribed\nfor the head, there must be the like used for the liver, spleen, stomach,\nhypochondries, &c. [4397]\"In crudity\" (saith Piso) \"'tis good to bind the\nstomach hard\" to hinder wind, and to help concoction.\n\nOf inward medicines I need not speak; use the same cordials as before. In\nthis kind of melancholy, some prescribe [4398]treacle in winter, especially\nbefore or after purges, or in the spring, as Avicenna, [4399] Trincavellius\nmithridate, [4400]Montaltus paeony seed, unicorn's horn; _os de corde\ncervi_, &c.\n\nAmongst topics or outward medicines, none are more precious than baths, but\nof them I have spoken. Fomentations to the hypochondries are very good, of\nwine and water in which are sodden southernwood, melilot, epithyme,\nmugwort, senna, polypody, as also [4401]cerotes, [4402]plaisters,\nliniments, ointments for the spleen, liver, and hypochondries, of which\nlook for examples in Laurentius, Jobertus _lib. 3. c. pra. med._ Montanus\n_consil. 231._ Montaltus _cap. 33._ Hercules de Saxonia, Faventinus. And so\nof epithems, digestive powders, bags, oils, Octavius Horatianus _lib. 2. c.\n5._ prescribes calastic cataplasms, or dry purging medicines; Piso\n[4403]dropaces of pitch, and oil of rue, applied at certain times to the\nstomach, to the metaphrene, or part of the back which is over against the\nheart, Aetius sinapisms; Montaltus _cap. 35._ would have the thighs to be\n[4404]cauterised, Mercurialis prescribes beneath the knees; Laelius\nAegubinus _consil. 77._ for a hypochondriacal Dutchman, will have the\ncautery made in the right thigh, and so Montanus _consil. 55._ The same\nMontanus _consil. 34._ approves of issues in the arms or hinder part of the\nhead. Bernardus Paternus in Hildesheim _spicel 2._ would have [4405] issues\nmade in both the thighs; [4406]Lod. Mercatus prescribes them near the\nspleen, _aut prope ventriculi regimen_, or in either of the thighs.\nLigatures, frictions, and cupping-glasses above or about the belly, without\nscarification, which [4407]Felix Platerus so much approves, may be used as\nbefore.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Correctors to expel Wind. Against Costiveness, &c._\n\nIn this kind of melancholy one of the most offensive symptoms is wind,\nwhich, as in the other species, so in this, hath great need to be corrected\nand expelled.\n\nThe medicines to expel it are either inwardly taken, or outwardly. Inwardly\nto expel wind, are simples or compounds: simples are herbs, roots, &c., as\ngalanga, gentian, angelica, enula, calamus aromaticus, valerian, zeodoti,\niris, condite ginger, aristolochy, cicliminus, China, dittander,\npennyroyal, rue, calamint, bay-berries, and bay-leaves, betony, rosemary,\nhyssop, sabine, centaury, mint, camomile, staechas, agnus castus,\nbroom-flowers, origan, orange-pills, &c.; spices, as saffron, cinnamon,\nbezoar stone, myrrh, mace, nutmegs, pepper, cloves, ginger, seeds of annis,\nfennel, amni, cari, nettle, rue, &c., juniper berries, grana paradisi;\ncompounds, dianisum, diagalanga, diaciminum, diacalaminth, _electuarium de\nbaccis lauri, benedicta laxativa, pulvis ad status. antid. florent. pulvis\ncarminativus, aromaticum rosatum, treacle, mithridate_ &c. This one caution\nof [4408]Gualter Bruell is to be observed in the administering of these hot\nmedicines and dry, \"that whilst they covet to expel wind, they do not\ninflame the blood, and increase the disease; sometimes\" (as he saith)\n\"medicines must more decline to heat, sometimes more to cold, as the\ncircumstances require, and as the parties are inclined to heat or cold.\"\n\nOutwardly taken to expel winds, are oils, as of camomile, rue, bays, &c.;\nfomentations of the hypochondries, with the decoctions of dill, pennyroyal,\nrue, bay leaves, cumin, &c., bags of camomile flowers, aniseed, cumin,\nbays, rue, wormwood, ointments of the oil of spikenard, wormwood, rue, &c.\n[4409]Areteus prescribes cataplasms of camomile flowers, fennel, aniseeds,\ncumin, rosemary, wormwood-leaves, &c.\n\n[4410]Cupping-glasses applied to the hypochondries, without scarification,\ndo wonderfully resolve wind. Fernelius _consil. 43._ much approves of them\nat the lower end of the belly; [4411]Lod. Mercatus calls them a powerful\nremedy, and testifies moreover out of his own knowledge, how many he hath\nseen suddenly eased by them. Julius Caesar Claudinus _respons. med. resp.\n33._ admires these cupping-glasses, which he calls out of Galen, [4412]\"a\nkind of enchantment, they cause such present help.\"\n\nEmpirics have a myriad of medicines, as to swallow a bullet of lead, &c.,\nwhich I voluntarily omit. Amatus Lusitanus, _cent. 4. curat. 54._ for a\nhypochondriacal person, that was extremely tormented with wind, prescribes\na strange remedy. Put a pair of bellows end into a clyster pipe, and\napplying it into the fundament, open the bowels, so draw forth the wind,\n_natura non admittit vacuum_. He vaunts he was the first invented this\nremedy, and by means of it speedily eased a melancholy man. Of the cure of\nthis flatuous melancholy, read more in Fienus de Flatibus, _cap. 26. et\npassim alias_.\n\nAgainst headache, vertigo, vapours which ascend forth of the stomach to\nmolest the head, read Hercules de Saxonia, and others.\n\nIf costiveness offend in this, or any other of the three species, it is to\nbe corrected with suppositories, clysters or lenitives, powder of senna,\ncondite prunes, &c. [Symbol: Rx] _Elect. lenit, e succo rosar. ana [Symbol:\nOunce] j. misce_. Take as much as a nutmeg at a time, half an hour before\ndinner or supper, or _pil. mastichin. [Symbol: Ounce] j_. in six pills, a\npill or two at a time. See more in Montan. _consil. 229._ Hildesheim\n_spicel. 2._ P. Cnemander, and Montanus commend [4413]\"Cyprian turpentine,\nwhich they would have familiarly taken, to the quantity of a small nut, two\nor three hours before dinner and supper, twice or thrice a week if need be;\nfor besides that it keeps the belly soluble, it clears the stomach, opens\nobstructions, cleanseth the liver, provokes urine.\"\n\nThese in brief are the ordinary medicines which belong to the cure of\nmelancholy, which if they be used aright, no doubt may do much good; _Si\nnon levando saltem leniendo valent, peculiaria bene selecta_, saith\nBessardus, a good choice of particular receipts must needs ease, if not\nquite cure, not one, but all or most, as occasion serves. _Et quae non\nprosunt singula, multa juvant_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SYNOPSIS OF THE THIRD PARTITION.\n\nLove and love melancholy, _Memb. 1 Sect. 1._\n\n  Preface or Introduction. _Subsect. 1._\n\n  Love's definition, pedigree, object, fair, amiable, gracious, and\n   pleasant, from which comes beauty, grace, which all desire and love,\n   parts affected.\n\n  Division or kinds, _Subs. 2._\n\n      Natural, in things without life, as love and hatred of elements; and\n        with life, as vegetable, vine and elm, sympathy, antipathy, &c.\n\n      Sensible, as of beasts, for pleasure, preservation of kind, mutual\n        agreement, custom, bringing up together, &c.\n\n      or Rational\n\n          Simple, which hath three objects as _M. 2._\n              Profitable, _Subs. 1._\n                  Health, wealth, honour, we love our benefactors: nothing\n                    so amiable as profit, or that which hath a show of\n                    commodity.\n              Pleasant, _Subs. 2._\n                  Things without life, made by art, pictures, sports,\n                    games, sensible objects, as hawks, hounds, horses; Or\n                    men themselves for similitude of manners, natural\n                    affection, as to friends, children, kinsmen, &c., for\n                    glory such as commend us.\n                  Of women, as\n                      Before marriage, as Heroical Mel. _Sect. 2. vide_\n                        [Symbol: Aries]\n                      Or after marriage, as Jealousy, _Sect. 3. vide_\n                        [Symbol: Taurus]\n              Honest, _Subs. 3._\n                  Fucate in show, by some error or hypocrisy; some seem and\n                    are not; or truly for virtue, honesty, good parts,\n                    learning, eloquence, &c.\n\n          or Mixed of all three, which extends to _M. 3._\n              Common good, our neighbour, country, friends, which is\n                charity; the defect of which is cause of much discontent\n                and melancholy.\n              or God, _Sect. 4._\n                  In excess, _vide_ [Symbol: Gemini]\n                  In defect, _vide_ [Symbol: Cancer]\n\n[Symbol: Aries] Heroical or Love-Melancholy, in which consider,\n\n  _Memb. 1._ His pedigree, power, extent to vegetables and sensible\n    creatures, as well as men, to spirits, devils, &c.\n\n  His name, definition, object, part affected, tyranny.

They cannot abide\nto hear talk of love toys, or amorous discourses, _vultu, gestu, oculis_ in\ntheir outward actions averse, and yet in their cogitations they are all out\nas bad, if not worse than others.\n\n[4417] \"Erubuit, posuitque meum Lucretia librum\n        Sed coram Bruto, Brute recede, legit.\"\n\nBut let these cavillers and counterfeit Catos know, that as the Lord John\nanswered the Queen in that Italian [4418]Guazzo, an old, a grave discreet\nman is fittest to discourse of love matters, because he hath likely more\nexperience, observed more, hath a more staid judgment, can better discern,\nresolve, discuss, advise, give better cautions, and more solid precepts,\nbetter inform his auditors in such a subject, and by reason of his riper\nyears sooner divert. Besides, _nihil in hac amoris voce subtimendum_, there\nis nothing here to be excepted at; love is a species of melancholy, and a\nnecessary part of this my treatise, which I may not omit; _operi suscepto\ninserviendum fuit_: so Jacobus Mysillius pleadeth for himself in his\ntranslation of Lucian's dialogues, and so do I; I must and will perform my\ntask. And that short excuse of Mercerus, for his edition of Aristaenetus\nshall be mine, [4419]\"If I have spent my time ill to write, let not them be\nso idle as to read.\" But I am persuaded it is not so ill spent, I ought not\nto excuse or repent myself of this subject; on which many grave and worthy\nmen have written whole volumes, Plato, Plutarch, Plotinus, Maximus, Tyrius,\nAlcinous, Avicenna, Leon Hebreus in three large dialogues, Xenophon\n_sympos._ Theophrastus, if we may believe Athenaeus, _lib. 13. cap. 9._\nPicus Mirandula, Marius, Aequicola, both in Italian, Kornmannus _de linea\nAmoris, lib. 3._ Petrus Godefridus hath handled in three books, P. Haedus,\nand which almost every physician, as Arnoldus, Villanovanus, Valleriola\n_observat. med. lib. 2. observ. 7._ Aelian Montaltus and Laurentius in\ntheir treatises of melancholy, Jason Pratensis _de morb. cap._ Valescus de\nTaranta, Gordonius, Hercules de Saxonia, Savanarola, Langius, &c., have\ntreated of apart, and in their works. I excuse myself, therefore, with\nPeter Godefridus, Valleriola, Ficinus, and in [4420]Langius' words. Cadmus\nMilesius writ fourteen books of love, \"and why should I be ashamed to write\nan epistle in favour of young men, of this subject?\" A company of stern\nreaders dislike the second of the Aeneids, and Virgil's gravity, for\ninserting such amorous passions in an heroical subject; but [4421]Servius,\nhis commentator, justly vindicates the poet's worth, wisdom, and discretion\nin doing as he did. Castalio would not have young men read the [4422]\nCanticles, because to his thinking it was too light and amorous a tract, a\nballad of ballads, as our old English translation hath it. He might as well\nforbid the reading of Genesis, because of the loves of Jacob and Rachael,\nthe stories of Sichem and Dinah, Judah and Thamar; reject the Book of\nNumbers, for the fornications of the people of Israel with the Moabites;\nthat of Judges for Samson and Dalilah's embracings; that of the Kings, for\nDavid and Bersheba's adulteries, the incest of Ammon and Thamar, Solomon's\nconcubines, &c. The stories of Esther, Judith, Susanna, and many such.\nDicearchus, and some other, carp at Plato's majesty, that he would\nvouchsafe to indite such love toys: amongst the rest, for that dalliance\nwith Agatho,\n\n       \"Suavia dans Agathoni, animam ipse in labra tenebam;\n          Aegra etenim properans tanquam abitura fuit.\"\n\nFor my part, saith [4423]Maximus Tyrius, a great Platonist himself, _me non\ntantum admiratio habet, sed eliam stupor_, I do not only admire, but stand\namazed to read, that Plato and Socrates both should expel Homer from their\ncity, because he writ of such light and wanton subjects, _Quod Junonem cum\nJove in Ida concumbentes inducit, ab immortali nube contectos_, Vulcan's\nnet. Mars and Venus' fopperies before all the gods, because Apollo fled,\nwhen he was persecuted by Achilles, the [4424]gods were wounded and ran\nwhining away, as Mars that roared louder than Stentor, and covered nine\nacres of ground with his fall; Vulcan was a summer's day falling down from\nheaven, and in Lemnos Isle brake his leg, &c., with such ridiculous\npassages; when, as both Socrates and Plato, by his testimony, writ lighter\nthemselves: _quid enim tam distat_ (as he follows it) _quam amans a\ntemperante, formarum admirator a demente_, what can be more absurd than for\ngrave philosophers to treat of such fooleries, to admire Autiloquus,\nAlcibiades, for their beauties as they did, to run after, to gaze, to dote\non fair Phaedrus, delicate Agatho, young Lysis, fine Charmides, _haeccine\nPhilosophum decent_? Doth this become grave philosophers? Thus peradventure\nCallias, Thrasimachus, Polus, Aristophanes, or some of his adversaries and\nemulators might object; but neither they nor [4425]Anytus and Melitus his\nbitter enemies, that condemned him for teaching Critias to tyrannise, his\nimpiety for swearing by dogs and plain trees, for his juggling sophistry,\n&c., never so much as upbraided him with impure love, writing or speaking\nof that subject; and therefore without question, as he concludes, both\nSocrates and Plato in this are justly to be excused. But suppose they had\nbeen a little overseen, should divine Plato be defamed? no, rather as he\nsaid of Cato's drunkenness, if Cato were drunk, it should be no vice at all\nto be drunk. They reprove Plato then, but without cause (as [4426]Ficinus\npleads) \"for all love is honest and good, and they are worthy to be loved\nthat speak well of love.\" Being to speak of this admirable affection of\nlove (saith [4427]Valleriola) \"there lies open a vast and philosophical\nfield to my discourse, by which many lovers become mad; let me leave my\nmore serious meditations, wander in these philosophical fields, and look\ninto those pleasant groves of the Muses, where with unspeakable variety of\nflowers, we may make garlands to ourselves, not to adorn us only, but with\ntheir pleasant smell and juice to nourish our souls, and fill our minds\ndesirous of knowledge,\" &c. After a harsh and unpleasing discourse of\nmelancholy, which hath hitherto molested your patience, and tired the\nauthor, give him leave with [4428]Godefridus the lawyer, and Laurentius\n(_cap. 5._) to recreate himself in this kind after his laborious studies,\n\"since so many grave divines and worthy men have without offence to\nmanners, to help themselves and others, voluntarily written of it.\"\nHeliodorus, a bishop, penned a love story of Theagines and Chariclea, and\nwhen some Catos of his time reprehended him for it, chose rather, saith\n[4429]Nicephorus, to leave his bishopric than his book. Aeneas Sylvius, an\nancient divine, and past forty years of age, (as [4430]he confesseth\nhimself, after Pope Pius Secundus) indited that wanton history of Euryalus\nand Lucretia. And how many superintendents of learning could I reckon up\nthat have written of light fantastical subjects? Beroaldus, Erasmus,\nAlpheratius, twenty-four times printed in Spanish, &c. Give me leave then\nto refresh my muse a little, and my weary readers, to expatiate in this\ndelightsome field, _hoc deliciarum campo_, as Fonseca terms it, to [4431]\nseason a surly discourse with a more pleasing aspersion of love matters:\n_Edulcare vitam convenit_, as the poet invites us, _curas nugis_, &c., 'tis\ngood to sweeten our life with some pleasing toys to relish it, and as Pliny\ntells us, _magna pars studiosorum amaenitates quaerimus_, most of our\nstudents love such pleasant [4432]subjects. Though Macrobius teach us\notherwise, [4433]\"that those old sages banished all such light tracts from\ntheir studies, to nurse's cradles, to please only the ear;\" yet out of\nApuleius I will oppose as honourable patrons, Solon, Plato, [4434]\nXenophon, Adrian, &c. that as highly approve of these treatises. On the\nother side methinks they are not to be disliked, they are not so unfit. I\nwill not peremptorily say as one did [4435]_tam suavia dicam facinora, ut\nmale sit ei qui talibus non delectetur_, I will tell you such pretty\nstories, that foul befall him that is not pleased with them; _Neque dicam\nea quae vobis usui sit audivisse, et voluptati meminisse_, with that\nconfidence, as Beroaldus doth his enarrations on Propertius. I will not\nexpert or hope for that approbation, which Lipsius gives to his Epictetus;\n_pluris facio quum relego; semper ut novum, et quum repetivi, repetendum_,\nthe more I read, the more shall I covet to read. I will not press you with\nmy pamphlets, or beg attention, but if you like them you may. Pliny holds\nit expedient, and most fit, _severitatem jucunditate etiam in scriptis\ncondire_, to season our works with some pleasant discourse; Synesius\napproves it, _licet in ludicris ludere_, the [4436]poet admires it, _Omne\ntulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci_; and there be those, without\nquestion, that are more willing to read such toys, than [4437]I am to\nwrite: \"Let me not live,\" saith Aretine's Antonia, \"If I had not rather\nhear thy discourse, [4438]than see a play?\" No doubt but there be more of\nher mind, ever have been, ever will be, as [4439]Hierome bears me witness.\nA far greater part had rather read Apuleius than Plato: Tully himself\nconfesseth he could not understand Plato's Timaeus, and therefore cared\nless for it: but every schoolboy hath that famous testament of Grunnius\nCorocotta Porcellus at his fingers' ends. The comical poet,\n\n[4440]  ------\"Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,\n        Populo ut placrent, quas fecissit fabulas,\"\n\nmade this his only care and sole study to please the people, tickle the\near, and to delight; but mine earnest intent is as much to profit as to\nplease; _non tam ut populo placerem, quam ut populum juvarem_, and these my\nwritings, I hope, shall take like gilded pills, which are so composed as\nwell to tempt the appetite, and deceive the palate, as to help and\nmedicinally work upon the whole body; my lines shall not only recreate, but\nrectify the mind. I think I have said enough; if not, let him that is\notherwise minded, remember that of [4441]Maudarensis, \"he was in his life a\nphilosopher\" (as Ausonius apologiseth for him), \"in his epigrams a lover,\nin his precepts most severe; in his epistle to Caerellia, a wanton.\"\nAnnianus, Sulpicius, Evemus, Menander, and many old poets besides, did _in\nscriptis prurire_, write Fescennines, Atellans, and lascivious songs;\n_laetam materiam_; yet they had _in moribus censuram, et severitatem_, they\nwere chaste, severe, and upright livers.\n\n[4442] \"Castum esse decet pium poetam\n        Ipsum, versiculos nihil necesse est,\n        Qui tum denique habent salem et leporem.\"\n\nI am of Catullus' opinion, and make the same apology in mine own behalf;\n_Hoc etiam quod scribo, pendet plerumque ex aliorum sententia et\nauctoritate; nec ipse forsan insanio, sed insanientes sequor. Atqui detur\nhoc insanire me; Semel insanivimus omnes, et tute ipse opinor insanis\naliquando, et is, et ille, et ego, scilicet_.[4443] _Homo sum, humani a me\nnihil alienum puto_:[4444] And which he urgeth for himself, accused of the\nlike fault, I as justly plead, [4445]_lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba\nest_. Howsoever my lines err, my life is honest, [4446]_vita verecunda est,\nmusa jocosa mihi_. But I presume I need no such apologies, I need not, as\nSocrates in Plato, cover his face when he spake of love, or blush and hide\nmine eyes, as Pallas did in her hood, when she was consulted by Jupiter\nabout Mercury's marriage, _quod, super nuptiis virgo consulitur_, it is no\nsuch lascivious, obscene, or wanton discourse; I have not offended your\nchaster ears with anything that is here written, as many French and Italian\nauthors in their modern language of late have done, nay some of our Latin\npontificial writers, Zanches, Asorius, Abulensis, Burchardus, &c., whom\n[4447]Rivet accuseth to be more lascivious than Virgil in Priapeiis,\nPetronius in Catalectis, Aristophanes in Lycistratae, Martialis, or any\nother pagan profane writer, _qui tam atrociter_ ([4448]one notes) _hoc\ngenere peccarunt ut multa ingeniosissime scripta obscaenitatum gratia\ncastae mentes abhorreant_. 'Tis not scurrile this, but chaste, honest, most\npart serious, and even of religion itself. [4449]\"Incensed\" (as he said)\n\"with the love of finding love, we have sought it, and found it.\" More yet,\nI have augmented and added something to this light treatise (if light)\nwhich was not in the former editions, I am not ashamed to confess it, with\na good [4450]author, _quod extendi et locupletari hoc subjectum plerique\npostulabant, et eorum importunitate victus, animum utcunque renitentem eo\nadegi, ut jam sexta vice calamum in manum sumerem, scriptionique longe et a\nstudiis et professione mea alienae, me accingerem, horas aliquas a seriis\nmeis occupationibus interim suffuratus, easque veluti ludo cuidam ac\nrecreationi destinans_;\n\n[4451] \"Cogor------retrorsum\n        Vela dare, atque literare cursus\n        Olim relictos\"------\n\n_etsi non ignorarem novos fortasse detractores novis hisce\ninterpolationibus meis minime defuturos_. [4452]\n\nAnd thus much I have thought good to say by way of preface, lest any man\n(which [4453]Godefridus feared in his book) should blame in me lightness,\nwantonness, rashness, in speaking of love's causes, enticements, symptoms,\nremedies, lawful and unlawful loves, and lust itself, [4454]I speak it only\nto tax and deter others from it, not to teach, but to show the vanities and\nfopperies of this heroical or Herculean love, [4455]and to apply remedies\nunto it. I will treat of this with like liberty as of the rest.\n\n[4456] \"Sed dicam vobis, vos porro dicite multis\n        Millibus, et facite haec charta loquatur anus.\"\n\nCondemn me not good reader then, or censure me hardly, if some part of this\ntreatise to thy thinking as yet be too light; but consider better of it;\n_Omnia munda mundis_, [4457]a naked man to a modest woman is no otherwise\nthan a picture, as Augusta Livia truly said, and [4458]_mala mens, malus\nanimus_, 'tis as 'tis taken. If in thy censure it be too light, I advise\nthee as Lipsius did his reader for some places of Plautus, _istos quasi\nSirenum scopulos praetervehare_, if they like thee not, let them pass; or\noppose that which is good to that which is bad, and reject not therefore\nall. For to invert that verse of Martial, and with Hierom Wolfius to apply\nit to my present purpose, _sunt mala, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt bona\nplura_; some is good, some bad, some is indifferent. I say further with him\nyet, I have inserted ([4459]_levicula quaedam et ridicula ascribere non sum\ngravatus, circumforanea quaedam e theatris, e plateis, etiam e popinis_)\nsome things more homely, light, or comical, _litans gratiis_, &c. which I\nwould request every man to interpret to the best, and as Julius Caesar\nScaliger besought Cardan (_si quid urbaniuscule lusum a nobis, per deos\nimmortales te oro Hieronyme Cardane ne me male capias_). I beseech thee,\ngood reader, not to mistake me, or misconstrue what is here written; _Per\nMusas et Charites, et omnia Poetarum numina, benigne lector, oro te ne me\nmale capias_. 'Tis a comical subject; in sober sadness I crave pardon of\nwhat is amiss, and desire thee to suspend thy judgment, wink at small\nfaults, or to be silent at least; but if thou likest, speak well of it, and\nwish me good success. _Extremum hunc Arethusa mihi concede laborem_.[4460]\n\nI am resolved howsoever, _velis, nolis, audacter stadium intrare_, in the\nOlympics, with those Aeliensian wrestlers in Philostratus, boldly to show\nmyself in this common stage, and in this tragicomedy of love, to act\nseveral parts, some satirically, some comically, some in a mixed tone, as\nthe subject I have in hand gives occasion, and present scene shall require,\nor offer itself.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Love's Beginning, Object, Definition, Division_.\n\n\"Love's limits are ample and great, and a spacious walk it hath, beset with\nthorns,\" and for that cause, which [4461]Scaliger reprehends in Cardan,\n\"not lightly to be passed over.\" Lest I incur the same censure, 1 will\nexamine all the kinds of love, his nature, beginning, difference, objects,\nhow it is honest or dishonest, a virtue or vice, a natural passion, or a\ndisease, his power and effects, how far it extends: of which, although\nsomething has been said in the first partition, in those sections of\nperturbations ([4462] \"for love and hatred are the first and most common\npassions, from which all the rest arise, and are attendant,\" as\nPicolomineus holds, or as Nich. Caussinus, the _primum mobile_ of all other\naffections, which carry them all about them) I will now more copiously\ndilate, through all his parts and several branches, that so it may better\nappear what love is, and how it varies with the objects, how in defect, or\n(which is most ordinary and common) immoderate, and in excess, causeth\nmelancholy.\n\nLove universally taken, is defined to be a desire, as a word of more ample\nsignification: and though Leon Hebreus, the most copious writer of this\nsubject, in his third dialogue make no difference, yet in his first he\ndistinguisheth them again, and defines love by desire. [4463]\"Love is a\nvoluntary affection, and desire to enjoy that which is good. [4464]Desire\nwisheth, love enjoys; the end of the one is the beginning of the other;\nthat which we love is present; that which we desire is absent.\" [4465]\"It\nis worth the labour,\" saith Plotinus, \"to consider well of love, whether it\nbe a god or a devil, or passion of the mind, or partly god, partly devil,\npartly passion.\" He concludes love to participate of all three, to arise\nfrom desire of that which is beautiful and fair, and defines it to be \"an\naction of the mind desiring that which is good.\" [4466]Plato calls it the\ngreat devil, for its vehemency, and sovereignty over all other passions,\nand defines it an appetite, [4467]\"by which we desire some good to be\npresent.\" Ficinus in his comment adds the word fair to this definition.\nLove is a desire of enjoying that which is good and fair. Austin dilates\nthis common definition, and will have love to be a delectation of the\nheart, [4468]\"for something which we seek to win, or joy to have, coveting\nby desire, resting in joy.\" [4469]Scaliger _exerc. 301._ taxeth these\nformer definitions, and will not have love to be defined by desire or\nappetite; \"for when we enjoy the things we desire, there remains no more\nappetite:\" as he defines it, \"Love is an affection by which we are either\nunited to the thing we love, or perpetuate our union;\" which agrees in part\nwith Leon Hebreus.\n\nNow this love varies as its object varies, which is always good, amiable,\nfair, gracious, and pleasant. [4470]\"All things desire that which is good,\"\nas we are taught in the Ethics, or at least that which to them seems to be\ngood; _quid enim vis mali_ (as Austin well infers) _dic mihi? puto nihil in\nomnibus actionibus_; thou wilt wish no harm, I suppose, no ill in all thine\nactions, thoughts or desires, _nihil mali vis_; [4471]thou wilt not have\nbad corn, bad soil, a naughty tree, but all good; a good servant, a good\nhorse, a good son, a good friend, a good neighbour, a good wife. From this\ngoodness comes beauty; from beauty, grace, and comeliness, which result as\nso many rays from their good parts, make us to love, and so to covet it:\nfor were it not pleasing and gracious in our eyes, we should not seek.\n[4472]\"No man loves\" (saith Aristotle _9. mor. cap. 5._) \"but he that was\nfirst delighted with comeliness and beauty.\" As this fair object varies, so\ndoth our love; for as Proclus holds, _Omne pulchrum amabile_, every fair\nthing is amiable, and what we love is fair and gracious in our eyes, or at\nleast we do so apprehend and still esteem of it. [4473] \"Amiableness is the\nobject of love, the scope and end is to obtain it, for whose sake we love,\nand which our mind covets to enjoy.\" And it seems to us especially fair and\ngood; for good, fair, and unity, cannot be separated. Beauty shines, Plato\nsaith, and by reason of its splendour and shining causeth admiration; and\nthe fairer the object is, the more eagerly it is sought. For as the same\nPlato defines it, [4474]\"Beauty is a lively, shining or glittering\nbrightness, resulting from effused good, by ideas, seeds, reasons, shadows,\nstirring up our minds, that by this good they may be united and made one.\"\nOthers will have beauty to be the perfection of the whole composition,\n[4475]\"caused out of the congruous symmetry, measure, order and manner of\nparts, and that comeliness which proceeds from this beauty is called grace,\nand from thence all fair things are gracious.\" For grace and beauty are so\nwonderfully annexed, [4476]\"so sweetly and gently win our souls, and\nstrongly allure, that they confound our judgment and cannot be\ndistinguished. Beauty and grace are like those beams and shinings that come\nfrom the glorious and divine sun,\" which are diverse, as they proceed from\nthe diverse objects, to please and affect our several senses. [4477]\"As the\nspecies of beauty are taken at our eyes, ears, or conceived in our inner\nsoul,\" as Plato disputes at large in his _Dialogue de pulchro, Phaedro,\nHyppias_, and after many sophistical errors confuted, concludes that beauty\nis a grace in all things, delighting the eyes, ears, and soul itself; so\nthat, as Valesius infers hence, whatsoever pleaseth our ears, eyes, and\nsoul, must needs be beautiful, fair, and delightsome to us. [4478]\"And\nnothing can more please our ears than music, or pacify our minds.\" Fair\nhouses, pictures, orchards, gardens, fields, a fair hawk, a fair horse is\nmost acceptable unto us; whatsoever pleaseth our eyes and ears, we call\nbeautiful and fair; [4479]\"Pleasure belongeth to the rest of the senses,\nbut grace and beauty to these two alone.\" As the objects vary and are\ndiverse, so they diversely affect our eyes, ears, and soul itself. Which\ngives occasion to some to make so many several kinds of love as there be\nobjects. One beauty ariseth from God, of which and divine love S.\nDionysius, [4480]with many fathers and neoterics, have written just\nvolumes, _De amore Dei_, as they term it, many paraenetical discourses;\nanother from his creatures; there is a beauty of the body, a beauty of the\nsoul, a beauty from virtue, _formam martyrum_, Austin calls it, _quam\nvidemus oculis animi_, which we see with the eyes of our mind; which\nbeauty, as Tully saith, if we could discern with these corporeal eyes,\n_admirabili sui amores excitaret_, would cause admirable affections, and\nravish our souls. This other beauty which ariseth from those extreme parts,\nand graces which proceed from gestures, speeches, several motions, and\nproportions of creatures, men and women (especially from women, which made\nthose old poets put the three graces still in Venus' company, as attending\non her, and holding up her train) are infinite almost, and vary their names\nwith their objects, as love of money, covetousness, love of beauty, lust,\nimmoderate desire of any pleasure, concupiscence, friendship, love,\ngoodwill, &c. and is either virtue or vice, honest, dishonest, in excess,\ndefect, as shall be showed in his place. Heroical love, religious love, &c.\nwhich may be reduced to a twofold division, according to the principal\nparts which are affected, the brain and liver. _Amor et amicitia_, which\nScaliger _exercitat. 301._ Valesius and Melancthon warrant out of Plato\n[Greek: philein] and [Greek: eran] from that speech of Pausanias belike,\nthat makes two Veneres and two loves. [4481]\"One Venus is ancient without a\nmother, and descended from heaven, whom we call celestial; the younger,\nbegotten of Jupiter and Dione, whom commonly we call Venus.\" Ficinus, in\nhis comment upon this place, _cap. 8._ following Plato, calls these two\nloves, two devils, [4482]or good and bad angels according to us, which are\nstill hovering about our souls. [4483]\"The one rears to heaven, the other\ndepresseth us to hell; the one good, which stirs us up to the contemplation\nof that divine beauty for whose sake we perform justice and all godly\noffices, study philosophy, &c.; the other base, and though bad yet to be\nrespected; for indeed both are good in their own natures: procreation of\nchildren is as necessary as that finding out of truth, but therefore called\nbad, because it is abused, and withdraws our souls from the speculation of\nthat other to viler objects,\" so far Ficinus. S. Austin, _lib. 15. de civ.\nDei et sup. Psal. lxiv._, hath delivered as much in effect. [4484]\"Every\ncreature is good, and may be loved well or ill:\" and [4485]\"Two cities make\ntwo loves, Jerusalem and Babylon, the love of God the one, the love of the\nworld the other; of these two cities we all are citizens, as by examination\nof ourselves we may soon find, and of which.\" The one love is the root of\nall mischief, the other of all good. So, in his _15. cap. lib. de amor.\nEcclesiae_, he will have those four cardinal virtues to be nought else but\nlove rightly composed; in his 15. book _de civ. Dei, cap. 22._ he calls\nvirtue the order of love, whom Thomas following _1. part. 2. quaest. 55.\nart. 1._ and _quaest. 56. 3. quaest. 62. art. 2._ confirms as much, and\namplifies in many words. [4486]Lucian, to the same purpose, hath a division\nof his own, \"One love was born in the sea, which is as various and raging\nin young men's breasts as the sea itself, and causeth burning lust: the\nother is that golden chain which was let down from heaven, and with a\ndivine fury ravisheth our souls, made to the image of God, and stirs us up\nto comprehend the innate and incorruptible beauty to which we were once\ncreated.\" Beroaldus hath expressed all this in an epigram of his:\n\n       \"Dogmata divini memorant si vera Platonis,\n          Sunt geminae Veneres, et geminatus amor.\n        Coelestis Venus est nullo generata parente,\n          Quae casto sanctos nectit amore viros.\n        Altera sed Venus est totum vulgata per orbem,\n          Quae divum mentes alligat, atque hominum;\"\n\n       \"Improba, seductrix, petulans,\" &c.\n\n       \"If divine Plato's tenets they be true,\n        Two Veneres, two loves there be,\n        The one from heaven, unbegotten still,\n        Which knits our souls in unity.\n        The other famous over all the world,\n        Binding the hearts of gods and men;\n        Dishonest, wanton, and seducing she,\n        Rules whom she will, both where and when.\"\n\nThis twofold division of love, Origen likewise follows, in his Comment on\nthe Canticles, one from God, the other from the devil, as he holds\n(understanding it in the worse sense) which many others repeat and imitate.\nBoth which (to omit all subdivisions) in excess or defect, as they are\nabused, or degenerate, cause melancholy in a particular kind, as shall be\nshown in his place. Austin, in another Tract, makes a threefold division of\nthis love, which we may use well or ill: [4487]\"God, our neighbour, and the\nworld: God above us, our neighbour next us, the world beneath us. In the\ncourse of our desires, God hath three things, the world one, our neighbour\ntwo. Our desire to God, is either from God, with God, or to God, and\nordinarily so runs. From God, when it receives from him, whence, and for\nwhich it should love him: with God, when it contradicts his will in\nnothing: to God, when it seeks to him, and rests itself in him. Our love to\nour neighbour may proceed from him, and run with him, not to him: from him,\nas when we rejoice of his good safety, and well doing: with him, when we\ndesire to have him a fellow and companion of our journey in the way of the\nLord: not in him, because there is no aid, hope, or confidence in man. From\nthe world our love comes, when we begin to admire the Creator in his works,\nand glorify God in his creatures: with the world it should run, if,\naccording to the mutability of all temporalities, it should be dejected in\nadversity, or over elevated in prosperity: to the world, if it would settle\nitself in its vain delights and studies.\" Many such partitions of love I\ncould repeat, and subdivisions, but least (which Scaliger objects to\nCardan, _Exercitat. 501._) [4488]\"I confound filthy burning lust with pure\nand divine love,\" I will follow that accurate division of Leon Hebreus,\ndial. 2. betwixt Sophia and Philo, where he speaks of natural, sensible,\nand rational love, and handleth each apart. Natural love or hatred, is that\nsympathy or antipathy which is to be seen in animate and inanimate\ncreatures, in the four elements, metals, stones, _gravia tendunt deorsum_,\nas a stone to his centre, fire upward, and rivers to the sea. The sun,\nmoon, and stars go still around, [4489]_Amantes naturae, debita exercere_,\nfor love of perfection. This love is manifest, I say, in inanimate\ncreatures. How comes a loadstone to draw iron to it? jet chaff? the ground\nto covet showers, but for love? No creature, S. Hierom concludes, is to be\nfound, _quod non aliquid amat_, no stock, no stone, that hath not some\nfeeling of love, 'Tis more eminent in plants, herbs, and is especially\nobserved in vegetables; as between the vine and elm a great sympathy,\nbetween the vine and the cabbage, between the vine and the olive, [4490]\n_Virgo fugit Bromium_, between the vine and bays a great antipathy, the\nvine loves not the bay, [4491]\"nor his smell, and will kill him, if he grow\nnear him;\" the bur and the lentil cannot endure one another, the olive\n[4492]and the myrtle embrace each other, in roots and branches if they grow\nnear. Read more of this in Picolomineus _grad. 7. cap. 1._ Crescentius\n_lib. 5. de agric._ Baptista Porta _de mag. lib. 1. cap. de plant. dodio et\nelement. sym._ Fracastorius _de sym. et antip._ of the love and hatred of\nplanets, consult with every astrologer. Leon Hebreus gives many fabulous\nreasons, and moraliseth them withal.\n\nSensible love is that of brute beasts, of which the same Leon Hebreus\n_dial. 2._ assigns these causes. First for the pleasure they take in the\nact of generation, male and female love one another. Secondly, for the\npreservation of the species, and desire of young brood. Thirdly, for the\nmutual agreement, as being of the same kind: _Sus sui, canis cani, bos\nbovi, et asinus asino pulcherrimus videtur_, as Epicharmus held, and\naccording to that adage of Diogenianus, _Adsidet usque graculus apud\ngraculum_, they much delight in one another's company, [4493]_Formicae\ngrata est formica, cicada cicadae_, and birds of a feather will gather\ntogether. Fourthly, for custom, use, and familiarity, as if a dog be\ntrained up with a lion and a bear, contrary to their natures, they will\nlove each other. Hawks, dogs, horses, love their masters and keepers: many\nstories I could relate in this kind, but see Gillius _de hist. anim. lib.\n3. cap. 14._ those two Epistles of Lipsius, of dogs and horses, Agellius,\n&c. Fifthly, for bringing up, as if a bitch bring up a kid, a hen\nducklings, a hedge-sparrow a cuckoo, &c.\n\nThe third kind is _Amor cognitionis_, as Leon calls it, rational love,\n_Intellectivus amor_, and is proper to men, on which I must insist. This\nappears in God, angels, men. God is love itself, the fountain of love, the\ndisciple of love, as Plato styles him; the servant of peace, the God of\nlove and peace; have peace with all men and God is with you.\n\n[4494]  ------\"Quisquis veneratur Olympum,\n        Ipse sibi mundum subjicit atque Deum.\"\n\n[4495]\"By this love\" (saith Gerson) \"we purchase heaven,\" and buy the\nkingdom of God. This [4496]love is either in the Trinity itself (for the\nHoly Ghost is the love of the Father and the Son, &c. John iii. 35, and v.\n20, and xiv. 31), or towards us his creatures, as in making the world.\n_Amor mundum fecit_, love built cities, _mundi anima_, invented arts,\nsciences, and all [4497]good things, incites us to virtue and humanity,\ncombines and quickens; keeps peace on earth, quietness by sea, mirth in the\nwinds and elements, expels all fear, anger, and rusticity; _Circulus a bono\nin bonum_, a round circle still from good to good; for love is the beginner\nand end of all our actions, the efficient and instrumental cause, as our\npoets in their symbols, impresses, [4498]emblems of rings, squares, &c.,\nshadow unto us,\n\n       \"Si rerum quaeris fuerit quis finis et ortus,\n        Desine; nam causa est unica solus amor.\"\n\n       \"If first and last of anything you wit,\n        Cease; love's the sole and only cause of it.\"\n\nLove, saith [4499]Leo, made the world, and afterwards in redeeming of it,\n\"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son for it,\" John\niii. 16. \"Behold what love the Father hath showed on us, that we should be\ncalled the sons of God,\" 1 John iii. 1. Or by His sweet Providence, in\nprotecting of it; either all in general, or His saints elect and church in\nparticular, whom He keeps as the apple of His eye, whom He loves freely, as\nHosea xiv. 5. speaks, and dearly respects, [4500]_Charior est ipsis homo\nquam sibi_. Not that we are fair, nor for any merit or grace of ours, for\nwe are most vile and base; but out of His incomparable love and goodness,\nout of His Divine Nature. And this is that Homer's golden chain, which\nreacheth down from heaven to earth, by which every creature is annexed, and\ndepends on his Creator. He made all, saith [4501]Moses, \"and it was good;\"\nHe loves it as good.\n\nThe love of angels and living souls is mutual amongst themselves, towards\nus militant in the church, and all such as love God; as the sunbeams\nirradiate the earth from those celestial thrones, they by their well wishes\nreflect on us, [4502]_in salute hominum promovenda alacres, et constantes\nadministri_, there is joy in heaven for every sinner that repenteth; they\npray for us, are solicitous for our good, [4503]_Casti genii_.\n\n[4504] \"Ubi regnat charitas, suave desiderium,\n        Laetitiaque et amor Deo conjunctus.\"\n\nLove proper to mortal men is the third member of this subdivision, and the\nsubject of my following discourse.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Love of Men, which varies as his Objects, Profitable,\nPleasant, Honest_.\n\nValesius, _lib. 3. contr. 13_, defines this love which is in men, \"to be\n[4505]an affection of both powers, appetite and reason.\" The rational\nresides in the brain, the other in the liver (as before hath been said out\nof Plato and others); the heart is diversely affected of both, and carried\na thousand ways by consent. The sensitive faculty most part overrules\nreason, the soul is carried hoodwinked, and the understanding captive like\na beast. [4506]\"The heart is variously inclined, sometimes they are merry,\nsometimes sad, and from love arise hope and fear, jealousy, fury,\ndesperation.\" Now this love of men is diverse, and varies, as the object\nvaries, by which they are enticed, as virtue, wisdom, eloquence, profit,\nwealth, money, fame, honour, or comeliness of person, &c. Leon Hubreus, in\nhis first dialogue, reduceth them all to these three, _utile, jucundum,\nhonestum_, profitable, pleasant, honest; (out of Aristotle belike _8.\nmoral._) of which he discourseth at large, and whatsoever is beautiful and\nfair, is referred to them, or any way to be desired. [4507]\"To profitable\nis ascribed health, wealth, honour, &c., which is rather ambition, desire,\ncovetousness, than love:\" friends, children, love of women, [4508]all\ndelightful and pleasant objects, are referred to the second. The love of\nhonest things consists in virtue and wisdom, and is preferred before that\nwhich is profitable and pleasant: intellectual, about that which is honest.\n[4509]St. Austin calls \"profitable, worldly; pleasant, carnal; honest,\nspiritual. [4510]Of and from all three, result charity, friendship, and\ntrue love, which respects God and our neighbour.\" Of each of these I will\nbriefly dilate, and show in what sort they cause melancholy.\n\nAmongst all these fair enticing objects, which procure love, and bewitch\nthe soul of man, there is none so moving, so forcible as profit; and that\nwhich carrieth with it a show of commodity. Health indeed is a precious\nthing, to recover and preserve which we will undergo any misery, drink\nbitter potions, freely give our goods: restore a man to his health, his\npurse lies open to thee, bountiful he is, thankful and beholding to thee;\nbut give him wealth and honour, give him gold, or what shall be for his\nadvantage and preferment, and thou shalt command his affections, oblige him\neternally to thee, heart, hand, life, and all is at thy service, thou art\nhis dear and loving friend, good and gracious lord and master, his\nMecaenas; he is thy slave, thy vassal, most devote, affectioned, and bound\nin all duty: tell him good tidings in this kind, there spoke an angel, a\nblessed hour that brings in gain, he is thy creature, and thou his creator,\nhe hugs and admires thee; he is thine for ever. No loadstone so attractive\nas that of profit, none so fair an object as this of gold; [4511]nothing\nwins a man sooner than a good turn, bounty and liberality command body and\nsoul:\n\n       \"Munera (crede mihi) placant hominesque deosque;\n          Placatur donis Jupiter ipse datis.\"\n\n       \"Good turns doth pacify both God and men,\n        And Jupiter himself is won by them.\"\n\nGold of all other is a most delicious object; a sweet light, a goodly\nlustre it hath; _gratius aurum quam solem intuemur_, saith Austin, and we\nhad rather see it than the sun. Sweet and pleasant in getting, in keeping;\nit seasons all our labours, intolerable pains we take for it, base\nemployments, endure bitter flouts and taunts, long journeys, heavy burdens,\nall are made light and easy by this hope of gain: _At mihi plaudo ipse\ndomi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca_. The sight of gold refresheth our\nspirits, and ravisheth our hearts, as that Babylonian garment and [4512]\ngolden wedge did Achan in the camp, the very sight and hearing sets on fire\nhis soul with desire of it. It will make a man run to the antipodes, or\ntarry at home and turn parasite, lie, flatter, prostitute himself, swear\nand bear false witness; he will venture his body, kill a king, murder his\nfather, and damn his soul to come at it. _Formosior auri massa_, as [4513]\nhe well observed, the mass of gold is fairer than all your Grecian\npictures, that Apelles, Phidias, or any doting painter could ever make: we\nare enamoured with it,\n\n[4514] \"Prima fere vota, et cunctis notissima templis,\n        Divitiae ut crescant.\"------\n\nAll our labours, studies, endeavours, vows, prayers and wishes, are to get,\nhow to compass it.\n\n[4515] \"Haec est illa cui famulatur maximus orbis,\n        Diva potens rerum, domitrixque pecunia fati.\"\n\n\"This is the great goddess we adore and worship; this is the sole object of\nour desire.\" If we have it, as we think, we are made for ever, thrice\nhappy, princes, lords, &c. If we lose it, we are dull, heavy, dejected,\ndiscontent, miserable, desperate, and mad. Our estate and _bene esse_ ebbs\nand flows with our commodity; and as we are endowed or enriched, so are we\nbeloved and esteemed: it lasts no longer than our wealth; when that is\ngone, and the object removed, farewell friendship: as long as bounty, good\ncheer, and rewards were to be hoped, friends enough; they were tied to thee\nby the teeth, and would follow thee as crows do a carcass: but when thy\ngoods are gone and spent, the lamp of their love is out, and thou shalt be\ncontemned, scorned, hated, injured. [4516]Lucian's Timon, when he lived in\nprosperity, was the sole spectacle of Greece, only admired; who but Timon?\nEverybody loved, honoured, applauded him, each man offered him his service,\nand sought to be kin to him; but when his gold was spent, his fair\npossessions gone, farewell Timon: none so ugly, none so deformed, so odious\nan object as Timon, no man so ridiculous on a sudden, they gave him a penny\nto buy a rope, no man would know him.\n\n'Tis the general humour of the world, commodity steers our affections\nthroughout, we love those that are fortunate and rich, that thrive, or by\nwhom we may receive mutual kindness, hope for like courtesies, get any\ngood, gain, or profit; hate those, and abhor on the other side, which are\npoor and miserable, or by whom we may sustain loss or inconvenience. And\neven those that were now familiar and dear unto us, our loving and long\nfriends, neighbours, kinsmen, allies, with whom we have conversed, and\nlived as so many Geryons for some years past, striving still to give one\nanother all good content and entertainment, with mutual invitations,\nfeastings, disports, offices, for whom we would ride, run, spend ourselves,\nand of whom we have so freely and honourably spoken, to whom we have given\nall those turgent titles, and magnificent eulogiums, most excellent and\nmost noble, worthy, wise, grave, learned, valiant, &c., and magnified\nbeyond measure: if any controversy arise between us, some trespass, injury,\nabuse, some part of our goods be detained, a piece of land come to be\nlitigious, if they cross us in our suit, or touch the string of our\ncommodity, we detest and depress them upon a sudden: neither affinity,\nconsanguinity, or old acquaintance can contain us, but [4517]_rupto jecore\nexierit Caprificus_. A golden apple sets altogether by the ears, as if a\nmarrowbone or honeycomb were flung amongst bears: father and son, brother\nand sister, kinsmen are at odds: and look what malice, deadly hatred can\ninvent, that shall be done, _Terrible, dirum, pestilens, atrox, ferum_,\nmutual injuries, desire of revenge, and how to hurt them, him and his, are\nall our studies. If our pleasures be interrupt, we can tolerate it: our\nbodies hurt, we can put it up and be reconciled: but touch our commodities,\nwe are most impatient: fair becomes foul, the graces are turned to harpies,\nfriendly salutations to bitter imprecations, mutual feastings to plotting\nvillainies, minings and counterminings; good words to satires and\ninvectives, we revile _e contra_, nought but his imperfections are in our\neyes, he is a base knave, a devil, a monster, a caterpillar, a viper, a\nhog-rubber, &c. _Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne_;[4518] the scene\nis altered on a sudden, love is turned to hate, mirth to melancholy: so\nfuriously are we most part bent, our affections fixed upon this object of\ncommodity, and upon money, the desire of which in excess is covetousness:\nambition tyranniseth over our souls, as [4519]I have shown, and in defect\ncrucifies as much, as if a man by negligence, ill husbandry, improvidence,\nprodigality, waste and consume his goods and fortunes, beggary follows, and\nmelancholy, he becomes an abject, [4520]odious and \"worse than an infidel,\nin not providing for his family.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Pleasant Objects of Love_.\n\nPleasant objects are infinite, whether they be such as have life, or be\nwithout life; inanimate are countries, provinces, towers, towns, cities, as\nhe said, [4521]_Pulcherrimam insulam videmus, etiam cum non videmus_ we see\na fair island by description, when we see it not. The [4522]sun never saw a\nfairer city, Thessala Tempe, orchards, gardens, pleasant walks, groves,\nfountains, &c. The heaven itself is said to be [4523]fair or foul: fair\nbuildings, [4524]fair pictures, all artificial, elaborate and curious\nworks, clothes, give an admirable lustre: we admire, and gaze upon them,\n_ut pueri Junonis avem_, as children do on a peacock: a fair dog, a fair\nhorse and hawk, &c. [4525]_Thessalus amat equum pullinum, buculum\nAegyptius, Lacedaemonius Catulum_, &c., such things we love, are most\ngracious in our sight, acceptable unto us, and whatsoever else may cause\nthis passion, if it be superfluous or immoderately loved, as Guianerius\nobserves. These things in themselves are pleasing and good, singular\nornaments, necessary, comely, and fit to be had; but when we fix an\nimmoderate eye, and dote on them over much, this pleasure may turn to pain,\nbring much sorrow and discontent unto us, work our final overthrow, and\ncause melancholy in the end. Many are carried away with those bewitching\nsports of gaming, hawking, hunting, and such vain pleasures, as [4526]I\nhave said: some with immoderate desire of fame, to be crowned in the\nOlympics, knighted in the field, &c., and by these means ruinate\nthemselves. The lascivious dotes on his fair mistress, the glutton on his\ndishes, which are infinitely varied to please the palate, the epicure on\nhis several pleasures, the superstitious on his idol, and fats himself with\nfuture joys, as Turks feed themselves with an imaginary persuasion of a\nsensual paradise: so several pleasant objects diversely affect diverse men.\nBut the fairest objects and enticings proceed from men themselves, which\nmost frequently captivate, allure, and make them dote beyond all measure\nupon one another, and that for many respects: first, as some suppose, by\nthat secret force of stars, (_quod me tibi temperat astrum_?) They do\nsingularly dote on such a man, hate such again, and can give no reason for\nit. [4527]_Non amo te Sabidi_, &c. Alexander admired Ephestion, Adrian\nAntinous, Nero Sporus, &c. The physicians refer this to their temperament,\nastrologers to trine and sextile aspects, or opposite of their several\nascendants, lords of their genitures, love and hatred of planets; [4528]\nCicogna, to concord and discord of spirits; but most to outward graces. A\nmerry companion is welcome and acceptable to all men, and therefore, saith\n[4529]Gomesius, princes and great men entertain jesters and players\ncommonly in their courts. But [4530]_Pares cum paribus facillime\ncongregantur_, 'tis that [4531]similitude of manners, which ties most men\nin an inseparable link, as if they be addicted to the same studies or\ndisports, they delight in one another's companies, \"birds of a feather will\ngather together:\" if they be of divers inclinations, or opposite in\nmanners, they can seldom agree. Secondly, [4532]affability, custom, and\nfamiliarity, may convert nature many times, though they be different in\nmanners, as if they be countrymen, fellow-students, colleagues, or have\nbeen fellow-soldiers, [4533]brethren in affliction, ([4534]_acerba\ncalamitatum societas, diversi etiam ingenii homines conjungit_) affinity,\nor some such accidental occasion, though they cannot agree amongst\nthemselves, they will stick together like burrs, and bold against a third;\nso after some discontinuance, or death, enmity ceaseth; or in a foreign\nplace:\n\n       \"Pascitur in vivis livor, post fata quiescit:\n        Et cecidere odia, et tristes mors obruit iras.\"\n\nA third cause of love and hate, may be mutual offices, _acceptum\nbeneficium_, [4535]commend him, use him kindly, take his part in a quarrel,\nrelieve him in his misery, thou winnest him for ever; do the opposite, and\nbe sure of a perpetual enemy. Praise and dispraise of each other, do as\nmuch, though unknown, as [4536]Schoppius by Scaliger and Casaubonus: _mulus\nmulum scabit_; who but Scaliger with him? what encomiums, epithets,\neulogiums? _Antistes sapientiae, perpetuus dictator, literarum ornamentum,\nEuropae miraculum_, noble Scaliger, [4537] _incredibilis ingenii\npraestantia, &c., diis potius quam hominibus per omnia comparandus, scripta\nejus aurea ancylia de coelo delapsa poplitibus veneramur flexis_,\n&c.,[4538] but when they began to vary, none so absurd as Scaliger, so vile\nand base, as his books _de Burdonum familia_, and other satirical\ninvectives may witness, Ovid, _in Ibin_, Archilocus himself was not so\nbitter. Another great tie or cause of love, is consanguinity: parents are\nclear to their children, children to their parents, brothers and sisters,\ncousins of all sorts, as a hen and chickens, all of a knot: every crow\nthinks her own bird fairest. Many memorable examples are in this kind, and\n'tis _portenti simile_, if they do not: [4539]\"a mother cannot forget her\nchild:\" Solomon so found out the true owner; love of parents may not be\nconcealed, 'tis natural, descends, and they that are inhuman in this kind,\nare unworthy of that air they breathe, and of the four elements; yet many\nunnatural examples we have in this rank, of hard-hearted parents,\ndisobedient children, of [4540]disagreeing brothers, nothing so common. The\nlove of kinsmen is grown cold, [4541]\"many kinsmen\" (as the saying is) \"few\nfriends;\" if thine estate be good, and thou able, _par pari referre_, to\nrequite their kindness, there will be mutual correspondence, otherwise thou\nart a burden, most odious to them above all others. The last object that\nties man and man, is comeliness of person, and beauty alone, as men love\nwomen with a wanton eye: which [Greek: kat' exochaen] is termed heroical,\nor love-melancholy. Other loves (saith Picolomineus) are so called with\nsome contraction, as the love of wine, gold, &c., but this of women is\npredominant in a higher strain, whose part affected is the liver, and this\nlove deserves a longer explication, and shall be dilated apart in the next\nsection.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Honest Objects of Love_.\n\nBeauty is the common object of all love, [4542]\"as jet draws a straw, so\ndoth beauty love:\" virtue and honesty are great motives, and give as fair a\nlustre as the rest, especially if they be sincere and right, not fucate,\nbut proceeding from true form, and an incorrupt judgment; those two Venus'\ntwins, Eros and Anteros, are then most firm and fast. For many times\notherwise men are deceived by their flattering gnathos, dissembling\ncamelions, outsides, hypocrites that make a show of great love, learning,\npretend honesty, virtue, zeal, modesty, with affected looks and counterfeit\ngestures: feigned protestations often steal away the hearts and favours of\nmen, and deceive them, _specie virtutis et umbra_, when as _revera_ and\nindeed, there is no worth or honesty at all in them, no truth, but mere\nhypocrisy, subtlety, knavery, and the like. As true friends they are, as he\nthat Caelius Secundus met by the highway side; and hard it is in this\ntemporising age to distinguish such companions, or to find them out. Such\ngnathos as these for the most part belong to great men, and by this glozing\nflattery, affability, and such like philters, so dive and insinuate into\ntheir favours, that they are taken for men of excellent worth, wisdom,\nlearning, demigods, and so screw themselves into dignities, honours,\noffices; but these men cause harsh confusion often, and as many times stirs\nas Rehoboam's counsellors in a commonwealth, overthrew themselves and\nothers. Tandlerus and some authors make a doubt, whether love and hatred\nmay be compelled by philters or characters; Cardan and Marbodius, by\nprecious stones and amulets; astrologers by election of times, &c. as\n[4543]I shall elsewhere discuss. The true object of this honest love is\nvirtue, wisdom, honesty, [4544]real worth, _Interna forma_, and this love\ncannot deceive or be compelled, _ut ameris amabilis esto_, love itself is\nthe most potent philtrum, virtue and wisdom, _gratia gratum faciens_, the\nsole and only grace, not counterfeit, but open, honest, simple, naked,\n[4545]\"descending from heaven,\" as our apostle hath it, an infused habit\nfrom God, which hath given several gifts, as wit, learning, tongues, for\nwhich they shall be amiable and gracious, Eph. iv. 11. as to Saul stature\nand a goodly presence, 1 Sam. ix. 1. Joseph found favour in Pharaoh's\ncourt, Gen. xxxix, for [4546]his person; and Daniel with the princes of the\neunuchs, Dan. xix. 19. Christ was gracious with God and men, Luke ii. 52.\nThere is still some peculiar grace, as of good discourse, eloquence, wit,\nhonesty, which is the _primum mobile_, first mover, and a most forcible\nloadstone to draw the favours and good wills of men's eyes, ears, and\naffections unto them. When \"Jesus spake, they were all astonished at his\nanswers,\" (Luke ii. 47.) \"and wondered at his gracious words which\nproceeded from his mouth.\" An orator steals away the hearts of men, and as\nanother Orpheus, _quo vult, unde vult_, he pulls them to him by speech\nalone: a sweet voice causeth admiration; and he that can utter himself in\ngood words, in our ordinary phrase, is called a proper man, a divine\nspirit. For which cause belike, our old poets, _Senatus populusque\npoetarum_, made Mercury the gentleman-usher to the Graces, captain of\neloquence, and those charities to be Jupiter's and Eurymone's daughters,\ndescended from above. Though they be otherwise deformed, crooked, ugly to\nbehold, those good parts of the mind denominate them fair. Plato commends\nthe beauty of Socrates; yet who was more grim of countenance, stern and\nghastly to look upon? So are and have been many great philosophers, as\n[4547]Gregory Nazianzen observes, \"deformed most part in that which is to\nbe seen with the eyes, but most elegant in that which is not to be seen.\"\n_Saepe sub attrita latitat sapientia veste_. Aesop, Democritus, Aristotle,\nPolitianus, Melancthon, Gesner, &c. withered old men, _Sileni Alcibiadis_,\nvery harsh and impolite to the eye; but who were so terse, polite,\neloquent, generally learned, temperate and modest? No man then living was\nso fair as Alcibiades, so lovely _quo ad superficiem_, to the eye, as\n[4548]Boethius observes, but he had _Corpus turpissimum interne_, a most\ndeformed soul; honesty, virtue, fair conditions, are great enticers to such\nas are well given, and much avail to get the favour and goodwill of men.\nAbdolominus in Curtius, a poor man, (but which mine author notes,\n[4549]\"the cause of this poverty was his honesty\") for his modesty and\ncontinency from a private person (for they found him digging in his garden)\nwas saluted king, and preferred before all the magnificoes of his time,\n_injecta ei vestis purpura auroque distincta_, \"a purple embroidered\ngarment was put upon him, [4550]and they bade him wash himself, and, as he\nwas worthy, take upon him the style and spirit of a king,\" continue his\ncontinency and the rest of his good parts. Titus Pomponius Atticus, that\nnoble citizen of Rome, was so fair conditioned, of so sweet a carriage,\nthat he was generally beloved of all good men, of Caesar, Pompey, Antony,\nTully, of divers sects, &c. _multas haereditates_ ([4551]Cornelius Nepos\nwrites) _sola bonitate consequutus. Operae, pretium audire_, &c. It is\nworthy of your attention, Livy cries, [4552]\"you that scorn all but riches,\nand give no esteem to virtue, except they be wealthy withal, Q. Cincinnatus\nhad but four acres, and by the consent of the senate was chosen dictator of\nRome.\" Of such account were Cato, Fabricius, Aristides, Antonius, Probus,\nfor their eminent worth: so Caesar, Trajan, Alexander, admired for valour,\n[4553] Haephestion loved Alexander, but Parmenio the king: _Titus deliciae\nhumani generis_, and which Aurelius Victor hath of Vespasian, the darling\nof his time, as [4554]Edgar Etheling was in England, for his\n[4555]excellent virtues: their memory is yet fresh, sweet, and we love them\nmany ages after, though they be dead: _Suavem memoriam sui reliquit_, saith\nLipsius of his friend, living and dead they are all one. [4556]\"I have ever\nloved as thou knowest\" (so Tully wrote to Dolabella) \"Marcus Brutus for his\ngreat wit, singular honesty, constancy, sweet conditions; and believe it\"\n[4557] \"there is nothing so amiable and fair as virtue.\" \"I [4558]do\nmightily love Calvisinus,\" (so Pliny writes to Sossius) \"a most\nindustrious, eloquent, upright man, which is all in all with me:\" the\naffection came from his good parts. And as St. Austin comments on the 84th\nPsalm, [4559]\"there is a peculiar beauty of justice, and inward beauty,\nwhich we see with the eyes of our hearts, love, and are enamoured with, as\nin martyrs, though their bodies be torn in pieces with wild beasts, yet\nthis beauty shines, and we love their virtues.\" The [4560]stoics are of\nopinion that a wise man is only fair; and Cato in Tully _3 de Finibus_\ncontends the same, that the lineaments of the mind are far fairer than\nthose of the body, incomparably beyond them: wisdom and valour according to\n[4561]Xenophon, especially deserve the name of beauty, and denominate one\nfair, _et incomparabiliter pulchrior est_ (as Austin holds) _veritas\nChristianorum quam Helena Graecorum_. \"Wine is strong, the king is strong,\nwomen are strong, but truth overcometh all things,\" Esd. i. 3, 10, 11, 12.\n\"Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and getteth understanding, for the\nmerchandise thereof is better than silver, and the gain thereof better than\ngold: it is more precious than pearls, and all the things thou canst desire\nare not to be compared to her,\" Prov. ii. 13, 14, 15, a wise, true, just,\nupright, and good man, I say it again, is only fair: [4562]it is reported\nof Magdalene Queen of France, and wife to Lewis 11th, a Scottish woman by\nbirth, that walking forth in an evening with her ladies, she spied M.\nAlanus, one of the king's chaplains, a silly, old, [4563]hard-favoured man\nfast asleep in a bower, and kissed him sweetly; when the young ladies\nlaughed at her for it, she replied, that it was not his person that she did\nembrace and reverence, but, with a platonic love, the divine beauty of\n[4564]his soul. Thus in all ages virtue hath been adored, admired, a\nsingular lustre hath proceeded from it: and the more virtuous he is, the\nmore gracious, the more admired. No man so much followed upon earth as\nChrist himself: and as the Psalmist saith, xlv. 2, \"He was fairer than the\nsons of men.\" Chrysostom _Hom. 8 in Mat._ Bernard _Ser. 1. de omnibus\nsanctis_; Austin, Cassiodore, _Hier. in 9 Mat._ interpret it of the\n[4565]beauty of his person; there was a divine majesty in his looks, it\nshined like lightning and drew all men to it: but Basil, _Cyril, lib. 6.\nsuper. 55. Esay._ Theodoret, Arnobius, &c. of the beauty of his divinity,\njustice, grace, eloquence, &c. Thomas _in Psal. xliv._ of both; and so doth\nBaradius and Peter Morales, _lib de pulchritud. Jesu et Mariae_, adding as\nmuch of Joseph and the Virgin Mary,--_haec alias forma praecesserit omnes_,\n[4566]according to that prediction of Sibylla Cumea. Be they present or\nabsent, near us, or afar off, this beauty shines, and will attract men many\nmiles to come and visit it. Plato and Pythagoras left their country, to see\nthose wise Egyptian priests: Apollonius travelled into Ethiopia, Persia, to\nconsult with the Magi, Brachmanni, gymnosophists. The Queen of Sheba came\nto visit Solomon; and \"many,\" saith [4567]Hierom, \"went out of Spain and\nremote places a thousand miles, to behold that eloquent Livy:\" [4568]_Multi\nRomam non ut urbem pulcherrimam, aut urbis et orbis dominum Octavianum, sed\nut hunc unum inviserent audirentque, a Gadibus profecti sunt._ No beauty\nleaves such an impression, strikes so deep [4569], or links the souls of\nmen closer than virtue.\n\n[4570] \"Non per deos aut pictor posset,\n        Aut statuarius ullus fingere\n        Talem pulchritudinem qualem virtus habet;\"\n\n\"no painter, no graver, no carver can express virtue's lustre, or those\nadmirable rays that come from it, those enchanting rays that enamour\nposterity, those everlasting rays that continue to the world's end.\" Many,\nsaith Phavorinus, that loved and admired Alcibiades in his youth, knew not,\ncared not for Alcibiades a man, _nunc intuentes quaerebant Alcibiadem_; but\nthe beauty of Socrates is still the same; [4571]virtue's lustre never\nfades, is ever fresh and green, _semper viva_ to all succeeding ages, and a\nmost attractive loadstone, to draw and combine such as are present. For\nthat reason belike, Homer feigns the three Graces to be linked and tied\nhand in hand, because the hearts of men are so firmly united with such\ngraces. [4572]\"O sweet bands (Seneca exclaims), which so happily combine,\nthat those which are bound by them love their binders, desiring withal much\nmore harder to be bound,\" and as so many Geryons to be united into one. For\nthe nature of true friendship is to combine, to be like affected, of one\nmind,\n\n[4573] \"Velle et nolle ambobus idem, satiataque toto\n        Mens aevo\"------\n\nas the poet saith, still to continue one and the same. And where this love\ntakes place there is peace and quietness, a true correspondence, perfect\namity, a diapason of vows and wishes, the same opinions, as between [4574]\nDavid and Jonathan, Damon and Pythias, Pylades and Orestes, [4575]Nysus and\nEuryalus, Theseus and Pirithous, [4576]they will live and die together, and\nprosecute one another with good turns. [4577]_Nam vinci in amore\nturpissimum putant_, not only living, but when their friends are dead, with\ntombs and monuments, nenias, epitaphs elegies, inscriptions, pyramids,\nobelisks, statues, images, pictures, histories, poems, annals, feasts,\nanniversaries, many ages after (as Plato's scholars did) they will\n_parentare_ still, omit no good office that may tend to the preservation of\ntheir names, honours, and eternal memory. [4578]_Illum coloribus, illum\ncera, illum aere_, &c. \"He did express his friends in colours, in wax, in\nbrass, in ivory, marble, gold, and silver\" (as Pliny reports of a citizen\nin Rome), \"and in a great auditory not long since recited a just volume of\nhis life.\" In another place, [4579]speaking of an epigram which Martial had\ncomposed in praise of him, [4580]\"He gave me as much as he might, and would\nhave done more if he could: though what can a man give more than honour,\nglory, and eternity?\" But that which he wrote peradventure will not\ncontinue, yet he wrote it to continue. 'Tis all the recompense a poor\nscholar can make his well-deserving patron, Mecaenas, friend, to mention\nhim in his works, to dedicate a book to his name, to write his life, &c.,\nas all our poets, orators, historiographers have ever done, and the\ngreatest revenge such men take of their adversaries, to persecute them with\nsatires, invectives, &c., and 'tis both ways of great moment, as [4581]\nPlato gives us to understand. Paulus Jovius, in the fourth book of the life\nand deeds of Pope Leo Decimus, his noble patron, concludes in these words,\n[4582]\"Because I cannot honour him as other rich men do, with like\nendeavour, affection, and piety, I have undertaken to write his life; since\nmy fortunes will not give me leave to make a more sumptuous monument, I\nwill perform those rites to his sacred ashes, which a small, perhaps, but a\nliberal wit can afford.\" But I rove. Where this true love is wanting, there\ncan be no firm peace, friendship from teeth outward, counterfeit, or for\nsome by-respects, so long dissembled, till they have satisfied their own\nends, which, upon every small occasion, breaks out into enmity, open war,\ndefiance, heart-burnings, whispering, calumnies, contentions, and all\nmanner of bitter melancholy discontents. And those men which have no other\nobject of their love, than greatness, wealth, authority, &c., are rather\nfeared than beloved; _nec amant quemquam, nec amantur ab ullo_: and\nhowsoever borne with for a time, yet for their tyranny and oppression,\ngriping, covetousness, currish hardness, folly, intemperance, imprudence,\nand such like vices, they are generally odious, abhorred of all, both God\nand men.\n\n       \"Non uxor salvum te vult, non filius, omnes\n        Vicini oderunt,\"------\n\n\"wife and children, friends, neighbours, all the world forsakes them, would\nfeign be rid of them,\" and are compelled many times to lay violent hands on\nthem, or else God's judgments overtake them: instead of graces, come\nfuries. So when fair [4583]Abigail, a woman of singular wisdom, was\nacceptable to David, Nabal was churlish and evil-conditioned; and therefore\n[4584]Mordecai was received, when Haman was executed, Haman the favourite,\n\"that had his seat above the other princes, to whom all the king's servants\nthat stood in the gates, bowed their knees and reverenced.\" Though they\nflourished many times, such hypocrites, such temporising foxes, and blear\nthe world's eyes by flattery, bribery, dissembling their natures, or other\nmen's weakness, that cannot so apprehend their tricks, yet in the end they\nwill be discerned, and precipitated in a moment: \"surely,\" saith David,\n\"thou hast set them in slippery places,\" Psal. xxxvii. 5. as so many\nSejani, they will come down to the Gemonian scales; and as Eusebius in\n[4585] Ammianus, that was in such authority, _ad jubendum Imperatorem_, be\ncast down headlong on a sudden. Or put case they escape, and rest unmasked\nto their lives' end, yet after their death their memory stinks as a snuff\nof a candle put out, and those that durst not so much as mutter against\nthem in their lives, will prosecute their name with satires, libels, and\nbitter imprecations, they shall _male audire_ in all succeeding ages, and\nbe odious to the world's end.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Charity composed of all three Kinds, Pleasant, Profitable, Honest_.\n\nBesides this love that comes from profit, pleasant, honest (for one good\nturn asks another in equity), that which proceeds from the law of nature,\nor from discipline and philosophy, there is yet another love compounded of\nall these three, which is charity, and includes piety, dilection,\nbenevolence, friendship, even all those virtuous habits; for love is the\ncircle equant of all other affections, of which Aristotle dilates at large\nin his Ethics, and is commanded by God, which no man can well perform, but\nhe that is a Christian, and a true regenerate man; this is, [4586]\"To love\nGod above all, and our neighbour as ourself;\" for this love is _lychnus\naccendens et accensus_, a communicating light, apt to illuminate itself as\nwell as others. All other objects are fair, and very beautiful, I confess;\nkindred, alliance, friendship, the love that we owe to our country, nature,\nwealth, pleasure, honour, and such moral respects, &c., of which read\n[4587]copious Aristotle in his morals; a man is beloved of a man, in that\nhe is a man; but all these are far more eminent and great, when they shall\nproceed from a sanctified spirit, that hath a true touch of religion, and a\nreference to God. Nature binds all creatures to love their young ones; a\nhen to preserve her brood will run upon a lion, a hind will fight with a\nbull, a sow with a bear, a silly sheep with a fox. So the same nature\nurgeth a man to love his parents, ([4588]_dii me pater omnes oderint, ni te\nmagis quam oculos amem meos!_) and this love cannot be dissolved, as Tully\nholds, [4589]\"without detestable offence:\" but much more God's commandment,\nwhich enjoins a filial love, and an obedience in this kind. [4590]\"The love\nof brethren is great, and like an arch of stones, where if one be\ndisplaced, all comes down,\" no love so forcible and strong, honest, to the\ncombination of which, nature, fortune, virtue, happily concur; yet this\nlove comes short of it. [4591]_Dulce et decorum pro patria mori_, [4592]it\ncannot be expressed, what a deal of charity that one name of country\ncontains. _Amor laudis et patriae pro stipendio est_; the Decii did _se\ndevovere_, Horatii, Curii, Scaevola, Regulus, Codrus, sacrifice themselves\nfor their country's peace and good.\n\n[4593] \"Una dies Fabios ad bellum miserat omnes,\n        Ad bellum missos perdidit una dies.\"\n\n       \"One day the Fabii stoutly warred,\n        One day the Fabii were destroyed.\"\n\nFifty thousand Englishmen lost their lives willingly near Battle Abbey, in\ndefence of their country. [4594]P. Aemilius _l. 6._ speaks of six senators\nof Calais, that came with halters in their hands to the king of England, to\ndie for the rest. This love makes so many writers take such pains, so many\nhistoriographers, physicians, &c., or at least, as they pretend, for common\nsafety, and their country's benefit. [4595]_Sanctum nomen amiciticae,\nsociorum communio sacra_; friendship is a holy name, and a sacred communion\nof friends. [4596]\"As the sun is in the firmament, so is friendship in the\nworld,\" a most divine and heavenly band. As nuptial love makes, this\nperfects mankind, and is to be preferred (if you will stand to the judgment\nof [4597]Cornelius Nepos) before affinity or consanguinity; _plus in\namiciticia valet similitudo morum, quam affinitas_, &c., the cords of love\nbind faster than any other wreath whatsoever. Take this away, and take all\npleasure, joy, comfort, happiness, and true content out of the world; 'tis\nthe greatest tie, the surest indenture, strongest band, and, as our modern\nMaro decides it, is much to be preferred before the rest.\n\n[4598] \"Hard is the doubt, and difficult to deem,\n        When all three kinds of love together meet;\n        And do dispart the heart with power extreme,\n        Whether shall weigh the balance down; to wit,\n        The dear affection unto kindred sweet,\n        Or raging fire of love to women kind,\n        Or zeal of friends, combin'd by virtues meet;\n        But of them all the band of virtuous mind,\n        Methinks the gentle heart should most assured bind.\n\n        For natural affection soon doth cease,\n        And quenched is with Cupid's greater flame;\n        But faithful friendship doth them both suppress,\n        And them with mastering discipline doth tame,\n        Through thoughts aspiring to eternal fame.\n        For as the soul doth rule the earthly mass,\n        And all the service of the body frame,\n        So love of soul doth love of body pass,\n        No less than perfect gold surmounts the meanest brass.\"\n\n[4599]A faithful friend is better than [4600]gold, a medicine of misery,\n[4601]an only possession; yet this love of friends, nuptial, heroical,\nprofitable, pleasant, honest, all three loves put together, are little\nworth, if they proceed not from a true Christian illuminated soul, if it be\nnot done _in ordine ad Deum_ for God's sake. \"Though I had the gift of\nprophecy, spake with tongues of men and angels, though I feed the poor with\nall my goods, give my body to be burned, and have not this love, it\nprofiteth me nothing,\" 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 3. 'tis _splendidum peccatum_,\nwithout charity. This is an all-apprehending love, a deifying love, a\nrefined, pure, divine love, the quintessence of all love, the true\nphilosopher's stone, _Non potest enim_, as [4602]Austin infers, _veraciter\namicus esse hominis, nisi fuerit ipsius primitus veritatis_, He is no true\nfriend that loves not God's truth. And therefore this is true love indeed,\nthe cause of all good to mortal men, that reconciles all creatures, and\nglues them together in perpetual amity and firm league; and can no more\nabide bitterness, hate, malice, than fair and foul weather, light and\ndarkness, sterility and plenty may be together; as the sun in the firmament\n(I say), so is love in the world; and for this cause 'tis love without an\naddition, love [Greek: kat' exochaen], love of God, and love of men.\n[4603]\"The love of God begets the love of man; and by this love of our\nneighbour, the love of God is nourished and increased.\" By this happy union\nof love, [4604]\"all well-governed families and cities are combined, the\nheavens annexed, and divine souls complicated, the world itself composed,\nand all that is in it conjoined in God, and reduced to one.\" [4605]\"This\nlove causeth true and absolute virtues, the life, spirit, and root of every\nvirtuous action, it finisheth prosperity, easeth adversity, corrects all\nnatural encumbrances,\" inconveniences, sustained by faith and hope, which\nwith this our love make an indissoluble twist, a Gordian knot, an\nequilateral triangle, \"and yet the greatest of them is love,\" 1 Cor. xiii.\n13, [4606]\"which inflames our souls with a divine heat, and being so\ninflamed, purged, and so purgeth, elevates to God, makes an atonement, and\nreconciles us unto him.\" [4607] \"That other love infects the soul of man,\nthis cleanseth; that depresses, this rears; that causeth cares and\ntroubles, this quietness of mind; this informs, that deforms our life; that\nleads to repentance, this to heaven.\" For if once we be truly linked and\ntouched with this charity, we shall love God above all, our neighbour as\nourself, as we are enjoined, Mark xii. 31. Matt. xix. 19. perform those\nduties and exercises, even all the operations of a good Christian.\n\n\"This love suffereth long, it is bountiful, envieth not, boasteth not\nitself, is not puffed up, it deceiveth not, it seeketh not his own things,\nis not provoked to anger, it thinketh not evil, it rejoiceth not in\niniquity, but in truth. It suffereth all things, believeth all things,\nhopeth all things,\" 1 Cor. xiii. 4, 5, 6, 7; \"it covereth all trespasses,\"\nProv, x. 12; \"a multitude of sins,\" 1 Pet. 4, as our Saviour told the woman\nin the Gospel, that washed his feet, \"many sins were forgiven her, for she\nloved much,\" Luke vii. 47; \"it will defend the fatherless and the widow,\"\nIsa. i. 17; \"will seek no revenge, or be mindful of wrong,\" Levit. xix. 18;\n\"will bring home his brother's ox if he go astray, as it is commanded,\"\nDeut. xxii. 1; \"will resist evil, give to him that asketh, and not turn\nfrom him that borroweth, bless them that curse him, love his enemy,\" Matt.\nv; \"bear his brother's burthen,\" Gal. vi. 7. He that so loves will be\nhospitable, and distribute to the necessities of the saints; he will, if it\nbe possible, have peace with all men, \"feed his enemy if he be hungry, if\nhe be athirst give him drink;\" he will perform those seven works of mercy,\n\"he will make himself equal to them of the lower sort, rejoice with them\nthat rejoice, weep with them that weep,\" Rom. xii; he will speak truth to\nhis neighbour, be courteous and tender-hearted, \"forgiving others for\nChrist's sake, as God forgave him,\" Eph. iv. 32; \"he will be like minded,\"\nPhil. ii. 2. \"Of one judgment; be humble, meek, long-suffering,\" Colos.\niii. \"Forbear, forget and forgive,\" xii. 13. 23. and what he doth shall be\nheartily done to God, and not to men. \"Be pitiful and courteous,\" 1 Pet.\niii. \"Seek peace and follow it.\" He will love his brother, not in word and\ntongue, but in deed and truth, John iii. 18. \"and he that loves God, Christ\nwill love him that is begotten of him,\" John v. 1, &c. Thus should we\nwillingly do, if we had a true touch of this charity, of this divine love,\nif we could perform this which we are enjoined, forget and forgive, and\ncompose ourselves to those Christian laws of love.\n\n[4608] \"O felix hominum genus,\n        Si vestros animos amor\n        Quo coelum regitur regat!\"\n\n\"Angelical souls, how blessed, how happy should we be, so loving, how might\nwe triumph over the devil, and have another heaven upon earth!\"\n\nBut this we cannot do; and which is the cause of all our woes, miseries,\ndiscontent, melancholy, [4609]want of this charity. We do _invicem\nangariare_, contemn, consult, vex, torture, molest, and hold one another's\nnoses to the grindstone hard, provoke, rail, scoff, calumniate, challenge,\nhate, abuse (hard-hearted, implacable, malicious, peevish, inexorable as we\nare), to satisfy our lust or private spleen, for [4610]toys, trifles, and\nimpertinent occasions, spend ourselves, goods, friends, fortunes, to be\nrevenged on our adversary, to ruin him and his. 'Tis all our study,\npractice, and business how to plot mischief, mine, countermine, defend and\noffend, ward ourselves, injure others, hurt all; as if we were born to do\nmischief, and that with such eagerness and bitterness, with such rancour,\nmalice, rage, and fury, we prosecute our intended designs, that neither\naffinity or consanguinity, love or fear of God or men can contain us: no\nsatisfaction, no composition will be accepted, no offices will serve, no\nsubmission; though he shall upon his knees, as Sarpedon did to Glaucus in\nHomer, acknowledging his error, yield himself with tears in his eyes, beg\nhis pardon, we will not relent, forgive, or forget, till we have confounded\nhim and his, \"made dice of his bones,\" as they say, see him rot in prison,\nbanish his friends, followers, _et omne invisum genus_, rooted him out and\nall his posterity. Monsters of men as we are, dogs, wolves, [4611]tigers,\nfiends, incarnate devils, we do not only contend, oppress, and tyrannise\nourselves, but as so many firebrands, we set on, and animate others: our\nwhole life is a perpetual combat, a conflict, a set battle, a snarling fit.\n_Eris dea_ is settled in our tents, [4612]_Omnia de lite_, opposing wit to\nwit, wealth to wealth, strength to strength, fortunes to fortunes, friends\nto friends, as at a sea-fight, we turn our broadsides, or two millstones\nwith continual attrition, we fire ourselves, or break another's backs, and\nboth are ruined and consumed in the end. Miserable wretches, to fat and\nenrich ourselves, we care not how we get it, _Quocunque modo rem_; how many\nthousands we undo, whom we oppress, by whose ruin and downfall we arise,\nwhom we injure, fatherless children, widows, common societies, to satisfy\nour own private lust. Though we have myriads, abundance of wealth and\ntreasure, (pitiless, merciless, remorseless, and uncharitable in the\nhighest degree), and our poor brother in need, sickness, in great\nextremity, and now ready to be starved for want of food, we had rather, as\nthe fox told the ape, his tail should sweep the ground still, than cover\nhis buttocks; rather spend it idly, consume it with dogs, hawks, hounds,\nunnecessary buildings, in riotous apparel, ingurgitate, or let it be lost,\nthan he should have part of it; [4613]rather take from him that little\nwhich he hath, than relieve him.\n\nLike the dog in the manger, we neither use it ourselves, let others make\nuse of or enjoy it; part with nothing while we live: for want of disposing\nour household, and setting things in order, set all the world together by\nthe ears after our death. Poor Lazarus lies howling at his gates for a few\ncrumbs, he only seeks chippings, offals; let him roar and howl, famish, and\neat his own flesh, he respects him not. A poor decayed kinsman of his sets\nupon him by the way in all his jollity, and runs begging bareheaded by him,\nconjuring by those former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,\n&c., uncle, cousin, brother, father,\n\n        ------\"Per ego has lachrymas, dextramque tuam te,\n        Si quidquam de te merui, fuit aut tibi quidquam\n        Dulce meum, misere mei.\"\n\n\"Show some pity for Christ's sake, pity a sick man, an old man,\" &c., he\ncares not, ride on: pretend sickness, inevitable loss of limbs, goods,\nplead suretyship, or shipwreck, fires, common calamities, show thy wants\nand imperfections,\n\n       \"Et si per sanctum juratus dicat Osyrim,\n        Credite, non ludo, crudeles tollite claudum.\"\n\nSwear, protest, take God and all his angels to witness, _quaere\nperegrinum_, thou art a counterfeit crank, a cheater, he is not touched\nwith it, _pauper ubique jacet_, ride on, he takes no notice of it. Put up a\nsupplication to him in the name of a thousand orphans, a hospital, a\nspittle, a prison, as he goes by, they cry out to him for aid, ride on,\n_surdo narras_, he cares not, let them eat stones, devour themselves with\nvermin, rot in their own dung, he cares not. Show him a decayed haven, a\nbridge, a school, a fortification, etc., or some public work, ride on; good\nyour worship, your honour, for God's sake, your country's sake, ride on.\nBut show him a roll wherein his name shall be registered in golden letters,\nand commended to all posterity, his arms set up, with his devices to be\nseen, then peradventure he will stay and contribute; or if thou canst\nthunder upon him, as Papists do, with satisfactory and meritorious works,\nor persuade him by this means he shall save his soul out of hell, and free\nit from purgatory (if he be of any religion), then in all likelihood he\nwill listen and stay; or that he have no children, no near kinsman, heir,\nhe cares for, at least, or cannot well tell otherwise how or where to\nbestow his possessions (for carry them with him he cannot), it may be then\nhe will build some school or hospital in his life, or be induced to give\nliberally to pious uses after his death. For I dare boldly say, vainglory,\nthat opinion of merit, and this enforced necessity, when they know not\notherwise how to leave, or what better to do with them, is the main cause\nof most of our good works. I will not urge this to derogate from any man's\ncharitable devotion, or bounty in this kind, to censure any good work; no\ndoubt there be many sanctified, heroical, and worthy-minded men, that in\ntrue zeal, and for virtue's sake (divine spirits), that out of\ncommiseration and pity extend their liberality, and as much as in them lies\ndo good to all men, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, comfort the sick and\nneedy, relieve all, forget and forgive injuries, as true charity requires;\nyet most part there is _simulatum quid_, a deal of hypocrisy in this kind,\nmuch default and defect. [4614]Cosmo de Medici, that rich citizen of\nFlorence, ingeniously confessed to a near friend of his, that would know of\nhim why he built so many public and magnificent palaces, and bestowed so\nliberally on scholars, not that he loved learning more than others, \"but to\n[4615]eternise his own name, to be immortal by the benefit of scholars; for\nwhen his friends were dead, walls decayed, and all inscriptions gone, books\nwould remain to the world's end.\" The lantern in [4616]Athens was built by\nZenocles, the theatre by Pericles, the famous port Pyraeum by Musicles,\nPallas Palladium by Phidias, the Pantheon by Callicratidas; but these brave\nmonuments are decayed all, and ruined long since, their builders' names\nalone flourish by meditation of writers. And as [4617]he said of that\nMarian oak, now cut down and dead, _nullius Agricolae manu vulta stirps tam\ndiuturna, quam quae poetae, versu seminari potest_, no plant can grow so\nlong as that which is _ingenio sata_, set and manured by those ever-living\nwits. [4618]Allon Backuth, that weeping oak, under which Deborah, Rebecca's\nnurse, died, and was buried, may not survive the memory of such everlasting\nmonuments. Vainglory and emulation (as to most men) was the cause\nefficient, and to be a trumpeter of his own fame, Cosmo's sole intent so to\ndo good, that all the world might take notice of it. Such for the most part\nis the charity of our times, such our benefactors, Mecaenates and patrons.\nShow me amongst so many myriads, a truly devout, a right, honest, upright,\nmeek, humble, a patient, innocuous, innocent, a merciful, a loving, a\ncharitable man! [4619]_Probus quis nobiscum vivit_? Show me a Caleb or a\nJoshua! _Dic mihi Musa virum_--show a virtuous woman, a constant wife, a\ngood neighbour, a trusty servant, an obedient child, a true friend, &c.\nCrows in Africa are not so scant. He that shall examine this [4620]iron age\nwherein we live, where love is cold, _et jam terras Astrea reliquit_,\njustice fled with her assistants, virtue expelled,\n\n[4621]  ------\"Justitiae soror,\n        Incorrupta fides, nudaque veritas,\"------\n\nall goodness gone, where vice abounds, the devil is loose, and see one man\nvilify and insult over his brother, as if he were an innocent, or a block,\noppress, tyrannise, prey upon, torture him, vex, gall, torment and crucify\nhim, starve him, where is charity? He that shall see men [4622]swear and\nforswear, lie and bear false witness, to advantage themselves, prejudice\nothers, hazard goods, lives, fortunes, credit, all, to be revenged on their\nenemies, men so unspeakable in their lusts, unnatural in malice, such\nbloody designments, Italian blaspheming, Spanish renouncing, &c., may well\nask where is charity? He that shall observe so many lawsuits, such endless\ncontentions, such plotting, undermining, so much money spent with such\neagerness and fury, every man for himself, his own ends, the devil for all:\nso many distressed souls, such lamentable complaints, so many factions,\nconspiracies, seditions, oppressions, abuses, injuries, such grudging,\nrepining, discontent, so much emulation, envy, so many brawls, quarrels,\nmonomachies, &c., may well require what is become of charity? when we see\nand read of such cruel wars, tumults, uproars, bloody battles, so many\n[4623]men slain, so many cities ruinated, &c. (for what else is the subject\nof all our stones almost, but bills, bows, and guns!) so many murders and\nmassacres, &c., where is charity? Or see men wholly devote to God,\nchurchmen, professed divines, holy men, [4624]\"to make the trumpet of the\ngospel the trumpet of war,\" a company of hell-born Jesuits, and\nfiery-spirited friars, _facem praeferre_ to all seditions: as so many\nfirebrands set all the world by the ears (I say nothing of their\ncontentious and railing books, whole ages spent in writing one against\nanother, and that with such virulency and bitterness, _Bionaeis sermonibus\net sale nigro_), and by their bloody inquisitions, that in thirty years,\nBale saith, consumed 39 princes, 148 earls, 235 barons, 14,755 commons;\nworse than those ten persecutions, may justly doubt where is charity?\n_Obsecro vos quales hi demum Christiani!_ Are these Christians? I beseech\nyou tell me: he that shall observe and see these things, may say to them as\nCato to Caesar, _credo quae de inferis dicuntur falsa existimas_, \"sure I\nthink thou art of opinion there is neither heaven nor hell.\" Let them\npretend religion, zeal, make what shows they will, give alms, peace-makers,\nfrequent sermons, if we may guess at the tree by the fruit, they are no\nbetter than hypocrites, epicures, atheists, with the [4625]\"fool in their\nhearts they say there is no God.\" 'Tis no marvel then if being so\nuncharitable, hard-hearted as we are, we have so frequent and so many\ndiscontents, such melancholy fits, so many bitter pangs, mutual discords,\nall in a combustion, often complaints, so common grievances, general\nmischiefs, _si tantae in terris tragoediae, quibus labefactatur et misere\nlaceratur humanum genus_, so many pestilences, wars, uproars, losses,\ndeluges, fires, inundations, God's vengeance and all the plagues of Egypt,\ncome upon us, since we are so currish one towards another, so respectless\nof God, and our neighbours, and by our crying sins pull these miseries upon\nour own heads. Nay more, 'tis justly to be feared, which [4626]Josephus\nonce said of his countrymen Jews, \"if the Romans had not come when they did\nto sack their city, surely it had been swallowed up with some earthquake,\ndeluge, or fired from heaven as Sodom and Gomorrah: their desperate malice,\nwickedness and peevishness was such.\" 'Tis to be suspected, if we continue\nthese wretched ways, we may look for the like heavy visitations to come\nupon us. If we had any sense or feeling of these things, surely we should\nnot go on as we do, in such irregular courses, practise all manner of\nimpieties; our whole carriage would not be so averse from God. If a man\nwould but consider, when he is in the midst and full career of such\nprodigious and uncharitable actions, how displeasing they are in God's\nsight, how noxious to himself, as Solomon told Joab, 1 Kings, ii. \"The Lord\nshall bring this blood upon their heads.\" Prov. i. 27, \"sudden desolation\nand destruction shall come like a whirlwind upon them: affliction, anguish,\nthe reward of his hand shall be given him,\" Isa. iii. 11, &c., \"they shall\nfall into the pit they have digged for others,\" and when they are scraping,\ntyrannising, getting, wallowing in their wealth, \"this night, O fool, I\nwill take away thy soul,\" what a severe account they must make; and how\n[4627]gracious on the other side a charitable man is in God's eyes, _haurit\nsibi gratiam_. Matt. v. 7, \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain\nmercy: he that lendeth to the poor, gives to God,\" and how it shall be\nrestored to them again; \"how by their patience and long-suffering they\nshall heap coals on their enemies' heads,\" Rom. xii. \"and he that followeth\nafter righteousness and mercy, shall find righteousness and glory;\" surely\nthey would check their desires, curb in their unnatural, inordinate\naffections, agree amongst themselves, abstain from doing evil, amend their\nlives, and learn to do well. \"Behold how comely and good a thing it is for\nbrethren to live together in [4628]union: it is like the precious ointment,\n&c. How odious to contend one with the other!\" [4629] _Miseriquid\nluctatiunculis hisce volumus? ecce mors supra caput est, et supremum illud\ntribunal, ubi et dicta et facta nostra examinanda sunt: Sapiamus!_ \"Why do\nwe contend and vex one another? behold death is over our heads, and we must\nshortly give an account of all our uncharitable words and actions: think\nupon it: and be wise.\"\n\n\nSECT. II. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Heroical love causeth Melancholy. His Pedigree, Power, and\nExtent_.\n\nIn the preceding section mention was made, amongst other pleasant objects,\nof this comeliness and beauty which proceeds from women, that causeth\nheroical, or love-melancholy, is more eminent above the rest, and properly\ncalled love. The part affected in men is the liver, and therefore called\nheroical, because commonly gallants. Noblemen, and the most generous\nspirits are possessed with it. His power and extent is very large, [4630]\nand in that twofold division of love, [Greek: philein] and [Greek: eran]\n[4631]those two veneries which Plato and some other make mention of it is\nmost eminent, and [Greek: kat' exochaen] called Venus, as I have said, or\nlove itself. Which although it be denominated from men, and most evident in\nthem, yet it extends and shows itself in vegetal and sensible creatures,\nthose incorporeal substances (as shall be specified), and hath a large\ndominion of sovereignty over them. His pedigree is very ancient, derived\nfrom the beginning of the world, as [4632]Phaedrus contends, and his [4633]\nparentage of such antiquity, that no poet could ever find it out. Hesiod\nmakes [4634]Terra and Chaos to be Love's parents, before the Gods were\nborn: _Ante deos omnes primum generavit amorem_. Some think it is the\nself-same fire Prometheus fetched from heaven. Plutarch _amator. libello_,\nwill have Love to be the son of Iris and Favonius; but Socrates in that\npleasant dialogue of Plato, when it came to his turn to speak of love, (of\nwhich subject Agatho the rhetorician, _magniloquus_ Agatho, that chanter\nAgatho, had newly given occasion) in a poetical strain, telleth this tale:\nwhen Venus was born, all the gods were invited to a banquet, and amongst\nthe rest, [4635]Porus the god of bounty and wealth; Penia or Poverty came a\nbegging to the door; Porus well whittled with nectar (for there was no wine\nin those days) walking in Jupiter's garden, in a bower met with Penia, and\nin his drink got her with child, of whom was born Love; and because he was\nbegotten on Venus's birthday, Venus still attends upon him. The moral of\nthis is in [4636]Ficinus. Another tale is there borrowed out of\nAristophanes: [4637]in the beginning of the world, men had four arms and\nfour feet, but for their pride, because they compared themselves with the\ngods, were parted into halves, and now peradventure by love they hope to be\nunited again and made one. Otherwise thus, [4638]Vulcan met two lovers, and\nbid them ask what they would and they should have it; but they made answer,\n_O Vulcane faber Deorum_, &c. \"O Vulcan the gods' great smith, we beseech\nthee to work us anew in thy furnace, and of two make us one; which he\npresently did, and ever since true lovers are either all one, or else\ndesire to be united.\" Many such tales you shall find in Leon Hebreus,\n_dial. 3._ and their moral to them. The reason why Love was still painted\nyoung, (as Phornutus [4639]and others will) [4640]\"is because young men are\nmost apt to love; soft, fair, and fat, because such folks are soonest\ntaken: naked, because all true affection is simple and open: he smiles,\nbecause merry and given to delights: hath a quiver, to show his power, none\ncan escape: is blind, because he sees not where he strikes, whom he hits,\n&c.\" His power and sovereignty is expressed by the [4641]poets, in that he\nis held to be a god, and a great commanding god, above Jupiter himself;\nMagnus Daemon, as Plato calls him, the strongest and merriest of all the\ngods according to Alcinous and [4642]Athenaeus. _Amor virorum rex, amor rex\net deum_, as Euripides, the god of gods and governor of men; for we must\nall do homage to him, keep a holiday for his deity, adore in his temples,\nworship his image, (_numen enim hoc non est nudum nomen_) and sacrifice to\nhis altar, that conquers all, and rules all:\n\n[4643] \"Mallem cum icone, cervo et apro Aeolico,\n        Cum Anteo et Stymphalicis avibus luctari\n        Quam cum amore\"------\n\n\"I had rather contend with bulls, lions, bears, and giants, than with\nLove;\" he is so powerful, enforceth [4644]all to pay tribute to him,\ndomineers over all, and can make mad and sober whom he list; insomuch that\nCaecilius in Tully's Tusculans, holds him to be no better than a fool or an\nidiot, that doth not acknowledge Love to be a great god.\n\n[4645] \"Cui in manu sit quem esse dementem velit,\n        Quem sapere, quam in morbum injici,\" &c.\n\nThat can make sick, and cure whom he list. Homer and Stesichorus were both\nmade blind, if you will believe [4646]Leon Hebreus, for speaking against\nhis godhead: and though Aristophanes degrade him, and say that he was\n[4647]scornfully rejected from the council of the gods, had his wings\nclipped besides, that he might come no more amongst them, and to his\nfarther disgrace banished heaven for ever, and confined to dwell on earth,\nyet he is of that [4648]power, majesty, omnipotency, and dominion, that no\ncreature can withstand him.\n\n[4649] \"Imperat Cupido etiam diis pro arbitrio,\n        Et ipsum arcere ne armipotens potest Jupiter.\"\n\nHe is more than quarter-master with the gods,\n\n[4650]  ------\"Tenet\n        Thetide aequor, umbras Aeaco, coelum Jove:\"\n\nand hath not so much possession as dominion. Jupiter himself was turned\ninto a satyr, shepherd, a bull, a swan, a golden shower, and what not, for\nlove; that as [4651]Lucian's Juno right well objected to him, _ludus amoris\ntu es_, thou art Cupid's whirligig: how did he insult over all the other\ngods, Mars, Neptune, Pan, Mercury, Bacchus, and the rest? [4652] Lucian\nbrings in Jupiter complaining of Cupid that he could not be quiet for him;\nand the moon lamenting that she was so impotently besotted on Endymion,\neven Venus herself confessing as much, how rudely and in what sort her own\nson Cupid had used her being his [4653]mother, \"now drawing her to Mount\nIda, for the love of that Trojan Anchises, now to Libanus for that Assyrian\nyouth's sake. And although she threatened to break his bow and arrows, to\nclip his wings, [4654]and whipped him besides on the bare buttocks with her\npantofle, yet all would not serve, he was too headstrong and unruly.\" That\nmonster-conquering Hercules was tamed by him:\n\n       \"Quem non mille ferae, quem non Sthenelejus hostis,\n        Nec potuit Juno vincere, vicit amor.\"\n\n       \"Whom neither beasts nor enemies could tame,\n        Nor Juno's might subdue, Love quell'd the same.\"\n\nYour bravest soldiers and most generous spirits are enervated with it,\n[4655]_ubi mulieribus blanditiis permittunt se, et inquinantur amplexibus_.\nApollo, that took upon him to cure all diseases, [4656]could not help\nhimself of this; and therefore [4657]Socrates calls Love a tyrant, and\nbrings him triumphing in a chariot, whom Petrarch imitates in his triumph\nof Love, and Fracastorius, in an elegant poem expresseth at large, Cupid\nriding, Mars and Apollo following his chariot, Psyche weeping, &c.\n\nIn vegetal creatures what sovereignty love hath, by many pregnant proofs\nand familiar examples may be proved, especially of palm-trees, which are\nboth he and she, and express not a sympathy but a love-passion, and by many\nobservations have been confirmed.\n\n[4658] \"Vivunt in venerem frondes, omnisque vicissim\n        Felix arbor amat, nutant et mutua palmae\n        Foedera, populeo suspirat populus ictu,\n        Et platano platanus, alnoque assibilat alnus.\"\n\nConstantine _de Agric. lib. 10. cap. 4._ gives an instance out of\nFlorentius his Georgics, of a palm-tree that loved most fervently, [4659]\n\"and would not be comforted until such time her love applied herself unto\nher; you might see the two trees bend, and of their own accords stretch out\ntheir boughs to embrace and kiss each other: they will give manifest signs\nof mutual love.\" Ammianus Marcellinus, _lib. 24_, reports that they marry\none another, and fall in love if they grow in sight; and when the wind\nbrings the smell to them, they are marvellously affected. Philostratus _in\nImaginibus_, observes as much, and Galen _lib. 6. de locis affectis, cap.\n5._ they will be sick for love; ready to die and pine away, which the\nhusbandmen perceiving, saith [4660]Constantine, \"stroke many palms that\ngrow together, and so stroking again the palm that is enamoured, they carry\nkisses from the one to the other:\" or tying the leaves and branches of the\none to the stem of the other, will make them both flourish and prosper a\ngreat deal better: [4661]\"which are enamoured, they can perceive by the\nbending of boughs, and inclination of their bodies.\" If any man think this\nwhich I say to be a tale, let him read that story of two palm-trees in\nItaly, the male growing at Brundusium, the female at Otranto (related by\nJovianus Pontanus in an excellent poem, sometimes tutor to Alphonsus\njunior, King of Naples, his secretary of state, and a great philosopher)\n\"which were barren, and so continued a long time,\" till they came to see\none another growing up higher, though many stadiums asunder. Pierius in his\nHieroglyphics, and Melchior Guilandinus, _Mem. 3. tract. de papyro_, cites\nthis story of Pontanus for a truth. See more in Salmuth _Comment. in\nPancirol. de Nova repert. Tit. 1. de novo orbe_ Mizaldus Arcanorum _lib.\n2._ Sand's Voyages, _lib. 2. fol. 103._ &c.\n\nIf such fury be in vegetals, what shall we think of sensible creatures, how\nmuch more violent and apparent shall it be in them!\n\n[4662] \"Omne adeo genus in terris hominumque ferarum,\n        Et genus aequoreum, pecudes, pictaeque volucres\n        In furias ignemque ruunt; amor omnibus idem.\"\n\n       \"All kind of creatures in the earth,\n          And fishes of the sea,\n        And painted birds do rage alike;\n          This love bears equal sway.\"\n\n[4663] \"Hic Deus et terras et maria alta domat.\"\n\nCommon experience and our sense will inform us how violently brute beasts\nare carried away with this passion, horses above the rest,--_furor est\ninsignis equarum_. [4664]\"Cupid in Lucian bids Venus his mother be of good\ncheer, for he was now familiar with lions, and oftentimes did get on their\nbacks, hold them by the mane, and ride them about like horses, and they\nwould fawn upon him with their tails.\" Bulls, bears, and boars are so\nfurious in this kind they kill one another: but especially cocks, [4665]\nlions, and harts, which are so fierce that you may hear them fight half a\nmile off, saith [4666]Turberville, and many times kill each other, or\ncompel them to abandon the rut, that they may remain masters in their\nplaces; \"and when one hath driven his co-rival away, he raiseth his nose up\ninto the air, and looks aloft, as though he gave thanks to nature,\" which\naffords him such great delight. How birds are affected in this kind,\nappears out of Aristotle, he will have them to sing _ob futuram venerem_\nfor joy or in hope of their venery which is to come.\n\n[4667] \"Aeeriae primum volucres te Diva tuumque\n        significant initum, perculsae corda tua vi.\"\n\n\"Fishes pine away for love and wax lean,\" if [4668]Gomesius's authority may\nbe taken, and are rampant too, some of them: Peter Gellius, _lib. 10. de\nhist, animal._ tells wonders of a triton in Epirus: there was a well not\nfar from the shore, where the country wenches fetched water, they,\n[4669]tritons, _stupri causa_ would set upon them and carry them to the\nsea, and there drown them, if they would not yield; so love tyranniseth in\ndumb creatures. Yet this is natural for one beast to dote upon another of\nthe same kind; but what strange fury is that, when a beast shall dote upon\na man? Saxo Grammaticus, _lib. 10. Dan. hist._ hath a story of a bear that\nloved a woman, kept her in his den a long time and begot a son of her, out\nof whose loins proceeded many northern kings: this is the original belike\nof that common tale of Valentine and Orson: Aelian, Pliny, Peter Gillius,\nare full of such relations. A peacock in Lucadia loved a maid, and when she\ndied, the peacock pined. [4670]\"A dolphin loved a boy called Hernias, and\nwhen he died, the fish came on land, and so perished.\" The like adds\nGellius, _lib. 10. cap. 22._ out of Appion, _Aegypt. lib. 15._ a dolphin at\nPuteoli loved a child, would come often to him, let him get on his back,\nand carry him about, [4671]\"and when by sickness the child was taken away,\nthe dolphin died.\" [4672]\"Every book is full\" (saith Busbequius, the\nemperor's orator with the Grand Signior, not long since, _ep. 3. legat.\nTurc._), \"and yields such instances, to believe which I was always afraid\nlest I should be thought to give credit to fables, until I saw a lynx which\nI had from Assyria, so affected towards one of my men, that it cannot be\ndenied but that he was in love with him. When my man was present, the beast\nwould use many notable enticements and pleasant motions, and when he was\ngoing, hold him back, and look after him when he was gone, very sad in his\nabsence, but most jocund when he returned: and when my man went from me,\nthe beast expressed his love with continual sickness, and after he had\npined away some few days, died.\" Such another story he hath of a crane of\nMajorca, that loved a Spaniard, that would walk any way with him, and in\nhis absence seek about for him, make a noise that he might hear her, and\nknock at his door, [4673]\"and when he took his last farewell, famished\nherself.\" Such pretty pranks can love play with birds, fishes, beasts:\n\n        ([4674]Coelestis aestheris, ponti, terrae claves habet Venus,\n        Solaque istorum omnium imperium obtinet.)\n\nand if all be certain that is credibly reported, with the spirits of the\nair, and devils of hell themselves, who are as much enamoured and dote (if\nI may use that word) as any other creatures whatsoever. For if those\nstories be true that are written of incubus and succubus, of nymphs,\nlascivious fauns, satyrs, and those heathen gods which were devils, those\nlascivious Telchines, of whom the Platonists tell so many fables; or those\nfamiliar meetings in our days, and company of witches and devils, there is\nsome probability for it. I know that Biarmannus, Wierus, _lib. 1. cap. 19.\net 24._ and some others stoutly deny it, that the devil hath any carnal\ncopulation with women, that the devil takes no pleasure in such facts, they\nbe mere fantasies, all such relations of incubi, succubi, lies and tales;\nbut Austin, _lib. 15. de civit. Dei_. doth acknowledge it: Erastus _de\nLamiis_, Jacobus Sprenger and his colleagues, &c. [4675] Zanchius, _cap.\n16. lib. 4. de oper. Dei_. Dandinus, _in Arist. de Anima, lib. 2. text. 29.\ncom. 30._ Bodin, _lib. 2. cap. 7._ and Paracelsus, a great champion of this\ntenet amongst the rest, which give sundry peculiar instances, by many\ntestimonies, proofs, and confessions evince it. Hector Boethius, in his\nScottish history, hath three or four such examples, which Cardan confirms\nout of him, _lib. 16. cap. 43._ of such as have had familiar company many\nyears with them, and that in the habit of men and women Philostratus in his\nfourth book _de vita Apollonii_, hath a memorable instance in this kind,\nwhich I may not omit, of one Menippus Lycius, a young man twenty-five years\nof age, that going between Cenchreas and Corinth, met such a phantasm in\nthe habit of a fair gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand, carried him\nhome to her house in the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a\nPhoenician by birth, and if he would tarry with her, [4676]\"he should hear\nher sing and play, and drink such wine as never any drank, and no man\nshould molest him; but she being fair and lovely would live and die with\nhim, that was fair and lovely to behold.\" The young man a philosopher,\notherwise staid and discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not\nthis of love, tarried with her awhile to his great content, and at last\nmarried her, to whose wedding, amongst other guests, came Apollonius, who,\nby some probable conjectures, found her out to be a serpent, a lamia, and\nthat all her furniture was like Tantalus's gold described by Homer, no\nsubstance, but mere illusions. When she saw herself descried, she wept, and\ndesired Apollonius to be silent, but he would not be moved, and thereupon\nshe, plate, house, and all that was in it, vanished in an instant:\n[4677]\"many thousands took notice of this fact, for it was done in the\nmidst of Greece.\" Sabine in his Comment on the tenth of Ovid's\nMetamorphoses, at the tale of Orpheus, telleth us of a gentleman of\nBavaria, that for many months together bewailed the loss of his dear wife;\nat length the devil in her habit came and comforted him, and told him,\nbecause he was so importunate for her, that she would come and live with\nhim again, on that condition he would be new married, never swear and\nblaspheme as he used formerly to do; for if he did, she should be gone:\n[4678]\"he vowed it, married, and lived with her, she brought him children,\nand governed his house, but was still pale and sad, and so continued, till\none day falling out with him, he fell a swearing; she vanished thereupon,\nand was never after seen.\" [4679]\"This I have heard,\" saith Sabine, \"from\npersons of good credit, which told me that the Duke of Bavaria did tell it\nfor a certainty to the Duke of Saxony.\" One more I will relate out of\nFlorilegus, _ad annum_ 1058, an honest historian of our nation, because he\ntelleth it so confidently, as a thing in those days talked of all over\nEurope: a young gentleman of Rome, the same day that he was married, after\ndinner with the bride and his friends went a walking into the fields, and\ntowards evening to the tennis-court to recreate himself; whilst he played,\nhe put his ring upon the finger of _Venus statua_, which was thereby made\nin brass; after he had sufficiently played, and now made an end of his\nsport, he came to fetch his ring, but Venus had bowed her finger in, and he\ncould not get it off. Whereupon loath to make his company tarry at present,\nthere left it, intending to fetch it the next day, or at some more\nconvenient time, went thence to supper, and so to bed. In the night, when\nhe should come to perform those nuptial rites, Venus steps between him and\nhis wife (unseen or felt of her), and told her that she was his wife, that\nhe had betrothed himself unto her by that ring, which he put upon her\nfinger: she troubled him for some following nights. He not knowing how to\nhelp himself, made his moan to one Palumbus, a learned magician in those\ndays, who gave him a letter, and bid him at such a time of the night, in\nsuch a cross-way, at the town's end, where old Saturn would pass by with\nhis associates in procession, as commonly he did, deliver that script with\nhis own hands to Saturn himself; the young man of a bold spirit,\naccordingly did it; and when the old fiend had read it, he called Venus to\nhim, who rode before him, and commanded her to deliver his ring, which\nforthwith she did, and so the gentleman was freed. Many such stories I find\nin several [4680]authors to confirm this which I have said; as that more\nnotable amongst the rest, of Philinium and Machates in [4681]Phlegon's\nTract, _de rebus mirabilibus_, and though many be against it, yet I, for my\npart, will subscribe to Lactantius, _lib. 14. cap. 15._ [4682]\"God sent\nangels to the tuition of men; but whilst they lived amongst us, that\nmischievous all-commander of the earth, and hot in lust, enticed them by\nlittle and little to this vice, and defiled them with the company of\nwomen:\" and to Anaxagoras, _de resurrect_. [4683]\"Many of those spiritual\nbodies, overcome by the love of maids, and lust, failed, of whom those were\nborn we call giants.\" Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Sulpicius\nSeverus, Eusebius, etc., to this sense make a twofold fall of angels, one\nfrom the beginning of the world, another a little before the deluge, as\nMoses teacheth us, [4684]openly professing that these genii can beget, and\nhave carnal copulation with women. At Japan in the East Indies, at this\npresent (if we may believe the relation of [4685]travellers), there is an\nidol called Teuchedy, to whom one of the fairest virgins in the country is\nmonthly brought, and left in a private room, in the fotoqui, or church,\nwhere she sits alone to be deflowered. At certain times [4686]the Teuchedy\n(which is thought to be the devil) appears to her, and knoweth her\ncarnally. Every month a fair virgin is taken in; but what becomes of the\nold, no man can tell. In that goodly temple of Jupiter Belus in Babylon,\nthere was a fair chapel, [4687]saith Herodotus, an eyewitness of it, in\nwhich was _splendide stratus lectus et apposita mensa aurea_, a brave bed,\na table of gold, &c., into which no creature came but one only woman, which\ntheir god made choice of, as the Chaldean priests told him, and that their\ngod lay with her himself, as at Thebes in Egypt was the like done of old.\nSo that you see this is no news, the devils themselves, or their juggling\npriests, have played such pranks in all ages. Many divines stiffly\ncontradict this; but I will conclude with [4688]Lipsius, that since\n\"examples, testimonies, and confessions, of those unhappy women are so\nmanifest on the other side, and many even in this our town of Louvain, that\nit is likely to be so. [4689]One thing I will add, that I suppose that in\nno age past, I know not by what destiny of this unhappy time, have there\never appeared or showed themselves so many lecherous devils, satyrs, and\ngenii, as in this of ours, as appears by the daily narrations, and judicial\nsentences upon record.\" Read more of this question in Plutarch, _vit.\nNumae_, Austin _de civ.

[4690]_Improbe\namor quid non mortalia pectora cogis_? How it tickles the hearts of mortal\nmen, _Horresco referens_,--I am almost afraid to relate, amazed, [4691]and\nashamed, it hath wrought such stupendous and prodigious effects, such foul\noffences. Love indeed (I may not deny) first united provinces, built\ncities, and by a perpetual generation makes and preserves mankind,\npropagates the church; but if it rage it is no more love, but burning lust,\na disease, frenzy, madness, hell. [4692]_Est orcus ille, vis est\nimmedicabilis, est rabies insana_; 'tis no virtuous habit this, but a\nvehement perturbation of the mind, a monster of nature, wit, and art, as\nAlexis in [4693]Athenaeus sets it out, _viriliter audax, muliebriter\ntimidium, furore praeceps, labore infractum, mel felleum, blanda\npercussio_, &c. It subverts kingdoms, overthrows cities, towns, families,\nmars, corrupts, and makes a massacre of men; thunder and lightning, wars,\nfires, plagues, have not done that mischief to mankind, as this burning\nlust, this brutish passion. Let Sodom and Gomorrah, Troy, (which Dares\nPhrygius, and Dictis Cretensis will make good) and I know not how many\ncities bear record,--_et fuit ante Helenam_, &c., all succeeding ages will\nsubscribe: Joanna of Naples in Italy, Fredegunde and Brunhalt in France,\nall histories are full of these basilisks. Besides those daily monomachies,\nmurders, effusion of blood, rapes, riot, and immoderate expense, to satisfy\ntheir lusts, beggary, shame, loss, torture, punishment, disgrace, loathsome\ndiseases that proceed from thence, worse than calentures and pestilent\nfevers, those often gouts, pox, arthritis, palsies, cramps, sciatica,\nconvulsions, aches, combustions, &c., which torment the body, that feral\nmelancholy which crucifies the soul in this life, and everlastingly\ntorments in the world to come.\n\nNotwithstanding they know these and many such miseries, threats, tortures,\nwill surely come upon them, rewards, exhortations, _e contra_; yet either\nout of their own weakness, a depraved nature, or love's tyranny, which so\nfuriously rageth, they suffer themselves to be led like an ox to the\nslaughter: (_Facilis descensus Averni_) they go down headlong to their own\nperdition, they will commit folly with beasts, men \"leaving the natural use\nof women,\" as [4694]Paul saith, \"burned in lust one towards another, and\nman with man wrought filthiness.\"\n\nSemiramis equo, Pasiphae tauro, Aristo Ephesius asinae se commiscuit,\nFulvius equae, alii canibus, capris, &c., unde monstra nascuntur aliquando,\nCentauri, Sylvani, et ad terrorem hominum prodigiosa spectra: Nec cum\nbrutis, sed ipsis hominibus rem habent, quod peccatum Sodomiae vulgo\ndicitur; et frequens olim vitium apud Orientalis illos fuit, Graecos\nnimirum, Italos, Afros, Asianos: [4695]Hercules Hylam habuit, Polycletum,\nDionem, Perithoonta, Abderum et Phryga; alii et Euristium ab Hercule amatum\ntradunt.

Caesaris legatus, referente Plinio, _lib. 35. cap. 3._ quem\nsuspicor eum esse qui Christum crucifixit, picturis Atalantae et Helenae\nadeo libidine incensus, ut tollere eas vellet si natura tectorii\npermisisset, alius statuam bonae Fortunae deperiit (Aelianus, _lib. 9. cap.\n37._) alius bonae deae, et ne qua pars probro vacet. [4707]\"Raptus ad\nstupra\" (quod ait ille) \"et ne [4708]os quidem a libidine exceptum.\"\nHeliogabalus, per omnia cava corporis libidinem recepit, Lamprid. vita\nejus. [4709]Hostius quidam specula fecit, et ita disposuit, ut quum virum\nipse pateretur, aversus omnes admissarii motus in speculo videret, ac\ndeinde falsa magnitudine ipsius membri tanquam vera gauderet, simul virum\net foeminam passus, quod dictu foedum et abominandum. Ut veram plane sit,\nquod apud [4710]Plutarchum Gryllus Ulyssi objecit. \"Ad hunc usque diem apud\nnos neque mas marem, neque foemina foeminam amavit, qualia multa apud vos\nmemorabiles et praeclari viri fecerunt: ut viles missos faciam, Hercules\nimberbem sectans socium, amicos deseruit, &c. Vestrae libidines intra suos\nnaturae fines coerceri non possunt, quin instar fluvii exundantis atrocem\nfoeditatum, tumultum, confusionemque naturae gignant in re Venerea: nam et\ncapras, porcos, equos inierunt viri et foeminae, insano bestiarum amore\nexarserunt, imde Minotauri, Centauri, Sylvani, Sphinges\", &c. Sed ne\nconfutando doceam, aut ea foras efferam, quae, non omnes scire convenit\n(haec enim doctis solummodo, quod causa non absimili [4711]Rodericus,\nscripta velim) ne levissomis ingentis et depravatis mentibus foedissimi\nsceleris notitiam, &c., nolo quem diutius hisce sordibus inquinare.\n\nI come at last to that heroical love which is proper to men and women, is a\nfrequent cause of melancholy, and deserves much rather to be called burning\nlust, than by such an honourable title. There is an honest love, I confess,\nwhich is natural, laqueus occultus captivans corda hominum, ut a mulieribus\nnon possint separari, \"a secret snare to captivate the hearts of men,\" as\n[4712]Christopher Fonseca proves, a strong allurement, of a most\nattractive, occult, adamantine property, and powerful virtue, and no man\nliving can avoid it. [4713]_Et qui vim non sensit amoris, aut lapis est,\naut bellua_. He is not a man but a block, a very stone, _aut [4714]Numen,\naut Nebuchadnezzar_, he hath a gourd for his head, a pepon for his heart,\nthat hath not felt the power of it, and a rare creature to be found, one in\nan age, _Qui nunquam visae flagravit amore puellae_; [4715]for _semel\ninsanivimus omnes_, dote we either young or old, as [4716]he said, and none\nare excepted but Minerva and the Muses: so Cupid in [4717]Lucian complains\nto his mother Venus, that amongst all the rest his arrows could not pierce\nthem. But this nuptial love is a common passion, an honest, for men to love\nin the way of marriage; _ut materia appetit formam, sic mulier virum._\n[4718]You know marriage is honourable, a blessed calling, appointed by God\nhimself in Paradise; it breeds true peace, tranquillity, content, and\nhappiness, _qua nulla est aut fuit unquam sanctior conjunctio_, as\nDaphnaeus in [4719]Plutarch could well prove, _et quae generi humano\nimmortalitatem parat_, when they live without jarring, scolding, lovingly\nas they should do.\n\n[4720] \"Felices ter et amplius\n          Quos irrupta tenet copula, nec ullis\n        Divulsus querimoniis\n          Suprema citius solvit amor die.\"\n\n       \"Thrice happy they, and more than that,\n          Whom bond of love so firmly ties,\n        That without brawls till death them part,\n          'Tis undissolv'd and never dies.\"\n\nAs Seneca lived with his Paulina, Abraham and Sarah, Orpheus and Eurydice,\nArria and Poetus, Artemisia and Mausolus, Rubenius Celer, that would needs\nhave it engraven on his tomb, he had led his life with Ennea, his dear\nwife, forty-three years eight months, and never fell out. There is no\npleasure in this world comparable to it, 'tis _summum mortalitatis bonum--\n[4721]hominum divumque voluptas, Alma Venus--latet enim in muliere aliquid\nmajus potentiusque, omnibus aliis humanis voluptatibus_, as [4722]one\nholds, there's something in a woman beyond all human delight; a magnetic\nvirtue, a charming quality, an occult and powerful motive. The husband\nrules her as head, but she again commands his heart, he is her servant, she\nis only joy and content: no happiness is like unto it, no love so great as\nthis of man and wife, no such comfort as [4723]_placens uxor_, a sweet\nwife: [4724]_Omnis amor magnus, sed aperto in conjuge major_. When they\nlove at last as fresh as they did at first, [4725]_Charaque charo\nconsenescit conjugi_, as Homer brings Paris kissing Helen, after they had\nbeen married ten years, protesting withal that he loved her as dear as he\ndid the first hour that he was betrothed. And in their old age, when they\nmake much of one another, saying, as he did to his wife in the poet,\n\n[4726] \"Uxor vivamus quod viximus, et moriamur,\n          Servantes nomen sumpsimus in thalamo;\n        Nec ferat ulla dies ut commutemur in aevo,\n          Quin tibi sim juvenis, tuque puella mihi.\"\n\n       \"Dear wife, let's live in love, and die together,\n          As hitherto we have in all good will:\n        Let no day change or alter our affections.\n          But let's be young to one another still.\"\n\nSuch should conjugal love be, still the same, and as they are one flesh, so\nshould they be of one mind, as in an aristocratical government, one\nconsent, [4727]Geyron-like, _coalescere in unum_, have one heart in two\nbodies, will and nill the same. A good wife, according to Plutarch, should\nbe as a looking-glass to represent her husband's face and passion: if he be\npleasant, she should be merry: if he laugh, she should smile: if he look\nsad, she should participate of his sorrow, and bear a part with him, and so\nshould they continue in mutual love one towards another.\n\n[4728] \"Et me ab amore tuo deducet nulla senectus,\n        Sive ego Tythonus, sive ego Nestor ero.\"\n\n       \"No age shall part my love from thee, sweet wife,\n        Though I live Nestor or Tithonus' life.\"\n\nAnd she again to him, as the [4729]Bride saluted the Bridegroom of old in\nRome, _Ubi tu Caius, ego semper Caia_, be thou still Caius, I'll be Caia.\n\n'Tis a happy state this indeed, when the fountain is blessed (saith\nSolomon, Prov. v. 17.) \"and he rejoiceth with the wife of his youth, and\nshe is to him as the loving hind and pleasant roe, and he delights in her\ncontinually.\" But this love of ours is immoderate, inordinate, and not to\nbe comprehended in any bounds. It will not contain itself within the union\nof marriage, or apply to one object, but is a wandering, extravagant, a\ndomineering, a boundless, an irrefragable, a destructive passion: sometimes\nthis burning lust rageth after marriage, and then it is properly called\njealousy; sometimes before, and then it is called heroical melancholy; it\nextends sometimes to co-rivals, &c., begets rapes, incests, murders:\n_Marcus Antonius compressit Faustinam sororem, Caracalla Juliam Novercam,\nNero Matrem, Caligula sorores, Cyneras Myrrham filiam_, &c. But it is\nconfined within no terms of blood, years, sex, or whatsoever else. Some\nfuriously rage before they come to discretion, or age. [4730]Quartilla in\nPetronius never remembered she was a maid; and the wife of Bath, in\nChaucer, cracks,\n\n       _Since I was twelve years old, believe,\n        Husbands at Kirk-door had I five_.\n\n[4731]Aratine Lucretia sold her maidenhead a thousand times before she was\ntwenty-four years old, _plus milies vendiderant virginitatem, &c. neque te\ncelabo, non deerant qui ut integram ambirent_. Rahab, that harlot, began to\nbe a professed quean at ten years of age, and was but fifteen when she hid\nthe spies, as [4732]Hugh Broughton proves, to whom Serrarius the Jesuit,\n_quaest. 6. in cap. 2. Josue_, subscribes. Generally women begin\n_pubescere_, as they call it, or _catullire_, as Julius Pollux cites, _lib.\n2. cap. 3. onomast_ out of Aristophanes, [4733]at fourteen years old, then\nthey do offer themselves, and some plainly rage. [4734]Leo Afer saith, that\nin Africa a man shall scarce find a maid at fourteen years of age, they are\nso forward, and many amongst us after they come into the teens do not live\nwithout husbands, but linger. What pranks in this kind the middle ages have\nplayed is not to be recorded. _Si mihi sint centum linguae, sint oraque\ncentum_, no tongue can sufficiently declare, every story is full of men and\nwomen's insatiable lust, Nero's, Heliogabali, Bonosi, &c. [4735] _Coelius\nAmphilenum, sed Quintius Amphelinam depereunt_, &c. They neigh after other\nmen's wives (as Jeremia, _cap. v. 8._ complaineth) like fed horses, or\nrange like town bulls, _raptores virginum et viduarum_, as many of our\ngreat ones do. Solomon's wisdom was extinguished in this fire of lust,\nSamson's strength enervated, piety in Lot's daughters quite forgot, gravity\nof priesthood in Eli's sons, reverend old age in the Elders that would\nviolate Susanna, filial duty in Absalom to his stepmother, brotherly love\nin Ammon. towards his sister. Human, divine laws, precepts, exhortations,\nfear of God and men, fair, foul means, fame, fortune, shame, disgrace,\nhonour cannot oppose, stave off, or withstand the fury of it, _omnia vincit\namor_, &c. No cord nor cable can so forcibly draw, or hold so fast, as love\ncan do with, a twined thread. The scorching beams under the equinoctial, or\nextremity of cold within the circle arctic, where the very seas are frozen,\ncold or torrid zone, cannot avoid or expel this heat, fury, and rage of\nmortal men.\n\n[4736] \"Quo fugis ab demens, nulla est fuga, tu licet usque\n        Ad Tanaim fugias, usque sequetur amor.\"\n\nOf women's unnatural, [4737]insatiable lust, what country, what village\ndoth not complain? Mother and daughter sometimes dote on the same man,\nfather and son, master and servant, on one woman.\n\n[4738] \"--Sed amor, sed ineffrenata libido,\n        Quid castum in terris intentatumque reliquit?\"\n\nWhat breach of vows and oaths, fury, dotage, madness, might I reckon up?\nYet this is more tolerable in youth, and such as are still in their hot\nblood; but for an old fool to dote, to see an old lecher, what more odious,\nwhat can be more absurd? and yet what so common? Who so furious?[4739]\n_Amare ea aetate si occiperint, multo insaniunt acrius_. Some dote then\nmore than ever they did in their youth. How many decrepit, hoary, harsh,\nwrithen, bursten-bellied, crooked, toothless, bald, blear-eyed, impotent,\nrotten, old men shall you see flickering still in every place? One gets him\na young wife, another a courtesan, and when he can scarce lift his leg over\na sill, and hath one foot already in Charon's boat, when he hath the\ntrembling in his joints, the gout in his feet, a perpetual rheum in his\nhead, \"a continuate cough,\" [4740]his sight fails him, thick of hearing,\nhis breath stinks, all his moisture is dried up and gone, may not spit from\nhim, a very child again, that cannot dress himself, or cut his own meat,\nyet he will be dreaming of, and honing after wenches, what can be more\nunseemly? Worse it is in women than in men, when she is _aetate declivis,\ndiu vidua, mater olim, parum decore matrimonium sequi videtur_, an old\nwidow, a mother so long since ([4741]in Pliny's opinion), she doth very\nunseemly seek to marry, yet whilst she is [4742]so old a crone, a beldam,\nshe can neither see, nor hear, go nor stand, a mere [4743]carcass, a witch,\nand scarce feel; she caterwauls, and must have a stallion, a champion, she\nmust and will marry again, and betroth herself to some young man,\n[4744]that hates to look on, but for her goods; abhors the sight of her, to\nthe prejudice of her good name, her own undoing, grief of friends, and ruin\nof her children.\n\nBut to enlarge or illustrate this power and effects of love, is to set a\ncandle in the sun. [4745]It rageth with all sorts and conditions of men,\nyet is most evident among such as are young and lusty, in the flower of\ntheir years, nobly descended, high fed, such as live idly, and at ease; and\nfor that cause (which our divines call burning lust) this [4746]_ferinus\ninsanus amor_, this mad and beastly passion, as I have said, is named by\nour physicians heroical love, and a more honourable title put upon it,\n_Amor nobilis_, as [4747]Savanarola styles it, because noble men and women\nmake a common practice of it, and are so ordinarily affected with it.\nAvicenna, _lib. 3. Fen, 1. tract. 4. cap. 23._ calleth this passion\n_Ilishi_, and defines it [4748]\"to be a disease or melancholy vexation, or\nanguish of mind, in which a man continually meditates of the beauty,\ngesture, manners of his mistress, and troubles himself about it:\" desiring,\n(as Savanarola adds) with all intentions and eagerness of mind, \"to compass\nor enjoy her, [4749]as commonly hunters trouble themselves about their\nsports, the covetous about their gold and goods, so is he tormented still\nabout his mistress.\" Arnoldus Villanovanus, in his book of heroical love,\ndefines it, [4750]\"a continual cogitation of that which he desires, with a\nconfidence or hope of compassing it;\" which definition his commentator\ncavils at. For continual cogitation is not the genus but a symptom of love;\nwe continually think of that which we hate and abhor, as well as that which\nwe love; and many things we covet and desire, without all hope of\nattaining. Carolus a Lorme, in his Questions, makes a doubt, _An amor sit\nmorbus_, whether this heroical love be a disease: Julius Pollux _Onomast.\nlib. 6. cap. 44._ determines it. They that are in love are likewise\n[4751]sick; _lascivus, salax, lasciviens, et qui in venerem furit, vere est\naegrotus_, Arnoldus will have it improperly so called, and a malady rather\nof the body than mind. Tully, in his _Tusculans_, defines it a furious\ndisease of the mind. Plato, madness itself. Ficinus, his Commentator, _cap.\n12._ a species of madness, \"for many have run mad for women,\" Esdr. iv. 26.\nBut [4752]Rhasis \"a melancholy passion:\" and most physicians make it a\nspecies or kind of melancholy (as will appear by the symptoms), and treat\nof it apart; whom I mean to imitate, and to discuss it in all his kinds, to\nexamine his several causes, to show his symptoms, indications, prognostics,\neffect, that so it may be with more facility cured.\n\nThe part affected in the meantime, as [4753]Arnoldus supposeth, \"is the\nformer part of the head for want of moisture,\" which his Commentator\nrejects. Langius, _med. epist. lib. 1. cap. 24._ will have this passion\nseated in the liver, and to keep residence in the heart, [4754]\"to proceed\nfirst from the eyes so carried by our spirits, and kindled with imagination\nin the liver and heart;\" _coget amare jecur_, as the saying is. _Medium\nferet per epar_, as Cupid in Anacreon. For some such cause belike [4755]\nHomer feigns Titius' liver (who was enamoured of Latona) to be still gnawed\nby two vultures day and night in hell, [4756]\"for that young men's bowels\nthus enamoured, are so continually tormented by love.\" Gordonius, _cap. 2.\npart. 2._ [4757]\"will have the testicles an immediate subject or cause, the\nliver an antecedent.\" Fracastorius agrees in this with Gordonius, _inde\nprimitus imaginatio venerea, erectio, &c. titillatissimam partem vocat, ita\nut nisi extruso semine gestiens voluptas non cessat, nec assidua veneris\nrecordatio, addit Gnastivinius_ _Comment. 4. Sect. prob. 27. Arist._ But\n[4758]properly it is a passion of the brain, as all other melancholy, by\nreason of corrupt imagination, and so doth Jason Pratensis, _c. 19. de\nmorb. cerebri_ (who writes copiously of this erotical love), place and\nreckon it amongst the affections of the brain. [4759]Melancthon _de anima_\nconfutes those that make the liver a part affected, and Guianerius, _Tract.\n15. cap. 13 et 17._ though many put all the affections in the heart, refers\nit to the brain. Ficinus, _cap. 7. in Convivium Platonis_, \"will have the\nblood to be the part affected.\" Jo. Frietagius, _cap. 14. noct. med._\nsupposeth all four affected, heart, liver, brain, blood; but the major part\nconcur upon the brain, [4760]'tis _imaginatio laesa_; and both imagination\nand reason are misaffected;, because of his corrupt judgment, and continual\nmeditation of that which he desires, he may truly be said to be melancholy.\nIf it be violent, or his disease inveterate, as I have determined in the\nprecedent partitions, both imagination and reason are misaffected, first\none, then the other.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Causes of Heroical Love, Temperature, full Diet, Idleness,\nPlace, Climate, &c._\n\nOf all causes the remotest are stars. [4761]Ficinus _cap. 19._ saith they\nare most prone to this burning lust, that have Venus in Leo in their\nhoroscope, when the Moon and Venus be mutually aspected, or such as be of\nVenus' complexion. [4762]Plutarch interprets astrologically that tale of\nMars and Venus, \"in whose genitures [Symbol: Mars] and [Symbol: Mars] are\nin conjunction,\" they are commonly lascivious, and if women queans; as the\ngood wife of Bath confessed in Chaucer;\n\n       _I followed aye mine inclination,\n        By virtue of my constellation_.\n\nBut of all those astrological aphorisms which I have ever read, that of\nCardan is most memorable, for which howsoever he is bitterly censured by\n[4763]Marinus Marcennus, a malapert friar, and some others (which [4764] he\nhimself suspected) yet methinks it is free, downright, plain and ingenious.\nIn his [4765]eighth _Geniture_, or example, he hath these words of himself,\n[Symbol: Mars] [Symbol: Mars] and [Symbol: Mercury] in [Symbol: Mercury]\n_dignitatibus assiduam mihi Venereorum cogitationem praestabunt, ita ut\nnunquam quiescam._ Et paulo post, _Cogitatio Venereorum me torquet\nperpetuo, et quam facto implere non licuit, aut fecisse potentem puduit,\ncogitatione assidua mentitus sum voluptatem_. Et alibi, _ob [Symbol:\nMoon-3/4] et [Symbol: Mercury] dominium et radiorum mixtionem, profundum\nfuit ingenium, sed lascivum, egoque turpi libidini deditus et obscaenus._\nSo far Cardan of himself, _quod de se fatetur ideo [4766]ut utilitatem\nadferat studiosis hujusce disciplinae_, and for this he is traduced by\nMarcennus, when as in effect he saith no more than what Gregory Nazianzen\nof old, to Chilo his scholar, _offerebant se mihi visendae mulieres, quarum\npraecellenti elegantia et decore spectabili tentabatur meae. integritas\npudicitiae. Et quidem flagitium vitavi fornicationis, at munditiae\nvirginalis florem arcana cordis cogitatione foedavi. Sed ad rem._ Aptiores\nad masculinam venerem sunt quorum genesi Venus est in signo masculino, et\nin Saturni finibus aut oppositione, &c. Ptolomeus _in quadripart._ plura de\nhis et specialia habet aphorismata, longo proculdubio usu confirmata, et ab\nexperientia multa perfecta, inquit commentator ejus Cardanus. Tho.\nCampanella _Astrologiae lib. 4. cap. 8. articulis 4 and 5._ insaniam\namatoriam remonstrantia, multa prae caeteris accumulat aphorismata, quae\nqui volet, consulat. Chiromantici ex cingulo Veneris plerumque conjecturam\nfaciunt, et monte Veneris, de quorum decretis, Taisnerum, Johan. de\nIndagine, Goclenium, ceterosque si lubet, inspicias. Physicians divine\nwholly from the temperature and complexion; phlegmatic persons are seldom\ntaken, according to Ficinus _Comment, cap. 9_; naturally melancholy less\nthan they, but once taken they are never freed; though many are of opinion\nflatuous or hypochondriacal melancholy are most subject of all others to\nthis infirmity. Valescus assigns their strong imagination for a cause,\nBodine abundance of wind, Gordonius of seed, and spirits, or atomi in the\nseed, which cause their violent and furious passions. Sanguine thence are\nsoon caught, young folks most apt to love, and by their good wills, saith\n[4767]Lucian, \"would have a bout with every one they see:\" the colt's evil\nis common to all complexions. Theomestus a young and lusty gallant\nacknowledgeth (in the said author) all this to be verified in him, \"I am so\namorously given, [4768]you may sooner number the sea-sands, and snow\nfalling from the skies, than my several loves. Cupid had shot all his\narrows at me, I am deluded with various desires, one love succeeds another,\nand that so soon, that before one is ended, I begin with a second; she that\nis last is still fairest, and she that is present pleaseth me most: as an\nhydra's head my loves increase, no Iolaus can help me. Mine eyes are so\nmoist a refuge and sanctuary of love, that they draw all beauties to them,\nand are never satisfied. I am in a doubt what fury of Venus this should be:\nalas, how have I offended her so to vex me, what Hippolitus am I!\" What\nTelchine is my genius? or is it a natural imperfection, an hereditary\npassion? Another in [4769]Anacreon confesseth that he had twenty\nsweethearts in Athens at once, fifteen at Corinth, as many at Thebes, at\nLesbos, and at Rhodes, twice as many in Ionia, thrice in Caria, twenty\nthousand in all: or in a word, [Greek: ei phulla, panta], &c.\n\n       \"Folia arborum omnium si\n        Nosti referre cuncta,\n        Aut computare arenas\n        In aequore universas,\n        Solum meorum amorum\n        Te fecero logistam?\"\n\n       \"Canst count the leaves in May,\n        Or sands i' th' ocean sea?\n        Then count my loves I pray.\"\n\nHis eyes are like a balance, apt to propend each way, and to be weighed\ndown with every wench's looks, his heart a weathercock, his affection\ntinder, or naphtha itself, which every fair object, sweet smile, or\nmistress's favour sets on fire. Guianerius _tract 15. cap. 14._ refers all\nthis [4770]to \"the hot temperature of the testicles,\" Ferandus a Frenchman\nin his _Erotique Mel._ (which [4771]book came first to my hands after the\nthird edition) to certain atomi in the seed, \"such as are very spermatic\nand full of seed.\" I find the same in Aristot. _sect. 4. prob. 17._ _si non\nsecernatur semen, cessare tentigines non possunt_, as Gaustavinius his\ncommentator translates it: for which cause these young men that be strong\nset, of able bodies, are so subject to it. Hercules de Saxonia hath the\nsame words in effect. But most part I say, such as are aptest to love that\nare young and lusty, live at ease, stall-fed, free from cares, like cattle\nin a rank pasture, idle and solitary persons, they must needs\n_hirquitullire_, as Guastavinius recites out of Censorinus.\n\n[4772] \"Mens erit apta capi tum quum laetissima rerum.\n        Ut seges in pingui luxuriabit humo.\"\n\n       \"The mind is apt to lust, and hot or cold,\n        As corn luxuriates in a better mould.\"\n\nThe place itself makes much wherein we live, the clime, air, and discipline\nif they concur. In our Misnia, saith Galen, near to Pergamus, thou shalt\nscarce find an adulterer, but many at Rome, by reason of the delights of\nthe seat. It was that plenty of all things, which made [4773]Corinth so\ninfamous of old, and the opportunity of the place to entertain those\nforeign comers; every day strangers came in, at each gate, from all\nquarters. In that one temple of Venus a thousand whores did prostitute\nthemselves, as Strabo writes, besides Lais and the rest of better note: all\nnations resorted thither, as to a school of Venus. Your hot and southern\ncountries are prone to lust, and far more incontinent than those that live\nin the north, as Bodine discourseth at large, _Method, hist. cap. 5._\n_Molles Asiatici_, so are Turks, Greeks, Spaniards, Italians, even all that\nlatitude; and in those tracts, such as are more fruitful, plentiful, and\ndelicious, as Valence in Spain, Capua in Italy, _domicilium luxus_ Tully\nterms it, and (which Hannibal's soldiers can witness) Canopus in Egypt,\nSybaris, Phoeacia, Baiae, [4774]Cyprus, Lampsacus. In [4775]Naples the\nfruit of the soil and pleasant air enervate their bodies, and alter\nconstitutions: insomuch that Florus calls it _Certamen Bacchi et Veneris_,\nbut [4776]Foliot admires it. In Italy and Spain they have their stews in\nevery great city, as in Rome, Venice, Florence, wherein, some say, dwell\nninety thousand inhabitants, of which ten thousand are courtesans; and yet\nfor all this, every gentleman almost hath a peculiar mistress;\nfornications, adulteries, are nowhere so common: _urbs est jam tota\nlupanar_; how should a man live honest amongst so many provocations? now if\nvigour of youth, greatness, liberty I mean, and that impunity of sin which\ngrandees take unto themselves in this kind shall meet, what a gap must it\nneeds open to all manner of vice, with what fury will it rage? For, as\nMaximus Tyrius the Platonist observes, _libido consequuta quum fuerit\nmateriam improbam et praeruptam licentiam, et effrenatam audaciam_, &c.,\nwhat will not lust effect in such persons? For commonly princes and great\nmen make no scruple at all of such matters, but with that whore in\nSpartian, _quicquid libet licet_, they think they may do what they list,\nprofess it publicly, and rather brag with Proculus (that writ to a friend\nof his in Rome, [4777]what famous exploits he had done in that kind) than\nany way be abashed at it. [4778]Nicholas Sanders relates of Henry VIII. (I\nknow not how truly) _Quod paucas vidit pulchriores quas non concupierit, et\npaucissimas non concupierit quas non violarit_, \"He saw very few maids that\nhe did not desire, and desired fewer whom he did not enjoy:\" nothing so\nfamiliar amongst them, 'tis most of their business: Sardanapalus,\nMessalina, and Joan of Naples, are not comparable to [4779]meaner men and\nwomen; Solomon of old had a thousand concubines; Ahasuerus his eunuchs and\nkeepers; Nero his Tigillinus panders, and bawds; the Turks, [4780]\nMuscovites, Mogors, Xeriffs of Barbary, and Persian Sophies, are no whit\ninferior to them in our times. _Delectus fit omnium puellarum toto regno\nforma praestantiorum_ (saith Jovius) _pro imperatore; et quas ille linquit,\nnobiles habent_; they press and muster up wenches as we do soldiers, and\nhave their choice of the rarest beauties their countries can afford, and\nyet all this cannot keep them from adultery, incest, sodomy, buggery, and\nsuch prodigious lusts. We may conclude, that if they be young, fortunate,\nrich, high-fed, and idle withal, it is almost impossible that they should\nlive honest, not rage, and precipitate themselves into these inconveniences\nof burning lust.\n\n[4781] \"Otium et reges prius et beatas\n                Perdidit urbes.\"\n\nIdleness overthrows all, _Vacuo pectore regnat amor_, love tyranniseth in\nan idle person. _Amore abundas Antiphio_. If thou hast nothing to do,[4782]\n_Invidia vel amore miser torquebere_--Thou shalt be haled in pieces with\nenvy, lust, some passion or other. _Homines nihil agendo male agere\ndiscunt_; 'tis Aristotle's simile, [4783]\"as match or touchwood takes fire,\nso doth an idle person love.\" _Quaeritur Aegistus quare sit factus\nadulter_, &c., why was Aegistus a whoremaster? You need not ask a reason of\nit. Ismenedora stole Baccho, a woman forced a man, as [4784]Aurora did\nCephalus: no marvel, saith [4785]Plutarch, _Luxurians opibus more hominum\nmulier agit_: she was rich, fortunate and jolly, and doth but as men do in\nthat case, as Jupiter did by Europa, Neptune by Amymone. The poets\ntherefore did well to feign all shepherds lovers, to give themselves to\nsongs and dalliances, because they lived such idle lives. For love, as\n[4786]Theophrastus defines it, is _otiosi animi affectus_, an affection of\nan idle mind, or as [4787]Seneca describes it, _Juventa gignitur, juxu\nnutritur, feriis alitur, otioque inter laeta fortunae bonae_; youth begets\nit, riot maintains it, idleness nourisheth it, &c. which makes [4788]\nGordonius the physician _cap. 20. part. 2._ call this disease the proper\npassion of nobility. Now if a weak judgment and a strong apprehension do\nconcur, how, saith Hercules de Saxonia, shall they resist? Savanarola\nappropriates it almost to [4789]\"monks, friars, and religious persons,\nbecause they live solitarily, fair daintily, and do nothing:\" and well he\nmay, for how should they otherwise choose?\n\nDiet alone is able to cause it: a rare thing to see a young man or a woman\nthat lives idly and fares well, of what condition soever, not to be in\nlove. [4790]Alcibiades was still dallying with wanton young women,\nimmoderate in his expenses, effeminate in his apparel, ever in love, but\nwhy? he was over-delicate in his diet, too frequent and excessive in\nbanquets, _Ubicunque securitas, ibi libido dominatur_; lust and security\ndomineer together, as St. Hierome averreth. All which the wife of Bath in\nChaucer freely justifies,\n\n       _For all to sicker, as cold engendreth hail,\n        A liquorish tongue must have a liquorish tail_.\n\nEspecially if they shall further it by choice diet, as many times those\nSybarites and Phaeaces do, feed liberally, and by their good will eat\nnothing else but lascivious meats. [4791]Vinum imprimis generosum, legumen,\nfabas, radices omnium generum bene conditas, et largo pipere aspersas,\ncarduos hortulanos, lactucas, [4792]erucas, rapas, porros, caepas, nucem\npiceam, amygdalas dulces, electuaria, syrupos, succos, cochleas, conchas,\npisces optime praeparatos, aviculas, testiculos animalium, ova, condimenta\ndiversorum generum, molles lectos, pulvinaria, &c. Et quicquid fere medici\nimpotentia rei venereae laboranti praescribunt, hoc quasi diasatyrion\nhabent in delitiis, et his dapes multo delicatiores; mulsum, exquisitas et\nexoticas fruges, aromata, placentas, expressos succos multis ferculis\nvariatos, ipsumque vinum suavitate vincentes, et quicquid culina,\npharmacopaea, aut quaeque fere officina subministrare possit. Et hoc\nplerumque victu quum se ganeones infarciant, [4793]ut ille ob Chreseida\nsuam, se bulbis et cochleis curavit; etiam ad Venerem se parent, et ad hanc\npalestram se exerceant, qui fieri possit, ut non misere depereant, [4794]ut\nnon penitus insaniant? _Aestuans venter cito despuit in libidinem_,\nHieronymus ait. [4795]_Post prandia, Callyroenda_. Quis enim continere se\npotest? [4796]_Luxuriosa res vinum_, fomentum libidinis vocat Augustinus,\nblandum daemonem, Bernardus; lac veneris, Aristophanes. _Non Aetna, non\nVesuvius tantis ardoribus aestuant, ac juveniles medullae vino plenae_,\naddit [4797]Hieronymus: unde ob optimum vinum Lamsacus olim Priapo sacer:\net venerandi Bacchi socia apud [4798] Orpheum Venus audit. Haec si vinum\nsimplex, et per se sumptum praestare possit, nam--[4799]_quo me Bacche\nrapis tui plenum_? quam non insaniam, quem non furorem a caeteris\nexpectemus? [4800]Gomesius salem enumerat inter ea quae intempstivam\nlibidinem provocare solent, _et salatiores fieri foeminas ob esum salis\ncontendit: Venerem ideo dicunt ab Oceano ortam_.\n\n[4801] \"Unde tot in Veneta scortorum millia cur stint?\n        In promptu causa est, est Venus orta mari.\"\n\n_Et hinc foeta mater Salacea Oceani conjux_, verbumque fortasse salax a\nsale effluxit. Mala Bacchica tantum olim in amoribus praevaluerunt, ut\ncoronae ex illis statuae Bacchi ponerentur. [4802]Cubebis in vino maceratis\nutuntur Indi Orientales ad Venerem excitandum, et [4803]Surax radice\nAfricani. Chinae radix eosdem effectus habet, talisque herbae meminit _mag.\nnat. lib. 2. cap. 16_. [4804]Baptista Porta ex India allatae, cujus\nmentionem facit et Theophrastus. Sed infinita his similia apud Rhasin,\nMatthiolum, Mizaldum, caeterosque medicos occurrunt, quorum ideo mentionem\nfeci, ne quis imperitior in hos scopulas impingat, sed pro virili tanquam\nsyrtes et cautes consulto effugiat.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Other causes of Love-Melancholy, Sight, Being from the Face,\nEyes, other parts, and how it pierceth_.\n\nMany such causes may be reckoned up, but they cannot avail, except\nopportunity be offered of time, place, and those other beautiful objects,\nor artificial enticements, as kissing, conference, discourse, gestures\nconcur, with such like lascivious provocations. Kornmannus, in his book _de\nlinea amoris_, makes five degrees of lust, out of [4805]Lucian belike,\nwhich he handles in five chapters, _Visus, Colloquium, Convictus, Oscula,\nTactus_. [4806]Sight, of all other, is the first step of this unruly love,\nthough sometime it be prevented by relation or hearing, or rather incensed.\nFor there be those so apt, credulous, and facile to love, that if they hear\nof a proper man, or woman, they are in love before they see them, and that\nmerely by relation, as Achilles Tatius observes. [4807]\"Such is their\nintemperance and lust, that they are as much maimed by report, as if they\nsaw them. Callisthenes a rich young gentleman of Byzance in Thrace, hearing\nof [4808]Leucippe, Sostratus' fair daughter, was far in love with her, and,\nout of fame and common rumour, so much incensed, that he would needs have\nher to be his wife.\" And sometimes by reading they are so affected, as he\nin [4809]Lucian confesseth of himself, \"I never read that place of Panthea\nin Xenophon, but I am as much affected as if I were present with her.\" Such\npersons commonly [4810]feign a kind of beauty to themselves; and so did\nthose three gentlewomen in [4811]Balthazar Castilio fall in love with a\nyoung man whom they never knew, but only heard him commended: or by reading\nof a letter; for there is a grace cometh from hearing, [4812] as a moral\nphilosopher informeth us, \"as well from sight; and the species of love are\nreceived into the fantasy by relation alone:\" [4813]_ut cupere ab aspectu,\nsic velle ab auditu_, both senses affect. _Interdum et absentes amamus_,\nsometimes we love those that are absent, saith Philostratus, and gives\ninstance in his friend Athenodorus, that loved a maid at Corinth whom he\nnever saw; _non oculi sed mens videt_, we see with the eyes of our\nunderstanding.\n\nBut the most familiar and usual cause of love is that which comes by sight,\nwhich conveys those admirable rays of beauty and pleasing graces to the\nheart. Plotinus derives love from sight, [Greek: eros] quasi [Greek:\nhorasis]. [4814]_Si nescis, oculi sunt in amore duces_, \"the eyes are the\nharbingers of love,\" and the first step of love is sight, as [4815]Lilius\nGiraldus proves at large, _hist. deor. syntag. 13._ they as two sluices let\nin the influences of that divine, powerful, soul-ravishing, and captivating\nbeauty, which, as [4816]one saith, \"is sharper than any dart or needle,\nwounds deeper into the heart; and opens a gap through our eyes to that\nlovely wound, which pierceth the soul itself\" (Ecclus. 18.) Through it love\nis kindled like a fire. This amazing, confounding, admirable, amiable\nbeauty, [4817]\"than which in all nature's treasure (saith Isocrates) there\nis nothing so majestical and sacred, nothing so divine, lovely, precious,\"\n'tis nature's crown, gold and glory; _bonum si non summum, de summis tamen\nnon infrequenter triumphans_, whose power hence may be discerned; we\ncontemn and abhor generally such things as are foul and ugly to behold,\naccount them filthy, but love and covet that which is fair. 'Tis [4818]\nbeauty in all things which pleaseth and allureth us, a fair hawk, a fine\ngarment, a goodly building, a fair house, &c. That Persian Xerxes when he\ndestroyed all those temples of the gods in Greece, caused that of Diana,\n_in integrum servari_, to be spared alone for that excellent beauty and\nmagnificence of it. Inanimate beauty can so command. 'Tis that which\npainters, artificers, orators, all aim at, as Eriximachus the physician, in\nPlato contends, [4819]\"It was beauty first that ministered occasion to art,\nto find out the knowledge of carving, painting, building, to find out\nmodels, perspectives, rich furnitures, and so many rare inventions.\"\nWhiteness in the lily, red in the rose, purple in the violet, a lustre in\nall things without life, the clear light of the moon, the bright beams of\nthe sun, splendour of gold, purple, sparkling diamond, the excellent\nfeature of the horse, the majesty of the lion, the colour of birds,\npeacock's tails, the silver scales of fish, we behold with singular delight\nand admiration. [4820]\"And which is rich in plants, delightful in flowers,\nwonderful in beasts, but most glorious in men,\" doth make us affect and\nearnestly desire it, as when we hear any sweet harmony, an eloquent tongue,\nsee any excellent quality, curious work of man, elaborate art, or aught\nthat is exquisite, there ariseth instantly in us a longing for the same. We\nlove such men, but most part for comeliness of person, we call them gods\nand goddesses, divine, serene, happy, &c. And of all mortal men they alone\n([4821]Calcagninus holds) are free from calumny; _qui divitiis, magistratu\net gloria florent, injuria lacessimus_, we backbite, wrong, hate renowned,\nrich, and happy men, we repine at their felicity, they are undeserving we\nthink, fortune is a stepmother to us, a parent to them. \"We envy\" (saith\n[4822]Isocrates) \"wise, just, honest men, except with mutual offices and\nkindnesses, some good turn or other, they extort this love from us; only\nfair persons we love at first sight, desire their acquaintance, and adore\nthem as so many gods: we had rather serve them than command others, and\naccount ourselves the more beholding to them, the more service they enjoin\nus:\" though they be otherwise vicious, dishonest, we love them, favour\nthem, and are ready to do them any good office for their [4823]beauty's\nsake, though they have no other good quality beside. _Dic igitur o fomose,\nadolescens_ (as that eloquent Phavorinus breaks out in [4824]Stobeus) _dic\nAutiloque, suavius nectare loqueris; dic o Telemache, vehementius Ulysse\ndicis; dic Alcibiades utcunque ebrius, libentius tibi licet ebrio\nauscultabimus_. \"Speak, fair youth, speak Autiloquus, thy words are sweeter\nthan nectar, speak O Telemachus, thou art more powerful than Ulysses, speak\nAlcibiades though drunk, we will willingly hear thee as thou art.\" Faults\nin such are no faults: for when the said Alcibiades had stolen Anytus his\ngold and silver plate, he was so far from prosecuting so foul a fact\n(though every man else condemned his impudence and insolency) that he\nwished it had been more, and much better (he loved him dearly) for his\nsweet sake. \"No worth is eminent in such lovely persons, all imperfections\nhid;\" _non enim facile de his quos plurimum diligimus, turpitudinem\nsuspicamur_, for hearing, sight, touch, &c., our mind and all our senses\nare captivated, _omnes sensus formosus delectat_. Many men have been\npreferred for their person alone, chosen kings, as amongst the Indians,\nPersians, Ethiopians of old; the properest man of person the country could\nafford, was elected their sovereign lord; _Gratior est pulchro veniens e\ncorpore virtus_, [4825]and so have many other nations thought and done, as\n[4826]Curtius observes: _Ingens enim in corporis majestate veneratio est_,\n\"for there is a majestical presence in such men;\" and so far was beauty\nadored amongst them, that no man was thought fit to reign, that was not in\nall parts complete and supereminent. Agis, king of Lacedaemon, had like to\nhave been deposed, because he married a little wife, they would not have\ntheir royal issue degenerate. Who would ever have thought that Adrian' the\nFourth, an English monk's bastard (as [4827]Papirius Massovius writes in\nhis life), _inops a suis relectus, squalidus et miser_, a poor forsaken\nchild, should ever come to be pope of Rome? But why was it? _Erat acri\ningenio, facundia expedita eleganti corpore, facieque laeta ac hilari_, (as\nhe follows it out of [4828]Nubrigensis, for he ploughs with his heifer,)\n\"he was wise, learned, eloquent, of a pleasant, a promising countenance, a\ngoodly, proper man; he had, in a word, a winning look of his own,\" and that\ncarried it, for that he was especially advanced. So \"Saul was a goodly\nperson and a fair.\" Maximinus elected emperor, &c. Branchus the son of\nApollo, whom he begot of Jance, Succron's daughter (saith Lactantius), when\nhe kept King Admetus' herds in Thessaly, now grown a man, was an earnest\nsuitor to his mother to know his father; the nymph denied him, because\nApollo had conjured her to the contrary; yet overcome by his importunity at\nlast she sent him to his father; when he came into Apollo's presence,\n_malas Dei reverenter osculatus_, he carried himself so well, and was so\nfair a young man, that Apollo was infinitely taken with the beauty of his\nperson, he could scarce look off him, and said he was worthy of such\nparents, gave him a crown of gold, the spirit of divination, and in\nconclusion made him a demigod. _O vis superba formae_, a goddess beauty is,\nwhom the very gods adore, _nam pulchros dii amant_; she is _Amoris domina_,\nlove's harbinger, love's loadstone, a witch, a charm, &c. Beauty is a dower\nof itself, a sufficient patrimony, an ample commendation, an accurate\nepistle, as [4829]Lucian, [4830]Apuleius, Tiraquellus, and some others\nconclude. _Imperio digna forma_, beauty deserves a kingdom, saith\nAbulensis, _paradox. 2. cap. 110._ immortality; and [4831]\"more have got\nthis honour and eternity for their beauty, than for all other virtues\nbesides:\" and such as are fair, \"are worthy to be honoured of God and men.\"\nThat Idalian Ganymede was therefore fetched by Jupiter into heaven,\nHephaestion dear to Alexander, Antinous to Adrian. Plato calls beauty for\nthat cause a privilege of nature, _Naturae gaudentis opus_, nature's\nmasterpiece, a dumb comment; Theophrastus, a silent fraud; still rhetoric\nCarneades, that persuades without speech, a kingdom without a guard,\nbecause beautiful persons command as so many captains; Socrates, a tyranny,\n\"which tyranniseth over tyrants themselves;\" which made Diogenes belike\ncall proper women queens, _quod facerent homines quae praeciperent_,\nbecause men were so obedient to their commands. They will adore, cringe,\ncompliment, and bow to a common wench (if she be fair) as if she were a\nnoble woman, a countess, a queen, or a goddess. Those intemperate young men\nof Greece erected at Delphos a golden image with infinite cost, to the\neternal memory of Phryne the courtesan, as Aelian relates, for she was a\nmost beautiful woman, insomuch, saith [4832]Athenaeus, that Apelles and\nPraxiteles drew Venus's picture from her. Thus young men will adore and\nhonour beauty; nay kings themselves I say will do it, and voluntarily\nsubmit their sovereignty to a lovely woman. \"Wine is strong, kings are\nstrong, but a woman strongest,\" 1 Esd. iv. 10. as Zerobabel proved at large\nto King Darius, his princes and noblemen. \"Kings sit still and command sea\nand land, &c., all pay tribute to the king; but women make kings pay\ntribute, and have dominion over them. When they have got gold and silver,\nthey submit all to a beautiful woman, give themselves wholly to her, gape\nand gaze on her, and all men desire her more than gold or silver, or any\nprecious thing: they will leave father and mother, and venture their lives\nfor her, labour and travel to get, and bring all their gains to women,\nsteal, fight, and spoil for their mistress's sake. And no king so strong,\nbut a fair woman is stronger than he is. All things\" (as [4833]he proceeds)\n\"fear to touch the king; yet I saw him and Apame his concubine, the\ndaughter of the famous Bartacus, sitting on the right hand of the king, and\nshe took the crown off his head, and put it on her own, and stroke him with\nher left hand; yet the king gaped and gazed on her, and when she laughed he\nlaughed, and when she was angry he flattered to be reconciled to her.\" So\nbeauty commands even kings themselves; nay whole armies and kingdoms are\ncaptivated together with their kings: [4834]_Forma vincit armatos, ferrum\npulchritudo captivat; vincentur specie, qui non vincentur proelio_. And\n'tis a great matter saith [4835]Xenophon, \"and of which all fair persons\nmay worthily brag, that a strong man must labour for his living if he will\nhave aught, a valiant man must fight and endanger himself for it, a wise\nman speak, show himself, and toil; but a fair and beautiful person doth all\nwith ease, he compasseth his desire without any pains-taking:\" God and men,\nheaven and earth conspire to honour him; every one pities him above other,\nif he be in need, [4836]and all the world is willing to do him good.\n[4837]Chariclea fell into the hand of pirates, but when all the rest were\nput to the edge of the sword, she alone was preserved for her person.\n[4838]When Constantinople was sacked by the Turk, Irene escaped, and was so\nfar from being made a captive, that she even captivated the Grand Signior\nhimself. So did Rosamond insult over King Henry the Second.\n\n[4839]  ------\"I was so fair an object;\n        Whom fortune made my king, my love made subject;\n        He found by proof the privilege of beauty,\n        That it had power to countermand all duty.\"\n\nIt captivates the very gods themselves, _Morosiora numina_,\n\n[4840]  ------\"Deus ipse deorum\n        Factus ob hanc formam bos, equus imber olor.\"\n\nAnd those _mali genii_ are taken with it, as [4841]I have already proved.\n_Formosam Barbari verentur, et ad spectum pulchrum immanis animus\nmansuescit_. (Heliodor. _lib. 5._) The barbarians stand in awe of a fair\nwoman, and at a beautiful aspect a fierce spirit is pacified. For when as\nTroy was taken, and the wars ended (as Clemens [4842]Alexandrinus quotes\nout of Euripides) angry Menelaus with rage and fury armed, came with his\nsword drawn, to have killed Helen, with his own hands, as being the sole\ncause of all those wars and miseries: but when he saw her fair face, as one\namazed at her divine beauty, he let his weapon fall, and embraced her\nbesides, he had no power to strike so sweet a creature. _Ergo habetantur\nenses pulchritudine_, the edge of a sharp sword (as the saying is) is\ndulled with a beautiful aspect, and severity itself is overcome. Hiperides\nthe orator, when Phryne his client was accused at Athens for her lewdness,\nused no other defence in her cause, but tearing her upper garment,\ndisclosed her naked breast to the judges, with which comeliness of her body\nand amiable gesture they were so moved and astonished, that they did acquit\nher forthwith, and let her go. O noble piece of justice! mine author\nexclaims: and who is he that would not rather lose his seat and robes,\nforfeit his office, than give sentence against the majesty of beauty? Such\nprerogatives have fair persons, and they alone are free from danger.\nParthenopaeus was so lovely and fair, that when he fought in the Theban\nwars, if his face had been by chance bare, no enemy would offer to strike\nat or hurt him, such immunities hath beauty. Beasts themselves are moved\nwith it. Sinalda was a woman of such excellent feature, [4843]and a queen,\nthat when she was to be trodden on by wild horses for a punishment, \"the\nwild beasts stood in admiration of her person,\" (Saxo Grammaticus _lib. 8.\nDan. hist._) \"and would not hurt her.\" Wherefore did that royal virgin in\n[4844]Apuleius, when she fled from the thieves' den, in a desert, make such\nan apostrophe to her ass on whom she rode; (for what knew she to the\ncontrary, but that he was an ass?) _Si me parentibus et proco formoso\nreddideris, quas, tibi gratias, quos honores habebo, quos cibos exhibebo_?\n[4845]She would comb him, dress him, feed him, and trick him every day\nherself, and he should work no more, toil no more, but rest and play, &c.\nAnd besides she would have a dainty picture drawn, in perpetual\nremembrance, a virgin riding upon an ass's back with this motto, _Asino\nvectore regia virgo fugiens captivitatem_; why said she all this? why did\nshe make such promises to a dumb beast? but that she perceived the poor ass\nto be taken with her beauty, for he did often _obliquo collo pedes puellae\ndecoros basiare_, kiss her feet as she rode, _et ad delicatulas voculas\ntentabat adhinnire_, offer to give consent as much as in him was to her\ndelicate speeches, and besides he had some feeling, as she conceived of her\nmisery. And why did Theogine's horse in Heliodorus [4846]curvet, prance,\nand go so proudly, _exultans alacriter et superbiens_, &c., but that such\nas mine author supposeth, he was in love with his master? _dixisses ipsum\nequum pulchrum intelligere pulchram domini fomam_? A fly lighted on [4847]\nMalthius' cheek as he lay asleep; but why? Not to hurt him, as a parasite\nof his, standing by, well perceived, _non ut pungeret, sed ut oscularetur_,\nbut certainly to kiss him, as ravished with his divine looks. Inanimate\ncreatures, I suppose, have a touch of this. When a drop of [4848]Psyche's\ncandle fell on Cupid's shoulder, I think sure it was to kiss it. When Venus\nran to meet her rose-cheeked Adonis, as an elegant [4849]poet of our's sets\nher out,\n\n        ------\"the bushes in the way\n        Some catch her neck, some kiss her face,\n        Some twine about her legs to make her stay,\n        And all did covet her for to embrace.\"\n\n_Aer ipse amore inficitur_, as Heliodorus holds, the air itself is in love:\nfor when Hero plaid upon her lute,\n\n[4850] \"The wanton air in twenty sweet forms danc't\n        After her fingers\"------\n\nand those lascivious winds stayed Daphne when she fled from Apollo;\n\n[4851]  ------\"nudabant corpora venti,\n        Obviaque adversas vibrabant flamina vestes.\"\n\nBoreas Ventus loved Hyacinthus, and Orithya Ericthons's daughter of Athens:\n_vi rapuit_, &c. he took her away by force, as she was playing with other\nwenches at Ilissus, and begat Zetes and Galias his two sons of her. That\nseas and waters are enamoured with this our beauty, is all out as likely as\nthat of the air and winds; for when Leander swam in the Hellespont, Neptune\nwith his trident did beat down the waves, but\n\n       \"They still mounted up intending to have kiss'd him.\n        And fell in drops like tears because they missed him.\"\n\nThe [4852]river Alpheus was in love with Arethusa, as she tells the tale\nherself,\n\n[4853]  ------\"viridesque manu siccata capillos,\n        Fluminis Alphei veteres recitavit amores;\n        Pars ego Nympharum,\" &c.\n\nWhen our Thame and Isis meet\n\n[4854] \"Oscula mille sonant, connexu brachia pallent,\n        Mutuaque explicitis connectunt colla lacertis.\"\n\nInachus and Pineus, and how many loving rivers can I reckon up, whom beauty\nhath enthralled! I say nothing all this while of idols themselves that have\ncommitted idolatry in this kind, of looking-glasses, that have been rapt in\nlove (if you will believe [4855]poets), when their ladies and mistresses\nlooked on to dress them.\n\n       \"Et si non habeo sensum, tua gratia sensum\n        Exhibet, et calidi sentio amoris onus.\n        Dirigis huc quoties spectantia lumina, flamma\n        Succendunt inopi saucia membra mihi.\"\n\n       \"Though I no sense at all of feeling have.\n        Yet your sweet looks do animate and save;\n        And when your speaking eyes do this way turn,\n        Methinks my wounded members live and burn.\"\n\nI could tell you such another story of a spindle that was fired by a fair\nlady's [4856]looks, or fingers, some say, I know not well whether, but\nfired it was by report, and of a cold bath that suddenly smoked, and was\nvery hot when naked Coelia came into it, _Miramur quis sit tantus et unde\nvapor_, [4857]&c. But of all the tales in this kind, that is the most\nmemorable of [4858]Death himself, when he should have strucken a sweet\nyoung virgin with his dart, he fell in love with the object. Many more such\ncould I relate which are to be believed with a poetical faith. So dumb and\ndead creatures dote, but men are mad, stupefied many times at the first\nsight of beauty, amazed, [4859]as that fisherman in Aristaenetus that spied\na maid bathing herself by the seaside,\n\n[4860] \"Soluta mihi sunt omnia membra--\n        A capite ad calcem. sensusque omnis periit\n        De pectore, tam immensus stupor animam invasit mihi.\"\n\nAnd as [4861]Lucian, in his images, confesses of himself, that he was at\nhis mistress's presence void of all sense, immovable, as if he had seen a\nGorgon's head: which was no such cruel monster (as [4862]Coelius interprets\nit, _lib. 3. cap. 9._), \"but the very quintessence of beauty,\" some fair\ncreature, as without doubt the poet understood in the first fiction of it,\nat which the spectators were amazed. [4863]_Miseri quibus intentata nites_,\npoor wretches are compelled at the very sight of her ravishing looks to run\nmad, or make away with themselves.\n\n[4864] \"They wait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\n        And whom she favours lives, the other dies.\"\n\n4865]Heliodorus, _lib. 1._ brings in Thyamis almost besides himself, when\nhe saw Chariclia first, and not daring to look upon her a second time, \"for\nhe thought it impossible for any man living to see her and contain\nhimself.\" The very fame of beauty will fetch them to it many miles off\n(such an attractive power this loadstone hath), and they will seem but\nshort, they will undertake any toil or trouble, [4866]long journeys. Penia\nor Atalanta shall not overgo them, through seas, deserts, mountains, and\ndangerous places, as they did to gaze on Psyche: \"many mortal men came far\nand near to see that glorious object of her age,\" Paris for Helena, Corebus\nto Troja.\n\n        ------\"Illis Trojam qui forte diebus\n        Venerat insano Cassandrae insensus amore.\"\n\n\"who inflamed with a violent passion for Cassandra, happened then to be in\nTroy.\" King John of France, once prisoner in England, came to visit his old\nfriends again, crossing the seas; but the truth is, his coming was to see\nthe Countess of Salisbury, the nonpareil of those times, and his dear\nmistress. That infernal God Pluto came from hell itself, to steal\nProserpine; Achilles left all his friends for Polixena's sake, his enemy's\ndaughter; and all the [4867]Graecian gods forsook their heavenly mansions\nfor that fair lady, Philo Dioneus daughter's sake, the paragon of Greece in\nthose days; _ea enim venustate fuit, ut eam certatim omnes dii conjugem\nexpeterent_: \"for she was of such surpassing beauty, that all the gods\ncontended for her love.\" [4868]_Formosa divis imperat puella_. \"The\nbeautiful maid commands the gods.\" They will not only come to see, but as a\nfalcon makes a hungry hawk hover about, follow, give attendance and\nservice, spend goods, lives, and all their fortunes to attain;\n\n       \"Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,\n        Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.\"\n\nWhen fair [4869]Hero came abroad, the eyes, hearts, and affections of her\nspectators were still attendant on her.\n\n[4870] \"Et medios inter vultus supereminet omnes,\n        Perque urbem aspiciunt venientem numinis instar.\"\n\n[4871] \"So far above the rest fair Hero shined.\n        And stole away the enchanted gazer's mind.\"\n\n[4872]When Peter Aretine's Lucretia came first to Rome, and that the fame\nof her beauty, _ad urbanarum deliciarum sectatores venerat, nemo non ad\nvidendam eam_, &c. was spread abroad, they came in (as they say) thick and\nthreefold to see her, and hovered about her gates, as they did of old to\nLais of Corinth, and Phryne of Thebes, [4873]_Ad cujus jacuit Graecia tota\nfores_, \"at whose gates lay all Greece.\" [4874]\"Every man sought to get her\nlove, some with gallant and costly apparel, some with an affected pace,\nsome with music, others with rich gifts, pleasant discourse, multitude of\nfollowers; others with letters, vows, and promises, to commend themselves,\nand to be gracious in her eyes.\" Happy was he that could see her, thrice\nhappy that enjoyed her company. Charmides [4875]in Plato was a proper young\nman in comeliness of person, \"and all good qualities, far exceeding others;\nwhensoever fair Charmides came abroad, they seemed all to be in love with\nhim\" (as Critias describes their carriage), \"and were troubled at the very\nsight of him; many came near him, many followed him wheresoever he went,\"\nas those [4876]_formarum spectatores_ did Acontius, if at any time he\nwalked abroad: the Athenian lasses stared on Alcibiades; Sappho and the\nMitilenean women on Phaon the fair. Such lovely sights do not only please,\nentice, but ravish and amaze. Cleonimus, a delicate and tender youth,\npresent at a feast which Androcles his uncle made in Piraeo at Athens, when\nhe sacrificed to Mercury, so stupefied the guests, Dineas, Aristippus,\nAgasthenes, and the rest (as Charidemus in [4877]Lucian relates it), that\nthey could not eat their meat, they sat all supper time gazing, glancing at\nhim, stealing looks, and admiring of his beauty. Many will condemn these\nmen that are so enamoured, for fools; but some again commend them for it;\nmany reject Paris's judgment, and yet Lucian approves of it, admiring Paris\nfor his choice; he would have done as much himself, and by good desert in\nhis mind: beauty is to be preferred [4878]\"before wealth or wisdom.\"\n[4879]Athenaeus _Deipnosophist, lib. 13. cap. 7_, holds it not such\nindignity for the Trojans and Greeks to contend ten years, to spend so much\nlabour, lose so many men's lives for Helen's sake, [4880]for so fair a\nlady's sake,\n\n       \"Ob talem uxorem cui praestantissima forma,\n        Nil mortale refert.\"\n\nThat one woman was worth a kingdom, a hundred thousand other women, a world\nitself. Well might [4881]Sterpsichores be blind for carping at so fair a\ncreature, and a just punishment it was. The same testimony gives Homer of\nthe old men of Troy, that were spectators of that single combat between\nParis and Menelaus at the Seian gate, when Helen stood in presence; they\nsaid all, the war was worthily prolonged and undertaken [4882]for her sake.\nThe very gods themselves (as Homer and [4883]Isocrates record) fought more\nfor Helen, than they did against the giants. When [4884]Venus lost her son\nCupid, she made proclamation by Mercury, that he that could bring tidings\nof him should have seven kisses; a noble reward some say, and much better\nthan so many golden talents; seven such kisses to many men were more\nprecious than seven cities, or so many provinces. One such a kiss alone\nwould recover a man if he were a dying, [4885]_Suaviolum Stygia sic te de\nvalle reducet_, &c. Great Alexander married Roxanne, a poor man's child,\nonly for her person. [4886]'Twas well done of Alexander, and heroically\ndone; I admire him for it. Orlando was mad for Angelica, and who doth not\ncondole his mishap? Thisbe died for Pyramus, Dido for Aeneas; who doth not\nweep, as (before his conversion) [4887]Austin did in commiseration of her\nestate! she died for him; \"methinks\" (as he said) \"I could die for her.\"\n\nBut this is not the matter in hand; what prerogative this beauty hath, of\nwhat power and sovereignty it is, and how far such persons that so much\nadmire, and dote upon it, are to be justified; no man doubts of these\nmatters; the question is, how and by what means beauty produceth this\neffect? By sight: the eye betrays the soul, and is both active and passive\nin this business; it wounds and is wounded, is an especial cause and\ninstrument, both in the subject and in the object. [4888]\"As tears, it\nbegins in the eyes, descends to the breast;\" it conveys these beauteous\nrays, as I have said, unto the heart. _Ut vidi ut perii._ [4889]_Mars videt\nhanc, visamque cupit._ Schechem saw Dinah the daughter of Leah, and defiled\nher, Gen. xxxiv. 3. Jacob, Rachel, xxix. 17, \"for she was beautiful and\nfair.\" David spied Bathsheba afar off, 2 Sam. xi. 2. The Elders, Susanna,\n[4890]as that Orthomenian Strato saw fair Aristoclea daughter of\nTheophanes, bathing herself at that Hercyne well in Lebadea, and were\ncaptivated in an instant. _Viderunt oculi, rapuerunt pectora flammae_;\nAmmon fell sick for Thamar's sake, 2 Sam. xiii. 2. The beauty of Esther was\nsuch, that she found favour not only in the sight of Ahasuerus, \"but of all\nthose that looked upon her.\" Gerson, Origen, and some others, contended\nthat Christ himself was the fairest of the sons of men, and Joseph next\nunto him, _speciosus prae filiis hominum_, and they will have it literally\ntaken; his very person was such, that he found grace and favour of all\nthose that looked upon him. Joseph was so fair, that, as the ordinary gloss\nhath it, _filiae decurrerent per murum, et ad fenestras_, they ran to the\ntop of the walls and to the windows to gaze on him, as we do commonly to\nsee some great personage go by: and so Matthew Paris describes Matilda the\nEmpress going through Cullen. [4891]P. Morales the Jesuit saith as much of\nthe Virgin Mary. Antony no sooner saw Cleopatra, but, saith Appian, _lib.\n1_, he was enamoured of her. [4892]Theseus at the first sight of Helen was\nso besotted, that he esteemed himself the happiest man in the world if he\nmight enjoy her, and to that purpose kneeled down, and made his pathetical\nprayers unto the gods. [4893]Charicles, by chance, espying that curious\npicture of smiling Venus naked in her temple, stood a great while gazing,\nas one amazed; at length, he brake into that mad passionate speech, \"O\nfortunate god Mars, that wast bound in chains, and made ridiculous for her\nsake!\" He could not contain himself, but kissed her picture, I know not how\noft, and heartily desired to be so disgraced as Mars was. And what did he\nthat his betters had not done before him?\n\n[4894]  ------\"atque aliquis de diis non tristibus optat\n        Sic fieri turpis\"------\n\nWhen Venus came first to heaven, her comeliness was such, that (as mine\nauthor saith) [4895]\"all the gods came flocking about, and saluted her,\neach of them went to Jupiter, and desired he might have her to be his\nwife.\" When fair [4896]Antilochus came in presence, as a candle in the dark\nhis beauty shined, all men's eyes (as Xenophon describes the manner of it)\n\"were instantly fixed on him, and moved at the sight, insomuch that they\ncould not conceal themselves, but in gesture or looks it was discerned and\nexpressed.\" Those other senses, hearing, touching, may much penetrate and\naffect, but none so much, none so forcible as sight. _Forma Briseis mediis\nin armis movit Achillem_, Achilles was moved in the midst of a battle by\nfair Briseis, Ajax by Tecmessa; Judith captivated that great Captain\nHolofernes: Dalilah, Samson; Rosamund, [4897]Henry the Second; Roxolana,\nSuleiman the Magnificent, &c.\n\n[4898] \"[Greek: nika de kai sidaeron\n        kai pur kalae tis ousa.]\"\n\n\"A fair woman overcomes fire and sword.\"\n\n[4899] \"Nought under heaven so strongly doth allure\n        The sense of man and all his mind possess,\n        As beauty's loveliest bait, that doth procure\n        Great warriors erst their rigour to suppress,\n        And mighty hands forget their manliness,\n        Driven with the power of an heart-burning eye,\n        And lapt in flowers of a golden tress.\n        That can with melting pleasure mollify\n        Their harden'd hearts inur'd to cruelty.\"\n\n[4900]Clitiphon ingenuously confesseth, that he no sooner came in\nLeucippe's presence, but that he did _corde tremere, et oculis lascivius\nintueri_; [4901]he was wounded at the first sight, his heart panted, and he\ncould not possibly turn his eyes from her. So doth Calysiris in Heliodorus,\n_lib. 2._ Isis Priest, a reverend old man, complain, who by chance at\nMemphis seeing that Thracian Rodophe, might not hold his eyes off her:\n[4902]\"I will not conceal it, she overcame me with her presence, and quite\nassaulted my continency which I had kept unto mine old age; I resisted a\nlong time my bodily eyes with the eyes of my understanding; at last I was\nconquered, and as in a tempest carried headlong.\" [4903] Xenophiles, a\nphilosopher, railed at women downright for many years together, scorned,\nhated, scoffed at them; coming at last into Daphnis a fair maid's company\n(as he condoles his mishap to his friend Demaritis), though free before,\n_Intactus nullis ante cupidinibus_, was far in love, and quite overcome\nupon a sudden. _Victus sum fateor a Daphnide_, &c. I confess I am taken,\n\n[4904] \"Sola haec inflexit sensus, animumque labentem\n        Impulit\"------\n\nI could hold out no longer. Such another mishap, but worse, had Stratocles\nthe physician, that blear-eyed old man, _muco plenus_ (so [4905]Prodromus\ndescribes him); he was a severe woman's-hater all his life, _foeda et\ncontumeliosa semper in faeminas profatus_, a bitter persecutor of the whole\nsex, _humanas aspides et viperas appellabat_, he forswore them all still,\nand mocked them wheresoever he came, in such vile terms, _ut matrem et\nsorores odisses_, that if thou hadst heard him, thou wouldst have loathed\nthine own mother and sisters for his word's sake. Yet this old doting fool\nwas taken at last with that celestial and divine look of Myrilla, the\ndaughter of Anticles the gardener, that smirking wench, that he shaved off\nhis bushy beard, painted his face, [4906]curled his hair, wore a laurel\ncrown to cover his bald pate, and for her love besides was ready to run\nmad. For the very day that he married he was so furious, _ut solis occasum\nminus expectare posset_ (a terrible, a monstrous long day), he could not\nstay till it was night, _sed omnibus insalutatis in thalamum festinans\nirrupit_, the meat scarce out of his mouth, without any leave taking, he\nwould needs go presently to bed. What young man, therefore, if old men be\nso intemperate, can secure himself? Who can say I will not be taken with a\nbeautiful object? I can, I will contain. No, saith [4907]Lucian of his\nmistress, she is so fair, that if thou dost but see her, she will stupefy\nthee, kill thee straight, and, Medusa like, turn thee to a stone; thou\ncanst not pull thine eyes from her, but, as an adamant doth iron, she will\ncarry thee bound headlong whither she will herself, infect thee like a\nbasilisk. It holds both in men and women. Dido was amazed at Aeneas'\npresence; _Obstupuit primo aspectu Sidonia Dido_; and as he feelingly\nverified out of his experience;\n\n[4908] \"Quam ego postquam vidi, non ita amavi ut sani solent\n        Homines, sed eodem pacto ut insani solent.\"\n\n       \"I lov'd her not as others soberly,\n        But as a madman rageth, so did I.\"\n\nSo Museus of Leander, _nusquam lumen detorquet ab illa_; and [4909]Chaucer\nof Palamon,\n\n       _He cast his eye upon Emilia,\n        And therewith he blent and cried ha, ha,\n        As though he had been stroke unto the hearta_.\n\nIf you desire to know more particularly what this beauty is, how it doth\n_Influere_, how it doth fascinate (for, as all hold, love is a\nfascination), thus in brief. [4910]\"This comeliness or beauty ariseth from\nthe due proportion of the whole, or from each several part.\" For an exact\ndelineation of which, I refer you to poets, historiographers, and those\namorous writers, to Lucian's Images, and Charidemus, Xenophon's description\nof Panthea, Petronius Catalectes, Heliodorus Chariclia, Tacius Leucippe,\nLongus Sophista's Daphnis and Chloe, Theodorus Prodromus his Rhodanthes,\nAristaenetus and Philostratus Epistles, Balthazar Castilio, _lib. 4. de\naulico._ Laurentius, _cap. 10, de melan._ Aeneas Sylvius his Lucretia, and\nevery poet almost, which have most accurately described a perfect beauty,\nan absolute feature, and that through every member, both in men and women.\nEach part must concur to the perfection of it; for as Seneca saith, _Ep.\n33. lib. 4._ _Non est formosa mulier cujus crus laudatur et brachium, sed\nilla cujus simul universa facies admirationem singulis partibus dedit_;\n\"she is no fair woman, whose arm, thigh, &c. are commended, except the face\nand all the other parts be correspondent.\" And the face especially gives a\nlustre to the rest: the face is it that commonly denominates a fair or\nfoul: _arx formae facies_, the face is beauty's tower; and though the other\nparts be deformed, yet a good face carries it (_facies non uxor amatur_)\nthat alone is most part respected, principally valued, _deliciis suis\nferox_, and of itself able to captivate.\n\n[4911] \"Urit te Glycerae nitor,\n        Urit grata protervitas,\n        Et vultus nimium lubricus aspici.\"\n\n\"Glycera's too fair a face was it that set him on fire, too fine to be\nbeheld.\" When [4912]Chaerea saw the singing wench's sweet looks, he was so\ntaken, that he cried out, _O faciem pulchram, deleo omnes dehinc ex animo\nmulieres, taedet quotidianarum harum formarum!_ \"O fair face, I'll never\nlove any but her, look on any other hereafter but her; I am weary of these\nordinary beauties, away with them.\" The more he sees her, the worse he\nis,--_uritque videndo_, as in a burning-glass, the sunbeams are\nre-collected to a centre, the rays of love are projected from her eyes. It\nwas Aeneas's countenance ravished Queen Dido, _Os humerosque Deo similis_,\nhe had an angelical face.\n\n[4913] \"O sacros vultus Baccho vel Apolline dignos,\n        Quos vir, quos tuto foemina nulla videt!\"\n\n        ------\"O sacred looks, befitting majesty,\n        Which never mortal wight could safely see.\"\n\nAlthough for the greater part this beauty be most eminent in the face, yet\nmany times those other members yield a most pleasing grace, and are alone\nsufficient to enamour. A high brow like unto the bright heavens, _coeli\npulcherrima plaga, Frons ubi vivit honor, frons ubi ludit amor_, white and\nsmooth like the polished alabaster, a pair of cheeks of vermilion colour,\nin which love lodgeth; [4914]_Amor qui mollibus genis puellae pernoctas_: a\ncoral lip, _suaviorum delubrum_, in which _Basia mille patent, basia mille\nlatent_, \"A thousand appear, as many are concealed;\" _gratiarum sedes\ngratissima_; a sweet-smelling flower, from which bees may gather honey,\n[4915]_Mellilegae volucres quid adhuc cava thyma rosasque_, &c.\n\n       \"Omnes ad dominae labra venite meae,\n        Illa rosas spirat,\" &c.\n\nA white and round neck, that _via lactea_, dimple in the chin, black\neyebrows, _Cupidinis arcus_, sweet breath, white and even teeth, which some\ncall the salepiece, a fine soft round pap, gives an excellent grace,\n[4916]_Quale decus tumidis Pario de marmore mammis!_ [4917]and make a\npleasant valley _lacteum sinum_, between two chalky hills, _Sororiantes\npapillulas, et ad pruritum frigidos amatores solo aspectu excitantes. Unde\nis, [4918]Forma papillarum quam fuit apta premi!_--Again _Urebant oculos\ndurae stantesque mamillae_. A flaxen hair; golden hair was even in great\naccount, for which Virgil commends Dido, _Nondum sustulerat flavum\nProserpinina crinem, Et crines nodantur in aurum_. Apollonius (_Argonaut.\nlib. 4._ _Jasonis flava coma incendit cor Medeae_) will have Jason's golden\nhair to be the main cause of Medea's dotage on him. Castor and Pollux were\nboth yellow haired. Paris, Menelaus, and most amorous young men, have been\nsuch in all ages, _molles ac suaves_, as Baptista Porta infers, [4919]\n_Physiog. lib. 2._ lovely to behold. Homer so commends Helen, makes\nPatroclus and Achilles both yellow haired: Pulchricoma Venus, and Cupid\nhimself was yellow haired, _in aurum coruscante et crispante capillo_, like\nthat neat picture of Narcissus in Callistratus; for so [4920]Psyche spied\nhim asleep, Briseis, Polixena, &c. _flavicomae omnes_,\n\n        ------\"and Hero the fair,\n        Whom young Apollo courted for her hair.\"\n\nLeland commends Guithera, king Arthur's wife, for a flaxen hair: so Paulus\nAemilius sets out Clodeveus, that lovely king of France. [4921]Synesius\nholds every effeminate fellow or adulterer is fair haired: and Apuleius\nadds that Venus herself, goddess of love, cannot delight, [4922]\"though she\ncome accompanied with the graces, and all Cupid's train to attend upon her,\ngirt with her own girdle, and smell of cinnamon and balm, yet if she be\nbald or badhaired, she cannot please her Vulcan.\" Which belike makes our\nVenetian ladies at this day to counterfeit yellow hair so much, great women\nto calamistrate and curl it up, _vibrantes ad gratiam crines, et tot\norbibus in captivitatem flexos_, to adorn their heads with spangles,\npearls, and made-flowers; and all courtiers to effect a pleasing grace in\nthis kind. In a word, [4923]\"the hairs are Cupid's nets, to catch all\ncomers, a brushy wood, in which Cupid builds his nest, and under whose\nshadow all loves a thousand several ways sport themselves.\"\n\nA little soft hand, pretty little mouth, small, fine, long fingers,\n_Gratiae quae digitis_ --'tis that which Apollo did admire in\nDaphne,--_laudat digitosque manusque_; a straight and slender body, a small\nfoot, and well-proportioned leg, hath an excellent lustre, [4924]_Cui totum\nincumbit corpus uti fundamento aedes_. Clearchus vowed to his friend\nAmyander in [4925]Aristaenetus, that the most attractive part in his\nmistress, to make him love and like her first, was her pretty leg and foot:\na soft and white skin, &c. have their peculiar graces, [4926]_Nebula haud\nest mollior ac hujus cutis est, aedipol papillam bellulam_. Though in men\nthese parts are not so much respected; a grim Saracen sometimes,--_nudus\nmembra Pyracmon_, a martial hirsute face pleaseth best; a black man is a\npearl in a fair woman's eye, and is as acceptable as [4927]lame Vulcan was\nto Venus; for he being a sweaty fuliginous blacksmith, was dearly beloved\nof her, when fair Apollo, nimble Mercury were rejected, and the rest of the\nsweet-faced gods forsaken. Many women (as Petronius [4928]observes)\n_sordibus calent_ (as many men are more moved with kitchen wenches, and a\npoor market maid, than all these illustrious court and city dames) will\nsooner dote upon a slave, a servant, a dirt dauber, a brontes, a cook, a\nplayer, if they see his naked legs or arms, _thorosaque brachia_,\n[4929]&c., like that huntsman Meleager in Philostratus, though he be all in\nrags, obscene and dirty, besmeared like a ruddleman, a gipsy, or a\nchimney-sweeper, than upon a noble gallant, Nireus, Ephestion, Alcibiades,\nor those embroidered courtiers full of silk and gold. [4930]Justine's wife,\na citizen of Rome, fell in love with Pylades a player, and was ready to run\nmad for him, had not Galen himself helped her by chance. Faustina the\nempress doted on a fencer.\n\nNot one of a thousand falls in love, but there is some peculiar part or\nother which pleaseth most, and inflames him above the rest. [4931]A company\nof young philosophers on a time fell at variance, which part of a woman was\nmost desirable and pleased best? some said the forehead, some the teeth,\nsome the eyes, cheeks, lips, neck, chin, &c., the controversy was referred\nto Lais of Corinth to decide; but she, smiling, said, they were a company\nof fools; for suppose they had her where they wished, what would they\n[4932]first seek? Yet this notwithstanding I do easily grant, _neque quis\nvestrum negaverit opinor_, all parts are attractive, but especially\n[4933]the eyes, [4934]\n\n        ------\"videt igne micantes,\n        Sideribus similes oculos\"------\n\nwhich are love's fowlers; [4935]_aucupium amoris_, the shoeing horns, \"the\nhooks of love\" (as Arandus will) \"the guides, touchstone, judges, that in a\nmoment cure mad men, and make sound folks mad, the watchmen of the body;\nwhat do they not?\" How vex they not? All this is true, and (which Athaeneus\n_lib. 13. dip. cap. 5._ and Tatius hold) they are the chief seats of love,\nand James Lernutius [4936]hath facetely expressed in an elegant ode of his,\n\n       \"Amorem ocellis flammeolis herae\n        Vidi insidentem, credite posteri,\n        Fratresque circum ludibundos\n        Cum pharetra volitare et arcu,\" &c.\n\n       \"I saw Love sitting in my mistress' eyes\n        Sparkling, believe it all posterity,\n        And his attendants playing round about\n        With bow and arrows ready for to fly.\"\n\nScaliger calls the eyes, [4937]\"Cupid's arrows; the tongue, the lightning\nof love; the paps, the tents:\" [4938]Balthazar Castilio, the causes, the\nchariots, the lamps of love,\n\n        ------\"aemula lumina stellis,\n        Lumina quae possent sollicitare deos.\"\n\n       \"Eyes emulating stars in light,\n        Enticing gods at the first sight;\"\n\nLove's orators, Petronius.\n\n       \"O blandos oculos, et o facetos,\n        Et quadam propria nota loquaces\n        Illic est Venus, et leves amores,\n        Atque ipsa in medio sedet voluptas.\"\n\n       \"O sweet and pretty speaking eyes,\n        Where Venus, love, and pleasure lies.\"\n\nLove's torches, touch-box, naphtha and matches, [4939]Tibullus.\n\n       \"Illius ex oculis quum vult exurere divos,\n        Accendit geminas lampades acer amor.\"\n\n       \"Tart Love when he will set the gods on fire,\n        Lightens the eyes as torches to desire.\"\n\nLeander, at the first sight of Hero's eyes, was incensed, saith Musaeus.\n\n       \"Simul in [4940]oculorum radiis crescebat fax amorum,\n        Et cor fervebat invecti ignis impetu;\n        Pulchritudo enim Celebris immaculatae foeminae,\n        Acutior hominibus est veloci sagitta.\n        Oculos vero via est, ab oculi ictibus\n        Vulnus dilabitur, et in praecordia viri manat.\"\n\n       \"Love's torches 'gan to burn first in her eyes.\n        And set his heart on fire which never dies:\n        For the fair beauty of a virgin pure\n        Is sharper than a dart, and doth inure\n        A deeper wound, which pierceth to the heart\n        By the eyes, and causeth such a cruel smart.\"\n\n[4941]A modern poet brings in Amnon complaining of Thamar,\n\n        ------\"et me fascino\n        Occidit ille risus et formae lepos,\n        Ille nitor, illa gratia, et verus decor,\n        Illae aemulantes purpuram, et [4942]rosas genae,\n        Oculique vinctaeque aureo nodo comae.\"------\n\n       \"It was thy beauty, 'twas thy pleasing smile,\n        Thy grace and comeliness did me beguile;\n        Thy rose-like cheeks, and unto purple fair\n        Thy lovely eyes and golden knotted hair.\"\n\n[4943]Philostratus Lemnius cries out on his mistress's basilisk eyes,\n_ardentes faces_, those two burning-glasses, they had so inflamed his soul,\nthat no water could quench it. \"What a tyranny\" (saith he), \"what a\npenetration of bodies is this! thou drawest with violence, and swallowest\nme up, as Charybdis doth sailors with thy rocky eyes: he that falls into\nthis gulf of love, can never get out.\" Let this be the corollary then, the\nstrongest beams of beauty are still darted from the eyes.\n\n[4944] \"Nam quis lumina tanta, tanta\n        Posset luminibus suis tueri,\n        Non statim trepidansque, palpitansque,\n        Prae desiderii aestuantis aura?\" &c.\n\n       \"For who such eyes with his can see,\n        And not forthwith enamour'd be!\"\n\nAnd as men catch dotterels by putting out a leg or an arm, with those\nmutual glances of the eyes they first inveigle one another. [4945]_Cynthia\nprima suis miserum me, cepit ocellis_. Of all eyes (by the way) black are\nmost amiable, enticing and fairer, which the poet observes in commending of\nhis mistress. [4946]_Spectandum nigris oculis, nigroque capillo_, which\nHesiod admires in his Alemena,\n\n[4947] \"Cujus a vertice ac nigricantibus oculis,\n        Tale quiddam spiral ac ab aurea Venere.\"\n\n       \"From her black eyes, and from her golden face\n        As if from Venus came a lovely grace.\"\n\nand [4948]Triton in his Milaene--_nigra oculos formosa mihi_. [4949]Homer\nuseth that epithet of ox-eyed, in describing Juno, because a round black\neye is the best, the son of beauty, and farthest from black the worse:\nwhich [4950]Polydore Virgil taxeth in our nation: _Angli ut plurimum\ncaesiis oculis_, we have grey eyes for the most part. Baptisma Porta,\n_Physiognom. lib. 3._ puts grey colour upon children, they be childish\neyes, dull and heavy. Many commend on the other side Spanish ladies, and\nthose [4951]Greek dames at this day, for the blackness of their eyes, as\nPorta doth his Neapolitan young wives. Suetonius describes Julius Caesar to\nhave been _nigris vegetisque oculis micantibus_, of a black quick sparkling\neye: and although Averroes in his Colliget will have such persons timorous,\nyet without question they are most amorous.\n\nNow last of all, I will show you by what means beauty doth fascinate,\nbewitch, as some hold, and work upon the soul of a man by the eye. For\ncertainly I am of the poet's mind, love doth bewitch and strangely change\nus.\n\n[4952] \"Ludit amor sensus, oculos perstringit, et aufert\n        Libertatem animi, mira nos fascinat arte.\n        Credo aliquis daemon subiens praecordia flammam\n        Concitat, et raptam tollit de cardine mentem.\"\n\n       \"Love mocks our senses, curbs our liberties,\n        And doth bewitch us with his art and rings,\n        I think some devil gets into our entrails,\n        And kindles coals, and heaves our souls from th'hinges.\"\n\nHeliodorus _lib. 3._ proves at large, [4953]that love is witchcraft, \"it\ngets in at our eyes, pores, nostrils, engenders the same qualities and\naffections in us, as were in the party whence it came.\" The manner of the\nfascination, as Ficinus _10. cap. com. in Plat._ declares it, is thus:\n\"Mortal men are then especially bewitched, when as by often gazing one on\nthe other, they direct sight to sight, join eye to eye, and so drink and\nsuck in love between them; for the beginning of this disease is the eye.\nAnd therefore he that hath a clear eye, though he be otherwise deformed, by\noften looking upon him, will make one mad, and tie him fast to him by the\neye.\" Leonard. Varius, _lib. 1. cap. 2. de fascinat._ telleth us, that by\nthis interview, [4954]\"the purer spirits are infected,\" the one eye\npierceth through the other with his rays, which he sends forth, and many\nmen have those excellent piercing eyes, that, which Suetonius relates of\nAugustus, their brightness is such, they compel their spectators to look\noff, and can no more endure them than the sunbeams. [4955]Barradius, _lib.\n6. cap. 10. de Harmonia Evangel._ reports as much of our Saviour Christ,\nand [4956]Peter Morales of the Virgin Mary, whom Nicephorus describes\nlikewise to have been yellow-haired, of a wheat colour, but of a most\namiable and piercing eye. The rays, as some think, sent from the eyes,\ncarry certain spiritual vapours with them, and so infect the other party,\nand that in a moment. I know, they that hold _visio fit intra mittendo_,\nwill make a doubt of this; but Ficinus proves it from blear-eyes, [4957]\n\"That by sight alone, make others blear-eyed; and it is more than manifest,\nthat the vapour of the corrupt blood doth get in together with the rays,\nand so by the contagion the spectators' eyes are infected.\" Other arguments\nthere are of a basilisk, that kills afar off by sight, as that Ephesian did\nof whom [4958]Philostratus speaks, of so pernicious an eye, he poisoned all\nhe looked steadily on: and that other argument, _menstruae faminae_, out of\nAristotle's Problems, _morbosae_ Capivaccius adds, and [4959]Septalius the\ncommentator, that contaminate a looking-glass with beholding it. [4960] \"So\nthe beams that come from the agent's heart, by the eyes, infect the spirits\nabout the patients, inwardly wound, and thence the spirits infect the\nblood.\" To this effect she complained in [4961]Apuleius, \"Thou art the\ncause of my grief, thy eyes piercing through mine eyes to mine inner parts,\nhave set my bowels on fire, and therefore pity me that am now ready to die\nfor thy sake.\" Ficinus illustrates this with a familiar example of that\nMarrhusian Phaedrus and Theban Lycias, [4962]\"Lycias he stares on Phaedrus'\nface, and Phaedrus fastens the balls of his eyes upon Lycias, and with\nthose sparkling rays sends out his spirits. The beams of Phaedrus' eyes are\neasily mingled with the beams of Lycias, and spirits are joined to spirits.\nThis vapour begot in Phaedrus' heart, enters into Lycias' bowels; and that\nwhich is a greater wonder, Phaedrus' blood is in Lycias' heart, and thence\ncome those ordinary love-speeches, my sweetheart Phaedrus, and mine own\nself, my dear bowels. And Phaedrus again to Lycias, O my light, my joy, my\nsoul, my life. Phaedrus follows Lycias, because his heart would have his\nspirits, and Lycias follows Phaedrus, because he loves the seat of his\nspirits; both follow; but Lycias the earnester of the two: the river hath\nmore need of the fountain, than the fountain of the river; as iron is drawn\nto that which is touched with a loadstone, but draws not it again; so\nLycias draws Phaedrus.\" But how comes it to pass then, that the blind man\nloves, that never saw? We read in the Lives of the Fathers, a story of a\nchild that was brought up in the wilderness, from his infancy, by an old\nhermit: now come to man's estate, he saw by chance two comely women\nwandering in the woods: he asked the old man what creatures they were, he\ntold him fairies; after a while talking _obiter_, the hermit demanded of\nhim, which was the pleasantest sight that ever he saw in his life? He\nreadily replied, the two [4963]fairies he spied in the wilderness. So that,\nwithout doubt, there is some secret loadstone in a beautiful woman, a\nmagnetic power, a natural inbred affection, which moves our concupiscence,\nand as he sings,\n\n       \"Methinks I have a mistress yet to come,\n        And still I seek, I love, I know not whom.\"\n\n'Tis true indeed of natural and chaste love, but not of this heroical\npassion, or rather brutish burning lust of which we treat; we speak of\nwandering, wanton, adulterous eyes, which, as [4964]he saith, \"lie still in\nwait as so many soldiers, and when they spy an innocent spectator fixed on\nthem, shoot him through, and presently bewitch him: especially when they\nshall gaze and gloat, as wanton lovers do one upon another, and with a\npleasant eye-conflict participate each other's souls.\" Hence you may\nperceive how easily and how quickly we may be taken in love; since at the\ntwinkling of an eye, Phaedrus' spirits may so perniciously infect Lycias'\nblood. [4965]\"Neither is it any wonder, if we but consider how many other\ndiseases closely, and as suddenly are caught by infection, plague, itch,\nscabs, flux,\" &c. The spirits taken in, will not let him rest that hath\nreceived them, but egg him on. [4966]_Idque petit corpus mens unde est\nsaucia amore_; and we may manifestly perceive a strange eduction of\nspirits, by such as bleed at nose after they be dead, at the presence of\nthe murderer; but read more of this in Lemnius, _lib. 2. de occult. nat.\nmir. cap. 7._ Valleriola _lib. 2. observ. cap. 7._ Valesius _controv._\nFicinus, Cardan, Libavius _de cruentis cadaveribus_, &c.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Artificial allurements of Love, Causes and Provocations to\nLust; Gestures, Clothes, Dower, &c._\n\nNatural beauty is a stronger loadstone of itself, as you have heard, a\ngreat temptation, and pierceth to the very heart; [4967]_forma verecundae,\nnocuit mihi visa puellae_; but much more when those artificial enticements\nand provocations of gestures, clothes, jewels, pigments, exornations, shall\nbe annexed unto it; those other circumstances, opportunity of time and\nplace shall concur, which of themselves alone were all sufficient, each one\nin particular to produce this effect. It is a question much controverted by\nsome wise men, _forma debeat plus arti an naturae_? Whether natural or\nartificial objects be more powerful? but not decided: for my part I am of\nopinion, that though beauty itself be a great motive, and give an excellent\nlustre _in sordibus_, in beggary, as a jewel on a dunghill will shine and\ncast his rays, it cannot be suppressed, which Heliodorus feigns of\nChariclia, though she were in beggar's weeds: yet as it is used, artificial\nis of more force, and much to be preferred.\n\n[4968] \"Sic dentata sibi videtur Aegle,\n        Emptis ossibus Indicoque cornu;\n        Sic quae nigrior est cadente moro,\n        Cerussata sibi placet Lychoris.\"\n\n       \"So toothless Aegle seems a pretty one,\n        Set out with new-bought teeth of Indy bone:\n        So foul Lychoris blacker than berry\n        Herself admires, now finer than cherry.\"\n\nJohn Lerius the Burgundian, _cap. 8. hist. navigat. in Brazil._ is\naltogether on my side. For whereas (saith he) at our coming to Brazil, we\nfound both men and women naked as they were born, without any covering, so\nmuch as of their privities, and could not be persuaded, by our Frenchmen\nthat lived a year with them, to wear any, [4969]\"Many will think that our\nso long commerce with naked women, must needs be a great provocation to\nlust;\" but he concludes otherwise, that their nakedness did much less\nentice them to lasciviousness, than our women's clothes. \"And I dare boldly\naffirm\" (saith he) \"that those glittering attires, counterfeit colours,\nheadgears, curled hairs, plaited coats, cloaks, gowns, costly stomachers,\nguarded and loose garments, and all those other accoutrements, wherewith\nour countrywomen counterfeit a beauty, and so curiously set out themselves,\ncause more inconvenience in this kind, than that barbarian homeliness,\nalthough they be no whit inferior unto them in beauty. I could evince the\ntruth of this by many other arguments, but I appeal\" (saith he) \"to my\ncompanions at that present, which were all of the same mind.\" His\ncountryman, Montague, in his essays, is of the same opinion, and so are\nmany others; out of whose assertions thus much in brief we may conclude,\nthat beauty is more beholden to art than nature, and stronger provocations\nproceed from outward ornaments, than such as nature hath provided. It is\ntrue that those fair sparkling eyes, white neck, coral lips, turgent paps,\nrose-coloured cheeks, &c., of themselves are potent enticers; but when a\ncomely, artificial, well-composed look, pleasing gesture, an affected\ncarriage shall be added, it must needs be far more forcible than it was,\nwhen those curious needleworks, variety of colours, purest dyes, jewels,\nspangles, pendants, lawn, lace, tiffanies, fair and fine linen,\nembroideries, calamistrations, ointments, etc. shall be added, they will\nmake the veriest dowdy otherwise, a goddess, when nature shall be furthered\nby art. For it is not the eye of itself that enticeth to lust, but an\n\"adulterous eye,\" as Peter terms it, 2. ii. 14. a wanton, a rolling,\nlascivious eye: a wandering eye, which Isaiah taxeth, iii. 16. Christ\nhimself, and the Virgin Mary, had most beautiful eyes, as amiable eyes as\nany persons, saith [4970]Baradius, that ever lived, but withal so modest,\nso chaste, that whosoever looked on them was freed from that passion of\nburning lust, if we may believe [4971]Gerson and [4972]Bonaventure: there\nwas no such antidote against it, as the Virgin Mary's face; 'tis not the\neye, but carriage of it, as they use it, that causeth such effects. When\nPallas, Juno, Venus, were to win Paris' favour for the golden apple, as it\nis elegantly described in that pleasant interlude of [4973]Apuleius, Juno\ncame with majesty upon the stage, Minerva gravity, but Venus _dulce\nsubridens, constitit amaene; et gratissimae, Graticae deam propitiantes_,\n&c. came in smiling with her gracious graces and exquisite music, as if she\nhad danced, _et nonnunquam saltare solis oculis_, and which was the main\nmatter of all, she danced with her rolling eyes: they were the brokers and\nharbingers of her suite. So she makes her brags in a modern poet,\n\n[4974] \"Soon could I make my brow to tyrannise,\n        And force the world do homage to mine eyes.\"\n\nThe eye is a secret orator, the first bawd, _Amoris porta_, and with\nprivate looks, winking, glances and smiles, as so many dialogues they make\nup the match many times, and understand one another's meanings, before they\ncome to speak a word. [4975]Euryalus and Lucretia were so mutually\nenamoured by the eye, and prepared to give each other entertainment, before\never they had conference: he asked her good will with his eyes; she did\n_suffragari_, and gave consent with a pleasant look. That [4976]Thracian\nRodophe was so excellent at this dumb rhetoric, \"that if she had but looked\nupon any one almost\" (saith Calisiris) \"she would have bewitched him, and\nhe could not possibly escape it.\" For as [4977]Salvianus observes, \"the\neyes are the windows of our souls, by which as so many channels, all\ndishonest concupiscence gets into our hearts.\" They reveal our thoughts,\nand as they say, _frons animi index_, but the eye of the countenance,\n[4978]_Quid procacibus intuere ocellis_? &c. I may say the same of smiling,\ngait, nakedness of parts, plausible gestures, &c. To laugh is the proper\npassion of a man, an ordinary thing to smile; but those counterfeit,\ncomposed, affected, artificial and reciprocal, those counter-smiles are the\ndumb shows and prognostics of greater matters, which they most part use, to\ninveigle and deceive; though many fond lovers again are so frequently\nmistaken, and led into a fool's paradise. For if they see but a fair maid\nlaugh, or show a pleasant countenance, use some gracious words or gestures,\nthey apply it all to themselves, as done in their favour; sure she loves\nthem, she is willing, coming, &c.\n\n       \"Stultus quando videt quod pulchra puellula ridet,\n        Tum fatuus credit se quod amare velit:\"\n\n       \"When a fool sees a fair maid for to smile,\n        He thinks she loves him, 'tis but to beguile.\"\n\nThey make an art of it, as the poet telleth us,\n\n[4979] \"Quis credat? discunt etiam ridere puellae,\n        Quaeritur atque illis hac quoque parte decor.\"\n\n       \"Who can believe? to laugh maids make an art,\n        And seek a pleasant grace to that same part.\"\n\nAnd 'tis as great an enticement as any of the rest,\n\n[4980]  ------\"subrisit molle puella,\n        Cor tibi rite salit.\"\n\n\"She makes thine heart leap with [4981]a pleasing gentle smile of hers.\"\n\n[4982] \"Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,\n        Dulce loquentem,\"\n\n\"I love Lalage as much for smiling, as for discoursing,\" _delectata illa\nrisit tam blandum_, as he said in Petronius of his mistress, being well\npleased, she gave so sweet a smile. It won Ismenias, as he [4983]\nconfesseth, _Ismene subrisit amatorium_, Ismene smiled so lovingly the\nsecond time I saw her, that I could not choose but admire her: and Galla's\nsweet smile quite overcame [4984]Faustus the shepherd, _Me aspiciens moils\nblande subrisit ocellis_. All other gestures of the body will enforce as\nmuch. Daphnis in [4985]Lucian was a poor tattered wench when I knew her\nfirst, said Corbile, _pannosa et Zacera_, but now she is a stately piece\nindeed, hath her maids to attend her, brave attires, money in her purse,\n&c., and will you know how this came to pass? \"by setting out herself after\nthe best fashion, by her pleasant carriage, affability, sweet smiling upon\nall,\" &c. Many women dote upon a man for his compliment only, and good\nbehaviour, they are won in an instant; too credulous to believe that every\nlight wanton suitor, who sees or makes love to them, is instantly\nenamoured, he certainly dotes on, admires them, will surely marry, when as\nhe means nothing less, 'tis his ordinary carriage in all such companies. So\nboth delude each other by such outward shows; and amongst the rest, an\nupright, a comely grace, courtesies, gentle salutations, cringes, a mincing\ngait, a decent and an affected pace, are most powerful enticers, and which\nthe prophet Isaiah, a courtier himself, and a great observer, objected to\nthe daughters of Zion, iii. 16. \"they minced as they went, and made a\ntinkling with their feet.\" To say the truth, what can they not effect by\nsuch means?\n\n       \"Whilst nature decks them in their best attires\n        Of youth and beauty which the world admires.\"\n\n[4986]_Urit--voce, manu, gressu, pectore, fronte, oculis_. When art shall\nbe annexed to beauty, when wiles and guiles shall concur; for to speak as\nit is, love is a kind of legerdemain; mere juggling, a fascination. When\nthey show their fair hand, fine foot and leg withal, _magnum sui desiderium\nnobis relinquunt_, saith [4987]Balthazar Castilio, _lib. 1._ they set us a\nlonging, \"and so when they pull up their petticoats, and outward garments,\"\nas usually they do to show their fine stockings, and those of purest silken\ndye, gold fringes, laces, embroiderings, (it shall go hard but when they go\nto church, or to any other place, all shall be seen) 'tis but a springe to\ncatch woodcocks; and as [4988]Chrysostom telleth them downright, \"though\nthey say nothing with their mouths, they speak in their gait, they speak\nwith their eyes, they speak in the carriage of their bodies.\" And what\nshall we say otherwise of that baring of their necks, shoulders, naked\nbreasts, arms and wrists, to what end are they but only to tempt men to\nlust!\n\n[4989] \"Nam quid lacteolus sinus, et ipsas\n        Prae te fers sine linteo papillas?\n        Hoc est dicere, posce, posce, trado;\n        Hoc est ad Venerem vocare amantes.\"\n\nThere needs no more, as [4990]Fredericus Matenesius well observes, but a\ncrier to go before them so dressed, to bid us look out, a trumpet to sound,\nor for defect a sow-gelder to blow,\n\n[4991] \"Look out, look out and see\n        What object this may be\n        That doth perstringe mine eye;\n        A gallant lady goes\n        In rich and gaudy clothes,\n        But whither away God knows,\n        ------look out, &c., _et quae sequuntur_,\"\n\nor to what end and purpose? But to leave all these fantastical raptures,\nI'll prosecute my intended theme. Nakedness, as I have said, is an odious\nthing of itself, _remedium amoris_; yet it may be so used, in part, and at\nset times, that there can be no such enticement as it is;\n\n[4992] \"Nec mihi cincta Diana placet, nec nuda Cythere,\n        Illa voluptatis nil habet, haec nimium.\"\n\nDavid so espied Bathsheba, the elders Susanna: [4993]Apelles was enamoured\nwith Campaspe, when he was to paint her naked. Tiberius _in Suet. cap. 42._\nsupped with Sestius Gallus an old lecher, _libidinoso sene, ea lege ut\nnudae puellae administrarent_; some say as much of Nero, and Pontus Huter\nof Carolus Pugnax. Amongst the Babylonians, it was the custom of some\nlascivious queans to dance frisking in that fashion, saith Curtius _lib.\n5._ and Sardus _de mor. gent. lib. 1._ writes of others to that effect. The\n[4994]Tuscans at some set banquets had naked women to attend upon them,\nwhich Leonicus _de Varia hist. lib. 3. cap. 96._ confirms of such other\nbawdy nations. Nero would have filthy pictures still hanging in his\nchamber, which is too commonly used in our times, and Heliogabalus, _etiam\ncoram agentes, ut ad venerem incitarent_: So things may be abused. A\nservant maid in Aristaenetus spied her master and mistress through the\nkey-hole [4995]merrily disposed; upon the sight she fell in love with her\nmaster. [4996]Antoninus Caracalla observed his mother-in-law with her\nbreasts amorously laid open, he was so much moved, that he said, _Ah si\nliceret_, O that I might; which she by chance overhearing, replied as\nimpudently, [4997]_Quicquid libet licet_, thou mayst do what thou wilt: and\nupon that temptation he married her: this object was not in cause, not the\nthing itself, but that unseemly, indecent carriage of it.\n\nWhen you have all done, _veniunt a veste sagittae_ the greatest\nprovocations of lust are from our apparel; God makes, they say, man shapes,\nand there is no motive like unto it;\n\n[4998] \"Which doth even beauty beautify,\n        And most bewitch a wretched eye,\"\n\na filthy knave, a deformed quean, a crooked carcass, a mawkin, a witch, a\nrotten post, a hedgestake may be so set out and tricked up, that it shall\nmake as fair a show, as much enamour as the rest: many a silly fellow is so\ntaken. _Primum luxuriae, aucupium_, one calls it, the first snare of lust;\n[4999]_Bossus aucupium animarum, lethalem arundinem_, a fatal reed, the\ngreatest bawd, _forte lenocinium, sanguineis lachrymis deplorandum_, saith\n[5000]Matenesius, and with tears of blood to be deplored. Not that\ncomeliness of clothes is therefore to be condemned, and those usual\nornaments: there is a decency and decorum in this as well as in other\nthings, fit to be used, becoming several persons, and befitting their\nestates; he is only fantastical that is not in fashion, and like an old\nimage in arras hangings, when a manner of attire is generally received; but\nwhen they are so new-fangled, so unstaid, so prodigious in their attires,\nbeyond their means and fortunes, unbefitting their age, place, quality,\ncondition, what should we otherwise think of them? Why do they adorn\nthemselves with so many colours of herbs, fictitious flowers, curious\nneedleworks, quaint devices, sweet-smelling odours, with those inestimable\nriches of precious stones, pearls, rubies, diamonds, emeralds, &c.? Why do\nthey crown themselves with gold and silver, use coronets and tires of\nseveral fashions, deck themselves with pendants, bracelets, earrings,\nchains, girdles, rings, pins, spangles, embroideries, shadows, rebatoes,\nversicolour ribands? why do they make such glorious shows with their\nscarves, feathers, fans, masks, furs, laces, tiffanies, ruffs, falls,\ncalls, cuffs, damasks, velvets, tinsels, cloth of gold, silver, tissue?\nwith colours of heavens, stars, planets: the strength of metals, stones,\nodours, flowers, birds, beasts, fishes, and whatsoever Africa, Asia,\nAmerica, sea, land, art, and industry of man can afford? Why do they use\nand covet such novelty of inventions; such new-fangled tires, and spend\nsuch inestimable sums on them? \"To what end are those crisped, false hairs,\npainted faces,\" as [5001]the satirist observes, \"such a composed gait, not\na step awry?\" Why are they like so many Sybarites, or Nero's Poppaea,\nAhasuerus' concubines, so costly, so long a dressing, as Caesar was\nmarshalling his army, or a hawk in pruning? [5002]_Dum moliuntur, dum\ncomuntur annus est_: a [5003]gardener takes not so much delight and pains\nin his garden, a horseman to dress his horse, scour his armour, a mariner\nabout his ship, a merchant his shop and shop-book, as they do about their\nfaces, and all those other parts: such setting up with corks, straightening\nwith whalebones; why is it, but as a day-net catcheth larks, to make young\nmen stoop unto them? Philocharus, a gallant in Aristenaetus, advised his\nfriend Poliaenus to take heed of such enticements, [5004]\"for it was the\nsweet sound and motion of his mistress's spangles and bracelets, the smell\nof her ointments, that captivated him first,\" _Illa fuit mentis prima ruina\nmeae_. _Quid sibi vult pixidum turba_, saith [5005]Lucian, \"to what use are\npins, pots, glasses, ointments, irons, combs, bodkins, setting-sticks? why\nbestow they all their patrimonies and husbands' yearly revenues on such\nfooleries?\" [5006]_bina patrimonia singulis auribus_; \"why use they\ndragons, wasps, snakes, for chains, enamelled jewels on their necks, ears?\"\n_dignum potius foret ferro manus istas religari, atque utinam monilia vere\ndracones essent_; they had more need some of them be tied in bedlam with\niron chains, have a whip for a fan, and hair-cloths next to their skins,\nand instead of wrought smocks, have their cheeks stigmatised with a hot\niron: I say, some of our Jezebels, instead of painting, if they were well\nserved. But why is all this labour, all this cost, preparation, riding,\nrunning, far-fetched, and dear bought stuff? [5007]\"Because forsooth they\nwould be fair and fine, and where nature, is defective, supply it by art.\"\n[5008]_Sanguine quae vero non rubet, arte rubet_, (Ovid); and to that\npurpose they anoint and paint their faces, to make Helen of\nHecuba--_parvamque exortamque puellam--Europen._[5009]To this intent they\ncrush in their feet and bodies, hurt and crucify themselves, sometimes in\nlax-clothes, a hundred yards I think in a gown, a sleeve; and sometimes\nagain so close, _ut nudos exprimant artus._ [5010]Now long tails and\ntrains, and then short, up, down, high, low, thick, thin, &c.; now little\nor no bands, then as big as cart wheels; now loose bodies, then great\nfarthingales and close girt, &c. Why is all this, but with the whore in the\nProverbs, to intoxicate some or other? _oculorum decipulam_, [5011]one\ntherefore calls it, _et indicem libidinis_, the trap of lust, and sure\ntoken, as an ivy-bush is to a tavern.\n\n       \"Quod pulchros Glycere sumas de pixide vultus,\n          Quod tibi compositae nec sine lege comae:\n        Quod niteat digitis adamas, Beryllus in aure,\n          Non sum divinus, sed scio quid cupias.\"\n\n       \"O Glycere, in that you paint so much,\n        Your hair is so bedeckt in order such.\n        With rings on fingers, bracelets in your ear,\n        Although no prophet, tell I can, I fear.\"\n\nTo be admired, to be gazed on, to circumvent some novice; as many times\nthey do, that instead of a lady he loves a cap and a feather instead of a\nmaid that should have _verum colorem, corpus solidum et succi plenum_ (as\nChaerea describes his mistress in the [5012]poet), a painted face, a\nruff-band, fair and fine linen, a coronet, a flower, ([5013]_Naturaeque\nputat quod fuit artificis_,) a wrought waistcoat he dotes on, or a pied\npetticoat, a pure dye instead of a proper woman. For generally, as with\nrich-furred conies, their cases are far better than their bodies, and like\nthe bark of a cinnamon, tree, which is dearer than the whole bulk, their\noutward accoutrements are far more precious than their inward endowments.\n'Tis too commonly so.\n\n[5014] \"Auferimur cultu, et gemmis, auroque teguntur\n        Omnia; pars minima est ipsa puella sui.\"\n\n       \"With gold and jewels all is covered,\n          And with a strange tire we are won,\n        (Whilst she's the least part of herself)\n          And with such baubles quite undone.\"\n\nWhy do they keep in so long together, a whole winter sometimes, and will\nnot be seen but by torch or candlelight, and come abroad with all the\npreparation may be, when they have no business, but only to show\nthemselves? _Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsae._\n\n[5015] \"For what is beauty if it be not seen,\n        Or what is't to be seen if not admir'd,\n        And though admir'd, unless in love desir'd?\"\n\nwhy do they go with such counterfeit gait, which [5016]Philo Judeus\nreprehends them for, and use (I say it again) such gestures, apish,\nridiculous, indecent attires, sybaritical tricks, _fucos genis, purpurissam\nvenis, cerussam fronti, leges occulis_, &c. use those sweet perfumes,\npowders and ointments in public; flock to hear sermons so frequent, is it\nfor devotion? or rather, as [5017]Basil tells them, to meet their\nsweethearts, and see fashions; for, as he saith, commonly they come so\nprovided to that place, with such curious compliments, with such gestures\nand tires, as if they should go to a dancing-school, a stage-play, or\nbawdy-house, fitter than a church.\n\n       \"When such a she-priest comes her mass to say,\n        Twenty to one they all forget to pray.\"\n\n\"They make those holy temples, consecrated to godly martyrs and religious\nuses, the shops of impudence, dens of whores and thieves, and little better\nthan brothel houses.\" When we shall see these things daily done, their\nhusbands bankrupts, if not cornutos, their wives light housewives,\ndaughters dishonest; and hear of such dissolute acts, as daily we do, how\nshould we think otherwise? what is their end, but to deceive and inveigle\nyoung men? As tow takes fire, such enticing objects produce their effect,\nhow can it be altered? When Venus stood before Anchises (as [5018]Homer\nfeigns in one of his hymns) in her costly robes, he was instantly taken,\n\n       \"Cum ante ipsum staret Jovis filia, videns eam\n        Anchises, admirabatur formam, et stupendas vestes;\n        Erat enim induta peplo, igneis radiis spiendidiore;\n        Habebat quoque torques fulgidos, flexiles haelices,\n        Tenerum collum ambiebant monilia pulchra,\n        Aurea, variegata.\"------\n\n       \"When Venus stood before Anchises first,\n        He was amaz'd to see her in her tires;\n        For she had on a hood as red as fire,\n        And glittering chains, and ivy-twisted spires,\n        About her tender neck were costly brooches,\n        And necklaces of gold, enamell'd ouches.\"\n\nSo when Medea came in presence of Jason first, attended by her nymphs and\nladies, as she is described by [5019]Apollonius,\n\n       \"Cunctas vero ignis instar sequebatur splendor,\n        Tantum ab aureis fimbriis resplendebat jubar,\n        Accenditque in oculis dulce desiderium.\"\n\n       \"A lustre followed them like flaming fire,\n        And from their golden borders came such beams,\n        Which in his eyes provok'd a sweet desire.\"\n\nSuch a relation we have in [5020]Plutarch, when the queens came and offered\nthemselves to Antony, [5021]\"with diverse presents, and enticing ornaments,\nAsiatic allurements, with such wonderful joy and festivity, they did so\ninveigle the Romans, that no man could contain himself, all was turned to\ndelight and pleasure. The women transformed themselves to Bacchus shapes,\nthe men-children to Satyrs and Pans; but Antony himself was quite besotted\nwith Cleopatra's sweet speeches, philters, beauty, pleasing tires: for when\nshe sailed along the river Cydnus, with such incredible pomp in a gilded\nship, herself dressed like Venus, her maids like the Graces, her pages like\nso many Cupids, Antony was amazed, and rapt beyond himself.\" Heliodorus,\n_lib. 1._ brings in Dameneta, stepmother to Cnemon, \"whom she [5022]saw in\nhis scarves, rings, robes, and coronet, quite mad for the love of him.\" It\nwas Judith's pantofles that ravished the eyes of Holofernes. And\n[5023]Cardan is not ashamed to confess, that seeing his wife the first time\nall in white, he did admire and instantly love her. If these outward\nornaments were not of such force, why doth [5024]Naomi give Ruth counsel\nhow to please Boaz? and [5025]Judith, seeking to captivate Holofernes,\nwashed and anointed herself with sweet ointments, dressed her hair, and put\non costly attires. The riot in this kind hath been excessive in times past;\nno man almost came abroad, but curled and anointed,\n\n[5026] \"Et matutino suadans Crispinus amomo.\n        Quantum vix redolent duo funera.\"\n\n\"one spent as much as two funerals at once, and with perfumed hairs,\"\n[5027]_et rosa canos odorati capillos Assyriaque nardo_. What strange thing\ndoth [5028]Sueton. relate in this matter of Caligula's riot? And Pliny,\n_lib. 12. & 13._ Read more in Dioscorides, Ulmus, Arnoldus, Randoletius _de\nfuco et decoratione_; for it is now an art, as it was of old, (so\n[5029]Seneca records) _officinae, sunt adores coquentium_. Women are bad\nand men worse, no difference at all between their and our times;\n[5030]\"good manners\" (as Seneca complains) \"are extinct with wantonness, in\ntricking up themselves men go beyond women, they wear harlots' colours, and\ndo not walk, but jet and dance,\" _hic mulier, haec vir_, more like players,\nbutterflies, baboons, apes, antics, than men. So ridiculous, moreover, we\nare in our attires, and for cost so excessive, that as Hierome said of old,\n_Uno filio villarum insunt pretia, uno lino decies sestertium inseritur_;\n'tis an ordinary thing to put a thousand oaks and a hundred oxen into a\nsuit of apparel, to wear a whole manor on his back. What with shoe-ties,\nhangers, points, caps and feathers, scarves, bands, curls, &c., in a short\nspace their whole patrimonies are consumed. Heliogabalus is taxed by\nLampridius, and admired in his age for wearing jewels in his shoes, a\ncommon thing in our times, not for emperors and princes, but almost for\nserving men and tailors; all the flowers, stars, constellations, gold and\nprecious stones do condescend to set out their shoes. To repress the luxury\nof those Roman matrons, there was [5031]Lex Valeria and Oppia, and a Cato\nto contradict; but no laws will serve to repress the pride and insolency of\nour days, the prodigious riot in this kind. Lucullus's wardrobe is put down\nby our ordinary citizens; and a cobbler's wife in Venice, a courtesan in\nFlorence, is no whit inferior to a queen, if our geographers say true: and\nwhy is all this? \"Why do they glory in their jewels\" (as [5032]he saith)\n\"or exult and triumph in the beauty of clothes? why is all this cost? to\nincite men the sooner to burning lust.\" They pretend decency and ornament;\nbut let them take heed, that while they set out their bodies they do not\ndamn their souls; 'tis [5033]Bernard's counsel: \"shine in jewels, stink in\nconditions; have purple robes, and a torn conscience.\" Let them take heed\nof Isaiah's prophecy, that their slippers and attires be not taken from\nthem, sweet balls, bracelets, earrings, veils, wimples, crisping-pins,\nglasses, fine linen, hoods, lawns, and sweet savours, they become not bald,\nburned, and stink upon a sudden. And let maids beware, as [5034]Cyprian\nadviseth, \"that while they wander too loosely abroad, they lose not their\nvirginities:\" and like Egyptian temples, seem fair without, but prove\nrotten carcases within. How much better were it for them to follow that\ngood counsel of Tertullian? [5035]\"To have their eyes painted with\nchastity, the Word of God inserted into their ears, Christ's yoke tied to\nthe hair, to subject themselves to their husbands. If they would do so,\nthey should be comely enough, clothe themselves with the silk of sanctity,\ndamask of devotion, purple of piety and chastity, and so painted, they\nshall have God himself to be a suitor: let whores and queans prank up\nthemselves, [5036]let them paint their faces with minion and ceruse, they\nare but fuels of lust, and signs of a corrupt soul: if ye be good, honest,\nvirtuous, and religious matrons, let sobriety, modesty and chastity be your\nhonour, and God himself your love and desire.\" _Mulier recte olet, ubi\nnihil olet_, then a woman smells best, when she hath no perfume at all; no\ncrown, chain, or jewel (Guivarra adds) is such an ornament to a virgin, or\nvirtuous woman, _quam virgini pudor_, as chastity is: more credit in a wise\nman's eye and judgment they get by their plainness, and seem fairer than\nthey that are set out with baubles, as a butcher's meat is with pricks,\npuffed up, and adorned like so many jays with variety of colours. It is\nreported of Cornelia, that virtuous Roman lady, great Scipio's daughter,\nTitus Sempronius' wife, and the mother of the Gracchi, that being by chance\nin company with a companion, a strange gentlewoman (some light housewife\nbelike, that was dressed like a May lady, and, as most of our gentlewomen\nare, \"was [5037]more solicitous of her head-tire than of her health, that\nspent her time between a comb and a glass, and had rather be fair than\nhonest\" (as Cato said), \"and have the commonwealth turned topsy-turvy than\nher tires marred;\" and she did nought but brag of her fine robes and\njewels, and provoked the Roman matron to show hers: Cornelia kept her in\ntalk till her children came from school, and these, said she, are my\njewels, and so deluded and put off a proud, vain, fantastical, housewife.\nHow much better were it for our matrons to do as she did, to go civilly and\ndecently, [5038]_Honestae mulieris instar quae utitur auro pro eo quod est,\nad ea tantum quibus opus est_, to use gold as it is gold, and for that use\nit serves, and when they need it, than to consume it in riot, beggar their\nhusbands, prostitute themselves, inveigle others, and peradventure damn\ntheir own souls? How much more would it be for their honour and credit?\nThus doing, as Hierom said of Blesilla, [5039]\"Furius did not so triumph\nover the Gauls, Papyrius of the Samnites, Scipio of Numantia, as she did by\nher temperance;\" _pulla semper veste_, &c., they should insult and domineer\nover lust, folly, vainglory, all such inordinate, furious and unruly\npassions.\n\nBut I am over tedious, I confess, and whilst I stand gaping after fine\nclothes, there is another great allurement, (in the world's eye at least)\nwhich had like to have stolen out of sight, and that is money, _veniunt a\ndote sagittae_, money makes the match; [5040][Greek: Monon arguron\nblepousin]: 'tis like sauce to their meat, _cum carne condimentum_, a good\ndowry with a wife. Many men if they do hear but of a great portion, a rich\nheir, are more mad than if they had all the beauteous ornaments, and those\ngood parts art and nature can afford, they [5041]care not for honesty,\nbringing up, birth, beauty, person, but for money.\n\n[5042] \"Canes et equos (o Cyrne) quaerimus\n        Nobiles, et a bona progenie;\n        Malam vero uxorem, malique patris filiam\n        Ducere non curat vir bonus,\n        Modo ei magnam dotem afferat,\"\n\n       \"Our dogs and horses still from the best breed\n        We carefully seek, and well may they speed:\n        But for our wives, so they prove wealthy,\n        Fair or foul, we care not what they be.\"\n\nIf she be rich, then she is fair, fine, absolute and perfect, then they\nburn like fire, they love her dearly, like pig and pie, and are ready to\nhang themselves if they may not have her. Nothing so familiar in these\ndays, as for a young man to marry an old wife, as they say, for a piece of\ngold; _asinum auro onustum_; and though she be an old crone, and have never\na tooth in her head, neither good conditions, nor a good face, a natural\nfool, but only rich, she shall have twenty young gallants to be suitors in\nan instant. As she said in Suetonius, _non me, sed mea ambiunt_, 'tis not\nfor her sake, but for her lands or money; and an excellent match it were\n(as he added) if she were away. So on the other side, many a young lovely\nmaid will cast away herself upon an old, doting, decrepit dizzard,\n\n[5043] \"Bis puer effoeto quamvis balbutiat ore,\n        Prima legit rarae tam culta roseta puellae,\"\n\nthat is rheumatic and gouty, hath some twenty diseases, perhaps but one\neye, one leg, never a nose, no hair on his head, wit in his brains, nor\nhonesty, if he have land or [5044]money, she will have him before all other\nsuitors, [5045]_Dummodo sit dives barbarus ille placet_. \"If he be rich, he\nis the man,\" a fine man, and a proper man, she will go to Jacaktres or\nTidore with him; _Galesimus de monte aureo_. Sir Giles Goosecap, Sir\nAmorous La-Fool, shall have her. And as Philemasium in [5046] Aristaenetus\ntold Emmusus, _absque argento omnia vana_, hang him that hath no money,\n\"'tis to no purpose to talk of marriage without means,\" [5047] trouble me\nnot with such motions; let others do as they will, \"I'll be sure to have\none shall maintain me fine and brave.\" Most are of her mind, [5048] _De\nmoribus ultima fiet questio_, for his conditions, she shall inquire after\nthem another time, or when all is done, the match made, and everybody gone\nhome. [5049]Lucian's Lycia was a proper young maid, and had many fine\ngentlemen to her suitors; Ethecles, a senator's son, Melissus, a merchant,\n&c.; but she forsook them all for one Passius, a base, hirsute, bald-pated\nknave; but why was it? \"His father lately died and left him sole heir of\nhis goods and lands.\" This is not amongst your dust-worms alone, poor\nsnakes that will prostitute their souls for money, but with this bait you\nmay catch our most potent, puissant, and illustrious princes. That proud\nupstart domineering Bishop of Ely, in the time of Richard the First,\nviceroy in his absence, as [5050]Nubergensis relates it, to fortify\nhimself, and maintain his greatness, _propinquarum suarum connubiis,\nplurimos sibi potentes et nobiles devincire curavit_, married his poor\nkinswomen (which came forth of Normandy by droves) to the chiefest nobles\nof the land, and they were glad to accept of such matches, fair or foul,\nfor themselves, their sons, nephews, &c. _Et quis tam praeclaram\naflinitatem sub spe magnae promotionis non optaret_? Who would not have\ndone as much for money and preferment? as mine author [5051]adds. Vortiger,\nKing of Britain, married Rowena the daughter of Hengist the Saxon prince,\nhis mortal enemy; but wherefore? she had Kent for her dowry. Iagello the\ngreat Duke of Lithuania, 1386, was mightily enamoured on Hedenga, insomuch\nthat he turned Christian from a Pagan, and was baptised himself by the name\nof Uladislaus, and all his subjects for her sake: but why was it? she was\ndaughter and heir of Poland, and his desire was to have both kingdoms\nincorporated into one. Charles the Great was an earnest suitor to Irene the\nEmpress, but, saith [5052]Zonarus, _ob regnum_, to annex the empire of the\nEast to that of the West. Yet what is the event of all such matches, that\nare so made for money, goods, by deceit, or for burning lust, _quos foeda\nlibido conjunxit_, what follows? they are almost mad at first, but 'tis a\nmere flash; as chaff and straw soon fired, burn vehemently for a while, yet\nout in a moment; so are all such matches made by those allurements of\nburning lust; where there is no respect of honesty, parentage, virtue,\nreligion, education, and the like, they are extinguished in an instant, and\ninstead of love comes hate; for joy, repentance and desperation itself.\nFranciscus Barbarus in his first book _de re uxoria, c. 5_, hath a story of\none Philip of Padua that fell in love with a common whore, and was now\nready to run mad for her; his father having no more sons let him enjoy her;\n[5053]\"but after a few days, the young man began to loath, could not so\nmuch as endure the sight of her, and from one madness fell into another.\"\nSuch event commonly have all these lovers; and he that so marries, or for\nsuch respects, let them look for no better success than Menelaus had with\nHelen, Vulcan with Venus, Theseus with Phaedra, Minos with Pasiphae, and\nClaudius with Messalina; shame, sorrow, misery, melancholy, discontent.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Importunity and Opportunity of Time, Place, Conference,\nDiscourse, Singing, Dancing, Music, Amorous Tales, Objects, Kissing,\nFamiliarity, Tokens, Presents, Bribes, Promises, Protestations, Tears, &c._\n\nAll these allurements hitherto are afar off, and at a distance; I will come\nnearer to those other degrees of love, which are conference, kissing,\ndalliance, discourse, singing, dancing, amorous tales, objects, presents,\n&c., which as so many sirens steal away the hearts of men and women. For,\nas Tacitus observes, _l. 2_, [5054]\"It is no sufficient trial of a maid's\naffection by her eyes alone, but you must say something that shall be more\navailable, and use such other forcible engines; therefore take her by the\nhand, wring her fingers hard, and sigh withal; if she accept this in good\npart, and seem not to be much averse, then call her mistress, take her\nabout the neck and kiss her,\" &c. But this cannot be done except they first\nget opportunity of living, or coming together, ingress, egress, and\nregress; letters and commendations may do much, outward gestures and\nactions: but when they come to live near one another, in the same street,\nvillage, or together in a house, love is kindled on a sudden. Many a\nserving-man by reason of this opportunity and importunity inveigles his\nmaster's daughter, many a gallant loves a dowdy, many a gentleman runs upon\nhis wife's maids; many ladies dote upon their men, as the queen in Ariosto\ndid upon the dwarf, many matches are so made in haste, and they are\ncompelled as it were by [5055]necessity so to love, which had they been\nfree, come in company of others, seen that variety which many places\nafford, or compared them to a third, would never have looked one upon\nanother. Or had not that opportunity of discourse and familiarity been\noffered, they would have loathed and contemned those whom, for want of\nbetter choice and other objects, they are fatally driven on, and by reason\nof their hot blood, idle life, full diet, &c., are forced to dote upon them\nthat come next. And many times those which at the first sight cannot fancy\nor affect each other, but are harsh and ready to disagree, offended with\neach other's carriage, like Benedict and Beatrice in the [5056]comedy, and\nin whom they find many faults, by this living together in a house,\nconference, kissing, colling, and such like allurements, begin at last to\ndote insensibly one upon another.\n\nIt was the greatest motive that Potiphar's wife had to dote upon Joseph,\nand [5057]Clitiphon upon Leucippe his uncle's daughter, because the plague\nbeing at Bizance, it was his fortune for a time to sojourn with her, to sit\nnext her at the table, as he tells the tale himself in Tatius, _lib. 2._\n(which, though it be but a fiction, is grounded upon good observation, and\ndoth well express the passions of lovers), he had opportunity to take her\nby the hand, and after a while to kiss, and handle her paps, &c., [5058]\nwhich made him almost mad. Ismenias the orator makes the like confession in\nEustathius, _lib. 1_, when he came first to Sosthene's house, and sat at\ntable with Cratistes his friend, Ismene, Sosthene's daughter, waiting on\nthem \"with her breasts open, arms half bare,\" [5059]_Nuda pedem, discincta\nsinum, spoliata lacertos_; after the Greek fashion in those times,--[5060]\n_nudos media plus parte lacertos_, as Daphne was when she fled from Phoebus\n(which moved him much), was ever ready to give attendance on him, to fill\nhim drink, her eyes were never off him, _rogabundi oculi_, those speaking\neyes, courting eyes, enchanting eyes; but she was still smiling on him, and\nwhen they were risen, that she had got a little opportunity, [5061]\"she\ncame and drank to him, and withal trod upon his toes, and would come and\ngo, and when she could not speak for the company, she would wring his\nhand,\" and blush when she met him: and by this means first she overcame him\n(_bibens amorem hauriebam simul_), she would kiss the cup and drink to him,\nand smile, \"and drink where he drank on that side of the cup,\" by which\nmutual compressions, kissings, wringing of hands, treading of feet, &c.\n_Ipsam mihi videbar sorbillare virginem_, I sipped and sipped so long, till\nat length I was drunk in love upon a sudden. Philocharinus, in [5062]\nAristaenetus, met a fair maid by chance, a mere stranger to him, he looked\nback at her, she looked back at him again, and smiled withal.\n\n[5063] \"Ille dies lethi primus, primusque malorum\n        Causa fuit.\"------\n\nIt was the sole cause of his farther acquaintance, and love that undid him.\n[5064]_O nullis tutum credere blanditiis_.\n\nThis opportunity of time and place, with their circumstances, are so\nforcible motives, that it is impossible almost for two young folks equal in\nyears to live together, and not be in love, especially in great houses,\nprinces' courts, where they are idle _in summo gradu_, fare well, live at\nease, and cannot tell otherwise how to spend their time. [5065]_Illic\nHippolitum pone, Priapus erit_. Achilles was sent by his mother Thetis to\nthe island of Scyros in the Aegean sea (where Lycomedes then reigned) in\nhis nonage to be brought up; to avoid that hard destiny of the oracle (he\nshould be slain at the siege of Troy): and for that cause was nurtured in\nGenesco, amongst the king's children in a woman's habit; but see the event:\nhe compressed Deidamia, the king's fair daughter, and had a fine son,\ncalled Pyrrhus by her. Peter Abelard the philosopher, as he tells the tale\nhimself, being set by Fulbertus her uncle to teach Heloise his lovely\nniece, and to that purpose sojourned in his house, and had committed _agnam\ntenellam famelico lupo_, I use his own words, he soon got her good will,\n_plura erant oscula quam sententiae_ and he read more of love than any\nother lecture; such pretty feats can opportunity plea; _primum domo\nconjuncti, inde animis_, &c. But when as I say, _nox, vinum, et\nadolescentia_, youth, wine, and night, shall concur, _nox amoris et quietis\nconscia_, 'tis a wonder they be not all plunged over head and ears in love;\nfor youth is _benigna in amorem, et prona materies_, a very combustible\nmatter, naphtha itself, the fuel of love's fire, and most apt to kindle it.\nIf there be seven servants in an ordinary house, you shall have three\ncouple in some good liking at least, and amongst idle persons how should it\nbe otherwise? \"Living at [5066]Rome,\" saith Aretine's Lucretia, \"in the\nflower of my fortunes, rich, fair, young, and so well brought up, my\nconversation, age, beauty, fortune, made all the world admire and love me.\"\nNight alone, that one occasion, is enough to set all on fire, and they are\nso cunning in great houses, that they make their best advantage of it: Many\na gentlewoman, that is guilty to herself of her imperfections, paintings,\nimpostures, will not willingly be seen by day, but as [5067]Castilio\nnoteth, in the night, _Diem ut glis odit, taedarum lucem super omnia\nmavult_, she hateth the day like a dormouse, and above all things loves\ntorches and candlelight, and if she must come abroad in the day, she\ncovets, as [5068]in a mercer's shop, a very obfuscate and obscure sight.\nAnd good reason she hath for it: _Nocte latent mendae_, and many an amorous\ngull is fetched over by that means. Gomesius _lib. 3. de sale gen. c. 22._\ngives instance in a Florentine gentleman, that was so deceived with a wife,\nshe was so radiantly set out with rings and jewels, lawns, scarves, laces,\ngold, spangles, and gaudy devices, that the young man took her to be a\ngoddess (for he never saw her but by torchlight); but after the wedding\nsolemnities, when as he viewed her the next morning without her tires, and\nin a clear day, she was so deformed, a lean, yellow, shrivelled, &c., such\na beastly creature in his eyes, that he could not endure to look upon her.\nSuch matches are frequently made in Italy, where they have no other\nopportunity to woo but when they go to church, or, as [5069]in Turkey, see\nthem at a distance, they must interchange few or no words, till such time\nthey come to be married, and then as Sardus _lib. 1. cap. 3. de morb.\ngent._ and [5070]Bohemus relate of those old Lacedaemonians, \"the bride is\nbrought into the chamber, with her hair girt about her, the bridegroom\ncomes in and unties the knot, and must not see her at all by daylight, till\nsuch time as he is made a father by her.\" In those hotter countries these\nare ordinary practices at this day; but in our northern parts, amongst\nGermans, Danes, French, and Britons, the continent of Scandia and the rest,\nwe assume more liberty in such cases; we allow them, as Bohemus saith, to\nkiss coming and going, _et modo absit lascivia, in cauponem ducere_, to\ntalk merrily, sport, play, sing, and dance so that it be modestly done, go\nto the alehouse and tavern together. And 'tis not amiss, though [5071]\nChrysostom, Cyprian, Hierome, and some other of the fathers speak bitterly\nagainst it: but that is the abuse which is commonly seen at some drunken\nmatches, dissolute meetings, or great unruly feasts. [5072]\"A young,\npickedevanted, trim-bearded fellow,\" saith Hierome, \"will come with a\ncompany of compliments, and hold you up by the arm as you go, and wringing\nyour fingers, will so be enticed, or entice: one drinks to you, another\nembraceth, a third kisseth, and all this while the fiddler plays or sings a\nlascivious song; a fourth singles you out to dance, [5073]one speaks by\nbeck and signs, and that which he dares not say, signifies by passions;\namongst so many and so great provocations of pleasure, lust conquers the\nmost hard and crabbed minds, and scarce can a man live honest amongst\nfeastings, and sports, or at such great meetings.\" For as he goes on,\n[5074]\"she walks along and with the ruffling of her clothes, makes men look\nat her, her shoes creak, her paps tied up, her waist pulled in to make her\nlook small, she is straight girded, her hairs hang loose about her ears,\nher upper garment sometimes falls, and sometimes tarries to show her naked\nshoulders, and as if she would not be seen, she covers that in all haste,\nwhich voluntarily she showed.\" And not at feasts, plays, pageants, and such\nassemblies, [5075]but as Chrysostom objects, these tricks are put in\npractice \"at service time in churches, and at the communion itself.\" If\nsuch dumb shows, signs, and more obscure significations of love can so\nmove, what shall they do that have full liberty to sing, dance, kiss, coll,\nto use all manner of discourse and dalliance! What shall he do that is\nbeleaguered of all sides?\n\n[5076] \"Quem tot, tam roseae petunt puellae,\n        Quem cultae cupiunt nurus, amorque\n        Omnis undique et undecunque et usque,\n        Omnis ambit Amor, Venusque Hymenque.\"\n\n       \"After whom so many rosy maids inquire,\n        Whom dainty dames and loving wights desire,\n        In every place, still, and at all times sue,\n        Whom gods and gentle goddesses do woo.\"\n\nHow shall he contain? The very tone of some of their voices, a pretty\npleasing speech, an affected tone they use, is able of itself to captivate\na young man; but when a good wit shall concur, art and eloquence,\nfascinating speech, pleasant discourse, sweet gestures, the Sirens\nthemselves cannot so enchant. [5077]P. Jovius commends his Italian\ncountrywomen, to have an excellent faculty in this kind, above all other\nnations, and amongst them the Florentine ladies: some prefer Roman and\nVenetian courtesans, they have such pleasing tongues, and such [5078]\nelegancy of speech, that they are able to overcome a saint, _Pro facie\nmultis vox sua lena fuit. Tanta gratia vocis famam conciliabat_, saith\nPetronius [5079]in his fragment of pure impurities, I mean his _Satyricon,\ntam dulcis sonus permulcebat aera, ut putares inter auras cantare Syrenum\nconcordiam_; she sang so sweetly that she charmed the air, and thou wouldst\nhave thought thou hadst heard a concert of Sirens. \"O good God, when Lais\nspeaks, how sweet it is!\" Philocolus exclaims in Aristenaetus, to hear a\nfair young gentlewoman play upon the virginals, lute, viol, and sing to it,\nwhich as Gellius observes, _lib. 1. cap. 11._ are _lascivientium\ndelicicae_, the chief delight of lovers, must needs be a great enticement.\nParthenis was so taken. [5080]_Mi vox ista avida haurit ab aure animam_: O\nsister Harpedona (she laments) I am undone, [5081]\"how sweetly he sings,\nI'll speak a bold word, he is the properest man that ever I saw in my life:\nO how sweetly he sings, I die for his sake, O that he would love me again!\"\nIf thou didst but hear her sing, saith [5082]Lucian, \"thou wouldst forget\nfather and mother, forsake all thy friends, and follow her.\" Helena is\nhighly commended by [5083]Theocritus the poet for her sweet voice and\nmusic; none could play so well as she, and Daphnis in the same Edyllion,\n\n       \"Quam tibi os dulce est, et vox amabilis o Daphni,\n        Jucundius est audire te canentem, quam mel lingere!\"\n\n       \"How sweet a face hath Daphne, how lovely a voice!\n        Honey itself is not so pleasant in my choice.\"\n\nA sweet voice and music are powerful enticers. Those Samian singing\nwenches, Aristonica, Onanthe and Agathocleia, _regiis diadematibus\ninsultarunt_, insulted over kings themselves, as [5084]Plutarch contends.\n_Centum luminibus cinctum caput Argus habebat_, Argus had a hundred eyes,\nall so charmed by one silly pipe, that he lost his head. Clitiphon\ncomplains in [5085]Tatius of Leucippe's sweet tunes, \"he heard her play by\nchance upon the lute, and sing a pretty song to it in commendations of a\nrose,\" out of old Anacreon belike;\n\n       \"Rosa honor decusque florum,\n        Rosa flos odorque divum,\n        Hominum rosa est voluptas,\n        Decus illa Gratiarum,\n        Florente amoris hora,\n        Rosa suavium Diones,\" &c.\n\n       \"Rose the fairest of all flowers.\n        Rose delight of higher powers,\n        Rose the joy of mortal men,\n        Rose the pleasure of fine women,\n        Rose the Graces' ornament,\n        Rose Dione's sweet content.\"\n\nTo this effect the lovely virgin with a melodious air upon her golden wired\nharp or lute, I know not well whether, played and sang, and that\ntransported him beyond himself, \"and that ravished his heart.\" It was\nJason's discourse as much as his beauty, or any other of his good parts,\nwhich delighted Medea so much.\n\n[5086]  ------\"Delectabatur enim\n        Animus simul forma dulcibusque verbis.\"\n\nIt was Cleopatra's sweet voice and pleasant speech which inveigled Antony,\nabove the rest of her enticements. _Verba ligant hominem, ut taurorum\ncornua funes_, \"as bulls' horns are bound with ropes, so are men's hearts\nwith pleasant words.\" \"Her words burn as fire,\" Eccles. ix. 10. Roxalana\nbewitched Suleiman the Magnificent, and Shore's wife by this engine\novercame Edward the Fourth, [5087]_Omnibus una omnes surripuit Veneres_.\nThe wife of Bath in Chaucer confesseth all this out of her experience.\n\n       _Some folk desire us for riches.\n        Some for shape, some for fairness,\n        Some for that she can sing or dance.\n        Some for gentleness, or for dalliance_.\n\n[5088]Peter Aretine's Lucretia telleth as much and more of herself, \"I\ncounterfeited honesty, as if I had been _virgo virginissima_, more than a\nvestal virgin, I looked like a wife, I was so demure and chaste, I did add\nsuch gestures, tunes, speeches, signs and motions upon all occasions, that\nmy spectators and auditors were stupefied, enchanted, fastened all to their\nplaces, like so many stocks and stones.\" Many silly gentlewomen are fetched\nover in like sort, by a company of gulls and swaggering companions, that\nfrequently belie noblemen's favours, rhyming Coribantiasmi, Thrasonean\nRhadomantes or Bombomachides, that have nothing in them but a few player's\nends and compliments, vain braggadocians, impudent intruders, that can\ndiscourse at table of knights and lords' combats, like [5089]Lucian's\nLeonitiscus, of other men's travels, brave adventures, and such common\ntrivial news, ride, dance, sing old ballad tunes, and wear their clothes in\nfashion, with a good grace; a fine sweet gentleman, a proper man, who could\nnot love him! She will have him though all her friends say no, though she\nbeg with him. Some again are incensed by reading amorous toys, Amadis de\nGaul, Palmerin de Oliva, the Knight of the Sun, &c., or hearing such tales\nof [5090]lovers, descriptions of their persons, lascivious discourses, such\nas Astyanassa, Helen's waiting-woman, by the report of Suidas, writ of old,\n_de variis concubitus modis_, and after her Philenis and Elephantine; or\nthose light tracts of [5091]Aristides Milesius (mentioned by Plutarch) and\nfound by the Persians in Crassus' army amongst the spoils, Aretine's\ndialogues, with ditties, love songs, &c., must needs set them on fire, with\nsuch like pictures, as those of Aretine, or wanton objects of what kind\nsoever; \"no stronger engine than to hear or read of love toys, fables and\ndiscourses\" ([5092]one saith) \"and many by this means are quite mad.\" At\nAbdera in Thrace (Andromeda one of Euripides' tragedies being played) the\nspectators were so much moved with the object, and those pathetical love\nspeeches of Perseus, amongst the rest, \"O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men,\"\n&c. that every man almost a good while after spake pure iambics, and raved\nstill on Perseus' speech, \"O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men.\" As carmen,\nboys and apprentices, when a new song is published with us, go singing that\nnew tune still in the streets, they continually acted that tragical part of\nPerseus, and in every man's mouth was \"O Cupid,\" in every street, \"O\nCupid,\" in every house almost, \"O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men,\"\npronouncing still like stage-players, \"O Cupid;\" they were so possessed all\nwith that rapture, and thought of that pathetical love speech, they could\nnot a long time after forget, or drive it out of their minds, but \"O Cupid,\nPrince of Gods and men,\" was ever in their mouths. This belike made\nAristotle, _Polit. lib. 7. cap. 18._ forbid young men to see comedies, or\nto hear amorous tales.\n\n[5093] \"Haec igitur juvenes nequam facilesque puellae\n        Inspiciant\"------\n\n\"let not young folks meddle at all with such matters.\" And this made the\nRomans, as [5094]Vitruvius relates, put Venus' temple in the suburbs,\n_extra murum, ne adolescentes venereis insuescant_, to avoid all occasions\nand objects. For what will not such an object do? Ismenias, as he walked in\nSosthene's garden, being now in love, when he saw so many [5095]lascivious\npictures, Thetis' marriage, and I know not what, was almost beside himself.\nAnd to say truth, with a lascivious object who is not moved, to see others\ndally, kiss, dance? And much more when he shall come to be an actor\nhimself.\n\nTo kiss and be kissed, which, amongst other lascivious provocations, is as\na burden in a song, and a most forcible battery, as infectious, [5096]\nXenophon thinks, as the poison of a spider; a great allurement, a fire\nitself, _prooemium aut anticoenium_, the prologue of burning lust (as\nApuleius adds), lust itself, [5097]_Venus quinta parte sui nectaris\nimbuit_, a strong assault, that conquers captains, and those all commanding\nforces, ([5098]_Domasque ferro sed domaris osculo_). [5099]Aretine's\nLucretia, when she would in kindness overcome a suitor of hers, and have\nher desire of him, \"took him about the neck, and kissed him again and\nagain,\" and to that, which she could not otherwise effect, she made him so\nspeedily and willingly condescend. And 'tis a continual\nassault,--[5100]_hoc non deficit incipitque semper_, always fresh, and\nready to [5101]begin as at first, _basium nullo fine terminatur, sed semper\nrecens est_, and hath a fiery touch with it.\n\n[5102]  ------\"Tenta modo tangere corpus,\n        Jam tua mellifluo membra calore fluent.\"\n\nEspecially when they shall be lasciviously given, as he feelingly said,\n[5103]_et me praessulum deosculata Fotis, Catenatis lacertis_, [5104]\n_Obtorto valgiter labello_.\n\n[5105] \"Valgiis suaviis,\n        Dum semiulco suavio\n        Meam puellam suavior,\n        Anima tunc aegra et saucia\n        Concurrit ad labia mihi.\"\n\nThe soul and all is moved; [5106]_Jam pluribus osculis labra crepitabant,\nanimarum quoque mixturam facientes, inter mutuos complexus animas\nanhelantes_,\n\n[5107] \"Haesimus calentes,\n        Et transfudimus hinc et hinc labellis\n        Errantes animas, valete curae.\"\n\n\"They breathe out their souls and spirits together with their kisses,\"\nsaith [5108]Balthazar Castilio, \"change hearts and spirits, and mingle\naffections as they do kisses, and it is rather a connection of the mind\nthan of the body.\" And although these kisses be delightsome and pleasant,\nAmbrosial kisses, [5109]_Suaviolum dulci dulcius Ambrosia_, such as [5110]\nGanymede gave Jupiter, _Nectare suavius_, sweeter than [5111]nectar,\nbalsam, honey, [5112]_Oscula merum amorem stillantia_, love-dropping\nkisses; for\n\n       \"The gilliflower, the rose is not so sweet,\n        As sugared kisses be when lovers meet;\"\n\nYet they leave an irksome impression, like that of aloes or gall,\n\n[5113] \"Ut mi ex Ambrosia, mutatum jam foret illud\n        Suaviolum tristi tristius helleboro.\"\n\n       \"At first Ambrose itself was not sweeter,\n        At last black hellebore was not so bitter.\"\n\nThey are deceitful kisses,\n\n[5114] \"Quid me mollibus implicas lacertis?\n        Quid fallacibus osculis inescas?&c.\"\n\n       \"Why dost within thine arms me lap,\n        And with false kisses me entrap.\"\n\nThey are destructive, and the more the worse: [5115]_Et quae me perdunt,\noscula mille dabat_, they are the bane of these miserable lovers. There be\nhonest kisses, I deny not, _osculum charitatis_, friendly kisses, modest\nkisses, vestal-virgin kisses, officious and ceremonial kisses, &c. _Osculi\nsensus, brachiorum amplexus_, kissing and embracing are proper gifts of\nNature to a man; but these are too lascivious kisses, [5116]_Implicuitque\nsuos circum meet colla lacertos_, &c. too continuate and too violent,\n[5117]_Brachia non hederae, non vincunt oscula conchae_; they cling like\nivy, close as an oyster, bill as doves, meretricious kisses, biting of\nlips, _cum additamento: Tam impresso ore_ (saith [5118]Lucian) _ut vix\nlabia detrahant, inter deosculandum mordicantes, tum et os aperientes\nquoque et mammas attrectantes_, &c. such kisses as she gave to Gyton,\n_innumera oscula dedit non repugnanti puero, cervicem invadens_,\ninnumerable kisses, &c. More than kisses, or too homely kisses: as those\nthat [5119]he spake of, _Accepturus ab ipsa venere 7, suavia_, &c. with\nsuch other obscenities that vain lovers use, which are abominable and\npernicious. If, as Peter de Ledesmo _cas. cons._ holds, every kiss a man\ngives his wife after marriage, be _mortale peccatum_, a mortal sin, or that\nof [5120]Hierome, _Adulter est quisquis in uxorem suam ardentior est\namator_; or that of Thomas Secund. _quaest. 154. artic. 4._ _contactus et\nosculum sit mortale peccatum_, or that of Durand. _Rational. lib. 1. cap.\n10._ _abstinere debent conjuges a complexu, toto tempore quo solennitas\nnuptiarum interdicitur_, what shall become of all such [5121]immodest\nkisses and obscene actions, the forerunners of brutish lust, if not lust\nitself! What shall become of them that often abuse their own wives? But\nwhat have I to do with this?\n\nThat which I aim at, is to show you the progress of this burning lust; to\nepitomise therefore all this which I have hitherto said, with a familiar\nexample out of that elegant Musaeus, observe but with me those amorous\nproceedings of Leander and Hero: they began first to look one on another\nwith a lascivious look,\n\n       \"Oblique intuens inde nutibus,--\n        Nutibus mutuis inducens in errorem mentem puellae.\n        Et illa e contra nutibus mutuis juvenis\n        Leandri quod amorem non renuit, &c. Inde\n        Adibat in tenebris tacite quidem stringens\n        Roseos puellae digitos, ex imo suspirabat\n        Vehementer------Inde\n        Virginis autem bene olens collum osculatus.\n        Tale verbum ait amoris ictus stimulo,\n        Preces audi et amoris miserere mei, &c.\n        Sic fatus recusantis persuasit mentem puellae.\"\n\n       \"With becks and nods he first began\n          To try the wench's mind.\n        With becks and nods and smiles again\n          An answer he did find.\"\n\n       \"And in the dark he took her by the hand,\n        And wrung it hard, and sighed grievously,\n        And kiss'd her too, and woo'd her as he might,\n        With pity me, sweetheart, or else I die,\n        And with such words and gestures as there past,\n        He won his mistress' favour at the last.\"\n\nThe same proceeding is elegantly described by Apollonius in his\nArgonautics, between Jason and Medea, by Eustathius in the ten books of the\nloves of Ismenias and Ismene, Achilles Tatius between his Clitophon and\nLeucippe, Chaucer's neat poem of Troilus and Cresseide; and in that notable\ntale in Petronius of a soldier and a gentlewoman of Ephesus, that was so\nfamous all over Asia for her chastity, and that mourned for her husband:\nthe soldier wooed her with such rhetoric as lovers use to do,--_placitone\netiam pugnabis amori_? &c. at last, _frangi pertinaciam passa est_, he got\nher good will, not only to satisfy his lust, [5122]but to hang her dead\nhusband's body on the cross (which he watched instead of the thief's that\nwas newly stolen away), whilst he wooed her in her cabin. These are tales,\nyou will say, but they have most significant morals, and do well express\nthose ordinary proceedings of doting lovers.\n\nMany such allurements there are, nods, jests, winks, smiles, wrestlings,\ntokens, favours, symbols, letters, valentines, &c. For which cause belike,\nGodfridus _lib. 2. de amor_. would not have women learn to write. Many such\nprovocations are used when they come in presence, [5123]10 they will and\nwill not,\n\n       \"Malo me Galatea petit lasciva puella,\n        Et fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videri.\"\n\n       \"My mistress with an apple woos me,\n          And hastily to covert goes\n        To hide herself, but would be seen\n          With all her heart before, God knows.\"\n\nHero so tripped away from Leander as one displeased,\n\n[5124] \"Yet as she went full often look'd behind,\n        And many poor excuses did she find\n        To linger by the way,\"------\n\nbut if he chance to overtake her, she is most averse, nice and coy,\n\n       \"Denegat et pugnat, sed vult super omnia vinci.\"\n\n       \"She seems not won, but won she is at length,\n        In such wars women use but half their strength.\"\n\nSometimes they lie open and are most tractable and coming, apt, yielding,\nand willing to embrace, to take a green gown, with that shepherdess in\nTheocritus, _Edyl. 27._ to let their coats, &c., to play and dally, at such\nseasons, and to some, as they spy their advantage; and then coy, close\nagain, so nice, so surly, so demure, you had much better tame a colt, catch\nor ride a wild horse, than get her favour, or win her love, not a look, not\na smile, not a kiss for a kingdom. [5125]Aretine's Lucretia was an\nexcellent artisan in this kind, as she tells her own tale, \"Though I was by\nnature and art most beautiful and fair, yet by these tricks I seemed to be\nfar more amiable than I was, for that which men earnestly seek and cannot\nattain, draws on their affection with a most furious desire. I had a suitor\nloved me dearly\" (said she), \"and the [5126]more he gave me, the more\neagerly he wooed me, the more I seemed to neglect, to scorn him, and which\nI commonly gave others, I would not let him see me, converse with me, no,\nnot have a kiss.\" To gull him the more, and fetch him over (for him only I\naimed at) I personated mine own servant to bring in a present from a\nSpanish count, whilst he was in my company, as if he had been the count's\nservant, which he did excellently well perform: [5127]_Comes de monte\nTurco_, \"my lord and master hath sent your ladyship a small present, and\npart of his hunting, a piece of venison, a pheasant, a few partridges, &c.\n(all which she bought with her own money), commends his love and service to\nyou, desiring you to accept of it in good part, and he means very shortly\nto come and see you.\" Withal she showed him rings, gloves, scarves,\ncoronets which others had sent her, when there was no such matter, but only\nto circumvent him. [5128]By these means (as she concludes) \"I made the poor\ngentleman so mad, that he was ready to spend himself, and venture his\ndearest blood for my sake.\" Philinna, in [5129]Lucian, practised all this\nlong before, as it shall appear unto you by her discourse; for when\nDiphilus her sweetheart came to see her (as his daily custom was) she\nfrowned upon him, would not vouchsafe him her company, but kissed Lamprius\nhis co-rival, at the same time [5130]before his face: but why was it? To\nmake him (as she telleth her mother that chid her for it) more jealous; to\nwhet his love, to come with a greater appetite, and to know that her favour\nwas not so easy to be had. Many other tricks she used besides this (as she\nthere confesseth), for she would fall out with, and anger him of set\npurpose, pick quarrels upon no occasion, because she would be reconciled to\nhim again. _Amantium irae amoris redintegratio_, as the old saying is, the\nfalling out of lovers is the renewing of love; and according to that of\nAristenaetis, _jucundiores amorum post injurias deliciae_, love is\nincreased by injuries, as the sunbeams are more gracious after a cloud. And\nsurely this aphorism is most true; for as Ampelis informs Crisis in the\nsaid Lucian, [5131]\"If a lover be not jealous, angry, waspish, apt to fall\nout, sigh and swear, he is no true lover.\" To kiss and coll, hang about her\nneck, protest, swear and wish, are but ordinary symptoms, _incipientis\nadhuc et crescentis amoris signa_; but if he be jealous, angry, apt to\nmistake, &c., _bene speres licet_, sweet sister he is thine own; yet if you\nlet him alone, humour him, please him, &c., and that he perceive once he\nhath you sure, without any co-rival, his love will languish, and he will\nnot care so much for you. Hitherto (saith she) can I speak out of\nexperience; Demophantus a rich fellow was a suitor of mine, I seemed to\nneglect him, and gave better entertainment to Calliades the painter before\nhis face, _principio abiit, verbis me insectatus_, at first he went away\nall in a chafe, cursing and swearing, but at last he came submitting\nhimself, vowing and protesting he loved me most dearly, I should have all\nhe had, and that he would kill himself for my sake. Therefore I advise thee\n(dear sister Crisis) and all maids, not to use your suitors over kindly;\n_insolentes enim sunt hoc cum sentiunt_, 'twill make them proud and\ninsolent; but now and then reject them, estrange thyself, _et si me audies\nsemel atque iterum exclude_, shut him out of doors once or twice, let him\ndance attendance; follow my counsel, and by this means [5132]you shall make\nhim mad, come off roundly, stand to any conditions, and do whatsoever you\nwill have him. These are the ordinary practices; yet in the said Lucian,\nMelissa methinks had a trick beyond all this; for when her suitor came\ncoldly on, to stir him up, she writ one of his co-rival's names and her own\nin a paper, _Melissa amat Hermotimum, Hermotimus Mellissam_, causing it to\nbe stuck upon a post, for all gazers to behold, and lost it in the way\nwhere he used to walk; which when the silly novice perceived, _statim ut\nlegit credidit_, instantly apprehended it was so, came raving to me, &c.\n[5133]\"and so when I was in despair of his love, four months after I\nrecovered him again.\" Eugenia drew Timocles for her valentine, and wore his\nname a long time after in her bosom: Camaena singled out Pamphilus to\ndance, at Myson's wedding (some say), for there she saw him first;\nFelicianus overtook Caelia by the highway side, offered his service, thence\ncame further acquaintance, and thence came love. But who can repeat half\ntheir devices? What Aretine experienced, what conceited Lucian, or wanton\nAristenaetus? They will deny and take, stiffly refuse, and yet earnestly\nseek the same, repel to make them come with more eagerness, fly from if you\nfollow, but if averse, as a shadow they will follow you again, _fugientem\nsequitur, sequentem fugit_; with a regaining retreat, a gentle reluctancy,\na smiling threat, a pretty pleasant peevishness they will put you off, and\nhave a thousand such several enticements. For as he saith,\n\n[5134] \"Non est forma satis, nec quae vult bella videri,\n          Debet vulgari more placere suis.\n        Dicta, sales, lusus, sermones, gratia, risus,\n          Vincunt naturae candidioris opus.\"\n\n       \"'Tis not enough though she be fair of hue,\n        For her to use this vulgar compliment:\n        But pretty toys and jests, and saws and smiles,\n        As far beyond what beauty can attempt.\"\n\n[5135]For this cause belike Philostratus, in his images, makes diverse\nloves, \"some young, some of one age, some of another, some winged, some of\none sex, some of another, some with torches, some with golden apples, some\nwith darts, gins, snares, and other engines in their hands,\" as Propertius\nhath prettily painted them out, _lib. 2. et 29._ and which some interpret,\ndiverse enticements, or diverse affections of lovers, which if not alone,\nyet jointly may batter and overcome the strongest constitutions.\n\nIt is reported of Decius, and Valerianus, those two notorious persecutors\nof the church, that when they could enforce a young Christian by no means\n(as [5136]Hierome records) to sacrifice to their idols, by no torments or\npromises, they took another course to tempt him: they put him into a fair\ngarden, and set a young courtesan to dally with him, [5137]\"took him about\nthe neck and kissed him, and that which is not to be named,\" _manibusque\nattrectare_, &c., and all those enticements which might be used, that whom\ntorments could not, love might batter and beleaguer. But such was his\nconstancy, she could not overcome, and when this last engine would take no\nplace, they left him to his own ways. At [5138]Berkley in Gloucestershire,\nthere was in times past a nunnery (saith Gualterus Mapes, an old\nhistoriographer, that lived 400 years since), \"of which there was a noble\nand a fair lady abbess: Godwin, that subtile Earl of Kent, travelling that\nway, (seeking not her but hers) leaves a nephew of his, a proper young\ngallant (as if he had been sick) with her, till he came back again, and\ngives the young man charge so long to counterfeit, till he had deflowered\nthe abbess, and as many besides of the nuns as he could, and leaves him\nwithal rings, jewels, girdles, and such toys to give them still, when they\ncame to visit him. The young man, willing to undergo such a business,\nplayed his part so well, that in short space he got up most of their\nbellies, and when he had done, told his lord how he had sped: [5139]his\nlord made instantly to the court, tells the king how such a nunnery was\nbecome a bawdy-house, procures a visitation, gets them to be turned out,\nand begs the lands to his own use.\" This story I do therefore repeat, that\nyou may see of what force these enticements are, if they be opportunely\nused, and how hard it is even for the most averse and sanctified souls to\nresist such allurements. John Major in the life of John the monk, that\nlived in the days of Theodosius, commends the hermit to have been a man of\nsingular continency, and of a most austere life; but one night by chance\nthe devil came to his cell in the habit of a young market wench that had\nlost her way, and desired for God's sake some lodging with him. [5140]\"The\nold man let her in, and after some common conference of her mishap, she\nbegan to inveigle him with lascivious talk and jests, to play with his\nbeard, to kiss him, and do worse, till at last she overcame him. As he went\nto address himself to that business, she vanished on a sudden, and the\ndevils in the air laughed him to scorn.\" Whether this be a true story, or a\ntale, I will not much contend, it serves to illustrate this which I have\nsaid.\n\nYet were it so, that these of which I have hitherto spoken, and such like\nenticing baits, be not sufficient, there be many others, which will of\nthemselves intend this passion of burning lust, amongst which, dancing is\nnone of the least; and it is an engine of such force, I may not omit it.\n_Incitamentum libidinis_, Petrarch calls it, the spur of lust. \"A [5141]\ncircle of which the devil himself is the centre. [5142]Many women that use\nit, have come dishonest home, most indifferent, none better.\" [5143]\nAnother terms it \"the companion of all filthy delights and enticements, and\n'tis not easily told what inconveniences come by it, what scurrile talk,\nobscene actions,\" and many times such monstrous gestures, such lascivious\nmotions, such wanton tunes, meretricious kisses, homely embracings.\n\n[5144]  ------\"(ut Gaditana canoro\n        Incipiat prurire choro, plausuque probatae\n        Ad terram tremula descendant clune puellae,\n        Irritamentum Veneris languentis)\"------\n\nthat it will make the spectators mad. When that epitomiser of [5145]Trogus\nhad to the full described and set out King Ptolemy's riot as a chief engine\nand instrument of his overthrow, he adds, _tympanum et tripudium_, fiddling\nand dancing: \"the king was not a spectator only, but a principal actor\nhimself.\" A thing nevertheless frequently used, and part of a gentlewoman's\nbringing up, to sing, dance, and play on the lute, or some such instrument,\nbefore she can say her paternoster, or ten commandments. 'Tis the next way\ntheir parents think to get them husbands, they are compelled to learn, and\nby that means, [5146]_Incoestos amores de tenero meditantur ungue_; 'tis a\ngreat allurement as it is often used, and many are undone by it. Thais, in\nLucian, inveigled Lamprias in a dance, Herodias so far pleased Herod, that\nshe made him swear to give her what she would ask, John Baptist's head in a\nplatter. [5147]Robert, Duke of Normandy, riding by Falais, spied Arlette, a\nfair maid, as she danced on a green, and was so much enamoured with the\nobject, that [5148]she must needs lie with her that night. Owen Tudor won\nQueen Catherine's affection in. a dance, falling by chance with his head in\nher lap. Who cannot parallel these stories out of his experience?\nSpeusippas a noble gallant in [5149]that Greek Aristenaetus, seeing\nPanareta a fair young gentlewoman dancing by accident, was so far in love\nwith her, that for a long time after he could think of nothing but\nPanareta: he came raving home full of Panareta: \"Who would not admire her,\nwho would not love her, that should but see her dance as I did? O\nadmirable, O divine Panareta! I have seen old and new Rome, many fair\ncities, many proper women, but never any like to Panareta, they are dross,\ndowdies all to Panareta! O how she danced, how she tripped, how she turned,\nwith what a grace! happy is that man that shall enjoy her. O most\nincomparable, only, Panareta!\" When Xenophon, in _Symposio_, or Banquet,\nhad discoursed of love, and used all the engines that might be devised, to\nmove Socrates, amongst the rest, to stir him the more, he shuts up all with\na pleasant interlude or dance of Dionysius and Ariadne. [5150]\"First\nAriadne dressed like a bride came in and took her place; by and by\nDionysius entered, dancing to the music. The spectators did all admire the\nyoung man's carriage; and Ariadne herself was so much affected with the\nsight, that she could scarce sit. After a while Dionysius beholding\nAriadne, and incensed with love, bowing to her knees, embraced her first,\nand kissed her with a grace; she embraced him again, and kissed him with\nlike affection, &c., as the dance required; but they that stood by, and saw\nthis, did much applaud and commend them both for it. And when Dionysius\nrose up, he raised her up with him, and many pretty gestures, embraces,\nkisses, and love compliments passed between them: which when they saw fair\nBacchus and beautiful Ariadne so sweetly and so unfeignedly kissing each\nother, so really embracing, they swore they loved indeed, and were so\ninflamed with the object, that they began to rouse up themselves, as if\nthey would have flown. At the last when they saw them still, so willingly\nembracing, and now ready to go to the bride-chamber, they were so ravished,\nwith it, that they that were unmarried, swore they would forthwith marry,\nand those that were married called instantly for their horses, and galloped\nhome to their wives.\" What greater motive can there be than this burning\nlust? what so violent an oppugner? Not without good cause therefore so many\ngeneral councils condemn it, so many fathers abhor it, so many grave men\nspeak against it; \"Use not the company of a woman,\" saith Siracides, 8. 4.\n\"that is a singer, or a dancer; neither hear, lest thou be taken in her\ncraftiness.\" _In circo non tam cernitur quam discitur libido_. [5151]Haedus\nholds, lust in theatres is not seen, but learned. Gregory Nazianzen that\neloquent divine, ([5152]as he relates the story himself,) when a noble\nfriend of his solemnly invited him with other bishops, to his daughter\nOlympia's wedding, refused to come: [5153]\"For it is absurd to see an old\ngouty bishop sit amongst dancers;\" he held it unfit to be a spectator, much\nless an actor. _Nemo saltat sobrius_, Tully writes, he is not a sober man\nthat danceth; for some such reason (belike) Domitian forbade the Roman\nsenators to dance, and for that fact removed many of them from the senate.\nBut these, you will say, are lascivious and Pagan dances, 'tis the abuse\nthat causeth such inconvenience, and I do not well therefore to condemn,\nspeak against, or \"innocently to accuse the best and pleasantest thing (so\n[5154]Lucian calls it) that belongs to mortal men.\" You misinterpret, I\ncondemn it not; I hold it notwithstanding an honest disport, a lawful\nrecreation, if it be opportune, moderately and soberly used: I am of\nPlutarch's mind, [5155]\"that which respects pleasure alone, honest\nrecreation, or bodily exercise, ought not to be rejected and contemned:\" I\nsubscribe to [5156]Lucian, \"'tis an elegant thing, which cheereth up the\nmind, exerciseth the body, delights the spectators, which teacheth many\ncomely gestures, equally affecting the ears, eyes, and soul itself.\"\nSallust discommends singing and dancing in Sempronia, not that she did sing\nor dance, but that she did it in excess, 'tis the abuse of it; and\nGregory's refusal doth not simply condemn it, but in some folks. Many will\nnot allow men and women to dance together, because it is a provocation to\nlust: they may as well, with Lycurgus and Mahomet, cut down all vines,\nforbid the drinking of wine, for that it makes some men drunk.\n\n[5157] \"Nihil prodest quod non laedere posset idem;\n        Igne quid utilius?\"------\n\nI say of this as of all other honest recreations, they are like fire, good\nand bad, and I see no such inconvenience, but that they may so dance, if it\nbe done at due times, and by fit persons: and conclude with Wolfungus\n[5158]Hider, and most of our modern divines: _Si decorae, graves,\nverecundae, plena luce bonorum virorum et matronarum honestarum, tempestive\nfiant, probari possunt, et debent_. \"There is a time to mourn, a time to\ndance,\" Eccles. iii. 4. Let them take their pleasures then, and as [5159]\nhe said of old, \"young men and maids flourishing in their age, fair and\nlovely to behold, well attired, and of comely carriage, dancing a Greek\ngalliard, and as their dance required, kept their time, now turning, now\ntracing, now apart now altogether, now a courtesy then a caper,\" &c., and\nit was a pleasant sight to see those pretty knots, and swimming figures.\nThe sun and moon (some say) dance about the earth, the three upper planets\nabout the sun as their centre, now stationary, now direct, now retrograde,\nnow in apogee, then in perigee, now swift then slow, occidental, oriental,\nthey turn round, jump and trace, [Symbol: Mars] and [Symbol: Mercury] about\nthe sun with those thirty-three Maculae or Bourbonian planet, _circa Solem\nsaltantes Cytharedum_, saith Fromundus. Four Medicean stars dance about\nJupiter, two Austrian about Saturn, &c., and all (belike) to the music of\nthe spheres. Our greatest counsellors, and staid senators, at some times\ndance, as David before the ark, 2 Sam. vi. 14. Miriam, Exod. xv. 20.\nJudith, xv. 13. (though the devil hence perhaps hath brought in those bawdy\nbacchanals), and well may they do it. The greatest soldiers, as [5160]\nQuintilianus, [5161]Aemilius Probus, [5162]Coelius Rhodiginus, have proved\nat large, still use it in Greece, Rome, and the most worthy senators,\n_cantare, saltare_. Lucian, Macrobius, Libanus, Plutarch, Julius, Pollux,\nAthenaeus, have written just tracts in commendation of it. In this our age\nit is in much request in those countries, as in all civil commonwealths, as\nAlexander ab Alexandro, _lib. 4. cap. 10. et lib. 2. cap. 25._ hath proved\nat large, [5163]amongst the barbarians themselves none so precious; all the\nworld allows it.\n\n[5164] \"Divitias contemno tuas, rex Craese, tuamque\n        Vendo Asiam, unguentis, flore, mero, choreis.\"\n\n[5165]Plato, in his Commonwealth, will have dancing-schools to be\nmaintained, \"that young folks might meet, be acquainted, see one another,\nand be seen;\" nay more, he would have them dance naked; and scoffs at them\nthat laugh at it. But Eusebius _praepar. Evangel. lib. 1. cap. 11._ and\nTheodoret _lib. 9. curat. graec. affect_. worthily lash him for it; and\nwell they might: for as one saith, [5166]\"the very sight of naked parts\ncauseth enormous, exceeding concupiscences, and stirs up both men and women\nto burning lust.\" There is a mean in all things: this is my censure in\nbrief; dancing is a pleasant recreation of body and mind, if sober and\nmodest (such as our Christian dances are); if tempestively used, a furious\nmotive to burning lust; if as by Pagans heretofore, unchastely abused. But\nI proceed.\n\nIf these allurements do not take place, for [5167]Simierus, that great\nmaster of dalliance, shall not behave himself better, the more effectually\nto move others, and satisfy their lust, they will swear and lie, promise,\nprotest, forge, counterfeit, brag, bribe, flatter and dissemble of all\nsides. 'Twas Lucretia's counsel in Aretine, _Si vis amica frui, promitte,\nfinge, jura, perjura, jacta, simula, mentire_; and they put it well in\npractice, as Apollo to Daphne,\n\n[5168]  ------\"mihi Delphica tellus\n        Et Claros et Tenedos, patareaque regia servit,\n        Jupiter est genitor\"------\n\n       \"Delphos, Claros, and Tenedos serve me,\n        And Jupiter is known my sire to be.\"\n\n[5169]The poorest swains will do as much, [5170]_Mille pecus nivei sunt et\nmihi vallibus agni_; \"I have a thousand sheep, good store of cattle, and\nthey are all at her command,\"\n\n[5171]  ------\"Tibi nos, tibi nostra supellex,\n        Ruraque servierint\"------\n\n\"house, land, goods, are at her service,\" as he is himself. Dinomachus, a\nsenator's son in [5172]Lucian, in love with a wench inferior to him in\nbirth and fortunes, the sooner to accomplish his desire, wept unto her, and\nswore he loved her with all his heart, and her alone, and that as soon as\never his father died (a very rich man and almost decrepit) he would make\nher his wife. The maid by chance made her mother acquainted with the\nbusiness, who being an old fox, well experienced in such matters, told her\ndaughter, now ready to yield to his desire, that he meant nothing less, for\ndost thou think he will ever care for thee, being a poor wench, [5173]that\nmay have his choice of all the beauties in the city, one noble by birth,\nwith so many talents, as young, better qualified, and fairer than thyself?\ndaughter believe him not: the maid was abashed, and so the matter broke\noff. When Jupiter wooed Juno first (Lilius Giraldus relates it out of an\nold comment on Theocritus) the better to effect his suit, he turned himself\ninto a cuckoo, and spying her one day walking alone, separated from the\nother goddesses, caused a tempest suddenly to arise, for fear of which she\nfled to shelter; Jupiter to avoid the storm likewise flew into her lap, _in\nvirginis Junonis gremium devolavit_, whom Juno for pity covered in her\n[5174]apron. But he turned himself forthwith into his own shape, began to\nembrace and offer violence unto her, _sed illa matris metu abnuebat_, but\nshe by no means would yield, _donec pollicitus connubium obtinuit_, till he\nvowed and swore to marry her, and then she gave consent. This fact was done\nat Thornax hill, which ever after was called Cuckoo hill, and in perpetual\nremembrance there was a temple erected to Telia Juno in the same place. So\npowerful are fair promises, vows, oaths and protestations. It is an\nordinary thing too in this case to belie their age, which widows usually\ndo, that mean to marry again, and bachelors too sometimes,\n\n[5175] \"Cujus octavum trepidavit aetas,\n        cernere lustrum;\"\n\nto say they are younger than they are. Carmides in the said Lucian loved\nPhilematium, an old maid of forty-five years; [5176]she swore to him she\nwas but thirty-two next December. But to dissemble in this kind, is\nfamiliar of all sides, and often it takes. [5177]_Fallere credentem res est\noperosa puellam_, 'tis soon done, no such great mastery, _Egregiam vero\nlaudem, et spolia ampla_,--and nothing so frequent as to belie their\nestates, to prefer their suits, and to advance themselves. Many men to\nfetch over a young woman, widows, or whom they love, will not stick to\ncrack, forge and feign any thing comes next, bid his boy fetch his cloak,\nrapier, gloves, jewels, &c. in such a chest, scarlet-golden-tissue\nbreeches, &c. when there is no such matter; or make any scruple to give\nout, as he did in Petronius, that he was master of a ship, kept so many\nservants, and to personate their part the better take upon them to be\ngentlemen of good houses, well descended and allied, hire apparel at\nbrokers, some scavenger or prick-louse tailors to attend upon them for the\ntime, swear they have great possessions, [5178]bribe, lie, cog, and foist\nhow dearly they love, how bravely they will maintain her, like any lady,\ncountess, duchess, or queen; they shall have gowns, tiers, jewels, coaches,\nand caroches, choice diet,\n\n       \"The heads of parrots, tongues of nightingales,\n        The brains of peacocks, and of ostriches,\n        Their bath shall be the juice of gilliflowers,\n        Spirit of roses and of violets,\n        The milk of unicorns,\" &c.\n\nas old Volpone courted Celia in the [5179]comedy, when as they are no such\nmen, not worth a groat, but mere sharkers, to make a fortune, to get their\ndesire, or else pretend love to spend their idle hours, to be more welcome,\nand for better entertainment. The conclusion is, they mean nothing less,\n\n[5180] \"Nil metuunt jurare, nihil promittere curant:\n        Sed simul accupidae mentis satiata libido est,\n        Dicta nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant;\"\n\n       \"Oaths, vows, promises, are much protested;\n        But when their mind and lust is satisfied,\n        Oaths, vows, promises, are quite neglected;\"\n\nthough he solemnly swear by the genius of Caesar, by Venus' shrine, Hymen's\ndeity, by Jupiter, and all the other gods, give no credit to his words. For\nwhen lovers swear, Venus laughs, _Venus haec perjuria ridet_, [5181]Jupiter\nhimself smiles, and pardons it withal, as grave [5182]Plato gives out; of\nall perjury, that alone for love matters is forgiven by the gods. If\npromises, lies, oaths, and protestations will not avail, they fall to\nbribes, tokens, gifts, and such like feats. [5183]_Plurimus auro\nconciliatur amor_: as Jupiter corrupted Danae with a golden shower, and\nLiber Ariadne with a lovely crown, (which was afterwards translated into\nthe heavens, and there for ever shines;) they will rain chickens, florins,\ncrowns, angels, all manner of coins and stamps in her lap. And so must he\ncertainly do that will speed, make many feasts, banquets, invitations, send\nher some present or other every foot. _Summo studio parentur epulae_ (saith\n[5184]Haedus) _et crebrae fiant largitiones_, he must be very bountiful and\nliberal, seek and sue, not to her only, but to all her followers, friends,\nfamiliars, fiddlers, panders, parasites, and household servants; he must\ninsinuate himself, and surely will, to all, of all sorts, messengers,\nporters, carriers; no man must be unrewarded, or unrespected. I had a\nsuitor (saith [5185]Aretine's Lucretia) that when he came to my house,\nflung gold and silver about, as if it had been chaff. Another suitor I had\nwas a very choleric fellow; but I so handled him, that for all his fuming,\nI brought him upon his knees. If there had been an excellent bit in the\nmarket, any novelty, fish, fruit, or fowl, muscatel, or malmsey, or a cup\nof neat wine in all the city, it was presented presently to me; though\nnever so dear, hard to come by, yet I had it: the poor fellow was so fond\nat last, that I think if I would I might have had one of his eyes out of\nhis head. A third suitor was a merchant of Rome, and his manner of wooing\nwas with [5186]exquisite music, costly banquets, poems, &c. I held him off\ntill at length he protested, promised, and swore _pro virginitate regno me\ndonaturum_, I should have all he had, house, goods, and lauds, _pro\nconcubitu solo_; [5187]neither was there ever any conjuror, I think, to\ncharm his spirits that used such attention, or mighty words, as he did\nexquisite phrases, or general of any army so many stratagems to win a city,\nas he did tricks and devices to get the love of me. Thus men are active and\npassive, and women not far behind them in this kind: _Audax ad omnia\nfoemina, quae vel amat, vel odit_.\n\n[5188] _For half so boldly there can non\n        Swear and lye as women can_.\n\n[5189]They will crack, counterfeit, and collogue as well as the best, with\nhandkerchiefs, and wrought nightcaps, purses, posies, and such toys: as he\njustly complained,\n\n[5190] \"Cur mittis violas? nempe ut violentius uret;\n        Quid violas violis me violenta tuis?\" &c.\n\n       \"Why dost thou send me violets, my dear?\n        To make me burn more violent, I fear,\n        With violets too violent thou art,\n        To violate and wound my gentle heart.\"\n\nWhen nothing else will serve, the last refuge is their tears. _Haec scripsi\n(testor amorem) mixta lachrymis et suspiriis_, 'twixt tears and sighs, I\nwrite this (I take love to witness), saith [5191]Chelidonia to Philonius.\n_Lumina quae modo fulmina, jam flumina lachrymarum_, those burning torches\nare now turned to floods of tears. Aretine's Lucretia, when her sweetheart\ncame to town, [5192]wept in his bosom, \"that he might be persuaded those\ntears were shed for joy of his return.\" Quartilla in Petronius, when nought\nwould move, fell a weeping, and as Balthazar Castilio paints them out,\n[5193]\"To these crocodile's tears they will add sobs, fiery sighs, and\nsorrowful countenance, pale colour, leanness, and if you do but stir\nabroad, these fiends are ready to meet you at every turn, with such a\nsluttish neglected habit, dejected look, as if they were now ready to die\nfor your sake; and how, saith he, shall a young novice thus beset, escape?\"\nBut believe them not.\n\n[5194]  ------\"animam ne crede puellis,\n        Namque est foeminea tutior unda fide.\"\n\nThou thinkest, peradventure, because of her vows, tears, smiles, and\nprotestations, she is solely thine, thou hast her heart, hand, and\naffection, when as indeed there is no such matter, as the [5195]Spanish\nbawd said, _gaudet illa habere unum in lecto, alterum in porta, tertium qui\ndomi suspiret_, she will have one sweetheart in bed, another in the gate, a\nthird sighing at home, a fourth, &c. Every young man she sees and likes\nhath as much interest, and shall as soon enjoy her as thyself. On the other\nside, which I have said, men are as false, let them swear, protest, and\nlie; [5196]_Quod vobis dicunt, dixerunt mille puellis_. They love some of\nthem those eleven thousand virgins at once, and make them believe, each\nparticular, he is besotted on her, or love one till they see another, and\nthen her alone; like Milo's wife in Apuleius, _lib. 2._ _Si quem\nconspexerit speciosae formae invenem, venustate ejus sumitur, et in eum\nanimum intorquet_. 'Tis their common compliment in that case, they care not\nwhat they swear, say or do: One while they slight them, care not for them,\nrail downright and scoff at them, and then again they will run mad, hang\nthemselves, stab and kill, if they may not enjoy them. Henceforth,\ntherefore,--_nulla viro juranti foemina credat_, let not maids believe\nthem. These tricks and counterfeit passions are more familiar with women,\n[5197]_finem hic dolori faciet aut vitae dies, miserere amantis_, quoth\nPhaedra to Hippolitus. Joessa, in [5198]Lucian, told Pythias, a young man,\nto move him the more, that if he would not have her, she was resolved to\nmake away herself. \"There is a Nemesis, and it cannot choose but grieve and\ntrouble thee, to hear that I have either strangled or drowned myself for\nthy sake.\" Nothing so common to this sex as oaths, vows, and protestations,\nand as I have already said, tears, which they have at command; for they can\nso weep, that one would think their very hearts were dissolved within them,\nand would come out in tears; their eyes are like rocks, which still drop\nwater, _diariae lachrymae et sudoris in modum lurgeri promptae_, saith\n[5199] Aristaenetus, they wipe away their tears like sweat, weep with one\neye, laugh with the other; or as children [5200]weep and cry, they can both\ntogether.\n\n[5201] \"Neve puellarum lachrymis moveare memento,\n        Ut flerent oculos erudiere suos.\"\n\n       \"Care not for women's tears, I counsel thee,\n        They teach their eyes as much to weep as see.\"\n\nAnd as much pity is to be taken of a woman weeping, as of a goose going\nbarefoot. When Venus lost her son Cupid, she sent a crier about, to bid\nevery one that met him take heed.\n\n[5202] \"Si fleatam aspicias, ne mox fallare, caveto;\n        Sin arridebit, magis effuge; et oscula si fors\n        Ferre volet, fugito; sunt oscula noxia, in ipsis\n        Suntque venena labris\" &c.\n\n       \"Take heed of Cupid's tears, if cautious.\n        And of his smiles and kisses I thee tell,\n        If that he offer't, for they be noxious,\n        And very poison in his lips doth dwell.\"\n\n[5203]A thousand years, as Castilio conceives, \"will scarce serve to reckon\nup those allurements and guiles, that men and women use to deceive one\nanother with.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Bawds, Philters, Causes_.\n\nWhen all other engines fail, that they can proceed no farther of\nthemselves, their last refuge is to fly to bawds, panders, magical\nphilters, and receipts; rather than fail, to the devil himself. _Flectere\nsi nequeunt superos, Acheronta movebunt_. And by those indirect means many\na man is overcome, and precipitated into this malady, if he take not good\nheed. For these bawds, first, they are everywhere so common, and so many,\nthat, as he said of old [5204]Croton, _omnes hic aut captantur, aut\ncaptant_, either inveigle or be inveigled, we may say of most of our\ncities, there be so many professed, cunning bawds in them. Besides, bawdry\nis become an art, or a liberal science, as Lucian calls it; and there be\nsuch tricks and subtleties, so many nurses, old women, panders, letter\ncarriers, beggars, physicians, friars, confessors, employed about it, that\n_nullus tradere stilus sufficiat_, one saith,\n\n[5205]  ------\"trecentis versibus\n        Suas impuritias traloqui nemo potest.\"\n\nSuch occult notes, stenography, polygraphy, _Nuntius animatus_, or\nmagnetical telling of their minds, which [5206]Cabeus the Jesuit, by the\nway, counts fabulous and false; cunning conveyances in this kind, that\nneither Juno's jealousy, nor Danae's custody, nor Argo's vigilancy can keep\nthem safe. 'Tis the last and common refuge to use an assistant, such as\nthat Catanean Philippa was to Joan Queen of Naples, a [5207]bawd's help, an\nold woman in the business, as [5208]Myrrha did when she doted on Cyniras,\nand could not compass her desire, the old jade her nurse was ready at a\npinch, _dic inquit, opemque me sine ferre tibi--et in hac mea (pone\ntimorem) Sedulitas erit apta libi_, fear it not, if it be possible to be\ndone, I will effect it: _non est mulieri mulier insuperabilis_,\n[5209]Caelestina said, let him or her be never so honest, watched and\nreserved, 'tis hard but one of these old women will get access: and scarce\nshall you find, as [5210]Austin observes, in a nunnery a maid alone, \"if\nshe cannot have egress, before her window you shall have an old woman, or\nsome prating gossip, tell her some tales of this clerk, and that monk,\ndescribing or commending some young gentleman or other unto her.\" \"As I was\nwalking in the street\" (saith a good fellow in Petronius) \"to see the town\nserved one evening, [5211]I spied an old woman in a corner selling of\ncabbages and roots\" (as our hucksters do plums, apples, and such like\nfruits); \"mother\" (quoth he) \"can you tell where I can dwell? she, being\nwell pleased with my foolish urbanity, replied, and why, sir, should I not\ntell? With that she rose up and went before me. I took her for a wise\nwoman, and by-and-by she led me into a by-lane, and told me there I should\ndwell. I replied again, I knew not the house; but I perceived, on a sudden,\nby the naked queans, that I was now come into a bawdy-house, and then too\nlate I began to curse the treachery of this old jade.\" Such tricks you\nshall have in many places, and amongst the rest it is ordinary in Venice,\nand in the island of Zante, for a man to be bawd to his own wife. No sooner\nshall you land or come on shore, but, as the Comical Poet hath it,\n\n[5212] \"Morem hunc meretrices habent,\n        Ad portum mittunt servulos, ancillulas,\n        Si qua peregrina navis in portum aderit,\n        Rogant cujatis sit, quod ei nomen siet,\n        Post illae extemplo sese adplicent.\"\n\nThese white devils have their panders, bawds, and factors in every place to\nseek about, and bring in customers, to tempt and waylay novices, and silly\ntravellers. And when they have them once within their clutches, as Aegidius\nMascrius in his comment upon Valerius Flaccus describes them, [5213]\"with\npromises and pleasant discourse, with gifts, tokens, and taking their\nopportunities, they lay nets which Lucretia cannot avoid, and baits that\nHippolitus himself would swallow; they make such strong assaults and\nbatteries, that the goddess of virginity cannot withstand them: give gifts\nand bribes to move Penelope, and with threats able to terrify Susanna. How\nmany Proserpinas, with those catchpoles, doth Pluto take? These are the\nsleepy rods with which their souls touched descend to hell; this the glue\nor lime with which the wings of the mind once taken cannot fly away; the\ndevil's ministers to allure, entice,\" &c. Many young men and maids, without\nall question, are inveigled by these Eumenides and their associates. But\nthese are trivial and well known. The most sly, dangerous, and cunning\nbawds, are your knavish physicians, empirics, mass-priests, monks, [5214]\nJesuits, and friars. Though it be against Hippocrates' oath, some of them\nwill give a dram, promise to restore maidenheads, and do it without danger,\nmake an abortion if need be, keep down their paps, hinder conception,\nprocure lust, make them able with Satyrions, and now and then step in\nthemselves. No monastery so close, house so private, or prison so well\nkept, but these honest men are admitted to censure and ask questions, to\nfeel their pulse beat at their bedside, and all under pretence of giving\nphysic. Now as for monks, confessors, and friars, as he said,\n\n[5215] \"Non audet Stygius Pluto tentare quod audet\n        Effrenis monachus, plenaque fraudis anus;\"\n\n       \"That Stygian Pluto dares not tempt or do,\n        What an old hag or monk will undergo;\"\n\neither for himself to satisfy his own lust; for another, if he be hired\nthereto, or both at once, having such excellent means. For under colour of\nvisitation, auricular confession, comfort and penance, they have free\negress and regress, and corrupt, God knows, how many. They can such trades,\nsome of them, practise physic, use exorcisms, &c.\n\n[5216] _That whereas was wont to walk and Elf,\n        There now walks the Limiter himself,\n        In every bush and under every tree,\n        There needs no other Incubus but he_.\n\n[5217]In the mountains between Dauphine and Savoy, the friars persuaded the\ngood wives to counterfeit themselves possessed, that their husbands might\ngive them free access, and were so familiar in those days with some of\nthem, that, as one [5218]observes, \"wenches could not sleep in their beds\nfor necromantic friars:\" and the good abbess in Boccaccio may in some sort\nwitness, that rising betimes, mistook and put on the friar's breeches\ninstead of her veil or hat. You have heard the story, I presume, of [5219]\nPaulina, a chaste matron in Aegesippus, whom one of Isis's priests did\nprostitute to Mundus, a young knight, and made her believe it was their god\nAnubis. Many such pranks are played by our Jesuits, sometimes in their own\nhabits, sometimes in others, like soldiers, courtiers, citizens, scholars,\ngallants, and women themselves. Proteus-like, in all forms and disguises,\nthat go abroad in the night, to inescate and beguile young women, or to\nhave their pleasure of other men's wives; and, if we may believe [5220]\nsome relations, they have wardrobes of several suits in the colleges for\nthat purpose. Howsoever in public they pretend much zeal, seem to be very\nholy men, and bitterly preach against adultery, fornication, there are no\nverier bawds or whoremasters in a country; [5221]\"whose soul they should\ngain to God, they sacrifice to the devil.\" But I spare these men for the\npresent.\n\nThe last battering engines are philters, amulets, spells, charms, images,\nand such unlawful means: if they cannot prevail of themselves by the help\nof bawds, panders, and their adherents, they will fly for succour to the\ndevil himself. I know there be those that deny the devil can do any such\nthing (Crato _epist. 2. lib. med._), and many divines, there is no other\nfascination than that which comes by the eyes, of which I have formerly\nspoken, and if you desire to be better informed, read Camerarius, _oper\nsubcis. cent. 2. c. 5._ It was given out of old, that a Thessalian wench\nhad bewitched King Philip to dote upon her, and by philters enforced his\nlove; but when Olympia, the Queen, saw the maid of an excellent beauty,\nwell brought up, and qualified--these, quoth she, were the philters which\ninveigled King Philip; those the true charms, as Henry to Rosamond,\n\n[5222] \"One accent from thy lips the blood more warms,\n        Than all their philters, exorcisms, and charms.\"\n\nWith this alone Lucretia brags [5223]in Aretine, she could do more than all\nphilosophers, astrologers, alchemists, necromancers, witches, and the rest\nof the crew. As for herbs and philters, I could never skill of them, \"The\nsole philter that ever I used was kissing and embracing, by which alone I\nmade men rave like beasts stupefied, and compelled them to worship me like\nan idol.\" In our times it is a common thing, saith Erastus, in his book _de\nLamiis_, for witches to take upon them the making of these philters,\n[5224]\"to force men and women to love and hate whom they will, to cause\ntempests, diseases,\" &c., by charms, spells, characters, knots.--[5225]_hic\nThessala vendit Philtra_. St. Hierome proves that they can do it (as in\nHilarius' life, _epist. lib. 3_); he hath a story of a young man, that with\na philter made a maid mad for the love of him, which maid was after cured\nby Hilarion. Such instances I find in John Nider, _Formicar. lib. 5. cap.\n5._ Plutarch records of Lucullus that he died of a philter; and that\nCleopatra used philters to inveigle Antony, amongst other allurements.\nEusebius reports as much of Lucretia the poet. Panormitan, _lib. 4. de\ngest. Aphonsi_, hath a story of one Stephan, a Neapolitan knight, that by a\nphilter was forced to run mad for love. But of all others, that which\n[5226]Petrarch, _epist. famil. lib. 1. ep. 5_, relates of Charles the Great\n(Charlemagne) is most memorable. He foolishly doted upon a woman of mean\nfavour and condition, many years together, wholly delighting in her\ncompany, to the great grief and indignation of his friends and followers.\nWhen she was dead, he did embrace her corpse, as Apollo did the bay-tree\nfor his Daphne, and caused her coffin (richly embalmed and decked with\njewels) to be carried about with him, over which he still lamented. At last\na venerable bishop, that followed his court, prayed earnestly to God\n(commiserating his lord and master's case) to know the true cause of this\nmad passion, and whence it proceeded; it was revealed to him, in fine,\n\"that the cause of the emperor's mad love lay under the dead woman's\ntongue.\" The bishop went hastily to the carcass, and took a small ring\nthence; upon the removal the emperor abhorred the corpse, and, instead\n[5227]of it, fell as furiously in love with the bishop, he would not suffer\nhim to be out of his presence; which when the bishop perceived, he flung\nthe ring into the midst of a great lake, where the king then was. From that\nhour the emperor neglected all his other houses, dwelt at [5228]Ache, built\na fair house in the midst of the marsh, to his infinite expense, and a\n[5229]temple by it, where after he was buried, and in which city all his\nposterity ever since use to be crowned. Marcus the heretic is accused by\nIrenaeus, to have inveigled a young maid by this means; and some writers\nspeak hardly of the Lady Katharine Cobham, that by the same art she\ncircumvented Humphrey Duke of Gloucester to be her husband. Sycinius\nAemilianus summoned [5230]Apuleius to come before Cneius Maximus, proconsul\nof Africa, that he being a poor fellow, \"had bewitched by philters\nPudentilla, an ancient rich matron, to love him,\" and, being worth so many\nthousand sesterces, to be his wife. Agrippa, _lib. 1. cap. 48. occult.\nphilos._ attributes much in this kind to philters, amulets, images: and\nSalmutz _com. in Pancirol. Tit. 10. de Horol._ Leo Afer, _lib. 3_, saith,\n'tis an ordinary practice at Fez in Africa, _Praestigiatores ibi plures,\nqui cogunt amores et concubitus_: as skilful all out as that hyperborean\nmagician, of whom Cleodemus, in [5231] Lucian, tells so many fine feats\nperformed in this kind. But Erastus, Wierus, and others are against it;\nthey grant indeed such things may be done, but (as Wierus discourseth,\n_lib. 3. de Lamiis. cap. 37._) not by charms, incantations, philters, but\nthe devil himself; _lib. 5. cap. 2._ he contends as much; so doth\nFreitagius, _noc. med. cap. 74._ Andreas Cisalpinus, _cap. 5_; and so much\nSigismundus Scheretzius, _cap. 9. de hirco nocturno_, proves at large.\n[5232]\"Unchaste women by the help of these witches, the devil's kitchen\nmaids, have their loves brought to them in the night, and carried back\nagain by a phantasm flying in the air in the likeness of a goat. I have\nheard\" (saith he) \"divers confess, that they have been so carried on a\ngoat's back to their sweethearts, many miles in a night.\" Others are of\nopinion that these feats, which most suppose to be done by charms and\nphilters, are merely effected by natural causes, as by man's blood\nchemically prepared, which much avails, saith Ernestus Burgravius, _in\nLucerna vitae et mortis Indice, ad amorem conciliandum et odium_, (so\nhuntsmen make their dogs love them, and farmers their pullen,) 'tis an\nexcellent philter, as he holds, _sed vulgo prodere grande nefas_, but not\nfit to be made common: and so be _Mala insana_, mandrake roots, mandrake\n[5233]apples, precious stones, dead men's clothes, candles, _mala Bacchica,\npanis porcinus, Hyppomanes_, a certain hair in a [5234]wolf's tail, &c., of\nwhich Rhasis, Dioscorides, Porta, Wecker, Rubeus, Mizaldus, Albertus,\ntreat: a swallow's heart, dust of a dove's heart, _multum valent linguae\nviperarum, cerebella asinorum, tela equina, palliola quibus infantes\nobvoluti nascuntur, funis strangulati hominis, lapis de nido Aquilae_, &c.\nSee more in Sckenkius _observat. medicinal, lib. 4._ &c., which are as\nforcible and of as much virtue as that fountain Salmacis in [5235]\nVitruvius, Ovid, Strabo, that made all such mad for love that drank of it,\nor that hot bath at [5236]Aix in Germany, wherein Cupid once dipped his\narrows, which ever since hath a peculiar virtue to make them lovers all\nthat wash in it. But hear the poet's own description of it,\n\n[5237] \"Unde hic fervor aquis terra erumpentibus uda?\n          Tela olim hic ludens ignea tinxit amor;\n        Et gaudens stridore novo, fervete perennes\n          Inquit, et haec pharetrae sint monumenta meae.\n        Ex illo fervet, rarusque hic mergitur hospes,\n          Cui non titillet pectora blandus amor.\"\n\nThese above-named remedies have happily as much power as that bath of Aix,\nor Venus' enchanted girdle, in which, saith Natales Comes, \"Love toys and\ndalliance, pleasantness, sweetness, persuasions, subtleties, gentle\nspeeches, and all witchcraft to enforce love, was contained.\" Read more of\nthese in Agrippa _de occult. Philos. lib. 1. cap. 50. et 45._ _Malleus\nmalefic. part. 1. quaest. 7._ Delrio _tom. 2. quest. 3. lib. 3._ Wierus,\nPomponatis, _cap. 8. de incantat._ Ficinus, _lib. 13. Theol. Plat._\nCalcagninus, &c.\n\n\nMEMB. III.\n_Symptoms or signs of Love Melancholy, in Body, Mind, good, bad, &c._\n\nSymptoms are either of body or mind; of body, paleness, leanness, dryness,\n&c. [5238]_Pallidus omnis amans, color hic est aptus amanti_, as the poet\ndescribes lovers: _fecit amor maciem_, love causeth leanness. [5239]\nAvicenna _de Ilishi, c. 33._ \"makes hollow eyes, dryness, symptoms of this\ndisease, to go smiling to themselves, or acting as if they saw or heard\nsome delectable object.\" Valleriola, _lib. 3. observat. cap. 7._\nLaurentius, _cap. 10._ Aelianus Montaltus _de Her. amore_. Langius, _epist.\n24. lib. 1. epist. med._ deliver as much, _corpus exangue pallet, corpus\ngracile, oculi cavi_, lean, pale,--_ut nudis qui pressit calcibus anguem_,\n\"as one who trod with naked foot upon a snake,\" hollow-eyed, their eyes are\nhidden in their heads,--[5240]_Tenerque nitidi corposis cecidit decor_,\nthey pine away, and look ill with waking, cares, sighs.\n\n       \"Et qui tenebant signa Phoebeae facis\n        Oculi, nihil gentile nec patrium micant.\"\n\n\"And eyes that once rivalled the locks of Phoebus, lose the patrial and\npaternal lustre.\" With groans, griefs, sadness, dullness,\n\n[5241]  ------\"Nulla jam Cereris subi\n        Cura aut salutis\"------\n\nwant of appetite, &c. A reason of all this, [5242]Jason Pratensis gives,\n\"because of the distraction of the spirits the liver doth not perform his\npart, nor turns the aliment into blood as it ought, and for that cause the\nmembers are weak for want of sustenance, they are lean and pine, as the\nherbs of my garden do this month of May, for want of rain.\" The green\nsickness therefore often happeneth to young women, a cachexia or an evil\nhabit to men, besides their ordinary sighs, complaints, and lamentations,\nwhich are too frequent. As drops from a still,--_ut occluso stillat ab igne\nliquor_, doth Cupid's fire provoke tears from a true lover's eyes,\n\n[5243] \"The mighty Mars did oft for Venus shriek,\n        Privily moistening his horrid cheek\n        With womanish tears,\"------\n\n[5244]  ------\"ignis distillat in undas,\n        Testis erit largus qui rigat ora liquor,\"\n\nwith many such like passions. When Chariclia was enamoured of Theagines, as\n[5245]Heliodorus sets her out, \"she was half distracted, and spake she knew\nnot what, sighed to herself, lay much awake, and was lean upon a sudden:\"\nand when she was besotted on her son-in-law, [5246]_pallor deformis,\nmarcentes oculi_, &c., she had ugly paleness, hollow eyes, restless\nthoughts, short wind, &c. Euryalus, in an epistle sent to Lucretia, his\nmistress, complains amongst other grievances, _tu mihi et somni et cibi\nusum abstulisti_, thou hast taken my stomach and my sleep from me. So he\ndescribes it aright:\n\n[5247] _His sleep, his meat, his drink, in him bereft,\n        That lean he waxeth, and dry as a shaft,\n        His eyes hollow and grisly to behold,\n        His hew pale and ashen to unfold,\n        And solitary he was ever alone,\n        And waking all the night making moan_.\n\nTheocritus _Edyl. 2._ makes a fair maid of Delphos, in love with a young\nman of Minda, confess as much,\n\n       \"Ut vidi ut insanii, ut animus mihi male affectiis est,\n        Miserae mihi forma tabescebat, neque amplius pompam\n        Ullum curabam, aut quando domum redieram\n        Novi, sed me ardens quidam morbus consumebat,\n        Decubui in lecto dies decem, et noctes decem,\n        Defluebant capite capilli, ipsaque sola reliqua\n        Ossa et cutis\"------\n\n       \"No sooner seen I had, but mad I was.\n        My beauty fail'd, and I no more did care\n        For any pomp, I knew not where I was,\n        But sick I was, and evil I did fare;\n        I lay upon my bed ten days and nights,\n        A skeleton I was in all men's sights.\"\n\nAll these passions are well expressed by [5248]that heroical poet in the\nperson of Dido:\n\n       \"At non infelix animi Phaenissa, nec unquam\n        Solvitur in somnos, oculisque ac pectore amores\n        Accipit; ingeminant curae, rursusque resurgens\n        Saevit amor,\" &c.------\n\n       \"Unhappy Dido could not sleep at all,\n        But lies awake, and takes no rest:\n        And up she gets again, whilst care and grief,\n        And raging love torment her breast.\"\n\nAccius Sanazarius _Egloga 2. de Galatea_, in the same manner feigns his\nLychoris [5249]tormenting herself for want of sleep, sighing, sobbing, and\nlamenting; and Eustathius in his Ismenias much troubled, and [5250]\n\"panting at heart, at the sight of his mistress,\" he could not sleep, his\nbed was thorns. [5251]All make leanness, want of appetite, want of sleep\nordinary symptoms, and by that means they are brought often so low, so much\naltered and changed, that as [5252]he jested in the comedy, \"one scarce\nknow them to be the same men.\"\n\n       \"Attenuant juvenum vigilatae corpora noctes,\n        Curaque et immenso qui fit amore dolor.\"\n\nMany such symptoms there are of the body to discern lovers by,--_quis enim\nbene celet amorem_? Can a man, saith Solomon, Prov. vi. 27, carry fire in\nhis bosom and not burn? it will hardly be hid; though they do all they can\nto hide it, it must out, _plus quam mille notis_--it may be described,\n[5253]_quoque magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis_. 'Twas Antiphanes\nthe comedian's observation of old, Love and drunkenness cannot be\nconcealed, _Celare alia possis, haec praeter duo, vini potum_, &c. words,\nlooks, gestures, all will betray them; but two of the most notable signs\nare observed by the pulse and countenance. When Antiochus, the son of\nSeleucus, was sick for Stratonice, his mother-in-law, and would not confess\nhis grief, or the cause of his disease, Erasistratus, the physician, found\nhim by his pulse and countenance to be in love with her, [5254]\"because\nthat when she came in presence, or was named, his pulse varied, and he\nblushed besides.\" In this very sort was the love of Callices, the son of\nPolycles, discovered by Panacaeas the physician, as you may read the story\nat large in [5255]Aristenaetus. By the same signs Galen brags that he found\nout Justa, Boethius the consul's wife, to dote on Pylades the player,\nbecause at his name still she both altered pulse and countenance, as [5256]\nPolyarchus did at the name of Argenis. Franciscus Valesius, _l. 3. controv.\n13. med. contr._ denies there is any such _pulsus amatorius_, or that love\nmay be so discerned; but Avicenna confirms this of Galen out of his\nexperience, _lib. 3. Fen. 1._ and Gordonius, _cap. 20._ [5257]\"Their pulse,\nhe saith, is ordinate and swift, if she go by whom he loves,\" Langius,\n_epist. 24. lib. 1. med. epist._ Neviscanus, _lib. 4. numer. 66. syl.\nnuptialis_, Valescus de Taranta, Guianerius, _Tract. 15._ Valleriola sets\ndown this for a symptom, [5258]\"Difference of pulse, neglect of business,\nwant of sleep, often sighs, blushings, when there is any speech of their\nmistress, are manifest signs.\" But amongst the rest, Josephus Struthis,\nthat Polonian, in the fifth book, _cap. 17._ of his Doctrine of Pulses,\nholds that this and all other passions of the mind may be discovered by the\npulse. [5259]\"And if you will know, saith he, whether the men suspected be\nsuch or such, touch their arteries,\" &c. And in his fourth book, fourteenth\nchapter, he speaks of this particular pulse, [5260] \"Love makes an unequal\npulse,\" &c., he gives instance of a gentlewoman, [5261]a patient of his,\nwhom by this means he found to be much enamoured, and with whom: he named\nmany persons, but at the last when his name came whom he suspected,\n[5262]\"her pulse began to vary and to beat swifter, and so by often feeling\nher pulse, he perceived what the matter was.\" Apollonius _Argonaut. lib.\n4._ poetically setting down the meeting of Jason and Medea, makes them both\nto blush at one another's sight, and at the first they were not able to\nspeak.\n\n[5263]  ------\"totus Parmeno\n        Tremo, horreoque postquam aspexi hanc,\"\n\nPhaedria trembled at the sight of Thais, others sweat, blow short, _Crura\ntremunt ac poplites_,--are troubled with palpitation of heart upon the like\noccasion, _cor proximum ori_, saith [5264]Aristenaetus, their heart is at\ntheir mouth, leaps, these burn and freeze, (for love is fire, ice, hot,\ncold, itch, fever, frenzy, pleurisy, what not) they look pale, red, and\ncommonly blush at their first congress; and sometimes through violent\nagitation of spirits bleed at nose, or when she is talked of; which very\nsign [5265]Eustathius makes an argument of Ismene's affection, that when\nshe met her sweetheart by chance, she changed her countenance to a\nmaiden-blush. 'Tis a common thing amongst lovers, as [5266]Arnulphus, that\nmerry-conceited bishop, hath well expressed in a facetious epigram of his,\n\n       \"Alterno facies sibi dat responsa rubore,\n        Et tener affectum prodit utrique pudor,\" &c.\n\n       \"Their faces answer, and by blushing say,\n        How both affected are, they do betray.\"\n\nBut the best conjectures are taken from such symptoms as appear when they\nare both present; all their speeches, amorous glances, actions, lascivious\ngestures will betray them; they cannot contain themselves, but that they\nwill be still kissing. [5267]Stratocles, the physician, upon his\nwedding-day, when he was at dinner, _Nihil prius sorbillavit, quam tria\nbasia puellae pangeret_, could not eat his meat for kissing the bride, &c.\nFirst a word, and then a kiss, then some other compliment, and then a kiss,\nthen an idle question, then a kiss, and when he had pumped his wits dry,\ncan say no more, kissing and colling are never out of season, [5268]_Hoc\nnon deficit incipitque semper_, 'tis never at an end, [5269]another kiss,\nand then another, another, and another, &c.--_huc ades O Thelayra_--Come\nkiss me Corinna?\n\n[5270] \"Centum basia centies,\n        Centum basia millies,\n        Mille basia millies,\n        Et tot millia millies,\n        Quot guttae Siculo mari,\n          Quot sunt sidera coelo,\n\n        Istis purpureis genis,\n        Istis turgidulis labris,\n        Ocelisque loquaculis,\n        Figam continuo impetu;\n          O formosa Neaera.

So Venus did by her\nAdonis, the moon with Endymion, they are still dallying and culling, as so\nmany doves, _Columbatimque labra conserentes labiis_, and that with\nalacrity and courage,\n\n[5272] \"Affligunt avide corpus, junguntque salivas\n        Oris, et inspirant prensantes dentibus ora.\"\n\n[5273]_Tam impresso ore ut vix inde labra detrahant, cervice reclinata_,\n\"as Lamprias in Lucian kissed Thais, Philippus her [5274]Aristaenetus,\"\n_amore lymphato tam uriose adhaesit, ut vix labra solvere esset, totumque\nos mihi contrivit_; [5275]Aretine's Lucretia, by a suitor of hers was so\nsaluted, and 'tis their ordinary fashion.\n\n        ------\"dentes illudunt saepe labellis,\n        Atque premunt arete adfigentes oscula\"------\n\nThey cannot, I say, contain themselves, they will be still not only joining\nhands, kissing, but embracing, treading on their toes, &c., diving into\ntheir bosoms, and that _libenter, et cum delectatione_, as [5276]\nPhilostratus confesseth to his mistress; and Lamprias in Lucian, _Mammillas\npremens, per sinum clam dextra_, &c., feeling their paps, and that scarce\nhonestly sometimes: as the old man in the [5277]Comedy well observed of his\nson, _Non ego te videbam manum huic puellae in sinum insere_? Did not I see\nthee put thy hand into her bosom? go to, with many such love tricks.\n[5278]Juno in Lucian _deorum, tom. 3. dial. 3._ complains to Jupiter of\nIxion, [5279]\"he looked so attentively on her, and sometimes would sigh and\nweep in her company, and when I drank by chance, and gave Ganymede the cup,\nhe would desire to drink still in the very cup that I drank of, and in the\nsame place where I drank, and would kiss the cup, and then look steadily on\nme, and sometimes sigh, and then again smile.\" If it be so they cannot come\nnear to dally, have not that opportunity, familiarity, or acquaintance to\nconfer and talk together; yet if they be in presence, their eye will betray\nthem: _Ubi amor ibi oculus_, as the common saying is, \"where I look I like,\nand where I like I love;\" but they will lose themselves in her looks.\n\n       \"Alter in alterius jactantes lumina vultus,\n        Quaerebant taciti noster ubi esset amor.\"\n\n\"They cannot look off whom they love,\" they will _impregnare eam, ipsis\noculis_, deflower her with their eyes, be still gazing, staring, stealing\nfaces, smiling, glancing at her, as [5280]Apollo on Leucothoe, the moon on\nher [5281]Endymion, when she stood still in Caria, and at Latmos caused her\nchariot to be stayed. They must all stand and admire, or if she go by, look\nafter her as long as they can see her, she is _animae auriga_, as Anacreon\ncalls her, they cannot go by her door or window, but, as an adamant, she\ndraws their eyes to it; though she be not there present, they must needs\nglance that way, and look back to it. Aristenaetus of [5282] Exithemus,\nLucian, in his Imagim. of himself, and Tatius of Clitophon, say as much,\n_Ille oculos de Leucippe [5283]nunquam dejiciebat_, and many lovers confess\nwhen they came in their mistress' presence, they could not hold off their\neyes, but looked wistfully and steadily on her, _inconnivo aspectu_, with\nmuch eagerness and greediness, as if they would look through, or should\nnever have enough sight of her. _Fixis ardens obtutibus haeret_; so she\nwill do by him, drink to him with her eyes, nay, drink him up, devour him,\nswallow him, as Martial's Mamurra is remembered to have done: _Inspexit\nmolles pueros, oculisque comedit_, &c. There is a pleasant story to this\npurpose in _Navigat. Vertom. lib. 3. cap. 5._ The sultan of Sana's wife in\nArabia, because Vertomannus was fair and white, could not look off him,\nfrom sunrising to sunsetting; she could not desist; she made him one day\ncome into her chamber, _et geminae, horae spatio intuebatur, non a me\nanquam aciem oculorum avertebat, me observans veluti Cupidinem quendam_,\nfor two hours' space she still gazed on him. A young man in [5284]Lucian\nfell in love with Venus' picture; he came every morning to her temple, and\nthere continued all day long [5285]from sunrising to sunset, unwilling to\ngo home at night, sitting over against the goddess's picture, he did\ncontinually look upon her, and mutter to himself I know not what. If so be\nthey cannot see them whom they love, they will still be walking and waiting\nabout their mistress's doors, taking all opportunity to see them, as in\n[5286]Longus Sophista, Daphnis and Chloe, two lovers, were still hovering\nat one another's gates, he sought all occasions to be in her company, to\nhunt in summer, and catch birds in the frost about her father's house in\nthe winter, that she might see him, and he her. [5287]\"A king's palace was\nnot so diligently attended,\" saith Aretine's Lucretia, \"as my house was\nwhen I lay in Rome; the porch and street was ever full of some, walking or\nriding, on set purpose to see me; their eye was still upon my window; as\nthey passed by, they could not choose but look back to my house when they\nwere past, and sometimes hem or cough, or take some impertinent occasion to\nspeak aloud, that I might look out and observe them.\" 'Tis so in other\nplaces, 'tis common to every lover, 'tis all his felicity to be with her,\nto talk with her; he is never well but in her company, and will walk [5288]\n\"seven or eight times a day through the street where she dwells, and make\nsleeveless errands to see her;\" plotting still where, when, and how to\nvisit her,\n\n[5289] \"Levesque sub nocte susurri,\n        Composita repetuntur hora.\"\n\nAnd when he is gone, he thinks every minute an hour, every hour as long as\na day, ten days a whole year, till he see her again. [5290]_Tempora si\nnumeres, bene quae numeramus amantes._ And if thou be in love, thou wilt\nsay so too, _Et longum formosa, vale_, farewell sweetheart, _vale\ncharissima Argenis_, &c. Farewell my dear Argenis, once more farewell,\nfarewell. And though he is to meet her by compact, and that very shortly,\nperchance tomorrow, yet both to depart, he'll take his leave again, and\nagain, and then come back again, look after, and shake his hand, wave his\nhat afar off. Now gone, he thinks it long till he see her again, and she\nhim, the clocks are surely set back, the hour's past,\n\n[5291] \"Hospita Demophoon tua te Rodopheia Phillis,\n        Ultra promissum tempus abesse queror.\"\n\nShe looks out at window still to see whether he come, [5292]and by report\nPhillis went nine times to the seaside that day, to see if her Demophoon\nwere approaching, and [5293]Troilus to the city gates, to look for his\nCresseid. She is ill at ease, and sick till she see him again, peevish in\nthe meantime; discontent, heavy, sad, and why comes he not? where is he?\nwhy breaks he promise? why tarries he so long? sure he is not well; sure he\nhath some mischance; sure he forgets himself and me; with infinite such.\nAnd then, confident again, up she gets, out she looks, listens, and\ninquires, hearkens, kens; every man afar off is sure he, every stirring in\nthe street, now he is there, that's he, _male aurorae, malae soli dicit,\ndeiratque_, &c., the longest day that ever was, so she raves, restless and\nimpatient; for _Amor non patitur moras_, love brooks no delays: the time's\nquickly gone that's spent in her company, the miles short, the way\npleasant; all weather is good whilst he goes to her house, heat or cold;\nthough his teeth chatter in his head, he moves not; wet or dry, 'tis all\none; wet to the skin, he feels it not, cares not at least for it, but will\neasily endure it and much more, because it is done with alacrity, and for\nhis mistress's sweet sake; let the burden be never so heavy, love makes it\nlight. [5294]Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and it was quickly gone\nbecause he loved her. None so merry; if he may happily enjoy her company,\nhe is in heaven for a time; and if he may not, dejected in an instant,\nsolitary, silent, he departs weeping, lamenting, sighing, complaining.\n\nBut the symptoms of the mind in lovers are almost infinite, and so diverse,\nthat no art can comprehend them; though they be merry sometimes, and rapt\nbeyond themselves for joy: yet most part, love is a plague, a torture, a\nhell, a bitter sweet passion at last; [5295]_Amor melle et felle est\nfaecundissimus, gustum dat dulcem et amarum_. 'Tis _suavis amaricies,\ndolentia delectabilis, hilare tormentum_;\n\n[5296] \"Et me melle beant suaviora,\n        Et me felle necant amariora.\"\n\nlike a summer fly or sphinx's wings, or a rainbow of all colours,\n\n       \"Quae ad solis radios conversae aureae erant,\n        Adversus nubes ceruleae, quale jabar iridis,\"\n\nfair, foul, and full of variation, though most part irksome and bad. For in\na word, the Spanish Inquisition is not comparable to it; \"a torment\" and\n[5297]\"execution\" as it is, as he calls it in the poet, an unquenchable\nfire, and what not? [5298]From it, saith Austin, arise \"biting cares,\nperturbations, passions, sorrows, fears, suspicions, discontents,\ncontentions, discords, wars, treacheries, enmities, flattery, cozening,\nriot, impudence, cruelty, knavery,\" &c.\n\n[5299]  ------\"dolor, querelae,\n        Lamentatio, lachrymae perennes,\n        Languor, anxietas, amaritudo;\n        Aut si triste magis potest quid esse,\n        Hos tu das comites Neaera vitae.\"\n\nThese be the companions of lovers, and the ordinary symptoms, as the poet\nrepeats them.\n\n[5300] \"In amore haec insunt vitia,\n        Suspiciones, inimicitiae, audaciae,\n        Bellum, pax rursum,\" &c.\n\n[5301] \"Insomnia, aerumna, error, terror, et fuga,\n        Excogitantia excors immodestia,\n        Petulantia, cupiditas, et malevolentia;\n        Inhaeret etiam aviditas, desidia, injuria,\n        Inopia, contumelia et dispendium,\" &c.\n\n       \"In love these vices are; suspicions.\n        Peace, war, and impudence, detractions.\n        Dreams, cares, and errors, terrors and affrights,\n        Immodest pranks, devices, sleights and flights,\n        Heart-burnings, wants, neglects, desire of wrong,\n        Loss continual, expense and hurt among.\"\n\nEvery poet is full of such catalogues of love symptoms; but fear and sorrow\nmay justly challenge the chief place. Though Hercules de Saxonia, _cap. 3.\nTract. de melanch._ will exclude fear from love melancholy, yet I am\notherwise persuaded. [5302]_Res est solliciti plena timoris amor._ 'Tis\nfull of fear, anxiety, doubt, care, peevishness, suspicion; it turns a man\ninto a woman, which made Hesiod belike put Fear and Paleness Venus'\ndaughters,\n\n        ------\"Marti clypeos atque arma secanti\n        Alma Venus peperit Pallorem, unaque Timorem:\"\n\nbecause fear and love are still linked together. Moreover they are apt to\nmistake, amplify, too credulous sometimes, too full of hope and confidence,\nand then again very jealous, unapt to believe or entertain any good news.\nThe comical poet hath prettily painted out this passage amongst the rest in\na [5303]dialogue betwixt Mitio and Aeschines, a gentle father and a\nlovesick son. \"Be of good cheer, my son, thou shalt have her to wife. Ae.\nAh father, do you mock me now? M. I mock thee, why? Ae. That which I so\nearnestly desire, I more suspect and fear. M. Get you home, and send for\nher to be your wife. Ae. What now a wife, now father,\" &c. These doubts,\nanxieties, suspicions, are the least part of their torments; they break\nmany times from passions to actions, speak fair, and flatter, now most\nobsequious and willing, by and by they are averse, wrangle, fight, swear,\nquarrel, laugh, weep: and he that doth not so by fits, [5304]Lucian holds,\nis not thoroughly touched with this loadstone of love. So their actions and\npassions are intermixed, but of all other passions, sorrow hath the\ngreatest share; [5305]love to many is bitterness itself; _rem amaram_ Plato\ncalls it, a bitter potion, an agony, a plague.\n\n       \"Eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi;\n        Quae mihi subrepens imos ut torpor in artus,\n        Expulit ex omni pectore laetitias.\"\n\n       \"O take away this plague, this mischief from me,\n        Which, as a numbness over all my body,\n        Expels my joys, and makes my soul so heavy.\"\n\nPhaedria had a true touch of this, when he cried out,\n\n[5306] \"O Thais, utinam esset mihi\n        Pars aequa amoris tecum, ac paritor fieret ut\n        Aut hoc tibi doleret itidem, ut mihi dolet.\"\n\n       \"O Thais, would thou hadst of these my pains a part,\n        Or as it doth me now, so it would make thee smart.\"\n\nSo had that young man, when he roared again for discontent,\n\n[5307] \"Jactor, crucior, agitor, stimulor,\n        Versor in amoris rota miser,\n        Exanimor, feror, distrahor, deripior,\n        Ubi sum, ibi non sum; ubi non sum, ibi est animus.\"\n\n       \"I am vext and toss'd, and rack'd on love's wheel:\n        Where not, I am; but where am, do not feel.\"\n\nThe moon in [5308]Lucian made her moan to Venus, that she was almost dead\nfor love, _pereo equidem amore_, and after a long tale, she broke off\nabruptly and wept, [5309]\"O Venus, thou knowest my poor heart.\" Charmides,\nin [5310]Lucian, was so impatient, that he sobbed and sighed, and tore his\nhair, and said he would hang himself. \"I am undone, O sister Tryphena, I\ncannot endure these love pangs; what shall I do?\" _Vos O dii Averrunci\nsolvite me his curis_, O ye gods, free me from these cares and miseries,\nout of the anguish of his soul, [5311]Theocles prays. Shall I say, most\npart of a lover's life is full of agony, anxiety, fear, and grief,\ncomplaints, sighs, suspicions, and cares, (heigh-ho, my heart is woe) full\nof silence and irksome solitariness?\n\n       \"Frequenting shady bowers in discontent,\n        To the air his fruitless clamours he will vent.\"\n\nexcept at such times that he hath _lucida intervalla_, pleasant gales, or\nsudden alterations, as if his mistress smile upon him, give him a good\nlook, a kiss, or that some comfortable message be brought him, his service\nis accepted, &c.\n\nHe is then too confident and rapt beyond himself, as if he had heard the\nnightingale in the spring before the cuckoo, or as [5312]Calisto was at\nMalebaeas' presence, _Quis unquam hac mortali vita, tam gloriosum corpus\nvidit? humanitatem transcendere videor._, &c. who ever saw so glorious a\nsight, what man ever enjoyed such delight? More content cannot be given of\nthe gods, wished, had or hoped of any mortal man. There is no happiness in\nthe world comparable to his, no content, no joy to this, no life to love,\nhe is in paradise.\n\n[5313] \"Quis me uno vivit felicior? aut magis hac est\n        Optandum vita dicere quis poterit?\"\n\n       \"Who lives so happy as myself? what bliss\n        In this our life may be compar'd to this?\"\n\nHe will not change fortune in that case with a prince,\n\n[5314] \"Donec gratus eram tibi,\n        Persarum vigui rege beatior.\"\n\nThe Persian kings are not so jovial as he is, _O [5315]festus dies\nhominis_, O happy day; so Chaerea exclaims when he came from Pamphila his\nsweetheart well pleased,\n\n       \"Nunc est profecto interfici cum perpeti me possem,\n        Ne hoc gaudium contaminet vita aliqua aegritudine.\"\n\n\"He could find in his heart to be killed instantly, lest if he live longer,\nsome sorrow or sickness should contaminate his joys.\" A little after, he\nwas so merrily set upon the same occasion, that he could not contain\nhimself.\n\n[5316] \"O populares, ecquis me vivit hodie fortunatior?\n        Nemo hercule quisquam; nam in me dii plane potestatem\n        Suam omnem ostendere;\"\n\n\"Is't possible (O my countrymen) for any living to be so happy as myself?\nNo sure it cannot be, for the gods have shown all their power, all their\ngoodness in me.\" Yet by and by when this young gallant was crossed in his\nwench, he laments, and cries, and roars downright: _Occidi_--I am undone,\n\n       \"Neque virgo est usquam, neque ego, qui e conspectu illam amisi meo,\n        Ubi quaeram, ubi investigem, quem percunter, quam insistam viam?\"\n\nThe virgin's gone, and I am gone, she's gone, she's gone, and what shall I\ndo? where shall I seek her, where shall I find her, whom shall I ask? what\nway, what course shall I take? what will become of me--[5317]_vitales auras\ninvitus agebat_, he was weary of his life, sick, mad, and desperate,\n[5318]_utinam mihi esset aliquid hic, quo nunc me praecipitem darem_. 'Tis\nnot Chaereas' case this alone, but his, and his, and every lover's in the\nlike state. If he hear ill news, have bad success in his suit, she frown\nupon him, or that his mistress in his presence respect another more (as\n[5319]Hedus observes) \"prefer another suitor, speak more familiarly to him,\nor use more kindly than himself, if by nod, smile, message, she discloseth\nherself to another, he is instantly tormented, none so dejected as he is,\"\nutterly undone, a castaway, [5320]_In quem fortuna omnia odiorum suorum\ncrudelissima tela exonerat_, a dead man, the scorn of fortune, a monster of\nfortune, worse than nought, the loss of a kingdom had been less.\n[5321]Aretine's Lucretia made very good proof of this, as she relates it\nherself. \"For when I made some of my suitors believe I would betake myself\nto a nunnery, they took on, as if they had lost father and mother, because\nthey were for ever after to want my company.\" _Omnes labores leves fuere_,\nall other labour was light: [5322]but this might not be endured. _Tui\ncarendum quod erat_--\"for I cannot be without thy company,\" mournful\nAmyntas, painful Amyntas, careful Amyntas; better a metropolitan city were\nsacked, a royal army overcome, an invincible armada sunk, and twenty\nthousand kings should perish, than her little finger ache, so zealous are\nthey, and so tender of her good. They would all turn friars for my sake, as\nshe follows it, in hope by that means to meet, or see me again, as my\nconfessors, at stool-ball, or at barley-break: And so afterwards when an\nimportunate suitor came, [5323]\"If I had bid my maid say that I was not at\nleisure, not within, busy, could not speak with him, he was instantly\nastonished, and stood like a pillar of marble; another went swearing,\nchafing, cursing, foaming.\" [5324]_Illa sibi vox ipsa Jovis violentior ira,\ncum tonat_, &c. the voice of a mandrake had been sweeter music: \"but he to\nwhom I gave entertainment, was in the Elysian fields, ravished for joy,\nquite beyond himself.\" 'Tis the general humour of all lovers, she is their\nstern, pole-star, and guide. [5325]_Deliciumque animi, deliquiumque sui._\nAs a tulipant to the sun (which our herbalists calls Narcissus) when it\nshines, is _Admirandus flos ad radios solis se pandens_, a glorious flower\nexposing itself; [5326]but when the sun sets, or a tempest comes, it hides\nitself, pines away, and hath no pleasure left, (which Carolus Gonzaga, duke\nof Mantua, in a cause not unlike, sometimes used for an impress) do all\ninamorates to their mistress; she is their sun, their _Primum mobile_, or\n_anima informans_; this [5327]one hath elegantly expressed by a windmill,\nstill moved by the wind, which otherwise hath no motion of itself. _Sic tua\nni spiret gratia, truncus ero._ \"He is wholly animated from her breath,\"\nhis soul lives in her body, [5328]_sola claves habet interitus et salutis_,\nshe keeps the keys of his life: his fortune ebbs and flows with her favour,\na gracious or bad aspect turns him up or down, _Mens mea lucescit Lucia\nluce tua_. Howsoever his present state be pleasing or displeasing, 'tis\ncontinuate so long as he [5329]loves, he can do nothing, think of nothing\nbut her; desire hath no rest, she is his cynosure, Hesperus and vesper, his\nmorning and evening star, his goddess, his mistress, his life, his soul,\nhis everything; dreaming, waking, she is always in his mouth; his heart,\nhis eyes, ears, and all his thoughts are full of her. His Laura, his\nVictorina, his Columbina, Flavia, Flaminia, Caelia, Delia, or Isabella,\n(call her how you will) she is the sole object of his senses, the substance\nof his soul, _nidulus animae suae_, he magnifies her above measure, _totus\nin illa_, full of her, can breathe nothing but her. \"I adore Melebaea,\"\nsaith lovesick [5330]Calisto, \"I believe in Melebaea, I honour, admire and\nlove my Melebaea;\" His soul was soused, imparadised, imprisoned in his\nlady. When [5331]Thais took her leave of Phaedria,--_mi Phaedria, et\nnunquid aliud vis_? Sweet heart (she said) will you command me any further\nservice? he readily replied, and gave in this charge,\n\n        ------\"egone quid velim?\n        Dies noctesque ames me, me desideres,\n        Me somnies, me expectes, me cogites,\n        Me speres, me te oblectes, mecum tota sis,\n        Meus fac postremo animus, quando ego sum tuus.\"\n\n       \"Dost ask (my dear) what service I will have?\n        To love me day and night is all I crave,\n        To dream on me, to expect, to think on me,\n        Depend and hope, still covet me to see,\n        Delight thyself in me, be wholly mine,\n        For know, my love, that I am wholly thine.\"\n\nBut all this needed not, you will say; if she affect once, she will be his,\nsettle her love on him, on him alone,\n\n[5332]  ------\"illum absens absentem\n        Auditque videtque\"------\n\nshe can, she must think and dream of nought else but him, continually of\nhim, as did Orpheus on his Eurydice,\n\n       \"Te dulcis conjux, te solo in littore mecum,\n        Te veniente die, te discedente canebam.\"\n\n       \"On thee sweet wife was all my song.\n        Morn, evening, and all along.\"\n\nAnd Dido upon her Aeneas;\n\n        ------\"et quae me insomnia terrent,\n        Multa viri virtus, et plurima currit imago.\"\n\n       \"And ever and anon she thinks upon the man\n        That was so fine, so fair, so blithe, so debonair.\"\n\nClitophon, in the first book of Achilles, Tatius, complaineth how that his\nmistress Leucippe tormented him much more in the night than in the day.\n[5333]\"For all day long he had some object or other to distract his senses,\nbut in the night all ran upon her.

Be she present or absent, all is one;\n\n[5340] \"Et quamvis aberat placidae praesentia formae\n        Quem dederat praesens forma, manebat amor.\"\n\nThat impression of her beauty is still fixed in his mind,--[5341]_haerent\ninfixi pectora vultus_; as he that is bitten with a mad dog thinks all he\nsees dogs--dogs in his meat, dogs in his dish, dogs in his drink: his\nmistress is in his eyes, ears, heart, in all his senses. Valleriola had a\nmerchant, his patient, in the same predicament; and [5342]Ulricus Molitor,\nout of Austin, hath a story of one, that through vehemency of his love\npassion, still thought he saw his mistress present with him, she talked\nwith him, _Et commisceri cum ea vigilans videbatur_, still embracing him.\n\nNow if this passion of love can produce such effects, if it be pleasantly\nintended, what bitter torments shall it breed, when it is with fear and\ncontinual sorrow, suspicion, care, agony, as commonly it is, still\naccompanied, what an intolerable [5343]pain must it be?\n\n        ------\"Non tam grandes\n        Gargara culmos, quot demerso\n        Pectore curas longa nexas\n        Usque catena, vel quae penitus\n        Crudelis amor vulnera miscet.\"\n\n       \"Mount Gargarus hath not so many stems\n        As lover's breast hath grievous wounds,\n        And linked cares, which love compounds.\"\n\nWhen the King of Babylon would have punished a courtier of his, for loving\nof a young lady of the royal blood, and far above his fortunes, [5344]\nApollonius in presence by all means persuaded to let him alone; \"For to\nlove and not enjoy was a most unspeakable torment,\" no tyrant could invent\nthe like punishment; as a gnat at a candle, in a short space he would\nconsume himself. For love is a perpetual [5345]_flux, angor animi_, a\nwarfare, _militat omni amans_, a grievous wound is love still, and a\nlover's heart is Cupid's quiver, a consuming [5346]fire, [5347]_accede ad\nhunc ignem_, &c. an inextinguishable fire.\n\n[5348]  ------\"alitur et crescit malum,\n        Et ardet intus, qualis Aetnaeo vapor\n        Exundat antro\"------\n\nAs Aetna rageth, so doth love, and more than Aetna or any material fire.\n\n[5349]  ------\"Nam amor saepe Lypareo\n        Vulcano ardentiorem flammam incendere solet.\"\n\nVulcan's flames are but smoke to this. For fire, saith [5350]Xenophon,\nburns them alone that stand near it, or touch it; but this fire of love\nburneth and scorcheth afar off, and is more hot and vehement than any\nmaterial fire: [5351]_Ignis in igne furit_, 'tis a fire in a fire, the\nquintessence of fire. For when Nero burnt Rome, as Calisto urgeth, he fired\nhouses, consumed men's bodies and goods; but this fire devours the soul\nitself, \"and [5352]one soul is worth a hundred thousand bodies.\" No water\ncan quench this wild fire.\n\n[5353]  ------\"In pectus coecos absorbuit ignes,\n        Ignes qui nec aqua perimi potuere, nec imbre\n        Diminui, neque graminibus, magicisque susurris.\"\n\n       \"A fire he took into his breast,\n          Which water could not quench.\n        Nor herb, nor art, nor magic spells\n          Could quell, nor any drench.\"\n\nExcept it be tears and sighs, for so they may chance find a little ease.\n\n[5354] \"Sic candentia colla, sic patens frons,\n        Sic me blanda tui Neaera ocelli,\n        Sic pares minio genae perurunt,\n        Ut ni me lachrymae rigent perennes,\n        Totus in tenues eam favillas.\"\n\n       \"So thy white neck, Neaera, me poor soul\n        Doth scorch, thy cheeks, thy wanton eyes that roll:\n        Were it not for my dropping tears that hinder,\n        I should be quite burnt up forthwith to cinder.\"\n\nThis fire strikes like lightning, which made those old Grecians paint\nCupid, in many of their [5355]temples, with Jupiter's thunderbolts in his\nhands; for it wounds, and cannot be perceived how, whence it came, where it\npierced. [5356]_Urimur, et coecum, pectora vulnus habent_, and can hardly\nbe discerned at first.\n\n[5357]  ------\"Est mollis flamma medullas,\n        Et tacitum insano vivit sub pectore vulnus.\"\n\n       \"A gentle wound, an easy fire it was,\n        And sly at first, and secretly did pass.\"\n\nBut by-and-by it began to rage and burn amain;\n\n[5358]  ------\"Pectus insanum vapor.\n        Amorque torret, intus saevus vorat\n        Penitus medullas, atque per venas meat\n        Visceribus ignis mersus, et venis latens,\n        Ut agilis altas flamma percurrit trabes.\"\n\n       \"This fiery vapour rageth in the veins,\n        And scorcheth entrails, as when fire burns\n        A house, it nimbly runs along the beams,\n        And at the last the whole it overturns.\"\n\nAbraham Hoffemannus, _lib. 1. amor conjugal, cap. 2. p. 22._ relates out of\nPlato, how that Empedocles, the philosopher, was present at the cutting up\nof one that died for love, [5359]\"his heart was combust, his liver smoky,\nhis lungs dried up, insomuch that he verily believed his soul was either\nsodden or roasted through the vehemency of love's fire.\" Which belike made\na modern writer of amorous emblems express love's fury by a pot hanging\nover the fire, and Cupid blowing the coals. As the heat consumes the water,\n[5360]_Sic sua consumit viscera coecus amor_, so doth love dry up his\nradical moisture. Another compares love to a melting torch, which stood too\nnear the fire.\n\n[5361] \"Sic quo quis proprior suae puellae est,\n        Hoc stultus proprior suae runinae est.\"\n\n       \"The nearer he unto his mistress is,\n        The nearer he unto his ruin is.\"\n\nSo that to say truth, as [5362]Castilio describes it, \"The beginning,\nmiddle, end of love is nought else but sorrow, vexation, agony, torment,\nirksomeness, wearisomeness; so that to be squalid, ugly, miserable,\nsolitary, discontent, dejected, to wish for death, to complain, rave, and\nto be peevish, are the certain signs and ordinary actions of a lovesick\nperson.\" This continual pain and torture makes them forget themselves, if\nthey be far gone with it, in doubt, despair of obtaining, or eagerly bent,\nto neglect all ordinary business.\n\n[5363]  ------\"pendent opera interrupta, minaeque\n        Murorum ingentes, aequataque machina coelo.\"\n\nLovesick Dido left her work undone, so did [5364]Phaedra,\n\n        ------\"Palladis telae vacant\n        Et inter ipsus pensa labuntur manus.\"\n\nFaustus, in [5365]Mantuan, took no pleasure in anything he did,\n\n       \"Nulla quies mihi dulcis erat, nullus labor aegro\n        Pectore, sensus iners, et mens torpore sepulta,\n        Carminis occiderat studium.\"------\n\nAnd 'tis the humour of them all, to be careless of their persons and their\nestates, as the shepherd in [5366]Theocritus, _et haec barba inculta est,\nsqualidique capilli_, their beards flag, and they have no more care of\npranking themselves or of any business, they care not, as they say, which\nend goes forward.\n\n[5367] \"Oblitusque greges, et rura domestica totus\n[5368]  Uritur, et noctes in luctum expendit amaras,\n\n       \"Forgetting flocks of sheep and country farms,\n        The silly shepherd always mourns and burns.\"\n\nLovesick [5369]Chaerea, when he came from Pamphila's house, and had not so\ngood welcome as he did expect, was all amort, Parmeno meets him, _quid\ntristis es_? Why art thou so sad man? _unde es_? whence comest, how doest?\nbut he sadly replies, _Ego hercle nescio neque unde eam, neque quorsum eam,\nita prorsus oblitus sum mei_, I have so forgotten myself, I neither know\nwhere I am, nor whence I come, nor whether I will, what I do. P. [5370]\"How\nso?\" Ch. \"I am in love.\" _Prudens sciens._ [5371]--_vivus vidensque pereo,\nnec quid agam scio._ [5372]\"He that erst had his thoughts free\" (as\nPhilostratus Lemnius, in an epistle of his, describes this fiery passion),\n\"and spent his time like a hard student, in those delightsome philosophical\nprecepts; he that with the sun and moon wandered all over the world, with\nstars themselves ranged about, and left no secret or small mystery in\nnature unsearched, since he was enamoured can do nothing now but think and\nmeditate of love matters, day and night composeth himself how to please his\nmistress; all his study, endeavour, is to approve himself to his mistress,\nto win his mistress' favour, to compass his desire, to be counted her\nservant.\" When Peter Abelard, that great scholar of his age, _Cui soli\npatuit scibile quicquid erat_, [5373](\"whose faculties were equal to any\ndifficulty in learning,\") was now in love with Heloise, he had no mind to\nvisit or frequent schools and scholars any more, _Taediosum mihi valde\nfuit_ (as he [5374]confesseth) _ad scholas procedere, vel in iis morari_,\nall his mind was on his new mistress.\n\nNow to this end and purpose, if there be any hope of obtaining his suit, to\nprosecute his cause, he will spend himself, goods, fortunes for her, and\nthough he lose and alienate all his friends, be threatened, be cast off,\nand disinherited; for as the poet saith, _Amori quis legem det_?[5375]\nthough he be utterly undone by it, disgraced, go a begging, yet for her\nsweet sake, to enjoy her, he will willingly beg, hazard all he hath, goods,\nlands, shame, scandal, fame, and life itself.\n\n       \"Non recedam neque quiescam, noctu et interdiu,\n        profecto quam aut ipsam, aut mortem investigavero.\"\n\n       \"I'll never rest or cease my suit\n        Till she or death do make me mute.\"\n\nParthenis in Aristaenetus [5376]was fully resolved to do as much. \"I may\nhave better matches, I confess, but farewell shame, farewell honour,\nfarewell honesty, farewell friends and fortunes, &c. O, Harpedona, keep my\ncounsel, I will leave all for his sweet sake, I will have him, say no more,\n_contra gentes_, I am resolved, I will have him.\" Gobrias,[5377] the\ncaptain, when, he had espied Rhodanthe, the fair captive maid, fell upon\nhis knees before Mystilus, the general, with tears, vows, and all the\nrhetoric he could, by the scars he had formerly received, the good service\nhe had done, or whatsoever else was dear unto him, besought his governor he\nmight have the captive virgin to be his wife, _virtutis suae spolium_, as a\nreward of his worth and service; and, moreover, he would forgive him the\nmoney which was owing, and all reckonings besides due unto him, \"I ask no\nmore, no part of booty, no portion, but Rhodanthe to be my wife.\" And when\nas he could not compass her by fair means, he fell to treachery, force and\nvillainy, and set his life at stake at last to accomplish his desire. 'Tis\na common humour this, a general passion of all lovers to be so affected,\nand which Aemilia told Aratine, a courtier in Castilio's discourse, \"surely\nAratine, if thou werst not so indeed, thou didst not love; ingenuously\nconfess, for if thou hadst been thoroughly enamoured, thou wouldst have\ndesired nothing more than to please thy mistress. For that is the law of\nlove, to will and nill the same.\"[5378]_Tantum velle et nolle, velit nolit\nquod amica_?[5379]\n\nUndoubtedly this may be pronounced of them all, they are very slaves,\ndrudges for the time, madmen, fools, dizzards, _atrabilarii_[5380], beside\nthemselves, and as blind as beetles. Their dotage [5381]is most eminent,\n_Amore simul et sapere ipsi Jovi non datur_, as Seneca holds, Jupiter\nhimself cannot love and be wise both together; the very best of them, if\nonce they be overtaken with this passion, the most staid, discreet, grave,\ngenerous and wise, otherwise able to govern themselves, in this commit many\nabsurdities, many indecorums, unbefitting their gravity and persons.\n\n[5382] \"Quisquis amat servit, sequitur captivus amantem,\n        Fert domita cervice jugum\"------\n\nSamson, David, Solomon, Hercules, Socrates, &c. are justly taxed of\nindiscretion in this point; the middle sort are between hawk and buzzard;\nand although they do perceive and acknowledge their own dotage, weakness,\nfury, yet they cannot withstand it; as well may witness those\nexpostulations and confessions of Dido in Virgil.\n\n[5383] \"Incipit effari mediaque in voce resistit.\"\n\nPhaedra in Seneca.\n\n[5384] \"Quod ratio poscit, vincit ac regnat furor,\n        Potensque tota mente dominatur deus.\"\n\nMyrrha in [5385].

For what\nelse may we think those ingenious poets to have shadowed in their witty\nfictions and poems but that a man once given over to his lust (as\n[5388]Fulgentius interprets that of Apuleius, _Alciat of Tereus_) \"is no\nbetter than a beast.\"\n\n       \"Rex fueram, sic crista docet, sed sordida vita\n        Immundam e tanto culmine fecit avem.\"[5389]\n\n       \"I was a king, my crown my witness is,\n        But by my filthiness am come to this.\"\n\nTheir blindness is all out as great, as manifest as their weakness and\ndotage, or rather an inseparable companion, an ordinary sign of it, [5390]\nlove is blind, as the saying is, Cupid's blind, and so are all his\nfollowers. _Quisquis amat ranam, ranam putat esse Dianam_.

She is _nulli secunda_,\na rare creature, a phoenix, the sole commandress of his thoughts, queen of\nhis desires, his only delight: as [5400]Triton now feelingly sings, that\nlovesick sea-god:\n\n       \"Candida Leucothoe placet, et placet atra Melaene,\n        Sed Galatea placet longe magis omnibus una.\"\n\n       \"Fair Leucothe, black Melene please me well,\n        But Galatea doth by odds the rest excel.\"\n\nAll the gracious elogies, metaphors, hyperbolical comparisons of the best\nthings in the world, the most glorious names; whatsoever, I say, is\npleasant, amiable, sweet, grateful, and delicious, are too little for her.\n\n       \"Phoebo pulchrior et sorore Phoebi.\"\n\n       \"His Phoebe is so fair, she is so bright,\n        She dims the sun's lustre, and the moon's light.\"\n\nStars, sun, moons, metals, sweet-smelling flowers, odours, perfumes,\ncolours, gold, silver, ivory, pearls, precious stones, snow, painted birds,\ndoves, honey, sugar, spice, cannot express her, [5401]so soft, so tender,\nso radiant, sweet, so fair is she.--_Mollior cuniculi capillo_, &c.\n\n[5402] \"Lydia bella, puelia candida,\n        Quae bene superas lac, et lilium,\n        Albamque simul rosam et rubicundam,\n        Et expolitum ebur Indicum.\"\n\n       \"Fine Lydia, my mistress, white and fair,\n        The milk, the lily do not thee come near;\n        The rose so white, the rose so red to see,\n        And Indian ivory comes short of thee.\"\n\nSuch a description our English Homer makes of a fair lady\n\n[5403] _That Emilia that was fairer to seen,\n        Then is lily upon the stalk green:\n        And fresher then May with flowers new,\n        For with the rose colour strove her hue,\n        I no't which was the fairer of the two_.\n\nIn this very phrase [5404]Polyphemus courts Galatea:\n\n       \"Candidior folio nivei Galatea ligustri,\n        Floridior prato, longa procerior alno,\n        Splendidior vitro, tenero lascivior haedo, &c.\n        Mollior et cygni plumis, et lacte coacto.\"\n\n       \"Whiter Galet than the white withie-wind,\n        Fresher than a field, higher than a tree,\n        Brighter than glass, more wanton than a kid,\n        Softer than swan's down, or ought that may be.\"\n\nSo she admires him again, in that conceited dialogue of Lucian, which John\nSecundus, an elegant Dutch modern poet, hath translated into verse. When\nDoris and those other sea nymphs upbraided her with her ugly misshapen\nlover, Polyphemus; she replies, they speak out of envy and malice,\n\n[5405] \"Et plane invidia huc mera vos stimulare videtur.\n        Quod non vos itidem ut me Polyphemus amet;\"\n\nSay what they could, he was a proper man. And as Heloise writ to her\nsweetheart Peter Abelard, _Si me Augustus orbis imperator uxorem expeteret,\nmallem tua esse meretrix quam orbis imperatrix_; she had rather be his\nvassal, his quean, than the world's empress or queen.--_non si me Jupiter\nipse forte velit_,--she would not change her love for Jupiter himself.\n\nTo thy thinking she is a most loathsome creature; and as when a country\nfellow discommended once that exquisite picture of Helen, made by Zeuxis,\n[5406]for he saw no such beauty in it; Nichomachus a lovesick spectator\nreplied, _Sume tibi meos oculos et deam existimabis_, take mine eyes, and\nthou wilt think she is a goddess, dote on her forthwith, count all her\nvices virtues; her imperfections infirmities, absolute and perfect: if she\nbe flat-nosed, she is lovely; if hook-nosed, kingly; if dwarfish and\nlittle, pretty; if tall, proper and man-like, our brave British Boadicea;\nif crooked, wise; if monstrous, comely; her defects are no defects at all,\nshe hath no deformities. _Immo nec ipsum amicae stercus foetet_, though she\nbe nasty, fulsome, as Sostratus' bitch, or Parmeno's sow; thou hadst as\nlive have a snake in thy bosom, a toad in thy dish, and callest her witch,\ndevil, hag, with all the filthy names thou canst invent; he admires her on\nthe other side, she is his idol, lady, mistress, [5407]venerilla, queen,\nthe quintessence of beauty, an angel, a star, a goddess.\n\n       \"Thou art my Vesta, thou my goddess art,\n        Thy hallowed temple only is my heart.\"\n\nThe fragrancy of a thousand courtesans is in her face: [5408]_Nec pulchrae\neffigies, haec Cypridis aut Stratonices_; 'tis not Venus' picture that, nor\nthe Spanish infanta's, as you suppose (good sir), no princess, or king's\ndaughter: no, no, but his divine mistress, forsooth, his dainty Dulcinia,\nhis dear Antiphila, to whose service he is wholly consecrate, whom he alone\nadores.\n\n[5409] \"Cui comparatus indecens erit pavo,\n        Inamabilis sciurus, et frequens Phoenix.\"\n\n       \"To whom conferr'd a peacock's indecent,\n        A squirrel's harsh, a phoenix too frequent.\"\n\nAll the graces, veneries, elegancies, pleasures, attend her. He prefers her\nbefore a myriad of court ladies.\n\n[5410] \"He that commends Phillis or Neraea,\n        Or Amaryllis, or Galatea,\n        Tityrus or Melibea, by your leave,\n        Let him be mute, his love the praises have.\"\n\nNay, before all the gods and goddesses themselves. So [5411]Quintus\nCatullus admired his squint-eyed friend Roscius.\n\n       \"Pace mihi liceat (Coelestes) dicere vestra,\n        Mortalis visus pulchrior esse Deo.\"\n\n       \"By your leave gentle Gods, this I'll say true,\n        There's none of you that have so fair a hue.\"\n\nAll the bombast epithets, pathetical adjuncts, incomparably fair, curiously\nneat, divine, sweet, dainty, delicious, &c., pretty diminutives, _corculum,\nsuaviolum_, &c. pleasant names may be invented, bird, mouse, lamb, puss,\npigeon, pigsney, kid, honey, love, dove, chicken, &c. he puts on her.\n\n[5412] \"Meum mel, mea suavitas, meum cor,\n        Meum suaviolum, mei lepores,\"\n\n\"my life, my light, my jewel, my glory,\" [5413]_Margareta speciosa, cujus\nrespectu omnia mundi pretiosa sordent_, my sweet Margaret, my sole delight\nand darling. And as [5414]Rhodomant courted Isabella:\n\n       \"By all kind words and gestures that he might,\n        He calls her his dear heart, his sole beloved,\n        His joyful comfort, and his sweet delight.\n        His mistress, and his goddess, and such names,\n        As loving knights apply to lovely dames.\"\n\nEvery cloth she wears, every fashion pleaseth him above measure; her hand,\n_O quales digitos, quos habet illa manus!_ pretty foot, pretty coronets,\nher sweet carriage, sweet voice, tone, O that pretty tone, her divine and\nlovely looks, her every thing, lovely, sweet, amiable, and pretty, pretty,\npretty. Her very name (let it be what it will) is a most pretty, pleasing\nname; I believe now there is some secret power and virtue in names, every\naction, sight, habit, gesture; he admires, whether she play, sing, or\ndance, in what tires soever she goeth, how excellent it was, how well it\nbecame her, never the like seen or heard. [5415]_Mille habet ornatus, mille\ndecenter habet._ Let her wear what she will, do what she will, say what she\nwill, [5416]_Quicquid enim dicit, seu facit, omne decet_. He applauds and\nadmires everything she wears, saith or doth,\n\n[5417] \"Illam quicquid agit, quoquo vestigia vertit,\n          Composuit furtim subsequiturque decor;\n        Seu solvit crines, fusis decet esse capillis,\n          Seu compsit, comptis est reverenda comis.\"\n\n       \"Whate'er she doth, or whither e'er she go,\n          A sweet and pleasing grace attends forsooth;\n        Or loose, or bind her hair, or comb it up,\n          She's to be honoured in what she doth.\"\n\n[5418]_Vestem induitur, formosa est: exuitur, tota forma est_, let her be\ndressed or undressed, all is one, she is excellent still, beautiful, fair,\nand lovely to behold. Women do as much by men; nay more, far fonder,\nweaker, and that by many parasangs. \"Come to me my dear Lycias,\" (saith\nMusaeus in [5419]Aristaenetus) \"come quickly sweetheart, all other men are\nsatyrs, mere clowns, blockheads to thee, nobody to thee.\" Thy looks, words,\ngestures, actions, &c., \"are incomparably beyond all others.\" Venus was\nnever so much besotted on her Adonis, Phaedra so delighted in Hippolitus,\nAriadne in Theseus, Thisbe in her Pyramus, as she is enamoured on her\nMopsus.\n\n       \"Be thou the marigold, and I will be the sun,\n        Be thou the friar, and I will be the nun.\"\n\nI could repeat centuries of such. Now tell me what greater dotage or\nblindness can there be than this in both sexes? and yet their slavery is\nmore eminent, a greater sign of their folly than the rest.\n\nThey are commonly slaves, captives, voluntary servants, _Amator amicae\nmancipium_, as [5420]Castilio terms him, his mistress' servant, her drudge,\nprisoner, bondman, what not? \"He composeth himself wholly to her affections\nto please her, and, as Aemelia said, makes himself her lackey. All his\ncares, actions, all his thoughts, are subordinate to her will and\ncommandment:\" her most devote, obsequious, affectionate servant and vassal.\n\"For love\" (as [5421]Cyrus in Xenophon well observed) \"is a mere tyranny,\nworse than any disease, and they that are troubled with it desire to be\nfree and cannot, but are harder bound than if they were in iron chains.\"\nWhat greater captivity or slavery can there be (as [5422]Tully\nexpostulates) than to be in love? \"Is he a free man over whom a woman\ndomineers, to whom she prescribes laws, commands, forbids what she will\nherself; that dares deny nothing she demands; she asks, he gives; she\ncalls, he comes; she threatens, he fears; _Nequissimum hunc servum puto_, I\naccount this man a very drudge.\" And as he follows it, [5423]\"Is this no\nsmall servitude for an enamourite to be every hour combing his head,\nstiffening his beard, perfuming his hair, washing his face with sweet\nwater, painting, curling, and not to come abroad but sprucely crowned,\ndecked, and apparelled?\" Yet these are but toys in respect, to go to the\nbarber, baths, theatres, &c., he must attend upon her wherever she goes,\nrun along the streets by her doors and windows to see her, take all\nopportunities, sleeveless errands, disguise, counterfeit shapes, and as\nmany forms as Jupiter himself ever took; and come every day to her house\n(as he will surely do if he be truly enamoured) and offer her service, and\nfollow her up and down from room to room, as Lucretia's suitors did, he\ncannot contain himself but he will do it, he must and will be where she is,\nsit next her, still talking with her. [5424]\"If I did but let my glove fall\nby chance,\" (as the said Aretine's Lucretia brags,) \"I had one of my\nsuitors, nay two or three at once ready to stoop and take it up, and kiss\nit, and with a low conge deliver it unto me; if I would walk, another was\nready to sustain me by the arm. A third to provide fruits, pears, plums,\ncherries, or whatsoever I would eat or drink.\" All this and much more he\ndoth in her presence, and when he comes home, as Troilus to his Cressida,\n'tis all his meditation to recount with himself his actions, words,\ngestures, what entertainment he had, how kindly she used him in such a\nplace, how she smiled, how she graced him, and that infinitely pleased him;\nand then he breaks out, O sweet Areusa, O my dearest Antiphila, O most\ndivine looks, O lovely graces, and thereupon instantly he makes an epigram,\nor a sonnet to five or seven tunes, in her commendation, or else he\nruminates how she rejected his service, denied him a kiss, disgraced him,\n&c., and that as effectually torments him. And these are his exercises\nbetween comb and glass, madrigals, elegies, &c., these his cogitations till\nhe see her again. But all this is easy and gentle, and the least part of\nhis labour and bondage, no hunter will take such pains for his game, fowler\nfor his sport, or soldier to sack a city, as he will for his mistress'\nfavour.\n\n[5425] \"Ipsa comes veniam, neque me salebrosa movebunt\n        Saxa, nec obliquo dente timendus aper.\"\n\nAs Phaedra to Hippolitus. No danger shall affright, for if that be true the\npoets feign, Love is the son of Mars and Venus; as he hath delights,\npleasures, elegances from his mother, so hath he hardness, valour, and\nboldness from his father. And 'tis true that Bernard hath; _Amore nihil\nmollius, nihil volentius_, nothing so boisterous, nothing so tender as\nlove. If once, therefore, enamoured, he will go, run, ride many a mile to\nmeet her, day and night, in a very dark night, endure scorching heat, cold,\nwait in frost and snow, rain, tempest, till his teeth chatter in his head,\nthose northern winds and showers cannot cool or quench his flame of love.\n_Intempesta nocte non deterretur_, he will, take my word, sustain hunger,\nthirst, _Penetrabit omnia, perrumpet omnia_, \"love will find out a way,\"\nthrough thick and thin he will to her, _Expeditissimi montes videntur omnes\ntranabiles_, he will swim through an ocean, ride post over the Alps,\nApennines, or Pyrenean hills,\n\n[5426] \"Ignem marisque fluctus, atque turbines\n        Venti paratus est transire,\"------\n\nthough it rain daggers with their points downward, light or dark, all is\none: (_Roscida per tenebras Faunus ad antra venit_), for her sweet sake he\nwill undertake Hercules's twelve labours, endure, hazard, &c., he feels it\nnot. [5427]\"What shall I say,\" saith Haedus, \"of their great dangers they\nundergo, single combats they undertake, how they will venture their lives,\ncreep in at windows, gutters, climb over walls to come to their\nsweethearts,\" (anointing the doors and hinges with oil, because they should\nnot creak, tread soft, swim, wade, watch, &c.), \"and if they be surprised,\nleap out at windows, cast themselves headlong down, bruising or breaking\ntheir legs or arms, and sometimes loosing life itself,\" as Calisto did for\nhis lovely Melibaea. Hear some of their own confessions, protestations,\ncomplaints, proffers, expostulations, wishes, brutish attempts, labours in\nthis kind. Hercules served Omphale, put on an apron, took a distaff and\nspun; Thraso the soldier was so submissive to Thais, that he was resolved\nto do whatever she enjoined. [5428]_Ego me Thaidi dedam; et faciam quod\njubet_, I am at her service. Philostratus in an epistle to his mistress,\n[5429]\"I am ready to die sweetheart if it be thy will; allay his thirst\nwhom thy star hath scorched and undone, the fountains and rivers deny no\nman drink that comes; the fountain doth not say thou shalt not drink, nor\nthe apple thou shalt not eat, nor the fair meadow walk not in me, but thou\nalone wilt not let me come near thee, or see thee, contemned and despised I\ndie for grief.\" Polienus, when his mistress Circe did but frown upon him in\nPetronius, drew his sword, and bade her [5430]kill, stab, or whip him to\ndeath, he would strip himself naked, and not resist. Another will take a\njourney to Japan, _Longae navigationis molestis non curans_: a third (if\nshe say it) will not speak a word for a twelvemonth's space, her command\nshall be most inviolably kept: a fourth will take Hercules's club from him,\nand with that centurion in the Spanish [5431]Caelestina, will kill ten men\nfor his mistress Areusa, for a word of her mouth he will cut bucklers in\ntwo like pippins, and flap down men like flies, _Elige quo mortis genere\nillum occidi cupis_? [5432]Galeatus of Mantua did a little more: for when\nhe was almost mad for love of a fair maid in the city, she, to try him\nbelike what he would do for her sake, bade him in jest leap into the river\nPo if he loved her; he forthwith did leap headlong off the bridge and was\ndrowned. Another at Ficinum in like passion, when his mistress by chance\n(thinking no harm I dare swear) bade him go hang, the next night at her\ndoors hanged himself. [5433]\"Money\" (saith Xenophon) \"is a very acceptable\nand welcome guest, yet I had rather give it my dear Clinia than take it of\nothers, I had rather serve him than command others, I had rather be his\ndrudge than take my ease, undergo any danger for his sake than live in\nsecurity. For I had rather see Clinia than all the world besides, and had\nrather want the sight of all other things than him alone; I am angry with\nthe night and sleep that I may not see him, and thank the light and sun\nbecause they show me my Clinia; I will run into the fire for his sake, and\nif you did but see him, I know that you likewise would run with me.\" So\nPhilostratus to his mistress, [5434]\"Command me what you will, I will do\nit; bid me go to sea, I am gone in an instant, take so many stripes, I am\nready, run through the fire, and lay down my life and soul at thy feet,\n'tis done.\" So did. Aeolus to Juno.\n\n        ------\"Tuus o regina quod optas\n        Explorare labor, mihi jussa capescere fas est.\"\n\n       \"O queen it is thy pains to enjoin me still,\n        And I am bound to execute thy will.\"\n\nAnd Phaedra to Hippolitus,\n\n       \"Me vel sororem Hippolite aut famulam voca,\n        Famulamque potius, omne servitium feram.\"\n\n       \"O call me sister, call me servant, choose,\n        Or rather servant, I am thine to use.\"\n\n[5435] \"Non me per altas ire si jubeas nives,\n        Pigeat galatis ingredi Pindi jugis,\n        Non si per ignes ire aut infesta agmina\n        Cuncter, paratus [5436]ensibus pectus dare,\n        Te tunc jubere, me decet jussa exequi.\"\n\n       \"It shall not grieve me to the snowy hills,\n        Or frozen Pindus' tops forthwith to climb.\n        Or run through fire, or through an army,\n        Say but the word, for I am always thine.\"\n\nCallicratides in [5437]Lucian breaks out into this passionate speech, \"O\nGod of Heaven, grant me this life for ever to sit over against my mistress,\nand to hear her sweet voice, to go in and out with her, to have every other\nbusiness common with her; I would labour when she labours; sail when she\nsails; he that hates her should hate me; and if a tyrant kill her, he\nshould kill me; if she should die, I would not live, and one grave should\nhold us both.\" [5438]_Finiet illa meos moriens morientis amores_. Abrocomus\nin [5439]Aristaenetus makes the like petition for his Delphia,\n--[5440]_Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam lubens_. \"I desire to live with\nthee, and I am ready to die with thee.\" 'Tis the same strain which\nTheagines used to his Chariclea, \"so that I may but enjoy thy love, let me\ndie presently:\" Leander to his Hero, when he besought the sea waves to let\nhim go quietly to his love, and kill him coming back. [5441]_Parcite dum\npropero, mergite dum redeo_. \"Spare me whilst I go, drown me as I return.\"\n'Tis the common humour of them all, to contemn death, to wish for death, to\nconfront death in this case, _Quippe queis nec fera, nec ignis, neque\npraecipitium, nec fretum, nec ensis, neque laqueus gravia videntur_; \"'Tis\ntheir desire\" (saith Tyrius) \"to die.\"\n\n       \"Haud timet mortem, cupit ire in ipsos\n        ------obvius enses.\"\n\n\"He does not fear death, he desireth such upon the very swords.\" Though a\nthousand dragons or devils keep the gates, Cerberus himself, Scyron and\nProcrastes lay in wait, and the way as dangerous, as inaccessible as hell,\nthrough fiery flames and over burning coulters, he will adventure for all\nthis. And as [5442]Peter Abelard lost his testicles for his Heloise, he\nwill I say not venture an incision, but life itself. For how many gallants\noffered to lose their lives for a night's lodging with Cleopatra in those\ndays! and in the hour or moment of death, 'tis their sole comfort to\nremember their dear mistress, as [5443]Zerbino slain in France, and\nBrandimart in Barbary; as Arcite did his Emily.\n\n[5444]  ------_when he felt death,\n        Dusked been his eyes, and faded is his breath\n        But on his lady yet casteth he his eye,\n        His last word was, mercy Emely,\n        His spirit chang'd, and out went there,\n        Whether I cannot tell, ne where_.\n\n[5445]When Captain Gobrius by an unlucky accident had received his death's\nwound, _heu me miserum exclamat_, miserable man that I am, (instead of\nother devotions) he cries out, shall I die before I see my sweetheart\nRhodanthe? _Sic amor mortem_, (saith mine author) _aut quicquid humanitus\naccidit, aspernatur_, so love triumphs, contemns, insults over death\nitself. Thirteen proper young men lost their lives for that fair\nHippodamias' sake, the daughter of Onomaus, king of Elis: when that hard\ncondition was proposed of death or victory, they made no account of it, but\ncourageously for love died, till Pelops at last won her by a sleight.\n[5446]As many gallants desperately adventured their dearest blood for\nAtalanta, the daughter of Schenius, in hope of marriage, all vanquished and\novercame, till Hippomenes by a few golden apples happily obtained his suit.\nPerseus, of old, fought with a sea monster for Andromeda's sake; and our\nSt. George freed the king's daughter of Sabea (the golden legend is mine\nauthor) that was exposed to a dragon, by a terrible combat. Our knights\nerrant, and the Sir Lancelots of these days, I hope will adventure as much\nfor ladies' favours, as the Squire of Dames, Knight of the Sun, Sir Bevis\nof Southampton, or that renowned peer,\n\n[5447] \"Orlando, who long time had loved dear\n        Angelica the fair, and for her sake\n        About the world in nations far and near,\n        Did high attempts perform and undertake;\"\n\nhe is a very dastard, a coward, a block and a beast, that will not do as\nmuch, but they will sure, they will; for it is an ordinary thing for these\ninamoratos of our time to say and do more, to stab their arms, carouse in\nblood, [5448]or as that Thessalian Thero, that bit off his own thumb,\n_provocans rivalem ad hoc aemulandum_, to make his co-rival do as much.\n'Tis frequent with them to challenge the field for their lady and mistress'\nsake, to run a tilt,\n\n[5449] \"That either bears (so furiously they meet)\n        The other down under the horses' feet,\"\n\nand then up and to it again,\n\n       \"And with their axes both so sorely pour,\n        That neither plate nor mail sustain'd the stour,\n        But riveld wreak like rotten wood asunder,\n        And fire did flash like lightning after thunder;\"\n\nand in her quarrel, to fight so long [5450]\"till their headpiece, bucklers\nbe all broken, and swords hacked like so many saws,\" for they must not see\nher abused in any sort, 'tis blasphemy to speak against her, a dishonour\nwithout all good respect to name her. 'Tis common with these creatures, to\ndrink [5451]healths upon their bare knees, though it were a mile to the\nbottom, no matter of what mixture, off it comes. If she bid them they will\ngo barefoot to Jerusalem, to the great Cham's court, [5452] to the East\nIndies, to fetch her a bird to wear in her hat: and with Drake and Candish\nsail round about the world for her sweet sake, _adversis ventis_, serve\ntwice seven years, as Jacob did for Rachel; do as much as [5453]Gesmunda,\nthe daughter of Tancredus, prince of Salerna, did for Guisardus, her true\nlove, eat his heart when he died; or as Artemisia drank her husband's bones\nbeaten to powder, and so bury him in herself, and endure more torments than\nTheseus or Paris. _Et his colitur Venus magis quam thure, et victimis_,\nwith such sacrifices as these (as [5454] Aristaenetus holds) Venus is well\npleased. Generally they undertake any pain, any labour, any toil, for their\nmistress' sake, love and admire a servant, not to her alone, but to all her\nfriends and followers, they hug and embrace them for her sake; her dog,\npicture, and everything she wears, they adore it as a relic. If any man\ncome from her, they feast him, reward him, will not be out of his company,\ndo him all offices, still remembering, still talking of her:\n\n[5455] \"Nam si abest quod ames, praesto simulacra tamen sunt\n        Illius, et nomen dulce observatur ad aures.\"\n\nThe very carrier that comes from him to her is a most welcome guest; and if\nhe bring a letter, she will read it twenty times over, and as [5456]\nLucretia did by Euryalus, \"kiss the letter a thousand times together, and\nthen read it:\" And [5457]Chelidonia by Philonius, after many sweet kisses,\nput the letter in her bosom,\n\n       \"And kiss again, and often look thereon,\n        And stay the messenger that would be gone:\"\n\nAnd asked many pretty questions, over and over again, as how he looked,\nwhat he did, and what he said? In a word,\n\n[5458] \"Vult placere sese amicae, vult mihi, vult pedissequae,\n        Vult famulis, vult etiam ancillis, et catulo meo.\"\n\n       \"He strives to please his mistress, and her maid,\n        Her servants, and her dog, and's well apaid.\"\n\nIf he get any remnant of hers, a busk-point, a feather of her fan, a\nshoe-tie, a lace, a ring, a bracelet of hair,\n\n[5459] \"Pignusque direptum lacertis;\n        Aut digito male pertinaci,\"\n\nhe wears it for a favour on his arm, in his hat, finger, or next his heart.\nHer picture he adores twice a day, and for two hours together will not look\noff it; as Laodamia did by Protesilaus, when he went to war, [5460]\"'sit\nat home with his picture before her;' a garter or a bracelet of hers is\nmore precious than any saint's relic,\" he lays it up in his casket, (O\nblessed relic) and every day will kiss it: if in her presence, his eye is\nnever off her, and drink he will where she drank, if it be possible, in\nthat very place, &c. If absent, he will walk in the walk, sit under that\ntree where she did use to sit, in that bower, in that very seat,--_et\nforibus miser oscula figit_, [5461]many years after sometimes, though she\nbe far distant and dwell many miles off, he loves yet to walk that way\nstill, to have his chamber-window look that way: to walk by that river's\nside, which (though far away) runs by the house where she dwells, he loves\nthe wind blows to that coast.\n\n[5462] \"O quoties dixi Zephyris properantibus illuc,\n        Felices pulchram visuri Amaryllada venti.\"\n\n       \"O happy western winds that blow that way,\n        For you shall see my love's fair face to day.\"\n\nHe will send a message to her by the wind.\n\n[5463] \"Vos aurae Alpinae, placidis de montibus aurae,\n        Haec illi portate,\"------\n\n[5464]he desires to confer with some of her acquaintance, for his heart is\nstill with her, [5465]to talk of her, admiring and commending her,\nlamenting, moaning, wishing himself anything for her sake, to have\nopportunity to see her, O that he might but enjoy her presence! So did\nPhilostratus to his mistress, [5466]\"O happy ground on which she treads,\nand happy were I if she would tread upon me. I think her countenance would\nmake the rivers stand, and when she comes abroad, birds will sing and come\nabout her.\"\n\n       \"Ridebunt valles, ridebunt obvia Tempe,\n        In florem viridis protinus ibi humus.\"\n\n       \"The fields will laugh, the pleasant valleys burn,\n        And all the grass will into flowers turn.\"\n\n_Omnis Ambrosiam spirabit aura_. [5467]\"When she is in the meadow, she is\nfairer than any flower, for that lasts but for a day, the river is\npleasing, but it vanisheth on a sudden, but thy flower doth not fade, thy\nstream is greater than the sea. If I look upon the heaven, methinks I see\nthe sun fallen down to shine below, and thee to shine in his place, whom I\ndesire. If I look upon the night, methinks I see two more glorious stars,\nHesperus and thyself.\" A little after he thus courts his mistress, [5468]\n\"If thou goest forth of the city, the protecting gods that keep the town\nwill run after to gaze upon thee: if thou sail upon the seas, as so many\nsmall boats, they will follow thee: what river would not run into the sea?\"\nAnother, he sighs and sobs, swears he hath _Cor scissum_, a heart bruised\nto powder, dissolved and melted within him, or quite gone from him, to his\nmistress' bosom belike, he is in an oven, a salamander in the fire, so\nscorched with love's heat; he wisheth himself a saddle for her to sit on, a\nposy for her to smell to, and it would not grieve him to be hanged, if he\nmight be strangled in her garters: he would willingly die tomorrow, so that\nshe might kill him with her own hands. [5469]Ovid would be a flea, a gnat,\na ring, Catullus a sparrow,\n\n[5470] \"O si tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem,\n        Et tristes animi levare curas.\"\n\n[5471]Anacreon, a glass, a gown, a chain, anything,\n\n       \"Sed speculum ego ipse fiam,\n        Ut me tuum usque cernas,\n        Et vestis ipse fiam,\n        Ut me tuum usque gestes.\n        Mutari et opto in undam,\n        Lavem tuos ut artus,\n        Nardus puella fiam,\n        Ut ego teipsum inungam,\n        Sim fascia in papillis,\n        Tuo et monile collo.\n        Fiamque calceus, me\n        Saltem ut pede usque calces.\"\n\n[5472] \"But I a looking-glass would be,\n        Still to be look'd upon by thee,\n        Or I, my love, would be thy gown,\n        By thee to be worn up and down;\n        Or a pure well full to the brims,\n        That I might wash thy purer limbs:\n        Or, I'd be precious balm to 'noint,\n        With choicest care each choicest joint;\n        Or, if I might, I would be fain\n        About thy neck thy happy chain,\n        Or would it were my blessed hap\n        To be the lawn o'er thy fair pap.\n        Or would I were thy shoe, to be\n        Daily trod upon by thee.\"\n\nO thrice happy man that shall enjoy her: as they that saw Hero in Museus,\nand [5473]Salmacis to Hermaphroditus,\n\n[5474]  ------\"Felices mater, &c. felix nutrix.--\n        Sed longe cunctis, longeque beatior ille,\n        Quem fructu sponsi et socii dignabere lecti.\"\n\nThe same passion made her break out in the comedy, [5475]_Nae illae\nfortunatae, sunt quae cum illo cubant_, \"happy are his bedfellows;\" and as\nshe said of Cyprus, [5476]_Beata quae illi uxor futura esset_, blessed is\nthat woman that shall be his wife, nay, thrice happy she that shall enjoy\nhim but a night. [5477]_Una nox Jovis sceptro aequiparanda_, such a night's\nlodging is worth Jupiter's sceptre.\n\n[5478] \"Qualis nox erit illa, dii, deaeque,\n        Quam mollis thorus?\"\n\n\"O what a blissful night would it be, how soft, how sweet a bed!\" She will\nadventure all her estate for such a night, for a nectarean, a balsam kiss\nalone.\n\n[5479] \"Qui te videt beatus est,\n        Beatior qui te audiet,\n        Qui te potitur est Deus.\"\n\nThe sultan of Sana's wife in Arabia, when she had seen Vertomannus, that\ncomely traveller, lamented to herself in this manner, [5480]\"O God, thou\nhast made this man whiter than the sun, but me, mine husband, and all my\nchildren black; I would to God he were my husband, or that I had such a\nson;\" she fell a weeping, and so impatient for love at last, that (as\nPotiphar's wife did by Joseph) she would have had him gone in with her, she\nsent away Gazella, Tegeia, Galzerana, her waiting-maids, loaded him with\nfair promises and gifts, and wooed him with all the rhetoric she could,--\n_extremum hoc miserae da munus amanti_, \"grant this last request to a\nwretched lover.\" But when he gave not consent, she would have gone with\nhim, and left all, to be his page, his servant, or his lackey, _Certa sequi\ncharum corpus ut umbra solet_, so that she might enjoy him, threatening\nmoreover to kill herself, &c. Men will do as much and more for women, spend\ngoods, lands, lives, fortunes; kings will leave their crowns, as King John\nfor Matilda the nun at Dunmow.\n\n[5481] \"But kings in this yet privileg'd may be,\n        I'll be a monk so I may live with thee.\"\n\nThe very Gods will endure any shame (_atque aliquis de diis non tristibus\ninquit_, &c.) be a spectacle as Mars and Venus were, to all the rest; so\ndid Lucian's Mercury wish, and peradventure so dost thou. They will\nadventure their lives with alacrity --[5482]_pro qua non metuam mori_--nay\nmore, _pro qua non metuam bis mori_, I will die twice, nay, twenty times\nfor her. If she die, there's no remedy, they must die with her, they cannot\nhelp it. A lover in Calcagninus, wrote this on his darling's tomb,\n\n       \"Quincia obiit, sed non Quincia sola obiit,\n        Quincia obiit, sed cum Quincia et ipse obii;\n        Risus obit, obit gratia, lusus obit.\n        Nec mea nunc anima in pectore, at in tumulo est.\"\n\n       \"Quincia my dear is dead, but not alone,\n        For I am dead, and with her I am gone:\n        Sweet smiles, mirth, graces, all with her do rest,\n        And my soul too, for 'tis not in my breast.\"\n\nHow many doting lovers upon the like occasion might say the same? But these\nare toys in respect, they will hazard their very souls for their mistress'\nsake.\n\n       \"Atque aliquis interjuvenes miratus est, et verbum dixit,\n        Non ego in caelo cuperem Deus esse,\n        Nostram uxorem habens domi Hero.\"\n\n       \"One said, to heaven would I not\n          desire at all to go,\n        If that at mine own house I had\n          such a fine wife as Hero.\"\n\nVenus forsook heaven for Adonis' sake,--[5483]_caelo praefertur Adonis_.\nOld Janivere, in Chaucer, thought when he had his fair May he should never\ngo to heaven, he should live so merrily here on earth; had I such a\nmistress, he protests,\n\n[5484] \"Caelum diis ego non suum inviderem,\n        Sed sortem mihi dii meam inviderent.\"\n\n       \"I would not envy their prosperity,\n        The gods should envy my felicity.\"\n\nAnother as earnestly desires to behold his sweetheart he will adventure and\nleave all this, and more than this to see her alone.\n\n[5485] \"Omnia quae patior mala si pensare velit fors,\n        Una aliqua nobis prosperitate, dii\n        Hoc precor, ut faciant, faciant me cernere coram,\n        Cor mihi captivum quae tenet hocce, deam.\"\n\n       \"If all my mischiefs were recompensed\n        And God would give we what I requested,\n        I would my mistress' presence only seek,\n        Which doth mine heart in prison captive keep.\"\n\nBut who can reckon upon the dotage, madness, servitude and blindness, the\nfoolish phantasms and vanities of lovers, their torments, wishes, idle\nattempts?\n\nYet for all this, amongst so many irksome, absurd, troublesome symptoms,\ninconveniences, fantastical fits and passions which are usually incident to\nsuch persons, there be some good and graceful qualities in lovers, which\nthis affection causeth. \"As it makes wise men fools, so many times it makes\nfools become wise; [5486]it makes base fellows become generous, cowards\ncourageous,\" as Cardan notes out of Plutarch; \"covetous, liberal and\nmagnificent; clowns, civil; cruel, gentle; wicked, profane persons, to\nbecome religious; slovens, neat; churls, merciful; and dumb dogs, eloquent;\nyour lazy drones, quick and nimble.\" _Feras mentes domat cupido_, that\nfierce, cruel and rude Cyclops Polyphemus sighed, and shed many a salt tear\nfor Galatea's sake. No passion causeth greater alterations, or more\nvehement of joy or discontent. Plutarch. _Sympos. lib. 5. quaest. 1_,\n[5487] saith, \"that the soul of a man in love is full of perfumes and sweet\nodours, and all manner of pleasing tones and tunes, insomuch that it is\nhard to say (as he adds) whether love do mortal men more harm than good.\"\nIt adds spirits and makes them, otherwise soft and silly, generous and\ncourageous, [5488]_Audacem faciebat amor_. Ariadne's love made Theseus so\nadventurous, and Medea's beauty Jason so victorious; _expectorat amor\ntimorem_. [5489]Plato is of opinion that the love of Venus made Mars so\nvalorous. \"A young man will be much abashed to commit any foul offence that\nshall come to the hearing or sight of his mistress.\" As [5490]he that\ndesired of his enemy now dying, to lay him with his face upward, _ne\namasius videret eum a tergo vulneratum_, lest his sweetheart should say he\nwas a coward. \"And if it were [5491]possible to have an army consist of\nlovers, such as love, or are beloved, they would be extraordinary valiant\nand wise in their government, modesty would detain them from doing amiss,\nemulation incite them to do that which is good and honest, and a few of\nthem would overcome a great company of others.\" There is no man so\npusillanimous, so very a dastard, whom love would not incense, make of a\ndivine temper, and an heroical spirit. As he said in like case, [5492]\n_Tota ruat caeli moles, non terreor_, &c. Nothing can terrify, nothing can\ndismay them. But as Sir Blandimor and Paridel, those two brave fairy\nknights, fought for the love of fair Florimel in presence--\n\n[5493] \"And drawing both their swords with rage anew,\n        Like two mad mastives each other slew,\n        And shields did share, and males did rash, and helms did hew;\n        So furiously each other did assail,\n        As if their souls at once they would have rent,\n        Out of their breasts, that streams of blood did trail\n        Adown as if their springs of life were spent,\n        That all the ground with purple blood was sprent,\n        And all their armour stain'd with bloody gore,\n        Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent.\n        So mortal was their malice and so sore,\n        That both resolved (than yield) to die before.\"\n\nEvery base swain in love will dare to do as much for his dear mistress'\nsake. He will fight and fetch, [5494]Argivum Clypeum, that famous buckler\nof Argos, to do her service, adventure at all, undertake any enterprise.\nAnd as Serranus the Spaniard, then Governor of Sluys, made answer to\nMarquess Spinola, if the enemy brought 50,000 devils against him he would\nkeep it. The nine worthies, Oliver and Rowland, and forty dozen of peers\nare all in him, he is all mettle, armour of proof, more than a man, and in\nthis case improved beyond himself. For as [5495]Agatho contends, a true\nlover is wise, just, temperate, and valiant. [5496]\"I doubt not, therefore,\nbut if a man had such an army of lovers\" (as Castilio supposeth) \"he might\nsoon conquer all the world, except by chance he met with such another army\nof inamoratos to oppose it.\" [5497]For so perhaps they might fight as that\nfatal dog and fatal hare in the heavens, course one another round, and\nnever make an end. Castilio thinks Ferdinand King of Spain would never have\nconquered Granada, had not Queen Isabel and her ladies been present at the\nsiege: [5498]\"It cannot be expressed what courage the Spanish knights took,\nwhen the ladies were present, a few Spaniards overcame a multitude of\nMoors.\" They will undergo any danger whatsoever, as Sir Walter Manny in\nEdward the Third's time, stuck full of ladies' favours, fought like a\ndragon. For _soli amantes_, as [5499]Plato holds, _pro amicis mori\nappetunt_, only lovers will die for their friends, and in their mistress'\nquarrel. And for that cause he would have women follow the camp, to be\nspectators and encouragers of noble actions: upon such an occasion, the\n[5500]Squire of Dames himself, Sir Lancelot or Sir Tristram, Caesar, or\nAlexander, shall not be more resolute or go beyond them.\n\nNot courage only doth love add, but as I said, subtlety, wit, and many\npretty devices, [5501]_Namque dolos inspirat amor, fraudesque ministrat_,\n[5502]Jupiter in love with Leda, and not knowing how to compass his desire,\nturned himself into a swan, and got Venus to pursue him in the likeness of\nan eagle; which she doing, for shelter, he fled to Leda's lap, _et in ejus\ngremio se collocavit_, Leda embraced him, and so fell fast asleep, _sed\ndormientem Jupiter compressit_, by which means Jupiter had his will.\nInfinite such tricks love can devise, such fine feats in abundance, with\nwisdom and wariness, [5503]_quis fallere possit amantem_. All manner of\ncivility, decency, compliment and good behaviour, _plus solis et leporis_,\npolite graces and merry conceits. Boccaccio hath a pleasant tale to this\npurpose, which he borrowed from the Greeks, and which Beroaldus hath turned\ninto Latin, Bebelius in verse, of Cymon and Iphigenia. This Cymon was a\nfool, a proper man of person, and the governor of Cyprus' son. but a very\nass, insomuch that his father being ashamed of him, sent him to a farmhouse\nhe had in the country, to be brought up. Where by chance, as his manner\nwas, walking alone, he espied a gallant young gentlewoman, named Iphigenia,\na burgomaster's daughter of Cyprus, with her maid, by a brook side in a\nlittle thicket, fast asleep in her smock, where she had newly bathed\nherself: \"When [5504]Cymon saw her, he stood leaning on his staff, gaping\non her immovable, and in amaze;\" at last he fell so far in love with the\nglorious object, that he began to rouse himself up, to bethink what he was,\nwould needs follow her to the city, and for her sake began to be civil, to\nlearn to sing and dance, to play on instruments, and got all those\ngentlemanlike qualities and compliments in a short space, which his friends\nwere most glad of. In brief, he became, from an idiot and a clown, to be\none of the most complete gentlemen in Cyprus, did many valorous exploits,\nand all for the love of mistress Iphigenia. In a word, I may say thus much\nof them all, let them be never so clownish, rude and horrid, Grobians and\nsluts, if once they be in love they will be most neat and spruce; for,\n[5505]_Omnibus rebus, et nitidis nitoribus antevenit amor_, they will\nfollow the fashion, begin to trick up, and to have a good opinion of\nthemselves, _venustatem enim mater Venus_; a ship is not so long a rigging\nas a young gentlewoman a trimming up herself against her sweetheart comes.\nA painter's shop, a flowery meadow, no so gracious aspect in nature's\nstorehouse as a young maid, _nubilis puella_, a Novitsa or Venetian bride,\nthat looks for a husband, or a young man that is her suitor; composed\nlooks, composed gait, clothes, gestures, actions, all composed; all the\ngraces, elegances in the world are in her face. Their best robes, ribands,\nchains, jewels, lawns, linens, laces, spangles, must come on,\n[5506]_praeter quam res patitur student elegantiae_, they are beyond all\nmeasure coy, nice, and too curious on a sudden; 'tis all their study, all\ntheir business, how to wear their clothes neat, to be polite and terse, and\nto set out themselves. No sooner doth a young man see his sweetheart\ncoming, but he smugs up himself, pulls up his cloak now fallen about his\nshoulders, ties his garters, points, sets his band, cuffs, slicks his hair,\ntwires his beard, &c. When Mercury was to come before his mistress,\n\n[5507]  ------\"Chlamydemque ut pendeat apte\n        Collocat, ut limbus totumque appareat aurum.\"\n\n       \"He put his cloak in order, that the lace.\n        And hem, and gold-work, all might have his grace.\"\n\nSalmacis would not be seen of Hermaphroditus, till she had spruced up\nherself first,\n\n[5508] \"Nec tamen ante adiit, etsi properabat adire,\n        Quam se composuit, quam circumspexit amictus,\n        Et finxit vultum, et meruit formosa videri.\"\n\n       \"Nor did she come, although 'twas her desire,\n        Till she compos'd herself, and trimm'd her tire,\n        And set her looks to make him to admire.\"\n\nVenus had so ordered the matter, that when her son [5509]Aeneas was to\nappear before Queen Dido, he was\n\n       \"Os humerosque deo similis (namque ipsa decoram\n        Caesariem nato genetrix, lumenque juventae\n        Purpureum et laetos oculis afflarat honores.\")\n\nlike a god, for she was the tire-woman herself, to set him out with all\nnatural and artificial impostures. As mother Mammea did her son\nHeliogabalus, new chosen emperor, when he was to be seen of the people\nfirst. When the hirsute cyclopical Polyphemus courted Galatea;\n\n[5510] \"Jamque tibi formae, jamque est tibi cura placendi,\n        Jam rigidos pectis rastris Polypheme capillos,\n        Jam libet hirsutam tibi falce recidere barbam,\n        Et spectare feros in aqua et componere vultus.\"\n\n       \"And then he did begin to prank himself,\n        To plait and comb his head, and beard to shave,\n        And look his face i' th' water as a glass,\n        And to compose himself for to be brave.\"\n\nHe was upon a sudden now spruce and keen, as a new ground hatchet. He now\nbegan to have a good opinion of his own features and good parts, now to be\na gallant.\n\n       \"Jam Galatea veni, nec munera despice nostra,\n        Certe ego me novi, liquidaque in imagine vidi\n        Nuper aquae, placuitque mihi mea forma videnti.\"\n\n       \"Come now, my Galatea, scorn me not,\n        Nor my poor presents; for but yesterday\n        I saw myself i' th' water, and methought\n        Full fair I was, then scorn me not I say.\"\n\n[5511] \"Non sum adeo informis, nuper me in littore vidi,\n        Cum placidum ventis staret mare\"------\n\n'Tis the common humour of all suitors to trick up themselves, to be\nprodigal in apparel, _pure lotus_, neat, combed, and curled, with powdered\nhair, _comptus et calimistratus_, with a long love-lock, a flower in his\near, perfumed gloves, rings, scarves, feathers, points, &c. as if he were a\nprince's Ganymede, with everyday new suits, as the fashion varies; going as\nif he trod upon eggs, as Heinsius writ to Primierus, [5512]\"if once he be\nbesotten on a wench, he must like awake at nights, renounce his book, sigh\nand lament, now and then weep for his hard hap, and mark above all things\nwhat hats, bands, doublets, breeches, are in fashion, how to cut his beard,\nand wear his locks, to turn up his mustachios, and curl his head, prune his\npickedevant, or if he wear it abroad, that the east side be correspondent\nto the west;\" he may be scoffed at otherwise, as Julian that apostate\nemperor was for wearing a long hirsute goatish beard, fit to make ropes\nwith, as in his Mysopogone, or that apologetical oration he made at Antioch\nto excuse himself, he doth ironically confess, it hindered his kissing,\n_nam non licuit inde pura puris, eoque suavioribus labra labris adjungere_,\nbut he did not much esteem it, as it seems by the sequel, _de accipiendis\ndandisve osculis non laboro_, yet (to follow mine author) it may much\nconcern a young lover, he must be more respectful in this behalf, \"he must\nbe in league with an excellent tailor, barber,\"\n\n[5513] \"Tonsorem pucrum sed arte talem,\n        Qualis nec Thalamis fuit Neronis;\"\n\n\"have neat shoe-ties, points, garters, speak in print, walk in print, eat\nand drink in print, and that which is all in all, he must be mad in print.\"\n\nAmongst other good qualities an amorous fellow is endowed with, he must\nlearn to sing and dance, play upon some instrument or other, as without all\ndoubt he will, if he be truly touched with this loadstone of love. For as\n[5514]Erasmus hath it, _Musicam docet amor et Poesia_, love will make them\nmusicians, and to compose ditties, madrigals, elegies, love sonnets, and\nsing them to several pretty tunes, to get all good qualities may be had.\n[5515]Jupiter perceived Mercury to be in love with Philologia, because he\nlearned languages, polite speech, (for Suadela herself was Venus' daughter,\nas some write) arts and sciences, _quo virgini placeret_, all to ingratiate\nhimself, and please his mistress. 'Tis their chiefest study to sing, dance;\nand without question, so many gentlemen and gentlewomen would not be so\nwell qualified in this kind, if love did not incite them. [5516]\"Who,\"\nsaith Castilio, \"would learn to play, or give his mind to music, learn to\ndance, or make so many rhymes, love-songs, as most do, but for women's\nsake, because they hope by that means to purchase their good wills, and win\ntheir favour?\" We see this daily verified in our young women and wives,\nthey that being maids took so much pains to sing, play, and dance, with\nsuch cost and charge to their parents, to get those graceful qualities, now\nbeing married will scarce touch an instrument, they care not for it.\nConstantine _agricult. lib. 11. cap. 18_, makes Cupid himself to be a great\ndancer; by the same token as he was capering amongst the gods, [5517]\"he\nflung down a bowl of nectar, which distilling upon the white rose, ever\nsince made it red:\" and Calistratus, by the help of Dedalus, about Cupid's\nstatue [5518]made a many of young wenches still a dancing, to signify\nbelike that Cupid was much affected with it, as without all doubt he was.\nFor at his and Psyche's wedding, the gods being present to grace the feast,\nGanymede filled nectar in abundance (as [5519]Apuleius describes it),\nVulcan was the cook, the Hours made all fine with roses and flowers, Apollo\nplayed on the harp, the Muses sang to it, _sed suavi Musicae super ingressa\nVenus saltavit_, but his mother Venus danced to his and their sweet\ncontent. Witty [5520]Lucian in that pathetical love passage, or pleasant\ndescription of Jupiter's stealing of Europa, and swimming from Phoenicia to\nCrete, makes the sea calm, the winds hush, Neptune and Amphitrite riding in\ntheir chariot to break the waves before them, the tritons dancing round\nabout, with every one a torch, the sea-nymphs half naked, keeping time on\ndolphins' backs, and singing Hymeneus, Cupid nimbly tripping on the top of\nthe waters, and Venus herself coming after in a shell, strewing roses and\nflowers on their heads. Praxiteles, in all his pictures of love, feigns\nCupid ever smiling, and looking upon dancers; and in St. Mark's in Rome\n(whose work I know not), one of the most delicious pieces, is a many of\n[5521]satyrs dancing about a wench asleep. So that dancing still is as it\nwere a necessary appendix to love matters. Young lasses are never better\npleased than when as upon a holiday, after evensong, they may meet their\nsweethearts, and dance about a maypole, or in a town-green under a shady\nelm. Nothing so familiar in. [5522]France, as for citizens' wives and maids\nto dance a round in the streets, and often too, for want of better\ninstruments, to make good music of their own voices, and dance after it.\nYea many times this love will make old men and women that have more toes\nthan teeth, dance,--\"John, come kiss me now,\" mask and mum; for Comus and\nHymen love masks, and all such merriments above measure, will allow men to\nput on women's apparel in some cases, and promiscuously to dance, young and\nold, rich and poor, generous and base, of all sorts. Paulus Jovius taxeth\nAugustine Niphus the philosopher, [5523]\"for that being an old man, and a\npublic professor, a father of many children, he was so mad for the love of\na young maid (that which many of his friends were ashamed to see), an old\ngouty fellow, yet would dance after fiddlers.\" Many laughed him to scorn\nfor it, but this omnipotent love would have it so.\n\n[5524] \"Hyacinthino bacillo\n        Properans amor, me adegit\n        Violenter ad sequendum.\"\n\n       \"Love hasty with his purple staff did make\n        Me follow and the dance to undertake.\"\n\nAnd 'tis no news this, no indecorum; for why? a good reason may be given of\nit. Cupid and death met both in an inn; and being merrily disposed, they\ndid exchange some arrows from either quiver; ever since young men die, and\noftentimes old men dote--[5525]_Sic moritur Juvenis, sic moribundus amat_.\nAnd who can then withstand it? If once we be in love, young or old, though\nour teeth shake in our heads, like virginal jacks, or stand parallel\nasunder like the arches of a bridge, there is no remedy, we must dance\ntrenchmore for a need, over tables, chairs, and stools, &c. And princum\nprancum is a fine dance. Plutarch, _Sympos. 1. quaest. 5._ doth in some\nsort excuse it, and telleth us moreover in what sense, _Musicam docet amor,\nlicet prius fuerit rudis_, how love makes them that had no skill before\nlearn to sing and dance; he concludes, 'tis only that power and prerogative\nlove hath over us. [5526]\"Love\" (as he holds) \"will make a silent man\nspeak, a modest man most officious; dull, quick; slow, nimble; and that\nwhich is most to be admired, a hard, base, untractable churl, as fire doth\niron in a smith's forge, free, facile, gentle, and easy to be entreated.\"\nNay, 'twill make him prodigal in the other extreme, and give a\n[5527]hundred sesterces for a night's lodging, as they did of old to Lais\nof Corinth, or [5528] _ducenta drachmarum millia pro unica nocte_, as\nMundus to Paulina, spend all his fortunes (as too many do in like case) to\nobtain his suit. For which cause many compare love to wine, which makes men\njovial and merry, frolic and sad, whine, sing, dance, and what not.\n\nBut above all the other symptoms of lovers, this is not lightly to be\noverpassed, that likely of what condition soever, if once they be in love,\nthey turn to their ability, rhymers, ballad makers, and poets. For as\nPlutarch saith, [5529]\"They will be witnesses and trumpeters of their\nparamours' good parts, bedecking them with verses and commendatory songs,\nas we do statues with gold, that they may be remembered and admired of\nall.\" Ancient men will dote in this kind sometimes as well as the rest; the\nheat of love will thaw their frozen affections, dissolve the ice of age,\nand so far enable them, though they be sixty years of age above the girdle,\nto be scarce thirty beneath. Jovianus Pontanus makes an old fool rhyme, and\nturn poetaster to please his mistress.\n\n[5530] \"Ne ringas Mariana, meos me dispice canos,\n        De sene nam juvenem dia referre potes,\" &c.\n\n       \"Sweet Marian do not mine age disdain,\n        For thou canst make an old man young again.\"\n\nThey will be still singing amorous songs and ditties (if young especially),\nand cannot abstain though it be when they go to, or should be at church. We\nhave a pretty story to this purpose in [5531]Westmonasteriensis, an old\nwriter of ours (if you will believe it) _An. Dom._ 1012. at Colewiz in\nSaxony, on Christmas eve a company of young men and maids, whilst the\npriest was at mass in the church, were singing catches and love songs in\nthe churchyard, he sent to them to make less noise, but they sung on still:\nand if you will, you shall have the very song itself.\n\n       \"Equitabat homo per sylvam frondosam,\n        Ducebatque secum Meswinden formosam.\n                Quid stamus, cur non imus?\"\n\n       \"A fellow rid by the greenwood side,\n        And fair Meswinde was his bride,\n                Why stand we so, and do not go?\"\n\nThis they sung, he chaft, till at length, impatient as he was, he prayed to\nSt. Magnus, patron of the church, they might all three sing and dance till\nthat time twelvemonth, and so [5532]they did without meat and drink,\nwearisomeness or giving over, till at year's end they ceased singing, and\nwere absolved by Herebertus archbishop of Cologne. They will in all places\nbe doing thus, young folks especially, reading love stories, talking of\nthis or that young man, such a fair maid, singing, telling or hearing\nlascivious tales, scurrilous tunes, such objects are their sole delight,\ntheir continual meditation, and as Guastavinius adds, _Com. in 4. Sect. 27.\nProv. Arist._ _ob seminis abundantiam crebrae cogitationes, veneris\nfrequens recordatio et pruriens voluptas_, &c. an earnest longing comes\nhence, _pruriens corpus, pruriens anima_, amorous conceits, tickling\nthoughts, sweet and pleasant hopes; hence it is, they can think, discourse\nwillingly, or speak almost of no other subject. 'Tis their only desire, if\nit may be done by art, to see their husband's picture in a glass, they'll\ngive anything to know when they shall be married, how many husbands they\nshall have, by cromnyomantia, a kind of divination with [5533]onions laid\non the altar on Christmas eve, or by fasting on St. Anne's eve or night, to\nknow who shall be their first husband, or by amphitormantia, by beans in a\ncake, &c., to burn the same. This love is the cause of all good conceits,\n[5534] neatness, exornations, plays, elegancies, delights, pleasant\nexpressions, sweet motions, and gestures, joys, comforts, exultancies, and\nall the sweetness of our life, [5535]_qualis jam vita foret, aut quid\njucundi sine aurea Venere_? [5536]_Emoriar cum ista non amplius mihi cura\nfuerit_, let me live no longer than I may love, saith a mad merry fellow in\nMimnermus. This love is that salt that seasoneth our harsh and dull\nlabours, and gives a pleasant relish to our other unsavoury proceedings,\n[5537]_Absit amor, surgunt tenebrae, torpedo, veternum, pestis_, &c. All\nour feasts almost, masques, mummings, banquets, merry meetings, weddings,\npleasing songs, fine tunes, poems, love stories, plays, comedies, Atellans,\njigs, Fescennines, elegies, odes, &c. proceed hence. [5538]Danaus, the son\nof Belus, at his daughter's wedding at Argos, instituted the first plays\n(some say) that ever were heard of symbols, emblems, impresses, devices, if\nwe shall believe Jovius, Coutiles, Paradine, Camillus de Camillis, may be\nascribed to it. Most of our arts and sciences, painting amongst the rest,\nwas first invented, saith [5539]Patritius _ex amoris beneficio_, for love's\nsake. For when the daughter of [5540]Deburiades the Sycionian, was to take\nleave of her sweetheart now going to wars, _ut desiderio ejus minus\ntabesceret_, to comfort herself in his absence, she took his picture with\ncoal upon a wall, as the candle gave the shadow, which her father admiring,\nperfected afterwards, and it was the first picture by report that ever was\nmade. And long after, Sycion for painting, carving, statuary, music, and\nphilosophy, was preferred before all the cities in Greece. [5541]Apollo was\nthe first inventor of physic, divination, oracles; Minerva found out\nweaving, Vulcan curious ironwork, Mercury letters, but who prompted all\nthis into their heads? Love, _Nunquam talia invenissent, nisi talia\nadamassent_, they loved such things, or some party, for whose sake they\nwere undertaken at first. 'Tis true, Vulcan made a most admirable brooch or\nnecklace, which long after Axion and Temenus, Phegius' sons, for the\nsingular worth of it, consecrated to Apollo at Delphos, but Pharyllus the\ntyrant stole it away, and presented it to Ariston's wife, on whom he\nmiserably doted (Parthenius tells the story out of Phylarchus); but why did\nVulcan make this excellent Ouch? to give Hermione Cadmus' wife, whom he\ndearly loved. All our tilts and tournaments, orders of the garter, golden\nfleece, &c.--_Nobilitas sub amore jacet_--owe their beginnings to love, and\nmany of our histories. By this means, saith Jovius, they would express\ntheir loving minds to their mistress, and to the beholders. 'Tis the sole\nsubject almost of poetry, all our invention tends to it, all our songs,\nwhatever those old Anacreons: (and therefore Hesiod makes the Muses and\nGraces still follow Cupid, and as Plutarch holds, Menander and the rest of\nthe poets were love's priests,) all our Greek and Latin epigrammatists,\nlove writers. Antony Diogenes the most ancient, whose epitome we find in\nPhocius Bibliotheca, Longus Sophista, Eustathius, Achilles, Tatius,\nAristaenetus, Heliodorus, Plato, Plutarch, Lucian, Parthenius, Theodorus,\nProdromus, Ovid, Catullus, Tibullus, &c. Our new Ariostoes, Boyards,\nAuthors of Arcadia, Urania, Faerie Queen, &c. Marullus, Leotichius,\nAngerianus, Stroza, Secundus, Capellanus, &c. with the rest of those facete\nmodern poets, have written in this kind, are but as so many symptoms of\nlove. Their whole books are a synopsis or breviary of love, the portuous of\nlove, legends of lovers' lives and deaths, and of their memorable\nadventures, nay more, _quod leguntur, quod laudantur amori debent_, as\n[5542]Nevisanus the lawyer holds, \"there never was any excellent poet that\ninvented good fables, or made laudable verses, which was not in love\nhimself;\" had he not taken a quill from Cupid's wings, he could never have\nwritten so amorously as he did.\n\n[5543] \"Cynthia te vatem fecit lascive Properti,\n          Ingenium Galli pulchra Lycoris habet.\n        Fama est arguti Nemesis formosa Tibulli,\n          Lesbia dictavit docte Catulle tibi.\n        Non me Pelignus, nec spernet Mantua vatem,\n          Si qua Corinna mihi, si quis Alexis erit.\"\n\n       \"Wanton Propertius and witty Callus,\n        Subtile Tibullus, and learned Catullus,\n        It was Cynthia, Lesbia, Lychoris,\n        That made you poets all; and if Alexis,\n        Or Corinna chance my paramour to be,\n        Virgil and Ovid shall not despise me.\"\n\n[5544] \"Non me carminibus vincet nec Thraceus Orpheus,\n        Nec Linus.\"\n\nPetrarch's Laura made him so famous, Astrophel's Stella, and Jovianus\nPontanus' mistress was the cause of his roses, violets, lilies, _nequitiae,\nblanditiae, joci, decor, nardus, ver, corolla, thus, Mars, Pallas, Venus,\nCharis, crocum, Laurus, unguentem, costum, lachrymae, myrrha, musae_, &c.\nand the rest of his poems; why are Italians at this day generally so good\npoets and painters? Because every man of any fashion amongst them hath his\nmistress. The very rustics and hog-rubbers, Menalcas and Corydon, _qui\nfaetant de stercore equino_, those fulsome knaves, if once they taste of\nthis love-liquor, are inspired in an instant. Instead of those accurate\nemblems, curious impresses, gaudy masques, tilts, tournaments, &c., they\nhave their wakes, Whitsun-ales, shepherd's feasts, meetings on holidays,\ncountry dances, roundelays, writing their names on [5545]trees, true\nlover's knots, pretty gifts.\n\n       \"With tokens, hearts divided, and half rings,\n        Shepherds in their loves are as coy as kings.\"\n\nChoosing lords, ladies, kings, queens, and valentines, &c., they go by\ncouples,\n\n       \"Corydon's Phillis, Nysa and Mopsus,\n        With dainty Dousibel and Sir Tophus.\"\n\nInstead of odes, epigrams and elegies, &c., they have their ballads,\ncountry tunes, \"O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,\" ditties and songs,\n\"Bess a belle, she doth excel,\"--they must write likewise and indite all in\nrhyme.\n\n[5546] \"Thou honeysuckle of the hawthorn hedge,\n        Vouchsafe in Cupid's cup my heart to pledge;\n        My heart's dear blood, sweet Cis is thy carouse\n        Worth all the ale in Gammer Gubbin's house.\n        I say no more, affairs call me away,\n        My father's horse for provender doth stay.\n        Be thou the Lady Cressetlight to me.\n        Sir Trolly Lolly will I prove to thee.\n        Written in haste, farewell my cowslip sweet,\n        Pray let's a Sunday at the alehouse meet.\"\n\nYour most grim stoics and severe philosophers will melt away with this\npassion, and if [5547]Atheneus belie them not, Aristippus, Apollodorus,\nAntiphanes, &c., have made love-songs and commentaries of their mistress'\npraises, [5548]orators write epistles, princes give titles, honours, what\nnot? [5549]Xerxes gave to Themistocles Lampsacus to find him wine, Magnesia\nfor bread, and Myunte for the rest of his diet. The [5550]Persian kings\nallotted whole cities to like use, _haec civitas mulieri redimiculum\npraebeat, haec in collum, haec in crines_, one whole city served to dress\nher hair, another her neck, a third her hood. Ahasuerus would [5551]have\ngiven Esther half his empire, and [5552]Herod bid Herodias \"ask what she\nwould, she should have it.\" Caligula gave 100,000 sesterces to his\ncourtesan at first word, to buy her pins, and yet when he was solicited by\nthe senate to bestow something to repair the decayed walls of Rome for the\ncommonwealth's good, he would give but 6000 sesterces at most.\n[5553]Dionysius, that Sicilian tyrant, rejected all his privy councillors,\nand was so besotted on Mirrha his favourite and mistress, that he would\nbestow no office, or in the most weightiest business of the kingdom do\naught without her especial advice, prefer, depose, send, entertain no man,\nthough worthy and well deserving, but by her consent; and he again whom she\ncommended, howsoever unfit, unworthy, was as highly approved. Kings and\nemperors, instead of poems, build cities; Adrian built Antinoa in Egypt,\nbesides constellations, temples, altars, statues, images, &c., in the\nhonour of his Antinous. Alexander bestowed infinite sums to set out his\nHephestion to all eternity. [5554]Socrates professeth himself love's\nservant, ignorant in all arts and sciences, a doctor alone in love matters,\n_et quum alienarum rerum omnium scientiam diffiteretur_, saith\n[5555]Maximus Tyrius, _his sectator, hujus negotii professor_, &c., and\nthis he spake openly, at home and abroad, at public feasts, in the academy,\n_in Pyraeo, Lycaeo, sub Platano_, &c., the very bloodhound of beauty, as he\nis styled by others. But I conclude there is no end of love's symptoms,\n'tis a bottomless pit. Love is subject to no dimensions; not to be surveyed\nby any art or engine: and besides, I am of [5556]Haedus' mind, \"no man can\ndiscourse of love matters, or judge of them aright, that hath not made\ntrial in his own person,\" or as Aeneas Sylvius [5557]adds, \"hath not a\nlittle doted, been mad or lovesick himself.\" I confess I am but a novice, a\ncontemplator only, _Nescio quid sit amor nec amo_[5558]--I have a tincture;\nfor why should I lie, dissemble or excuse it, yet _homo sum_, &c., not\naltogether inexpert in this subject, _non sum praeceptor amandi_, and what\nI say, is merely reading, _ex altorum forsan ineptiis_, by mine own\nobservation, and others' relation.\n\n\nMEMB. IV.\n_Prognostics of Love-Melancholy_.\n\nWhat fires, torments, cares, jealousies, suspicions, fears, griefs,\nanxieties, accompany such as are in love, I have sufficiently said: the\nnext question is, what will be the event of such miseries, what they\nforetell. Some are of opinion that this love cannot be cured, _Nullis amor\nest medicabilis herbis_, it accompanies them to the [5559]last, _Idem amor\nexitio est pecori pecorisque magistro_. \"The same passion consume both the\nsheep and the shepherd,\" and is so continuate, that by no persuasion almost\nit may be relieved. [5560]\"Bid me not love,\" said Euryalus, \"bid the\nmountains come down into the plains, bid the rivers run back to their\nfountains; I can as soon leave to love, as the sun leave his course;\"\n\n[5561] \"Et prius aequoribus pisces, et montibus umbrae,\n        Et volucres deerunt sylvis, et murmura ventis,\n        Quam mihi discedent formosae Amaryllidis ignes.\"\n\n       \"First seas shall want their fish, the mountains shade\n        Woods singing birds, the wind's murmur shall fade,\n        Than my fair Amaryllis' love allay'd.\"\n\nBid me not love, bid a deaf man hear, a blind man see, a dumb speak, lame\nrun, counsel can do no good, a sick man cannot relish, no physic can ease\nme. _Non prosunt domino quae prosunt omnibus artes_. As Apollo confessed,\nand Jupiter himself could not be cured.\n\n[5562] \"Omnes humanos curat medicina dolores,\n        Solus amor morbi non habet artificem.\"\n\n       \"Physic can soon cure every disease,\n[5563]  Excepting love that can it not appease.\"\n\nBut whether love may be cured or no, and by what means, shall be explained\nin his place; in the meantime, if it take his course, and be not otherwise\neased or amended, it breaks out into outrageous often and prodigious\nevents. _Amor et Liber violenti dii sunt_) as [5564]Tatius observes, _et\neousque animum incendunt, ut pudoris oblivisci cogant_, love and Bacchus\nare so violent gods, so furiously rage in our minds, that they make us\nforget all honesty, shame, and common civility. For such men ordinarily, as\nare thoroughly possessed with this humour, become _insensati et insani_,\nfor it is [5565]_amor insanus_, as the poet calls it, beside themselves,\nand as I have proved, no better than beasts, irrational, stupid,\nheadstrong, void of fear of God or men, they frequently forswear\nthemselves, spend, steal, commit incests, rapes, adulteries, murders,\ndepopulate towns, cities, countries, to satisfy their lust.\n\n[5566] \"A devil 'tis, and mischief such doth work,\n        As never yet did Pagan, Jew, or Turk.\"\n\nThe wars of Troy may be a sufficient witness; and as Appian, _lib. 5.\nhist_, saith of Antony and Cleopatra, [5567]\"Their love brought themselves\nand all Egypt into extreme and miserable calamities,\" \"the end of her is as\nbitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword,\" Prov. v. 4, 5. \"Her\nfeet go down to death, her steps lead on to hell. She is more bitter than\ndeath,\" (Eccles. vii. 28.) \"and the sinner shall be taken by her.\"\n[5568]_Qui in amore praecipitavit, pejus perit, quam qui saxo salit_.\n[5569]\"He that runs headlong from the top of a rock is not in so bad a case\nas he that falls into this gulf of love.\" \"For hence,\" saith [5570]\nPlatina, \"comes repentance, dotage, they lose themselves, their wits, and\nmake shipwreck of their fortunes altogether:\" madness, to make away\nthemselves and others, violent death. _Prognosticatio est talis_, saith\nGordonius, [5571]_si non succurratur iis, aut in maniam cadunt, aut\nmoriuntur_; the prognostication is, they will either run mad, or die. \"For\nif this passion continue,\" saith [5572]Aelian Montaltus, \"it makes the\nblood hot, thick, and black; and if the inflammation get into the brain,\nwith continual meditation and waking, it so dries it up, that madness\nfollows, or else they make away themselves,\" [5573]_O Corydon, Corydon,\nquae te dementia cepit_? Now, as Arnoldus adds, it will speedily work these\neffects, if it be not presently helped; [5574]\"They will pine away, run\nmad, and die upon a sudden;\" _Facile incidunt in maniam_, saith Valescus,\nquickly mad, _nisi succurratur_, if good order be not taken,\n\n[5575] \"Ehou triste jugum quisquis amoris habet,\n        Is prius se norit se periisse perit.\"\n\n       \"Oh heavy yoke of love, which whoso bears,\n        Is quite undone, and that at unawares.\"\n\nSo she confessed of herself in the poet,\n\n[5576]  ------\"insaniam priusquam quis sentiat,\n        Vix pili intervallo a furore absum.\"\n\n       \"I shall be mad before it be perceived,\n        A hair-breadth off scarce am I, now distracted.\"\n\nAs mad as Orlando for his Angelica, or Hercules for his Hylas,\n\n       \"At ille ruebat quo pedes ducebant, furibundus,\n        Nam illi saevus Deus intus jecur laniabat.\"\n\n       \"He went he car'd not whither, mad he was,\n        The cruel God so tortured him, alas!\"\n\nAt the sight of Hero I cannot tell how many ran mad,\n\n[5577] \"Alius vulnus celans insanit pulchritudine puellae.\"\n\n       \"And whilst he doth conceal his grief,\n        Madness comes on him like a thief.\"\n\nGo to Bedlam for examples. It is so well known in every village, how many\nhave either died for love, or voluntary made away themselves, that I need\nnot much labour to prove it: [5578]_Nec modus aut requies nisi mors\nreperitur amoris_: death is the common catastrophe to such persons.\n\n[5579] \"Mori mihi contingat, non enim alia\n        Liberatio ab aeramnis fuerit ullo paeto istis.\"\n\n       \"Would I were dead, for nought, God knows,\n        But death can rid me of these woes.\"\n\nAs soon as Euryalus departed from Senes, Lucretia, his paramour, \"never\nlooked up, no jests could exhilarate her sad mind, no joys comfort her\nwounded and distressed soul, but a little after she fell sick and died.\"\nBut this is a gentle end, a natural death, such persons commonly make away\nthemselves.\n\n        ------\"proprioque in sanguine laetus,\n        Indignantem animam vacuas elludit in auras;\"\n\nso did Dido; _Sed moriamur ait, sic sic juvat ire per umbras_; [5580]\nPyramus and Thisbe, Medea, [5581]Coresus and Callirhoe, [5582]Theagines the\nphilosopher, and many myriads besides, and so will ever do,\n\n[5583]  ------\"et mihi fortis\n        Est manus, est et amor, dabit hic in vulnera vires.\"\n\n       \"Whoever heard a story of more woe,\n        Than that of Juliet and her Romeo?\"\n\nRead Parthenium in _Eroticis_, and Plutarch's _amatorias narrationes_, or\nlove stories, all tending almost to this purpose. Valleriola, _lib. 2.\nobserv. 7_, hath a lamentable narration of a merchant, his patient, [5584]\n\"that raving through impatience of love, had he not been watched, would\nevery while have offered violence to himself.\" Amatus Lusitanus, _cent. 3.\ncar. 56_, hath such [5585]another story, and Felix Plater, _med. observ.\nlib. 1._ a third of a young [5586]gentleman that studied physic, and for\nthe love of a doctor's daughter, having no hope to compass his desire,\npoisoned himself, [5587]anno 1615. A barber in Frankfort, because his wench\nwas betrothed to another, cut his own throat. [5588]At Neoburg, the same\nyear, a young man, because he could not get her parents' consent, killed\nhis sweetheart, and afterward himself, desiring this of the magistrate, as\nhe gave up the ghost, that they might be buried in one grave, _Quodque\nrogis superest una requiescat in urna_, which [5589] Gismunda besought of\nTancredus, her father, that she might be in like sort buried with\nGuiscardus, her lover, that so their bodies might lie together in the\ngrave, as their souls wander about [5590]_Campos lugentes_ in the Elysian\nfields,--_quos durus amor crudeli tabe peredit_, [5591]in a myrtle grove\n\n[5592]  ------\"et myrtea circum\n        Sylva tegit: curae non ipsa in morte relinquunt.\"\n\nYou have not yet heard the worst, they do not offer violence to themselves\nin this rage of lust, but unto others, their nearest and dearest friends.\n[5593]Catiline killed his only son, _misitque ad orci pallida, lethi\nobnubila, obsita tenebris loca_, for the love of Aurelia Oristella, _quod\nejus nuptias vivo filio recusaret_. [5594]Laodice, the sister of\nMithridates, poisoned her husband, to give content to a base fellow whom\nshe loved. [5595]Alexander, to please Thais, a concubine of his, set\nPersepolis on fire. [5596]Nereus' wife, a widow, and lady of Athens, for\nthe love of a Venetian gentleman, betrayed the city; and he for her sake\nmurdered his wife, the daughter of a nobleman in Venice. [5597]Constantine\nDespota made away Catherine, his wife, turned his son Michael and his other\nchildren out of doors, for the love of a base scrivener's daughter in\nThessalonica, with whose beauty he was enamoured. [5598]Leucophria betrayed\nthe city where she dwelt, for her sweetheart's sake, that was in the\nenemies' camp. [5599]Pithidice, the governor's daughter of Methinia, for\nthe love of Achilles, betrayed the whole island to him, her father's enemy.\n[5600]Diognetus did as much in the city where he dwelt, for the love of\nPolicrita, Medea for the love of Jason, she taught him how to tame the\nfire-breathing brass-feeted bulls, and kill the mighty dragon that kept the\ngolden fleece, and tore her little brother Absyrtus in pieces, that her\nfather. Aethes might have something to detain him, while she ran away with\nher beloved Jason, &c. Such acts and scenes hath this tragicomedy of love.\n\n\nMEMB. V.\n\nSUBSECT. 1.--_Cure of Love-Melancholy, by Labour, Diet, Physic, Fasting,\n&c._\n\nAlthough it be controverted by some, whether love-melancholy may be cured,\nbecause it is so irresistible and violent a passion; for as you know,\n\n[5601]  ------\"facilis descensus Averni;\n        Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras;\n        Hic labor, hoc opus est.\"------\n\n       \"It is an easy passage down to hell,\n        But to come back, once there, you cannot well.\"\n\nYet without question, if it be taken in time, it may be helped, and by many\ngood remedies amended. Avicenna, _lib. 3. Fen. cap. 23. et 24._ sets down\nseven compendious ways how this malady may be eased, altered, and expelled.\nSavanarola 9. principal observations, Jason Pratensis prescribes eight\nrules besides physic, how this passion may be tamed, Laurentius 2. main\nprecepts, Arnoldus, Valleriola, Montaltus, Hildesheim, Langius, and others\ninform us otherwise, and yet all tending to, the same purpose. The sum of\nwhich I will briefly epitomise, (for I light my candle from their torches)\nand enlarge again upon occasion, as shall seem best to me, and that after\nmine own method. The first rule to be observed in this stubborn and\nunbridled passion, is exercise and diet. It is an old and well-known,\nsentence, _Sine Cerere et Saccho friget Venus_ (love grows cool without\nbread and wine). As an [5602]idle sedentary life, liberal feeding, are\ngreat causes of it, so the opposite, labour, slender and sparing diet, with\ncontinual business, are the best and most ordinary means to prevent it.\n\n       \"Otio si tollas, periere Cupidinis artes,\n        Contemptaeque jacent, et sine luce faces.\"\n\n       \"Take idleness away, and put to flight\n        Are Cupid's arts, his torches give no light.\"\n\nMinerva, Diana, Vesta, and the nine Muses were not enamoured at all,\nbecause they never were idle.\n\n[5603] \"Frustra blanditae appulistis ad has,\n        Frustra nequitiae venistis ad has,\n        Frustra delitiae obsidebitis has,\n        Frustra has illecebrae, et procacitates,\n        Et suspiria, et oscula, et susurri,\n        Et quisquis male sana corda amantum\n        Blandis ebria fascinat venenis.\"\n\n       \"In vain are all your flatteries,\n        In vain are all your knaveries,\n        Delights, deceits, procacities,\n        Sighs, kisses, and conspiracies,\n        And whate'er is done by art,\n        To bewitch a lover's heart.\"\n\n'Tis in vain to set upon those that are busy. 'Tis Savanarola's third rule,\n_Occupari in multis et magnis negotiis_, and Avicenna's precept, _cap. 24._\n[5604]_Cedit amor rebus; res, age tutus eris_. To be busy still, and as\n[5605]Guianerius enjoins, about matters of great moment, if it may be.\n[5606]Magninus adds, \"Never to be idle but at the hours of sleep.\"\n\n[5607]  ------\"et si\n        Poscas ante diem librum cum lumine, si non\n        Intendas animum studiis, et rebus honestis,\n        Invidia vel amore miser torquebere.\"------\n\n       \"For if thou dost not ply thy book,\n        By candlelight to study bent,\n        Employ'd about some honest thing,\n        Envy or love shall thee torment.\"\n\nNo better physic than to be always occupied, seriously intent.\n\n[5608] \"Cur in penates rarius tenues subit,\n        Haec delicatas eligens pestis domus,\n        Mediumque sanos vulgus affectuss tenet?\" &c.\n\n       \"Why dost thou ask, poor folks are often free,\n        And dainty places still molested be?\"\n\nBecause poor people fare coarsely, work hard, go woolward and bare. [5609]\n_Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem_. [5610]Guianerius therefore\nprescribes his patient \"to go with hair-cloth next his skin, to go\nbarefooted, and barelegged in cold weather, to whip himself now and then,\nas monks do, but above all to fast.\" Not with sweet wine, mutton and\npottage, as many of those tender-bellies do, howsoever they put on Lenten\nfaces, and whatsoever they pretend, but from all manner of meat. Fasting is\nan all-sufficient remedy of itself; for, as Jason Pratensis holds, the\nbodies of such persons that feed liberally, and live at ease, [5611]\"are\nfull of bad spirits and devils, devilish thoughts; no better physic for\nsuch parties, than to fast.\" Hildesheim, _spicel. 2._ to this of hunger,\nadds, [5612]\"often baths, much exercise and sweat,\" but hunger and fasting\nhe prescribes before the rest. And 'tis indeed our Saviour's oracle, \"This\nkind of devil is not cast out but by fasting and prayer,\" which makes the\nfathers so immoderate in commendation of fasting. As \"hunger,\" saith [5613]\nAmbrose, \"is a friend of virginity, so is it an enemy to lasciviousness,\nbut fullness overthrows chastity, and fostereth all manner of\nprovocations.\" If thine horse be too lusty, Hierome adviseth thee to take\naway some of his provender; by this means those Pauls, Hilaries, Anthonies,\nand famous anchorites, subdued the lusts of the flesh; by this means\nHilarion \"made his ass, as he called his own body, leave kicking,\" (so\n[5614]Hierome relates of him in his life) \"when the devil tempted him to\nany such foul offence.\" By this means those [5615]Indian Brahmins kept\nthemselves continent: they lay upon the ground covered with skins, as the\nred-shanks do on heather, and dieted themselves sparingly on one dish,\nwhich Guianerius would have all young men put in practice, and if that will\nnot serve, [5616]Gordonius \"would have them soundly whipped, or, to cool\ntheir courage, kept in prison,\" and there fed with bread and water till\nthey acknowledge their error, and become of another mind. If imprisonment\nand hunger will not take them down, according to the directions of that\n[5617] Theban Crates, \"time must wear it out; if time will not, the last\nrefuge is a halter.\" But this, you will say, is comically spoken.\nHowsoever, fasting, by all means, must be still used; and as they must\nrefrain from such meats formerly mentioned, which cause venery, or provoke\nlust, so they must use an opposite diet. [5618]Wine must be altogether\navoided of the younger sort. So [5619]Plato prescribes, and would have the\nmagistrates themselves abstain from it, for example's sake, highly\ncommending the Carthaginians for their temperance in this kind. And 'twas a\ngood edict, a commendable thing, so that it were not done for some sinister\nrespect, as those old Egyptians abstained from wine, because some fabulous\npoets had given out, wine sprang first from the blood of the giants, or out\nof superstition, as our modern Turks, but for temperance, it being _animae\nvirus et vitiorum fomes_, a plague itself, if immoderately taken. Women of\nold for that cause, [5620]in hot countries, were forbid the use of it; as\nseverely punished for drinking of wine as for adultery; and young folks, as\nLeonicus hath recorded, Var. _hist. l. 3. cap. 87, 88._ out of Athenaeus\nand others, and is still practised in Italy, and some other countries of\nEurope and Asia, as Claudius Minoes hath well illustrated in his Comment on\nthe 23. Emblem of Alciat. So choice is to be made of other diet.\n\n       \"Nec minus erucas aptum est vitare salaces,\n        Et quicquid veneri corpora nostra parat.\"\n\n       \"Eringos are not good for to be taken,\n        And all lascivious meats must be forsaken.\"\n\nThose opposite meats which ought to be used are cucumbers, melons,\npurslane, water-lilies, rue, woodbine, ammi, lettuce, which Lemnius so much\ncommends, _lib. 2, cap. 42._ and Mizaldus _hort. med._ to this purpose;\nvitex, or agnus castus before the rest, which, saith [5621]Magninus, hath a\nwonderful virtue in it. Those Athenian women, in their solemn feasts called\nThesmopheries, were to abstain nine days from the company of men, during\nwhich time, saith Aelian, they laid a certain herb, named hanea, in their\nbeds, which assuaged those ardent flames of love, and freed them from the\ntorments of that violent passion. See more in Porta, Matthiolus,\nCrescentius _lib. 5._ &c., and what every herbalist almost and physician\nhath written, _cap. de Satyriasi et Priapismo_; Rhasis amongst the rest. In\nsome cases again, if they be much dejected, and brought low in body, and\nnow ready to despair through anguish, grief, and too sensible a feeling of\ntheir misery, a cup of wine and full diet is not amiss, and as Valescus\nadviseth, _cum alia honesta venerem saepe exercendo_, which Langius _epist.\nmed. lib. 1. epist. 24._ approves out of Rhasis (_ad assiduationem coitus\ninvitat_] and Guianerius seconds it, _cap. 16. tract. 16._ as a [5622] very\nprofitable remedy.\n\n[5623]  ------\"tument tibi quum inguina, cum si\n        Ancilla, aut verna praesto est, tentigine rumpi\n        Malis? non ego namque,\" &c.------\n\n[5624]Jason Pratensis subscribes to this counsel of the poet, _Excretio\nenim aut tollet prorsus aut lenit aegritudinem._ As it did the raging lust\nof Ahasuerus, [5625]_qui ad impatientiam amoris leniendam, per singulas\nfere noctes novas puellas devirginavit._ And to be drunk too by fits; but\nthis is mad physic, if it be at all to be permitted. If not, yet some\npleasure is to be allowed, as that which Vives speaks of, _lib. 3. de\nanima._, [5626]\"A lover that hath as it were lost himself through\nimpotency, impatience, must be called home as a traveller, by music,\nfeasting, good wine, if need be to drunkenness itself, which many so much\ncommend for the easing of the mind, all kinds of sports and merriments, to\nsee fair pictures, hangings, buildings, pleasant fields, orchards, gardens,\ngroves, ponds, pools, rivers, fishing, fowling, hawking, hunting, to hear\nmerry tales, and pleasant discourse, reading, to use exercise till he\nsweat, that new spirits may succeed, or by some vehement affection or\ncontrary passion to be diverted till he be fully weaned from anger,\nsuspicion, cares, fears, &c., and habituated into another course.\" _Semper\ntecum sit_, (as [5627]Sempronius adviseth Calisto his lovesick master) _qui\nsermones joculares moveat, conciones ridiculas, dicteria falsa, suaves\nhistorias, fabulas venustas recenseat, coram ludat_, &c., still have a\npleasant companion to sing and tell merry tales, songs and facete\nhistories, sweet discourse, &c. And as the melody of music, merriment,\nsinging, dancing, doth augment the passion of some lovers, as [5628]\nAvicenna notes, so it expelleth it in others, and doth very much good.\nThese things must be warily applied, as the parties' symptoms vary, and as\nthey shall stand variously affected.\n\nIf there be any need of physic, that the humours be altered, or any new\nmatter aggregated, they must be cured as melancholy men. Carolus a Lorme,\namongst other questions discussed for his degree at Montpelier in France,\nhath this, _An amantes et amantes iisdem remediis curentur_? Whether lovers\nand madmen be cured by the same remedies? he affirms it; for love extended\nis mere madness. Such physic then as is prescribed, is either inward or\noutward, as hath been formerly handled in the precedent partition in the\ncure of melancholy. Consult with Valleriola _observat. lib. 2. observ. 7._\nLod. Mercatus _lib. 2. cap. 4. de mulier. affect._ Daniel Sennertus _lib.\n1. part. 2. cap. 10._ [5629]Jacobus Ferrandus the Frenchman, in his Tract\n_de amore Erotique_, Forestus _lib. 10. observ. 29 and 30_, Jason Pratensis\nand others for peculiar receipts. [5630]Amatus Lusitanus cured a young Jew,\nthat was almost mad for love, with the syrup of hellebore, and such other\nevacuations and purges which are usually prescribed to black choler:\n[5631]Avicenna confirms as much if need require, and [5632]\"bloodletting\nabove the rest,\" which makes _amantes ne sint amentes_, lovers to come to\nthemselves, and keep in their right minds. 'Tis the same which Schola\nSalernitana, Jason Pratensis, Hildesheim, &c., prescribe bloodletting to be\nused as a principal remedy. Those old Scythians had a trick to cure all\nappetite of burning lust, by [5633] letting themselves blood under the\nears, and to make both men and women barren, as Sabellicus in his\n_Aeneades_ relates of them. Which Salmuth. _Tit. 10. de Herol. comment. in\nPancirol. de nov. report._ Mercurialis, _var. lec. lib. 3. cap. 7._ out of\nHippocrates and Benzo say still is in use amongst the Indians, a reason of\nwhich Langius gives _lib. 1. epist. 10._\n\nHuc faciunt medicamenta venerem sopientia, \"ut camphora pudendis alligata,\net in bracha gestata\" (quidam ait) \"membrum flaccidum reddit. Laboravit hoc\nmorbo virgo nobilis, cui inter caetera praescripsit medicus, ut laminam\nplumbeam multis foraminibus pertusam ad dies viginti portaret in dorso; ad\nexiccandum vero sperma jussit eam quam parcissime cibari, et manducare\nfrequentur coriandrum praeparatum, et semen lactucae, et acetosae, et sic\neam a morbo liberavit\". Porro impediunt et remittunt coitum folia salicis\ntrita et epota, et si frequentius usurpentur ipsa in totum auferunt.

II.--_Withstand the beginnings, avoid occasions, change his place:\nfair and foul means, contrary passions, with witty inventions: to bring in\nanother, and discommend the former_.\n\nOther good rules and precepts are enjoined by our physicians, which, if not\nalone, yet certainly conjoined, may do much; the first of which is _obstare\nprincipiis_, to withstand the beginning,[5634]_Quisquis in primo obstitit,\nPepulitque amorem tutus ac victor fuit_, he that will but resist at first,\nmay easily be a conqueror at the last. Balthazar Castilio, _l. 4._ urgeth\nthis prescript above the rest, [5635]\"when he shall chance\" (saith he) \"to\nlight upon a woman that hath good behaviour joined with her excellent\nperson, and shall perceive his eyes with a kind of greediness to pull unto\nthem this image of beauty, and carry it to the heart: shall observe himself\nto be somewhat incensed with this influence, which moveth within: when he\nshall discern those subtle spirits sparkling in her eyes, to administer\nmore fuel to the fire, he must wisely withstand the beginnings, rouse up\nreason, stupefied almost, fortify his heart by all means, and shut up all\nthose passages, by which it may have entrance.\" 'Tis a precept which all\nconcur upon,\n\n[5636] \"Opprime dum nova sunt subiti mala semina morbi,\n        Dum licet, in primo lumine siste pedem.\"\n\n       \"Thy quick disease, whilst it is fresh today,\n        By all means crush, thy feet at first step stay.\"\n\nWhich cannot speedier be done, than if he confess his grief and passion to\nsome judicious friend [5637](_qui tacitus ardet magis uritur_, the more he\nconceals, the greater is his pain) that by his good advice may happily ease\nhim on a sudden; and withal to avoid occasions, or any circumstance that\nmay aggravate his disease, to remove the object by all means; for who can\nstand by a fire and not burn?\n\n[5638] \"Sussilite obsecro et mittite istanc foras,\n        quae misero mihi amanti ebibit sanguinem.\"\n\n'Tis good therefore to keep quite out of her company, which Hierom so much\nlabours to Paula, to Nepotian; Chrysost. so much inculcates in _ser. in\ncontubern._ Cyprian, and many other fathers of the church, Siracides in his\nninth chapter, Jason Pratensis, Savanarola, Arnoldus, Valleriola, &c., and\nevery physician that treats of this subject. Not only to avoid, as [5639]\nGregory Tholosanus exhorts, \"kissing, dalliance, all speeches, tokens,\nlove-letters, and the like,\" or as Castilio, _lib. 4._ to converse with\nthem, hear them speak, or sing, (_tolerabilius est audire basiliscum\nsibilantem_, thou hadst better hear, saith [5640]Cyprian, a serpent hiss)\n[5641]\"those amiable smiles, admirable graces, and sweet gestures,\" which\ntheir presence affords.\n\n[5642] \"Neu capita liment solitis morsiunculis,\n        Et his papillarum oppressiunculis\n        Abstineant:\"------\n\nbut all talk, name, mention, or cogitation of them, and of any other women,\npersons, circumstance, amorous book or tale that may administer any\noccasion of remembrance. [5643]Prosper adviseth young men not to read the\nCanticles, and some parts of Genesis at other times; but for such as are\nenamoured they forbid, as before, the name mentioned, &c., especially all\nsight, they must not so much as come near, or look upon them.\n\n[5644] \"Et fugitare decet simulacra et pabula amoris,\n        Abstinere sibi atque alio convertere mentem.\"\n\n\"Gaze not on a maid,\" saith Siracides, \"turn away thine eyes from a\nbeautiful woman,\" c. 9. v. 5. 7, 8. _averte oculos_, saith David, or if\nthou dost see them, as Ficinus adviseth, let not thine eye be _intentus ad\nlibidinem_, do not intend her more than the rest: for as [5645]Propertius\nholds, _Ipse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor_, love as a snow ball\nenlargeth itself by sight: but as Hierome to Nepotian, _aut aequaliter ama,\naut aequaliter ignora_, either see all alike, or let all alone; make a\nleague with thine eyes, as [5646]Job did, and that is the safest course,\nlet all alone, see none of them. Nothing sooner revives, [5647]\"or waxeth\nsore again,\" as Petrarch holds, \"than love doth by sight.\" \"As pomp renews\nambition; the sight of gold, covetousness; a beauteous object sets on fire\nthis burning lust.\" _Et multum saliens incitat unda sitim._ The sight of\ndrink makes one dry, and the sight of meat increaseth appetite. 'Tis\ndangerous therefore to see. A [5648]young gentleman in merriment would\nneeds put on his mistress's clothes, and walk abroad alone, which some of\nher suitors espying, stole him away for her that he represented. So much\ncan sight enforce. Especially if he have been formerly enamoured, the sight\nof his mistress strikes him into a new fit, and makes him rave many days\nafter.\n\n[5649]  ------\"Infirmis causa pusilla nocet,\n        Ut pene extinctum cinerem si sulphure tangas,\n          Vivet, et ex minimo maximus ignis erit:\n        Sic nisi vitabis quicquid renovabit amorem,\n          Flamma recrudescet, quae modo nulla fuit.\"\n\n       \"A sickly man a little thing offends,\n          As brimstone doth a fire decayed renew,\n        And makes it burn afresh, doth love's dead flames,\n          If that the former object it review.\"\n\nOr, as the poet compares it to embers in ashes, which the wind blows,\n[5650]_ut solet a ventis_, &c., a scald head (as the saying is) is soon\nbroken, dry wood quickly kindles, and when they have been formerly wounded\nwith sight, how can they by seeing but be inflamed? Ismenias acknowledged\nas much of himself, when he had been long absent, and almost forgotten his\nmistress, [5651]\"at the first sight of her, as straw in a fire, I burned\nafresh, and more than ever I did before.\" [5652]\"Chariclia was as much\nmoved at the sight of her dear Theagines, after he had been a great\nstranger.\" [5653]Mertila, in Aristaenetus, swore she would never love\nPamphilus again, and did moderate her passion, so long as he was absent;\nbut the next time he came in presence, she could not contain, _effuse\namplexa attrectari se sinit_, &c., she broke her vow, and did profusely\nembrace him. Hermotinus, a young man (in the said [5654]author) is all out\nas unstaid, he had forgot his mistress quite, and by his friends was well\nweaned from her love; but seeing her by chance, _agnovit veteris vestigia\nflammae_, he raved amain, _Illa tamen emergens veluti lucida stella cepit\nelucere_, &c., she did appear as a blazing star, or an angel to his sight.\nAnd it is the common passion of all lovers to be overcome in this sort. For\nthat cause belike Alexander discerning this inconvenience and danger that\ncomes by seeing, [5655]\"when he heard Darius's wife so much commended for\nher beauty, would scarce admit her to come in his sight,\" foreknowing\nbelike that of Plutarch, _formosam videre periculosissimum_, how full of\ndanger it is to see a proper woman, and though he was intemperate in other\nthings, yet in this _superbe se gessit_, he carried himself bravely. And so\nwhen as Araspus, in Xenophon, had so much magnified that divine face of\nPanthea to Cyrus, [5656]\"by how much she was fairer than ordinary, by so\nmuch he was the more unwilling to see her.\" Scipio, a young man of\ntwenty-three years of age, and the most beautiful of the Romans, equal in\nperson to that Grecian Charinus, or Homer's Nireus, at the siege of a city\nin Spain, when as a noble and most fair young gentlewoman was brought unto\nhim, [5657]\"and he had heard she was betrothed to a lord, rewarded her, and\nsent her back to her sweetheart.\" St. Austin, as [5658]Gregory reports of\nhim, _ne cum sorore quidem sua putavit habitandum_, would not live in the\nhouse with his own sister. Xenocrates lay with Lais of Corinth all night,\nand would not touch her. Socrates, though all the city of Athens supposed\nhim to dote upon fair Alcibiades, yet when he had an opportunity,\n[5659]_solus cum solo_ to lie in the chamber with, and was wooed by him\nbesides, as the said Alcibiades publicly [5660]confessed, _formam sprevit\net superbe contempsit_, he scornfully rejected him. Petrarch, that had so\nmagnified his Laura in several poems, when by the pope's means she was\noffered unto him, would not accept of her. [5661]\"It is a good happiness to\nbe free from this passion of love, and great discretion it argues in such a\nman that he can so contain himself; but when thou art once in love, to\nmoderate thyself (as he saith) is a singular point of wisdom.\"\n\n[5662] \"Nam vitare plagas in amoris ne jaciamur\n        Non ita difficile est, quam captum retibus ipsis\n        Exire, et validos Veneris perrumpere nodos.\"\n\n       \"To avoid such nets is no such mastery,\n        But ta'en escape is all the victory.\"\n\nBut, forasmuch as few men are free, so discreet lovers, or that can contain\nthemselves, and moderate their passions, to curb their senses, as not to\nsee them, not to look lasciviously, not to confer with them, such is the\nfury of this headstrong passion of raging lust, and their weakness, _ferox\nille ardor a natura insitus_, [5663]as he terms it \"such a furious desire\nnature hath inscribed, such unspeakable delight.\"\n\n       \"Sic Divae Veneris furor,\n        Insanis adeo mentibus incubat,\"\n\nwhich neither reason, counsel, poverty, pain, misery, drudgery, _partus\ndolor_, &c., can deter them from; we must use some speedy means to correct\nand prevent that, and all other inconveniences, which come by conference\nand the like. The best, readiest, surest way, and which all approve, is\n_Loci mutatio_, to send them several ways, that they may neither hear of,\nsee, nor have an opportunity to send to one another again, or live\ntogether, _soli cum sola_, as so many Gilbertines. _Elongatio a patria_,\n'tis Savanarola's fourth rule, and Gordonius' precept, _distrahatur ad\nlonginquas regiones_, send him to travel. 'Tis that which most run upon, as\nso many hounds, with full cry, poets, divines, philosophers, physicians,\nall, _mutet patriam_: Valesius: [5664]as a sick man he must be cured with\nchange of air, Tully _4 Tuscul_. The best remedy is to get thee gone, Jason\nPratensis: change air and soil, Laurentius. [5665]_Fuge littus amatum_.\n\n       \"Virg. Utile finitimis abstinuisse locis.\n[5666]  Ovid. I procul, et longas carpere perge vias.\n        ------sed fuge tutus eris.\"\n\nTravelling is an antidote of love,\n\n[5667] \"Magnum iter ad doctas proficisci cogor Athenas,\n        Ut me longa gravi solvat amore via.\"\n\nFor this purpose, saith [5668]Propertius, my parents sent me to Athens;\ntime and patience wear away pain and grief, as fire goes out for want of\nfuel. _Quantum oculis, animo tam procul ibit amor_. But so as they tarry\nout long enough: a whole year [5669]Xenophon prescribes _Critobulus, vix\nenim intra hoc tempus ab amore sanari poteris_: some will hardly be weaned\nunder. All this [5670]Heinsius merrily inculcates in an epistle to his\nfriend Primierus; first fast, then tarry, thirdly, change thy place,\nfourthly, think of a halter. If change of place, continuance of time,\nabsence, will not wear it out with those precedent remedies, it will hardly\nbe removed: but these commonly are of force. Felix Plater, _observ. lib.\n1._ had a baker to his patient, almost mad for the love of his maid, and\ndesperate; by removing her from him, he was in a short space cured. Isaeus,\na philosopher of Assyria, was a most dissolute liver in his youth, _palam\nlasciviens_, in love with all he met; but after he betook himself, by his\nfriends' advice, to his study, and left women's company, he was so changed\nthat he cared no more for plays, nor feasts, nor masks, nor songs, nor\nverses, fine clothes, nor no such love toys: he became a new man upon a\nsudden, _tanquam si priores oculos amisisset_, (saith mine [5671]author) as\nif he had lost his former eyes. Peter Godefridus, in the last chapter of\nhis third book, hath a story out of St. Ambrose, of a young man that\nmeeting his old love after long absence, on whom he had extremely doted,\nwould scarce take notice of her; she wondered at it, that he should so\nlightly esteem her, called him again, _lenibat dictis animum_, and told him\nwho she was, _Ego sum, inquit: At ego non sum ego_; but he replied, \"he was\nnot the same man:\" _proripuit sese tandem_, as [5672]Aeneas fled from Dido,\nnot vouchsafing her any farther parley, loathing his folly, and ashamed of\nthat which formerly he had done. [5673]_Non sum stultus ut ante jam\nNeaera_. \"O Neaera, put your tricks, and practise hereafter upon somebody\nelse, you shall befool me no longer.\" Petrarch hath such another tale of a\nyoung gallant, that loved a wench with one eye, and for that cause by his\nparents was sent to travel into far countries, \"after some years he\nreturned, and meeting the maid for whose sake he was sent abroad, asked her\nhow, and by what chance she lost her eye? no, said she, I have lost none,\nbut you have found yours:\" signifying thereby, that all lovers were blind,\nas Fabius saith, _Amantes de forma judicare non possunt_, lovers cannot\njudge of beauty, nor scarce of anything else, as they will easily confess\nafter they return unto themselves, by some discontinuance or better advice,\nwonder at their own folly, madness, stupidity, blindness, be much abashed,\n\"and laugh at love, and call it an idle thing, condemn themselves that ever\nthey should be so besotted or misled: and be heartily glad they have so\nhappily escaped.\"\n\nIf so be (which is seldom) that change of place will not effect this\nalteration, then other remedies are to be annexed, fair and foul means, as\nto persuade, promise, threaten, terrify, or to divert by some contrary\npassion, rumour, tales, news, or some witty invention to alter his\naffection, [5674]\"by some greater sorrow to drive out the less,\" saith\nGordonius, as that his house is on fire, his best friends dead, his money\nstolen. [5675]\"That he is made some great governor, or hath some honour,\noffice, some inheritance is befallen him.\" He shall be a knight, a baron;\nor by some false accusation, as they do to such as have the hiccup, to make\nthem forget it. St. Hierome, _lib. 2. epist. 16._ to Rusticus the monk,\nhath an instance of a young man of Greece, that lived in a monastery in\nEgypt, [5676]\"that by no labour, no continence, no persuasion, could be\ndiverted, but at last by this trick he was delivered. The abbot sets one of\nhis convent to quarrel with him, and with some scandalous reproach or other\nto defame him before company, and then to come and complain first, the\nwitnesses were likewise suborned for the plaintiff. The young man wept, and\nwhen all were against him, the abbot cunningly took his part, lest he\nshould be overcome with immoderate grief: but what need many words? by this\ninvention he was cured, and alienated from his pristine\nlove-thoughts\"--Injuries, slanders, contempts, disgraces--_spretaeque\ninjuria formae_, \"the insult of her slighted beauty,\" are very forcible\nmeans to withdraw men's affections, _contumelia affecti amatores amare\ndesinunt_, as [5677]Lucian saith, lovers reviled or neglected, contemned or\nmisused, turn love to hate; [5678]_redeam? Non si me obsecret_, \"I'll never\nlove thee more.\" _Egone illam, quae illum, quae me, quae non_? So Zephyrus\nhated Hyacinthus because he scorned him, and preferred his co-rival Apollo\n(Palephaetus _fab. Nar._), he will not come again though he be invited.\nTell him but how he was scoffed at behind his back, ('tis the counsel of\nAvicenna), that his love is false, and entertains another, rejects him,\ncares not for him, or that she is a fool; a nasty quean, a slut, a vixen, a\nscold, a devil, or, which Italians commonly do, that he or she hath some\nloathsome filthy disease, gout, stone, strangury, falling sickness, and\nthat they are hereditary, not to be avoided, he is subject to a\nconsumption, hath the pox, that he hath three or four incurable tetters,\nissues; that she is bald, her breath stinks, she is mad by inheritance, and\nso are all the kindred, a hair-brain, with many other secret infirmities,\nwhich I will not so much as name, belonging to women. That he is a\nhermaphrodite, an eunuch, imperfect, impotent, a spendthrift, a gamester, a\nfool, a gull, a beggar, a whoremaster, far in debt, and not able to\nmaintain her, a common drunkard, his mother was a witch, his father hanged,\nthat he hath a wolf in his bosom, a sore leg, he is a leper, hath some\nincurable disease, that he will surely beat her, he cannot hold his water,\nthat he cries out or walks in the night, will stab his bedfellow, tell all\nhis secrets in his sleep, and that nobody dare lie with him, his house is\nhaunted with spirits, with such fearful and tragical things, able to avert\nand terrify any man or woman living, Gordonius, _cap. 20. part. 2._ hunc in\nmodo consulit; _Paretur aliqua vetula turpissima aspectu, cum turpi et vili\nhabitu: et portet subtus gremium pannum menstrualem, et dicat quod amica\nsua sit ebriosa, et quod mingat in lecto, et quod est epileptica et\nimpudicia; et quod in corpore suo sunt excrescentiae enormes, cum faetore\nanhelitus, et aliae enormitates, quibus vetulae sunt edoctae: si nolit his\npersuaderi, subito extrahat [5679]pannum menstrualem, coram facie portando,\nexclamando, talis est amica tua; et si ex his non demiserit, non est homo,\nsed diabolus incarnatus_. Idem fere, Avicenna, _cap. 24, de cura Elishi,\nlib. 3, Fen. 1. Tract. 4._ _Narrent res immundas vetulae, ex quibus\nabominationem incurrat, et res [5680]sordidas et, hoc assiduent_. Idem\nArculanus _cap. 16. in 9. Rhasis_, &c.\n\nWithal as they do discommend the old, for the better effecting a more\nspeedy alteration, they must commend another paramour, _alteram inducere_,\nset him or her to be wooed, or woo some other that shall be fairer, of\nbetter note, better fortune, birth, parentage, much to be preferred, [5681]\n_Invenies alium si te hic fastidit Alexis_, by this means, which Jason\nPratensis wisheth, to turn the stream of affection another way, _Successore\nnovo truditur omnis amor_; or, as Valesius adviseth, by [5682]subdividing\nto diminish it, as a great river cut into many channels runs low at last.\n[5683]_Hortor et ut pariter binas habeatis amicas_, &c. If you suspect to\nbe taken, be sure, saith the poet, to have two mistresses at once, or go\nfrom one to another: as he that goes from a good fire in cold weather is\nboth to depart from it, though in the next room there be a better which\nwill refresh him as much; there's as much difference of _haec_ as _hac\nignis_; or bring him to some public shows, plays, meetings, where he may\nsee variety, and he shall likely loathe his first choice: carry him but to\nthe next town, yea peradventure to the next house, and as Paris lost\nOenone's love by seeing Helen, and Cressida forsook Troilus by conversing\nwith Diomede, he will dislike his former mistress, and leave her quite\nbehind him, as [5684]Theseus left Ariadne fast asleep in the island of Dia,\nto seek her fortune, that was erst his loving mistress. [5685]_Nunc primum\nDorida vetus amator contempsi_, as he said, Doris is but a dowdy to this.\nAs he that looks himself in a glass forgets his physiognomy forthwith, this\nflattering glass of love will be diminished by remove; after a little\nabsence it will be remitted, the next fair object will likely alter it. A\nyoung man in [5686]Lucian was pitifully in love, he came to the theatre by\nchance, and by seeing other fair objects there, _mentis sanitatem recepit_,\nwas fully recovered, [5687] \"and went merrily home, as if he had taken a\ndram of oblivion.\" [5688]A mouse (saith an apologer) was brought up in a\nchest, there fed with fragments of bread and cheese, though there could be\nno better meat, till coming forth at last, and feeding liberally of other\nvariety of viands, loathed his former life: moralise this fable by thyself.\nPlato, in. his seventh book _De Legibus_, hath a pretty fiction of a city\nunder ground, [5689]to which by little holes some small store of light\ncame; the inhabitants thought there could not be a better place, and at\ntheir first coming abroad they might not endure the light, _aegerrime solem\nintueri_; but after they were accustomed a little to it, [5690]\"they\ndeplored their fellows' misery that lived under ground.\" A silly lover is\nin like state, none so fair as his mistress at first, he cares for none but\nher; yet after a while, when he hath compared her with others, he abhors\nher name, sight, and memory. 'Tis generally true; for as he observes,\n[5691]_Priorem flammam novus ignis extrudit; et ea multorum natura, ut\npraesentes maxime ament_, one fire drives out another; and such is women's\nweakness, that they love commonly him that is present. And so do many men;\nas he confessed, he loved Amye, till he saw Florial, and when he saw\nCynthia, forgat them both: but fair Phillis was incomparably beyond, them\nall, Cloris surpassed her, and yet when he espied Amaryllis, she was his\nsole mistress; O divine Amaryllis: _quam procera, cupressi ad instar, quam\nelegans, quam decens_, &c. How lovely, how tall, how comely she was (saith\nPolemius) till he saw another, and then she was the sole subject of his\nthoughts. In conclusion, her he loves best he saw last. [5692]Triton, the\nsea-god, first loved Leucothoe, till he came in presence of Milaene, she\nwas the commandress of his heart, till he saw Galatea: but (as [5693]she\ncomplains) he loved another eftsoons, another, and another. 'Tis a thing\nwhich, by Hierom's report, hath been usually practised. [5694]\"Heathen\nphilosophers drive out one love with another, as they do a peg, or pin with\na pin. Which those seven Persian princes did to Ahasuerus, that they might\nrequite the desire of Queen Vashti with the love of others.\" Pausanias in\nEliacis saith, that therefore one Cupid was painted to contend with\nanother, and to take the garland from him, because one love drives out\nanother, [5695]_Alterius vires subtrahit alter amor_; and Tully, _3. Nat.\nDeor._ disputing with C. Cotta, makes mention of three several Cupids, all\ndiffering in office. Felix Plater, in the first book of his observations,\nboasts how he cured a widower in Basil, a patient of his, by this stratagem\nalone, that doted upon a poor servant his maid, when friends, children, no\npersuasion could serve to alienate his mind: they motioned him to another\nhonest man's daughter in the town, whom he loved, and lived with long\nafter, abhorring the very name and sight of the first. After the death of\nLucretia, [5696]Euryalus would admit of no comfort, till the Emperor\nSigismund married him to a noble lady of his court, and so in short space\nhe was freed.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_By counsel and persuasion, foulness of the fact, men's,\nwomen's faults, miseries of marriage, events of lust, &c._\n\nAs there be divers causes of this burning lust, or heroical love, so there\nbe many good remedies to ease and help; amongst which, good counsel and\npersuasion, which I should have handled in the first place, are of great\nmoment, and not to be omitted. Many are of opinion, that in this blind\nheadstrong passion counsel can do no good.\n\n[5697] \"Quae enim res in se neque consilium neque modum\n        Habet, ullo eam consilio regere non potes.\"\n\n       \"Which thing hath neither judgment, or an end,\n        How should advice or counsel it amend?\"\n\n[5698]_Quis enim modus adsit amori_? But, without question, good counsel\nand advice must needs be of great force, especially if it shall proceed\nfrom a wise, fatherly, reverent, discreet person, a man of authority, whom\nthe parties do respect, stand in awe of, or from a judicious friend, of\nitself alone it is able to divert and suffice. Gordonius, the physician,\nattributes so much to it, that he would have it by all means used in the\nfirst place. _Amoveatur ab illa, consilio viri quem timet, ostendendo\npericula saeculi, judicium inferni, gaudia Paradisi_. He would have some\ndiscreet men to dissuade them, after the fury of passion is a little spent,\nor by absence allayed; for it is as intempestive at first, to give counsel,\nas to comfort parents when their children are in that instant departed; to\nno purpose to prescribe narcotics, cordials, nectarines, potions, Homer's\nnepenthes, or Helen's bowl, &c. _Non cessabit pectus tundere_, she will\nlament and howl for a season: let passion have his course awhile, and then\nhe may proceed, by foreshowing the miserable events and dangers which will\nsurely happen, the pains of hell, joys of Paradise, and the like, which by\ntheir preposterous courses they shall forfeit or incur; and 'tis a fit\nmethod, a very good means; for what [5699]Seneca said of vice, I say of\nlove, _Sine magistro discitur, vix sine magistro deseritur_, 'tis learned\nof itself, but [5700]hardly left without a tutor. 'Tis not amiss therefore\nto have some such overseer, to expostulate and show them such absurdities,\ninconveniences, imperfections, discontents, as usually follow; which their\nblindness, fury, madness, cannot apply unto themselves, or will not\napprehend through weakness; and good for them to disclose themselves, to\ngive ear to friendly admonitions. \"Tell me, sweetheart (saith Tryphena to a\nlovesick Charmides in [5701]Lucian), what is it that troubles thee?\nperadventure I can ease thy mind, and further thee in thy suit;\" and so,\nwithout question, she might, and so mayst thou, if the patient be capable\nof good counsel, and will hear at least what may be said.\n\nIf he love at all, she is either an honest woman or a whore. If dishonest,\nlet him read or inculcate to him that 5. of Solomon's Proverbs, Ecclus. 26.\nAmbros. _lib. 1. cap. 4._ in his book of Abel and Cain, Philo Judeus _de\nmercede mer_. Platina's _dial. in Amores_, Espencaeus, and those three\nbooks of Pet. Haedus _de contem. amoribus_, Aeneas Sylvius' tart Epistle,\nwhich he wrote to his friend Nicholas of Warthurge, which he calls _medelam\nilliciti amoris_ &c. [5702]\"For what's a whore,\" as he saith, \"but a poller\nof youth, a [5703]ruin of men, a destruction, a devourer of patrimonies, a\ndownfall of honour, fodder for the devil, the gate of death, and supplement\nof hell?\" [5704]_Talis amor est laqueus animae_, &c., a bitter honey, sweet\npoison, delicate destruction, a voluntary mischief, _commixtum coenum,\nsterquilinium_. And as [5705]Pet. Aretine's Lucretia, a notable quean,\nconfesseth: \"Gluttony, anger, envy, pride, sacrilege, theft, slaughter,\nwere all born that day that a whore began her profession; for,\" as she\nfollows it, \"her pride is greater than a rich churl's, she is more envious\nthan the pox, as malicious as melancholy, as covetous as hell. If from the\nbeginning of the world any were _mala, pejor, pessima_, bad in the\nsuperlative degree, 'tis a whore; how many have I undone, caused to be\nwounded, slain! O Antonia, thou seest [5706]what I am without, but within,\nGod knows, a puddle of iniquity, a sink of sin, a pocky quean.\" Let him now\nthat so dotes meditate on this; let him see the event and success of\nothers, Samson, Hercules, Holofernes, &c. Those infinite mischiefs attend\nit: if she be another man's wife he loves, 'tis abominable in the sight of\nGod and men; adultery is expressly forbidden in God's commandment, a mortal\nsin, able to endanger his soul: if he be such a one that fears God, or have\nany religion, he will eschew it, and abhor the loathsomeness of his own\nfact. If he love an honest maid, 'tis to abuse or marry her; if to abuse,\n'tis fornication, a foul fact (though some make light of it), and almost\nequal to adultery itself. If to marry, let him seriously consider what he\ntakes in hand, look before ye leap, as the proverb is, or settle his\naffections, and examine first the party, and condition of his estate and\nhers, whether it be a fit match, for fortunes, years, parentage, and such\nother circumstances, _an sit sitae Veneris_. Whether it be likely to\nproceed: if not, let him wisely stave himself off at the first, curb in his\ninordinate passion, and moderate his desire, by thinking of some other\nsubject, divert his cogitations. Or if it be not for his good, as Aeneas,\nforewarned by Mercury in a dream, left Dido's love, and in all haste got\nhim to sea,\n\n[5707] \"Mnestea, Surgestumque vocat fortemque Cloanthem,\n        Classem aptent taciti jubet\"------\n\nand although she did oppose with vows, tears, prayers, and imprecation.\n\n[5708]  ------\"nullis ille movetur\n        Fletibus, aut illas voces tractabilis audit;\"\n\nLet thy Mercury-reason rule thee against all allurements, seeming delights,\npleasing inward or outward provocations. Thou mayst do this if thou wilt,\n_pater non deperit filiam, nec frater sororem_, a father dotes not on his\nown daughter, a brother on a sister; and why? because it is unnatural,\nunlawful, unfit. If he be sickly, soft, deformed, let him think of his\ndeformities, vices, infirmities; if in debt, let him ruminate how to pay\nhis debts: if he be in any danger, let him seek to avoid it: if he have any\nlawsuit, or other business, he may do well to let his love-matters alone\nand follow it, labour in his vocation whatever it is. But if he cannot so\nease himself, yet let him wisely premeditate of both their estates; if they\nbe unequal in years, she young and he old, what an unfit match must it\nneeds be, an uneven yoke, how absurd and indecent a thing is it! as Lycinus\nin [5709]Lucian told Timolaus, for an old bald crook-nosed knave to marry a\nyoung wench; how odious a thing it is to see an old lecher! What should a\nbald fellow do with a comb, a dumb doter with a pipe, a blind man with a\nlooking-glass, and thou with such a wife? How absurd it is for a young man\nto marry an old wife for a piece of good. But put case she be equal in\nyears, birth, fortunes, and other qualities correspondent, he doth desire\nto be coupled in marriage, which is an honourable estate, but for what\nrespects? Her beauty belike, and comeliness of person, that is commonly the\nmain object, she is a most absolute form, in his eye at least, _Cui formam\nPaphia, et Charites tribuere decoram_; but do other men affirm as much? or\nis it an error in his judgment.\n\n[5710] \"Fallunt nos oculi vagique sensus,\n        Oppressa ratione mentiuntur,\"\n\n\"our eyes and other senses will commonly deceive us;\" it may be, to thee\nthyself upon a more serious examination, or after a little absence, she is\nnot so fair as she seems. _Quaedam videntur et non sunt_; compare her to\nanother standing by, 'tis a touchstone to try, confer hand to hand, body to\nbody, face to face, eye to eye, nose to nose, neck to neck, &c., examine\nevery part by itself, then altogether, in all postures, several sites, and\ntell me how thou likest her. It may be not she, that is so fair, but her\ncoats, or put another in her clothes, and she will seem all out as fair; as\nthe [5711]poet then prescribes, separate her from her clothes: suppose thou\nsaw her in a base beggar's weed, or else dressed in some old hirsute\nattires out of fashion, foul linen, coarse raiment, besmeared with soot,\ncolly, perfumed with opoponax, sagapenum, asafoetida, or some such filthy\ngums, dirty, about some indecent action or other; or in such a case as\n[5712]Brassivola, the physician, found Malatasta, his patient, after a\npotion of hellebore, which he had prescribed: _Manibus in terram depositis,\net ano versus caelum elevato (ac si videretur Socraticus ille Aristophanes,\nqui Geometricas figuras in terram scribens, tubera colligere videbatur)\natram bilem in album parietem injiciebat, adeoque totam cameram, et se\ndeturpabat, ut_, &c., all to bewrayed, or worse; if thou saw'st her (I say)\nwould thou affect her as thou dost? Suppose thou beheldest her in a [5713]\nfrosty morning, in cold weather, in some passion or perturbation of mind,\nweeping, chafing, &c., rivelled and ill-favoured to behold. She many times\nthat in a composed look seems so amiable and delicious, _tam scitula,\nforma_, if she do but laugh or smile, makes an ugly sparrow-mouthed face,\nand shows a pair of uneven, loathsome, rotten, foul teeth: she hath a black\nskin, gouty legs, a deformed crooked carcass under a fine coat. It may be\nfor all her costly tires she is bald, and though she seem so fair by dark,\nby candlelight, or afar off at such a distance, as Callicratides observed\nin [5714]Lucian, \"If thou should see her near, or in a morning, she would\nappear more ugly than a beast;\" [5715]_si diligenter consideres, quid per\nos et nares et caeteros corporis meatus egreditur, vilius sterquilinium\nnunquam vidisti_. Follow my counsel, see her undressed, see her, if it be\npossible, out of her attires, _furtivis nudatam coloribus_, it may be she\nis like Aesop's jay, or [5716]Pliny's cantharides, she will be loathsome,\nridiculous, thou wilt not endure her sight: or suppose thou saw'st her,\npale, in a consumption, on her death-bed, skin and bones, or now dead,\n_Cujus erat gratissimus amplexus_ (whose embrace was so agreeable) as\nBarnard saith, _erit horribilis aspectus; Non redolet, sed olet, quae,\nredolere solet_, \"As a posy she smells sweet, is most fresh and fair one\nday, but dried up, withered, and stinks another.\" Beautiful Nireus, by that\nHomer so much admired, once dead, is more deformed than Thersites, and\nSolomon deceased as ugly as Marcolphus: thy lovely mistress that was erst\n[5717]_Charis charior ocellis_, \"dearer to thee than thine eyes,\" once sick\nor departed, is _Vili vilior aestimata coeno_, \"worse than any dirt or\ndunghill.\" Her embraces were not so acceptable, as now her looks be\nterrible: thou hadst better behold a Gorgon's head, than Helen's carcass.\n\nSome are of opinion, that to see a woman naked is able of itself to alter\nhis affection; and it is worthy of consideration, saith [5718]Montaigne the\nFrenchman in his Essays, that the skilfulest masters of amorous dalliance,\nappoint for a remedy of venerous passions, a full survey of the body; which\nthe poet insinuates,\n\n[5719] \"Ille quod obscaenas in aperto corpore partes\n        Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, haesit amor.\"\n\n       \"The love stood still, that run in full career,\n        When once it saw those parts should not appear.\"\n\nIt is reported of Seleucus, king of Syria, that seeing his wife\nStratonice's bald pate, as she was undressing her by chance, he could never\naffect her after. Remundus Lullius, the physician, spying an ulcer or\ncancer in his mistress' breast, whom he so dearly loved, from that day\nfollowing abhorred the looks of her. Philip the French king, as\nNeubrigensis, _lib. 4. cap. 24._ relates it, married the king of Denmark's\ndaughter, [5720]\"and after he had used her as a wife one night, because her\nbreath stunk, they say, or for some other secret fault, sent her back again\nto her father.\" Peter Mattheus, in the life of Lewis the Eleventh, finds\nfault with our English [5721]chronicles, for writing how Margaret the king\nof Scots' daughter, and wife to Louis the Eleventh, French king, was _ob\ngraveolentiam oris_, rejected by her husband. Many such matches are made\nfor by-respects, or some seemly comeliness, which after honeymoon's past,\nturn to bitterness: for burning lust is but a flash, a gunpowder passion;\nand hatred oft follows in the highest degree, dislike and contempt.\n\n[5722]  ------\"Cum se cutis arida laxat,\n        Fiunt obscuri dentes\"------\n\nwhen they wax old, and ill-favoured, they may commonly no longer abide\nthem,--_Jam gravis es nobis_, Be gone, they grow stale, fulsome, loathsome,\nodious, thou art a beastly filthy quean,--[5723]_faciem Phoebe cacantis\nhabes_, thou art _Saturni podex_, withered and dry, _insipida et\nvetula_,--[5724]_Te quia rugae turpant, et capitis nives_, (I say) be gone,\n[5725]_portae patent, proficiscere_.\n\nYea, but you will infer, your mistress is complete, of a most absolute form\nin all men's opinions, no exceptions can be taken at her, nothing may be\nadded to her person, nothing detracted, she is the mirror of women for her\nbeauty, comeliness and pleasant grace, inimitable, _merae deliciae, meri\nlepores_, she is _Myrothetium Veneris, Gratiarum pixis_, a mere magazine of\nnatural perfections, she hath all the Veneres and Graces,--_mille faces et\nmille figuras_, in each part absolute and complete, [5726]_Laeta genas\nlaeta os roseum, vaga lumina laeta_: to be admired for her person, a most\nincomparable, unmatchable piece, _aurea proles, ad simulachrum alicujus\nnuminis composita, a Phoenix, vernantis aetatulae Venerilla_, a nymph, a\nfairy, [5727]like Venus herself when she was a maid, _nulli secunda_, a\nmere quintessence, _flores spirans et amaracum, foeminae prodigium_: put\ncase she be, how long will she continue? [5728]_Florem decoris singuli\ncarpunt dies_: \"Every day detracts from her person,\" and this beauty is\n_bonum fragile_, a mere flash, a Venice glass, quickly broken,\n\n[5729] \"Anceps forma bonum mortalibus,\n        ------exigui donum breve temporis,\"\n\nit will not last. As that fair flower [5730]Adonis, which we call an\nanemone, flourisheth but one month, this gracious all-commanding beauty\nfades in an instant. It is a jewel soon lost, the painter's goddess, _fulsa\nveritas_, a mere picture. \"Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vanity,\"\nProv. xxxi. 30.\n\n[5731] \"Vitrea gemmula, fluxaque bullula, candida forma est,\n        Nix, rosa, fumus, ventus et aura, nihil.\"\n\n       \"A brittle gem, bubble, is beauty pale,\n        A rose, dew, snow, smoke, wind, air, nought at all.\"\n\nIf she be fair, as the saying is, she is commonly a fool: if proud,\nscornful, _sequiturque superbia formam_, or dishonest, _rara est concordia\nformae, atque pudicitiae_, \"can she be fair and honest too?\" [5732] Aristo,\nthe son of Agasicles, married a Spartan lass, the fairest lady in all\nGreece next to Helen, but for her conditions the most abominable and\nbeastly creature of the world. So that I would wish thee to respect, with\n[5733]Seneca, not her person but qualities. \"Will you say that's a good\nblade which hath a gilded scabbard, embroidered with gold and jewels? No,\nbut that which hath a good edge and point, well tempered metal, able to\nresist.\" This beauty is of the body alone, and what is that, but as [5734]\nGregory Nazianzen telleth us, \"a mock of time and sickness?\" or as\nBoethius, [5735]\"as mutable as a flower, and 'tis not nature so makes us,\nbut most part the infirmity of the beholder.\" For ask another, he sees no\nsuch matter: _Dic mihi per gratias quails tibi videtur_, \"I pray thee tell\nme how thou likest my sweetheart,\" as she asked her sister in Aristenaetus,\n[5736]\"whom I so much admire, methinks he is the sweetest gentleman, the\nproperest man that ever I saw: but I am in love, I confess (_nec pudet\nfateri_) and cannot therefore well judge.\" But be she fair indeed,\ngolden-haired, as Anacreon his Bathillus, (to examine particulars) she have\n[5737]_Flammeolos oculos, collaque lacteola_, a pure sanguine complexion,\nlittle mouth, coral lips, white teeth, soft and plump neck, body, hands,\nfeet, all fair and lovely to behold, composed of all graces, elegances, an\nabsolute piece,\n\n[5738] \"Lumina sint Melitae Junonia, dextra Minervae,\n        Mamillae Veneris, sura maris dominae,\" &c.\n\nLet [5739]her head be from Prague, paps out of Austria, belly from France,\nback from Brabant, hands out of England, feet from Rhine, buttocks from\nSwitzerland, let her have the Spanish gait, the Venetian tire, Italian\ncompliment and endowments:\n\n[5740] \"Candida sideriis ardescant lumina flammis,\n        Sudent colla rosas, et cedat crinibus aurum,\n        Mellea purpurem depromant ora ruborem;\n        Fulgeat, ac Venerem coelesti corpore vincat,\n        Forma dearum omnis,\" &c.\n\nLet her be such a one throughout, as Lucian deciphers in his Imagines, as\nEuphranor of old painted Venus, Aristaenetus describes Lais, another\nHelena, Chariclea, Leucippe, Lucretia, Pandora; let her have a box of\nbeauty to repair herself still, such a one as Venus gave Phaon, when he\ncarried her over the ford; let her use all helps art and nature can yield;\nbe like her, and her, and whom thou wilt, or all these in one; a little\nsickness, a fever, small-pox, wound, scar, loss of an eye, or limb, a\nviolent passion, a distemperature of heat or cold, mars all in an instant,\ndisfigures all; child-bearing, old age, that tyrant time will turn Venus to\nErinnys; raging time, care, rivels her upon a sudden; after she hath been\nmarried a small while, and the black ox hath trodden on her toe, she will\nbe so much altered, and wax out of favour, thou wilt not know her. One\ngrows to fat, another too lean, &c., modest Matilda, pretty pleasing Peg,\nsweet-singing Susan, mincing merry Moll, dainty dancing Doll, neat Nancy,\njolly Joan, nimble Nell, kissing Kate, bouncing Bess, with black eyes, fair\nPhyllis, with fine white hands, fiddling Frank, tall Tib, slender Sib, &c.,\nwill quickly lose their grace, grow fulsome, stale, sad, heavy, dull, sour,\nand all at last out of fashion. _Ubi jam vultus argutia, suavis suavitatio,\nblandus, risus_, &c. Those fair sparkling eyes will look dull, her soft\ncoral lips will be pale, dry, cold, rough, and blue, her skin rugged, that\nsoft and tender superficies will be hard and harsh, her whole complexion\nchange in a moment, and as [5741]Matilda writ to King John.\n\n       \"I am not now as when thou saw'st me last,\n        That favour soon is vanished and past;\n        That rosy blush lapt in a lily vale,\n        Now is with morphew overgrown and pale.\"\n\n'Tis so in the rest, their beauty fades as a tree in winter, which Dejanira\nhath elegantly expressed in the poet,\n\n[5742] \"Deforme solis aspicis truncis nemus?\n        Sic nostra longum forma percurrens iter,\n        Deperdit aliquid semper, et fulget minus,\n        Malisque minus est quiquid in nobis fuit,\n        Olim petitum cecidit, et partu labat,\n        Maturque multum rapuit ex illa mihi,\n        Aetas citato senior eripuit gradu.\"\n\n       \"And as a tree that in the green wood grows,\n        With fruit and leaves, and in the summer blows,\n        In winter like a stock deformed shows:\n        Our beauty takes his race and journey goes,\n        And doth decrease, and lose, and come to nought,\n        Admir'd of old, to this by child-birth brought:\n        And mother hath bereft me of my grace,\n        And crooked old age coining on apace.\"\n\nTo conclude with Chrysostom, [5743]\"When thou seest a fair and beautiful\nperson, a brave Bonaroba, _a bella donna, quae salivam moveat, lepidam\npuellam et quam tu facile ames_, a comely woman, having bright eyes, a\nmerry countenance, a shining lustre in her look, a pleasant grace, wringing\nthy soul, and increasing thy concupiscence; bethink with thyself that it is\nbut earth thou lovest, a mere excrement, which so vexeth thee, which thou\nso admirest, and thy raging soul will be at rest. Take her skin from her\nface, and thou shalt see all loathsomeness under it, that beauty is a\nsuperficial skin and bones, nerves, sinews: suppose her sick, now rivelled,\nhoary-headed, hollow-cheeked, old; within she is full of filthy phlegm,\nstinking, putrid, excremental stuff: snot and snivel in her nostrils,\nspittle in her mouth, water in her eyes, what filth in her brains,\" &c. Or\ntake her at best, and look narrowly upon her in the light, stand near her,\nnearer yet, thou shalt perceive almost as much, and love less, as [5744]\nCardan well writes, _minus amant qui acute vident_, though Scaliger deride\nhim for it: if he see her near, or look exactly at such a posture,\nwhosoever he is, according to the true rules of symmetry and proportion,\nthose I mean of Albertus Durer, Lomatius and Tasnier, examine him of her.\nIf he be _elegans formarum spectator_ he shall find many faults in\nphysiognomy, and ill colour: if form, one side of the face likely bigger\nthan the other, or crooked nose, bad eyes, prominent veins, concavities\nabout the eyes, wrinkles, pimples, red streaks, freckles, hairs, warts,\nneves, inequalities, roughness, scabredity, paleness, yellowness, and as\nmany colours as are in a turkeycock's neck, many indecorums in their other\nparts; _est quod desideres, est quod amputes_, one leers, another frowns, a\nthird gapes, squints, &c. And 'tis true that he saith, [5745]_Diligenter\nconsideranti raro facies absoluta, et quae vitio caret_, seldom shall you\nfind an absolute face without fault, as I have often observed; not in the\nface alone is this defect or disproportion to be found; but in all the\nother parts, of body and mind; she is fair, indeed, but foolish; pretty,\ncomely, and decent, of a majestical presence, but peradventure, imperious,\ndishonest, _acerba, iniqua_, self-willed: she is rich, but deformed; hath a\nsweet face, but bad carriage, no bringing up, a rude and wanton flirt; a\nneat body she hath, but it is a nasty quean otherwise, a very slut, of a\nbad kind. As flowers in a garden have colour some, but no smell, others\nhave a fragrant smell, but are unseemly to the eye; one is unsavoury to the\ntaste as rue, as bitter as wormwood, and yet a most medicinal cordial\nflower, most acceptable to the stomach; so are men and women; one is well\nqualified, but of ill proportion, poor and base: a good eye she hath, but a\nbad hand and foot, _foeda pedes et foeda manus_, a fine leg, bad teeth, a\nvast body, &c. Examine all parts of body and mind, I advise thee to inquire\nof all. See her angry, merry, laugh, weep, hot, cold, sick, sullen,\ndressed, undressed, in all attires, sites, gestures, passions, eat her\nmeals, &c., and in some of these you will surely dislike. Yea, not her only\nlet him observe, but her parents how they carry themselves: for what\ndeformities, defects, encumbrances of body or mind be in them at such an\nage, they will likely be subject to, be molested in like manner, they will\n_patrizare_ or _matrizare._ And withal let him take notice of her\ncompanions, _in convictu_ (as Quiverra prescribes), _et quibuscum\nconversetur_, whom she converseth with. _Noscitur ex comite, qui non\ncognoscitur ex se._ [5746]According to Thucydides, she is commonly the\nbest, _de quo minimus foras habetur sermo_, that is least talked of abroad.\nFor if she be a noted reveller, a gadder, a singer, a pranker or dancer,\nthan take heed of her. For what saith Theocritus?\n\n[5747] \"At vos festivae ne ne saltate puellae,\n        En malus hireus adest in vos saltare paratus.\"\n\nYoung men will do it when they come to it. Fauns and satyrs will certainly\nplay reaks, when they come in such wanton Baccho's or Elenora's presence.\nNow when they shall perceive any such obliquity, indecency, disproportion,\ndeformity, bad conditions, &c., let them still ruminate on that, and as\n[5748]Haedus adviseth out of Ovid, _earum mendas notent_, note their\nfaults, vices, errors, and think of their imperfections; 'tis the next way\nto divert and mitigate love's furious headstrong passions; as a peacock's\nfeet, and filthy comb, they say, make him forget his fine feathers, and\npride of his tail; she is lovely, fair, well-favoured, well qualified,\ncourteous and kind, \"but if she be not so to me, what care I how kind she\nbe?\" I say with [5749]Philostratus, _formosa aliis, mihi superba_, she is a\ntyrant to me, and so let her go. Besides these outward neves or open\nfaults, errors, there be many inward infirmities, secret, some private\n(which I will omit), and some more common to the sex, sullen fits, evil\nqualities, filthy diseases, in this case fit to be considered; consideratio\nfoeditatis mulierum, menstruae imprimis, quam immundae sunt, quam\nSavanarola proponit regula septima penitus observandam; et Platina _dial.\namoris_ fuse perstringit. Lodovicus Bonacsialus, _mulieb. lib. 2. cap. 2._\nPet. Haedus, Albertus, et infiniti fere medici. [5750]A lover, in\nCalcagninus's Apologies, wished with all his heart he were his mistress's\nring, to hear, embrace, see, and do I know not what: O thou fool, quoth the\nring, if thou wer'st in my room, thou shouldst hear, observe, and see\n_pudenda et poenitenda_, that which would make thee loathe and hate her,\nyea, peradventure, all women for her sake.\n\nI will say nothing of the vices of their minds, their pride, envy,\ninconstancy, weakness, malice, selfwill, lightness, insatiable lust,\njealousy, Ecclus. v. 14. \"No malice to a woman's, no bitterness like to\nhers,\" Eccles. vii. 21. and as the same author urgeth, Prov. xxxi. 10. \"Who\nshall find a virtuous woman?\" He makes a question of it. _Neque jus neque\nbonum, neque aequum sciunt, melius pejus, prosit, obsit, nihil vident, nisi\nquod libido suggerit_. \"They know neither good nor bad, be it better or\nworse\" (as the comical poet hath it), \"beneficial or hurtful, they will do\nwhat they list.\"\n\n[5751] \"Insidiae humani generis, querimonia vitae,\n        Exuviae noctis, durissima cura diei,\n        Poena virum, nex et juvenum,\" &c.------\n\nAnd to that purpose were they first made, as Jupiter insinuates in the\n[5752]poet;\n\n       \"The fire that bold Prometheus stole from me,\n        With plagues call'd women shall revenged be,\n        On whose alluring and enticing face,\n        Poor mortals doting shall their death embrace.\"\n\nIn fine, as Diogenes concludes in Nevisanus, _Nulla est faemina quae non\nhabeat quid_: they have all their faults.\n\n[5753] _Every each of them hath some vices,\n        If one be full of villainy,\n        Another hath a liquorish eye,\n        If one be full of wantonness,\n        Another is a chideress_.\n\nWhen Leander was drowned, the inhabitants of Sestos consecrated Hero's\nlantern to Anteros, _Anteroti sacrum_, [5754]and he that had good success\nin his love should light the candle: but never any man was found to light\nit; which I can refer to nought, but the inconstancy and lightness of\nwomen.\n\n[5755] \"For in a thousand, good there is not one;\n        All be so proud, unthankful, and unkind,\n        With flinty hearts, careless of other's moan.\n        In their own lusts carried most headlong blind,\n        But more herein to speak I am forbidden;\n        Sometimes for speaking truth one may be chidden.\"\n\nI am not willing, you see, to prosecute the cause against them, and\ntherefore take heed you mistake me not, [5756]_matronam nullam ego tango_,\nI honour the sex, with all good men, and as I ought to do, rather than\ndisplease them, I will voluntarily take the oath which Mercurius\nBritannicus took, _Viragin. descript. tib. 2. fol. 95._ _Me nihil unquam\nmali nobilissimo sexui, vel verbo, vel facto machinaturum_, &c., let\nSimonides, Mantuan, Platina, Pet. Aretine, and such women-haters bare the\nblame, if aught be said amiss; I have not writ a tenth of that which might\nbe urged out of them and others; [5757]_non possunt invectivae omnes, et\nsatirae in foeminas scriptae, uno volumine comprehendi_. And that which I\nhave said (to speak truth) no more concerns them than men, though women be\nmore frequently named in this tract; (to apologise once for all) I am\nneither partial against them, or therefore bitter; what is said of the one,\n_mutato nomine_, may most part be understood of the other. My words are\nlike Passus' picture in [5758]Lucian, of whom, when a good fellow had\nbespoke a horse to be painted with his heels upwards, tumbling on his back,\nhe made him passant: now when the fellow came for his piece, he was very\nangry, and said, it was quite opposite to his mind; but Passus instantly\nturned the picture upside down, showed him the horse at that site which he\nrequested, and so gave him satisfaction. If any man take exception at my\nwords, let him alter the name, read him for her, and 'tis all one in\neffect.\n\nBut to my purpose: If women in general be so bad (and men worse than they)\nwhat a hazard is it to marry? where shall a man find a good wife, or a\nwoman a good husband? A woman a man may eschew, but not a wife: wedding is\nundoing (some say) marrying marring, wooing woeing: [5759]\"a wife is a\nfever hectic,\" as Scaliger calls her, \"and not be cured but by death,\" as\nout of Menander, Athenaeus adds,\n\n       \"In pelaprus te jacis negotiorum,--\n        Non Libyum, non Aegeum, ubi ex triginta non pereunt\n        Tria navigia: duceus uxorem servatur prorsus nemo.\"\n\n       \"Thou wadest into a sea itself of woes;\n        In Libya and Aegean each man knows\n        Of thirty not three ships are cast away,\n        But on this rock not one escapes, I say.\"\n\nThe worldly cares, miseries, discontents, that accompany marriage, I pray\nyou learn of them that have experience, for I have none; [5760][Greek:\npaidas ego logous egensamaen], _libri mentis liberi_. For my part I'll\ndissemble with him,\n\n[5761] \"Este procul nymphae, fallax genus este puellae,\n        Vita jugata meo non facit ingenio: me juvat,\" &c.\n\nmany married men exclaim at the miseries of it, and rail at wives\ndownright; I never tried, but as I hear some of them say, [5762]_Mare haud\nmare, vos mare acerrimum_, an Irish Sea is not so turbulent and raging as a\nlitigious wife.\n\n[5763] \"Scylla et Charybdis Sicula contorquens freta,\n        Minus est timenda, nulla non melior fera est.\"\n\n       \"Scylla and Charybdis are less dangerous,\n        There is no beast that is so noxious.\"\n\nWhich made the devil belike, as most interpreters hold, when he had taken\naway Job's goods, _corporis et fortunae bona_, health, children, friends,\nto persecute him the more, leave his wicked wife, as Pineda proves out of\nTertullian, Cyprian, Austin, Chrysostom, Prosper, Gaudentius, &c. _ut novum\ncalamitatis inde genus viro existeret_, to vex and gall him worse _quam\ntotus infernus_ than all the fiends in hell, as knowing the conditions of a\nbad woman. Jupiter _non tribuit homini pestilentius malum_, saith\nSimonides: \"better dwell with a dragon or a lion, than keep house with a\nwicked wife,\" Ecclus. xxv. 18. \"better dwell in a wilderness,\" Prov. xxi.\n19. \"no wickedness like to her,\" Ecclus. xxv. 22. \"She makes a sorry heart,\nan heavy countenance, a wounded mind, weak hands, and feeble knees,\" vers.\n25. \"A woman and death are two the bitterest things in the world:\" _uxor\nmihi ducenda est hodie, id mihi visus est dicere, abi domum et suspende\nte_. _Ter. And. 1. 5._ And yet for all this we bachelors desire to be\nmarried; with that vestal virgin, we long for it, [5764]_Felices nuptae!\nmoriar, nisi nubere dulce est_. 'Tis the sweetest thing in the world, I\nwould I had a wife saith he,\n\n       \"For fain would I leave a single life,\n        If I could get me a good wife.\"\n\nHeigh-ho for a husband, cries she, a bad husband, nay, the worst that ever\nwas is better than none: O blissful marriage, O most welcome marriage, and\nhappy are they that are so coupled: we do earnestly seek it, and are never\nwell till we have effected it. But with what fate? like those birds in the\n[5765]Emblem, that fed about a cage, so long as they could fly away at\ntheir pleasure liked well of it; but when they were taken and might not get\nloose, though they had the same meat, pined away for sullenness, and would\nnot eat. So we commend marriage,\n\n        ------\"donec miselli liberi\n        Aspichmis dominam; sed postquam heu janua clausa est,\n        Fel intus est quod mel fuit:\"\n\n\"So long as we are wooers, may kiss and coll at our pleasure, nothing is so\nsweet, we are in heaven as we think; but when we are once tied, and have\nlost our liberty, marriage is an hell,\" \"give me my yellow hose again:\" a\nmouse in a trap lives as merrily, we are in a purgatory some of us, if not\nhell itself. _Dulce bellum inexpertis_, as the proverb is, 'tis fine\ntalking of war, and marriage sweet in contemplation, till it be tried: and\nthen as wars are most dangerous, irksome, every minute at death's door, so\nis, &c. When those wild Irish peers, saith [5766]Stanihurst, were feasted\nby king Henry the Second, (at what time he kept his Christmas at Dublin)\nand had tasted of his prince-like cheer, generous wines, dainty fare, had\nseen his [5767]massy plate of silver, gold, enamelled, beset with jewels,\ngolden candlesticks, goodly rich hangings, brave furniture, heard his\ntrumpets sound, fifes, drums, and his exquisite music in all kinds: when\nthey had observed his majestical presence as he sat in purple robes,\ncrowned, with his sceptre, &c., in his royal seat, the poor men were so\namazed, enamoured, and taken with the object, that they were _pertaesi\ndomestici et pristini tyrotarchi_, as weary and ashamed of their own\nsordidity and manner of life. They would all be English forthwith; who but\nEnglish! but when they had now submitted themselves, and lost their former\nliberty, they began to rebel some of them, others repent of what they had\ndone, when it was too late. 'Tis so with us bachelors, when we see and\nbehold those sweet faces, those gaudy shows that women make, observe their\npleasant gestures and graces, give ear to their siren tunes, see them\ndance, &c., we think their conditions are as fine as their faces, we are\ntaken, with dumb signs, _in amplexum ruimus_, we rave, we burn, and would\nfain be married. But when we feel the miseries, cares, woes, that accompany\nit, we make our moan many of us, cry out at length and cannot be released.\nIf this be true now, as some out of experience will inform us, farewell\nwiving for my part, and as the comical poet merrily saith,\n\n[5768] \"Perdatur ille pessime qui foeminam\n        Duxit secundus, nam nihil primo imprecor!\n        Ignarus ut puto mali primus fuit.\"\n\n[5769] \"Foul fall him that brought the second match to pass,\n        The first I wish no harm, poor man alas!\n        He knew not what he did, nor what it was.\"\n\nWhat shall I say to him that marries again and again, [5770]_Stulta\nmaritali qui porrigit ora capistro_, I pity him not, for the first time he\nmust do as he may, bear it out sometimes by the head and shoulders, and let\nhis next neighbour ride, or else run away, or as that Syracusian in a\ntempest, when all ponderous things were to be exonerated out of the ship,\n_quia maximum pondus erat_, fling his wife into the sea. But this I confess\nis comically spoken, [5771]and so I pray you take it. In sober sadness,\n[5772]marriage is a bondage, a thraldom, a yoke, a hindrance to all good\nenterprises, (\"he hath married a wife and cannot come\") a stop to all\npreferments, a rock on which many are saved, many impinge and are cast\naway: not that the thing is evil in itself or troublesome, but full of all\ncontentment and happiness, one of the three things which please God, [5773]\n\"when a man and his wife agree together,\" an honourable and happy estate,\nwho knows it not? If they be sober, wise, honest, as the poet infers,\n\n[5774] \"Si commodos nanciscantur amores,\n        Nullum iis abest voluptatis genus.\"\n\n       \"If fitly match'd be man and wife,\n        No pleasure's wanting to their life.\"\n\nBut to undiscreet sensual persons, that as brutes are wholly led by sense,\nit is a feral plague, many times a hell itself, and can give little or no\ncontent, being that they are often so irregular and prodigious in their\nlusts, so diverse in their affections. _Uxor nomen dignitatis, non\nvoluptatis_, as [5775]he said, a wife is a name of honour, not of pleasure:\nshe is fit to bear the office, govern a family, to bring up children, sit\nat a board's end and carve, as some carnal men think and say; they had\nrather go to the stews, or have now and then a snatch as they can come by\nit, borrow of their neighbours, than have wives of their own; except they\nmay, as some princes and great men do, keep as many courtesans as they will\nthemselves, fly out _impune_, [5776]_Permolere uxores alienas_, that\npolygamy of Turks, Lex Julia, with Caesar once enforced in Rome, (though\nLevinus Torrentius and others suspect it) _uti uxores quot et quas vellent\nliceret_, that every great man might marry, and keep as many wives as he\nwould, or Irish divorcement were in use: but as it is, 'tis hard and gives\nnot that satisfaction to these carnal men, beastly men as too many are:\n[5777]What still the same, to be tied [5778]to one, be she never so fair,\nnever so virtuous, is a thing they may not endure, to love one long. Say\nthy pleasure, and counterfeit as thou wilt, as [5779]Parmeno told Thais,\n_Neque tu uno eris contenta_, \"one man will never please thee;\" nor one\nwoman many men. But as [5780]Pan replied to his father Mercury, when he\nasked whether he was married, _Nequaquam pater, amator enim sum_ &c. \"No,\nfather, no, I am a lover still, and cannot be contented with one woman.\"\nPythias, Echo, Menades, and I know not how many besides, were his\nmistresses, he might not abide marriage. _Varietas delectat_, 'tis\nloathsome and tedious, what one still? which the satirist said of Iberina,\nis verified in most,\n\n[5781] \"Unus Iberinae vir sufficit? ocyus illud\n        Extorquebis ut haec oculo contenta sit uno.\"\n\n       \"'Tis not one man will serve her by her will,\n        As soon she'll have one eye as one man still.\"\n\nAs capable of any impression as _materia prima_ itself, that still desires\nnew forms, like the sea their affections ebb and flow. Husband is a cloak\nfor some to hide their villainy; once married she may fly out at her\npleasure, the name of husband is a sanctuary to make all good. _Eo ventum_\n(saith Seneca) _ut nulla virum habeat, nisi ut irritet adulterum_. They are\nright and straight, as true Trojans as mine host's daughter, that Spanish\nwench in [5782]Ariosto, as good wives as Messalina. Many men are as\nconstant in their choice, and as good husbands as Nero himself, they must\nhave their pleasure of all they see, and are in a word far more fickle than\nany woman.\n\n       _For either they be full of jealousy,\n        Or masterfull, or loven novelty_.\n\nGood men have often ill wives, as bad as Xanthippe was to Socrates, Elevora\nto St. Lewis, Isabella to our Edward the Second; and good wives are as\noften matched to ill husbands, as Mariamne to Herod, Serena to Diocletian,\nTheodora to Theophilus, and Thyra to Gurmunde. But I will say nothing of\ndissolute and bad husbands, of bachelors and their vices; their good\nqualities are a fitter subject for a just volume, too well known already in\nevery village, town and city, they need no blazon; and lest I should mar\nany matches, or dishearten loving maids, for this present I will let them\npass.\n\nBeing that men and women are so irreligious, depraved by nature, so\nwandering in their affections, so brutish, so subject to disagreement, so\nunobservant of marriage rites, what shall I say? If thou beest such a one,\nor thou light on such a wife, what concord can there be, what hope of\nagreement? 'tis not _conjugium_ but _conjurgium_, as the Reed and Fern in\nthe [5783]Emblem, averse and opposite in nature: 'tis twenty to one thou\nwilt not marry to thy contentment: but as in a lottery forty blanks were\ndrawn commonly for one prize, out of a multitude you shall hardly choose a\ngood one: a small ease hence then, little comfort,\n\n[5784] \"Nec integrum unquam transiges laetus diem.\"\n\n       \"If he or she be such a one,\n        Thou hadst much better be alone.\"\n\nIf she be barren, she is not--&c. If she have [5785]children, and thy state\nbe not good, though thou be wary and circumspect, thy charge will undo\nthee,--_foecunda domum tibi prole gravabit_, [5786]thou wilt not be able to\nbring them up, [5787]\"and what greater misery can there be than to beget\nchildren, to whom thou canst leave no other inheritance but hunger and\nthirst?\" [5788]_cum fames dominatur, strident voces rogantium panem,\npenetrantes patris cor_: what so grievous as to turn them up to the wide\nworld, to shift for themselves? No plague like to want: and when thou hast\ngood means, and art very careful of their education, they will not be\nruled. Think but of that old proverb, [Greek: haeiroon tekna paemata],\n_heroum filii noxae_, great men's sons seldom do well; _O utinam aut\ncoelebs mansissem, aut prole carerem!_ \"would that I had either remained\nsingle, or not had children,\" [5789]Augustus exclaims in Suetonius. Jacob\nhad his Reuben, Simeon and Levi; David an Amnon, an Absalom, Adoniah; wise\nmen's sons are commonly fools, insomuch that Spartian concludes, _Neminem\nprope magnorum virorum optimum et utilem reliquisse filium_: [5790]they had\nbeen much better to have been childless. 'Tis too common in the middle\nsort; thy son's a drunkard, a gamester, a spendthrift; thy daughter a fool,\na whore; thy servants lazy drones and thieves; thy neighbours devils, they\nwill make thee weary of thy life. [5791]\"If thy wife be froward, when she\nmay not have her will, thou hadst better be buried alive; she will be so\nimpatient, raving still, and roaring like Juno in the tragedy, there's\nnothing but tempests, all is in an uproar.\" If she be soft and foolish,\nthou wert better have a block, she will shame thee and reveal thy secrets;\nif wise and learned, well qualified, there is as much danger on the other\nside, _mulierem doctam ducere periculosissimum_, saith Nevisanus, she will\nbe too insolent and peevish, [5792]_Malo Venusinam quam te Cornelia mater_.\nTake heed; if she be a slut, thou wilt loathe her; if proud, she'll beggar\nthee, so [5793]\"she'll spend thy patrimony in baubles, all Arabia will not\nserve to perfume her hair,\" saith Lucian; if fair and wanton, she'll make\nthee a cornuto; if deformed, she will paint. [5794]\"If her face be filthy\nby nature, she will mend it by art,\" _alienis et adscititiis imposturis_,\n\"which who can endure?\" If she do not paint, she will look so filthy, thou\ncanst not love her, and that peradventure will make thee dishonest.\nCromerus _lib. 12. hist._, relates of Casimirus, [5795]that he was\nunchaste, because his wife Aleida, the daughter of Henry, Landgrave of\nHesse, was so deformed. If she be poor, she brings beggary with her (saith\nNevisanus), misery and discontent. If you marry a maid, it is uncertain how\nshe proves, _Haec forsan veniet non satis apta tibi_. [5796]If young, she\nis likely wanton and untaught; if lusty, too lascivious; and if she be not\nsatisfied, you know where and when, _nil nisi jurgia_, all is in an uproar,\nand there is little quietness to be had; If an old maid, 'tis a hazard she\ndies in childbed; if a [5797]rich widow, _induces te in laqueum_, thou dost\nhalter thyself, she will make all away beforehand, to her other children,\n&c.--[5798]_dominam quis possit ferre tonantem_? she will hit thee still in\nthe teeth with her first husband; if a young widow, she is often insatiable\nand immodest. If she be rich, well descended, bring a great dowry, or be\nnobly allied, thy wife's friends will eat thee out of house and home,\n_dives ruinam aedibus inducit_, she will be so proud, so high-minded, so\nimperious. For--_nihil est magis intolerabile dite_, \"there's nothing so\nintolerable,\" thou shalt be as the tassel of a goshawk, [5799]\"she will\nride upon thee, domineer as she list,\" wear the breeches in her\noligarchical government, and beggar thee besides. _Uxores divites\nservitutem exigunt_ (as Seneca hits them, _declam. lib. 2. declam.\n6._)--_Dotem accepi imperium perdidi_. They will have sovereignty, _pro\nconjuge dominam arcessis_, they will have attendance, they will do what\nthey list. [5800]In taking a dowry thou losest thy liberty, _dos intrat,\nlibertas exit_, hazardest thine estate.\n\n       \"Hae sunt atque aliae multae in magnis dotibus\n        Incommoditates, sumptusque intolerabiles,\" &c.\n\n\"with many such inconveniences:\" say the best, she is a commanding servant;\nthou hadst better have taken a good housewife maid in her smock. Since then\nthere is such hazard, if thou be wise keep thyself as thou art, 'tis good\nto match, much better to be free.\n\n[5801] \"--procreare liberos lepidissimum.\n        Hercle vero liberum esse, id multo est lepidius.\"\n\n[5802]Art thou young? then match not yet; if old, match not at all.\n\n       \"Vis juvenis nubere? nondum venit tempus.\n        Ingravescente aetate jam tempus praeteriit.\"\n\nAnd therefore, with that philosopher, still make answer to thy friends that\nimportune thee to marry, _adhuc intempestivum_, 'tis yet unseasonable, and\never will be.\n\nConsider withal how free, how happy, how secure, how heavenly, in respect,\na single man is, [5803]as he said in the comedy, _Et isti quod fortunatum\nesse autumant, uxorem nunquam habui_, and that which all my neighbours\nadmire and applaud me for, account so great a happiness, I never had a\nwife; consider how contentedly, quietly, neatly, plentifully, sweetly, and\nhow merrily he lives! he hath no man to care for but himself, none to\nplease, no charge, none to control him, is tied to no residence, no cure to\nserve, may go and come, when, whither, live where he will, his own master,\nand do what he list himself. Consider the excellency of virgins, [5804]\n_Virgo coelum meruit_, marriage replenisheth the earth, but virginity\nParadise; Elias, Eliseus, John Baptist, were bachelors: virginity is a\nprecious jewel, a fair garland, a never-fading flower; [5805]for why was\nDaphne turned to a green bay-tree, but to show that virginity is immortal?\n\n[5806] \"Ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis,\n        Ignotus pecori, nullo contusus aratro,\n        Quam mulcent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber, &c.\n        Sic virgo dum intacta manet, dum chara suis, sed\n        Cum Castum amisit,\" &c.------\n\nVirginity is a fine picture, as [5807]Bonaventure calls it, a blessed thing\nin itself, and if you will believe a Papist, meritorious. And although\nthere be some inconveniences, irksomeness, solitariness, &c., incident to\nsuch persons, want of those comforts, _quae, aegro assideat et curet\naegrotum, fomentum paret, roget medieum_, &c., embracing, dalliance,\nkissing, colling, &c., those furious motives and wanton pleasures a\nnew-married wife most part enjoys; yet they are but toys in respect, easily\nto be endured, if conferred to those frequent encumbrances of marriage.\nSolitariness may be otherwise avoided with mirth, music, good company,\nbusiness, employment; in a word, [5808]_Gaudebit minus, et minus dolebit_;\nfor their good nights, he shall have good days. And methinks some time or\nother, amongst so many rich bachelors, a benefactor should be found to\nbuild a monastical college for old, decayed, deformed, or discontented\nmaids to live together in, that have lost their first loves, or otherwise\nmiscarried, or else are willing howsoever to lead a single life. The rest I\nsay are toys in respect, and sufficiently recompensed by those innumerable\ncontents and incomparable privileges of virginity. Think of these things,\nconfer both lives, and consider last of all these commodious prerogatives a\nbachelor hath, how well he is esteemed, how heartily welcome to all his\nfriends, _quam mentitis obsequiis_, as Tertullian observes, with what\ncounterfeit courtesies they will adore him, follow him, present him with\ngifts, _humatis donis_; \"it cannot be believed\" (saith [5809]Ammianus)\n\"with what humble service he shall be worshipped,\" how loved and respected:\n\"If he want children, (and have means) he shall be often invited, attended\non by princes, and have advocates to plead his cause for nothing,\" as\n[5810] Plutarch adds. Wilt thou then be reverenced, and had in estimation?\n\n[5811]  ------\"dominus tamen et domini rex\n        Si tu vis fieri, nullus tibi parvulus aula.\n        Luserit Aeneas, nec filia dulcior illa?\n        Jucundum et charum sterilis facit uxor amicum.\"\n\nLive a single man, marry not, and thou shalt soon perceive how those\nHaeredipetae (for so they were called of old) will seek after thee, bribe\nand flatter thee for thy favour, to be thine heir or executor: Aruntius and\nAterius, those famous parasites in this kind, as Tacitus and [5812]Seneca\nhave recorded, shall not go beyond them. Periplectomines, that good\npersonate old man, _delicium senis_, well understood this in Plautus: for\nwhen Pleusides exhorted him to marry that he might have children of his\nown, he readily replied in this sort,\n\n       \"Quando habeo multos cognatos, quid opus mihi sit liberis?\n        Nunc bene vivo et fortunate, atque animo ut lubet.\n        Mea bona mea morte cognatis dicam interpartiant.\n        Illi apud me edunt, me curant, visunt quid agam, ecquid velim,\n        Qui mihi mittunt munera, ad prandium, ad coenam vocant.\"\n\n       \"Whilst I have kin, what need I brats to have?\n        Now I live well, and as I will, most brave.\n        And when I die, my goods I'll give away\n        To them that do invite me every day.\n        That visit me, and send me pretty toys,\n        And strive who shall do me most courtesies.\"\n\nThis respect thou shalt have in like manner, living as he did, a single\nman. But if thou marry once, [5813]_cogitato in omni vita te servum fore_,\nbethink thyself what a slavery it is, what a heavy burden thou shalt\nundertake, how hard a task thou art tied to, (for as Hierome hath it, _qui\nuxorem habet, debitor est, et uxoris servus alligatus_,) and how\ncontinuate, what squalor attends it, what irksomeness, what charges, for\nwife and children are a perpetual bill of charges; besides a myriad of\ncares, miseries, and troubles; for as that comical Plautus merrily and\ntruly said, he that wants trouble, must get to be master of a ship, or\nmarry a wife; and as another seconds him, wife and children have undone me;\nso many and such infinite encumbrances accompany this kind of life.\nFurthermore, _uxor intumuit_, &c., or as he said in the comedy, [5814]_Duxi\nuxorem, quam ibi miseriam vidi, nati filii, alia cura_. All gifts and\ninvitations cease, no friend will esteem thee, and thou shalt be compelled\nto lament thy misery, and make thy moan with [5815]Bartholomeus Scheraeus,\nthat famous poet laureate, and professor of Hebrew in Wittenberg: I had\nfinished this work long since, but that _inter alia dura et tristia quae\nmisero mihi pene tergum fregerunt_, (I use his own words) amongst many\nmiseries which almost broke my back, [Greek: syzygia] _ob Xantipismum_, a\nshrew to my wife tormented my mind above measure, and beyond the rest. So\nshalt thou be compelled to complain, and to cry out at last, with\n[5816]Phoroneus the lawyer, \"How happy had I been, if I had wanted a wife!\"\nIf this which I have said will not suffice, see more in Lemnius _lib. 4.\ncap. 13. de occult. nat. mir._ Espensaeus _de continentia, lib. 6. cap. 8._\nKornman _de virginitate_, Platina _in Amor. dial. Practica artis amandi_,\nBarbarus _de re uxoria_, Arnisaeus _in polit. cap. 3._ and him that is\n_instar omnium_, Nevisanus the lawyer, _Sylva nuptial_, almost in every\npage.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Philters, Magical and Poetical Cures_.\n\nWhere persuasions and other remedies will not take place, many fly to\nunlawful means, philters, amulets, magic spells, ligatures, characters,\ncharms, which as a wound with the spear of Achilles, if so made and caused,\nmust so be cured. If forced by spells and philters, saith Paracelsus, it\nmust be eased by characters, _Mag. lib. 2. cap 28._ and by incantations.\nFernelius _Path. lib. 6. cap. 13._ [5817]Skenkius _lib. 4. observ. med_.\nhath some examples of such as have been so magically caused, and magically\ncured, and by witchcraft: so saith Baptista Codronchus, _lib. 3. cap. 9. de\nmor. ven._ _Malleus malef. cap. 6._ 'Tis not permitted to be done, I\nconfess; yet often attempted: see more in Wierus _lib. 3. cap. 18. de\npraestig. de remediis per philtra._ Delrio _tom. 2. lib. 2. quaest. 3.\nsect. 3. disquisit. magic_. Cardan _lib. 16. cap. 90._ reckons up many\nmagnetical medicines, as to piss through a ring, &c. Mizaldus _cent. 3.\n30_, Baptista Porta, Jason Pratensis, Lobelius _pag. 87_, Matthiolus, &c.,\nprescribe many absurd remedies. Radix mandragora ebibitae, Annuli ex\nungulis Asini, Stercus amatae sub cervical positum, illa nesciente, &c.,\nquum odorem foeditatis sentit, amor solvitur. Noctuae ocum abstemios facit\ncomestum, ex consilio Jarthae Indorum gymnosophistae apud Philostratum\n_lib. 3._ Sanguis amasiae, ebibitus omnem amoris sensum tollit: Faustinam\nMarci Aurelii uxorem, gladiatoris amore captam, ita penitus consilio\nChaldaeorum liberatam, refert Julius Capitolinus. Some of our astrologers\nwill effect as much by characteristical images, _ex sigillis Hermetis,\nSalomonis, Chaelis, &c. mulieris imago habentis crines sparsos_, &c. Our\nold poets and fantastical writers have many fabulous remedies for such as\nare lovesick, as that of Protesilaus' tomb in Philostratus, in his dialogue\nbetween Phoenix and Vinitor: Vinitor, upon occasion discoursing of the rare\nvirtues of that shrine, telleth him that Protesilaus' altar and tomb\n[5818]\"cures almost all manner of diseases, consumptions, dropsies,\nquartan-agues, sore eyes: and amongst the rest, such as are lovesick shall\nthere be helped.\" But the most famous is [5819]Leucata Petra, that renowned\nrock in Greece, of which Strabo writes, _Geog. lib. 10._ not far from St.\nMaures, saith Sands, _lib. 1._ from which rock if any lover flung himself\ndown headlong, he was instantly cured. Venus after the death of Adonis,\n\"when she could take no rest for love,\" [5820]_Cum vesana suas torreret\nflamma medullas_, came to the temple of Apollo to know what she should do\nto be eased of her pain: Apollo sent her to Leucata Petra, where she\nprecipitated herself, and was forthwith freed; and when she would needs\nknow of him a reason of it, he told her again, that he had often observed\n[5821]Jupiter, when he was enamoured on Juno, thither go to ease and wash\nhimself, and after him divers others. Cephalus for the love of Protela,\nDegonetus' daughter, leaped down here, that Lesbian Sappho for Phaon, on\nwhom she miserably doted. [5822]_Cupidinis aestro percita e summo praeceps\nruit_, hoping thus to ease herself, and to be freed of her love pangs.\n\n[5823] \"Hic se Deucalion Pyrrhae suecensus amore\n        Mersit, et illaeso corpore pressit aquas.\n        Nec mora, fugit amor,\" &c.------\n\n       \"Hither Deucalion came, when Pyrrha's love\n        Tormented him, and leapt down to the sea,\n        And had no harm at all, but by and by\n        His love was gone and chased quite away.\"\n\nThis medicine Jos. Scaliger speaks of, _Ausoniarum lectionum lib. 18._\nSalmutz _in Pancirol. de 7. mundi mirac._ and other writers. Pliny reports,\nthat amongst the Cyzeni, there is a well consecrated to Cupid, of which if\nany lover taste, his passion is mitigated: and Anthony Verdurius _Imag.\ndeorum de Cupid._ saith, that amongst the ancients there was [5824]_Amor\nLethes_, \"he took burning torches, and extinguished them in the river; his\nstatute was to be seen in the temple of Venus Eleusina,\" of which Ovid\nmakes mention, and saith \"that all lovers of old went thither on\npilgrimage, that would be rid of their love-pangs.\" Pausanias, in [5825]\nPhocicis, writes of a temple dedicated _Veneri in spelunca_, to Venus in\nthe vault, at Naupactus in Achaia (now Lepanto) in which your widows that\nwould have second husbands, made their supplications to the goddess; all\nmanner of suits concerning lovers were commenced, and their grievances\nhelped. The same author, in Achaicis, tells as much of the river [5826]\nSenelus in Greece; if any lover washed himself in it, by a secret virtue of\nthat water, (by reason of the extreme coldness belike) he was healed, of\nlove's torments, [5827]_Amoris vulnus idem qui sanat facit_; which if it be\nso, that water, as he holds, is _omni auro pretiosior_, better than any\ngold. Where none of all these remedies will take place, I know no other but\nthat all lovers must make a head and rebel, as they did in [5828]Ausonius,\nand crucify Cupid till he grant their request, or satisfy their desires.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_The last and best Cure of Love-Melancholy, is to let them\nhave their Desire_.\n\nThe last refuge and surest remedy, to be put in practice in the utmost\nplace, when no other means will take effect, is to let them go together,\nand enjoy one another: _potissima cura est ut heros amasia sua potiatur_,\nsaith Guianerius, _cap. 15. tract. 15._ Aesculapius himself, to this\nmalady, cannot invent a better remedy, _quam ut amanti cedat amatum_,\n[5829](Jason Pratensis) than that a lover have his desire.\n\n       \"Et pariter torulo bini jungantur in uno,\n        Et pulchro detur Aeneae Lavinia conjux.\"\n\n       \"And let them both be joined in a bed,\n        And let Aeneas fair Lavinia wed;\"\n\n'Tis the special cure, to let them bleed in _vena Hymencaea_, for love is a\npleurisy, and if it be possible, so let it be,--_optataque gaudia carpant_.\n[5830]Arculanus holds it the speediest and the best cure, 'tis Savanarola's\n[5831]last precept, a principal infallible remedy, the last, sole, and\nsafest refuge.\n\n[5832] \"Julia sola poles nostras extinguere flammas,\n        Non nive, nun glacie, sed potes igne pari.\"\n\n       \"Julia alone can quench my desire,\n        With neither ice nor snow, but with like fire.\"\n\nWhen you have all done, saith [5833]Avicenna, \"there is no speedier or\nsafer course, than to join the parties together according to their desires\nand wishes, the custom and form of law; and so we have seen him quickly\nrestored to his former health, that was languished away to skin and bones;\nafter his desire was satisfied, his discontent ceased, and we thought it\nstrange; our opinion is therefore that in such cases nature is to be\nobeyed.\" Areteus, an old author, _lib. 3. cap. 3._ hath an instance of a\nyoung man, [5834]when no other means could prevail, was so speedily\nrelieved. What remains then but to join them in marriage?\n\n[5835] \"Tunc et basia morsiunculasque\n        Surreptim dare, mutuos fovere\n        Amplexus licet, et licet jocari;\"\n\n\"they may then kiss and coll, lie and look babies in one another's eyes,\"\nas heir sires before them did, they may then satiate themselves with love's\npleasures, which they have so long wished and expected;\n\n       \"Atque uno simul in toro quiescant,\n        Conjuncto simul ore suavientur,\n        Et somnos agitent quiete in una.\"\n\nYea, but _hic labor, hoc opus_, this cannot conveniently be done, by reason\nof many and several impediments. Sometimes both parties themselves are not\nagreed: parents, tutors, masters, guardians, will not give consent; laws,\ncustoms, statutes hinder: poverty, superstition, fear and suspicion: many\nmen dote on one woman, _semel et simul_: she dotes as much on him, or them,\nand in modesty must not, cannot woo, as unwilling to confess as willing to\nlove: she dare not make it known, show her affection, or speak her mind.\n\"And hard is the choice\" (as it is in Euphues) \"when one is compelled\neither by silence to die with grief, or by speaking to live with shame.\" In\nthis case almost was the fair lady Elizabeth, Edward the Fourth his\ndaughter, when she was enamoured on Henry the Seventh, that noble young\nprince, and new saluted king, when she broke forth into that passionate\nspeech, [5836] \"O that I were worthy of that comely prince! but my father\nbeing dead, I want friends to motion such a matter! What shall I say? I am\nall alone, and dare not open my mind to any. What if I acquaint my mother\nwith it? bashfulness forbids. What if some of the lords? audacity wants. O\nthat I might but confer with him, perhaps in discourse I might let slip\nsuch a word that might discover mine intention!\" How many modest maids may\nthis concern, I am a poor servant, what shall I do? I am a fatherless\nchild, and want means, I am blithe and buxom, young and lusty, but I have\nnever a suitor, _Expectant stolidi ut ego illos rogatum veniam_, as\n[5837]she said, A company of silly fellows look belike that I should woo\nthem and speak first: fain they would and cannot woo,--[5838]_quae primum\nexordia sumam_? being merely passive they may not make suit, with many such\nlets and inconveniences, which I know not; what shall we do in such a case?\nsing \"Fortune my foe? \"------\n\nSome are so curious in this behalf, as those old Romans, our modern\nVenetians, Dutch and French, that if two parties clearly love, the one\nnoble, the other ignoble, they may not by their laws match, though equal\notherwise in years, fortunes, education, and all good affection. In\nGermany, except they can prove their gentility by three descents, they\nscorn to match with them. A nobleman must marry a noblewoman: a baron, a\nbaron's daughter; a knight, a knight's; a gentleman, a gentleman's: as\nslaters sort their slates, do they degrees and families. If she be never so\nrich, fair, well qualified otherwise, they will make him forsake her. The\nSpaniards abhor all widows; the Turks repute them old women, if past\nfive-and-twenty. But these are too severe laws, and strict customs, _dandum\naliquid amori_, we are all the sons of Adam, 'tis opposite to nature, it\nought not to be so. Again: he loves her most impotently, she loves not him,\nand so _e contra_. [5839]Pan loved Echo, Echo Satyrus, Satyrus Lyda.\n\n       \"Quantum ipsorum aliquis amantem oderat,\n        Tantum ipsius amans odiosus erat.\"\n\n\"They love and loathe of all sorts, he loves her, she hates him; and is\nloathed of him, on whom she dotes.\" Cupid hath two darts, one to force\nlove, all of gold, and that sharp,--[5840]_Quod facit auratum est_; another\nblunt, of lead, and that to hinder;--_fugat hoc, facit illud amorem_, \"this\ndispels, that creates love.\" This we see too often verified in our common\nexperience. [5841]Choresus dearly loved that virgin Callyrrhoe; but the\nmore he loved her, the more she hated him. Oenone loved Paris, but he\nrejected her: they are stiff of all sides, as if beauty were therefore\ncreated to undo, or be undone. I give her all attendance, all observance, I\npray and intreat, [5842]_Alma precor miserere mei_, fair mistress pity me,\nI spend myself, my time, friends and fortunes, to win her favour, (as he\ncomplains in the [5843]Eclogue,) I lament, sigh, weep, and make my moan to\nher, \"but she is hard as flint,\"--_cautibus Ismariis immotior_--as fair and\nhard as a diamond, she will not respect, _Despectus tibi sum_, or hear me,\n\n[5844]  ------\"fugit illa vocantem\n        Nil lachrymas miserata meas, nil flexa querelis.\"\n\nWhat shall I do?\n\n       \"I wooed her as a young man should do,\n        But sir, she said, I love not you.\"\n\n[5845] \"Durior at scopulis mea Coelia, marmore, ferro,\n        Robore, rupe, antro, cornu, adamante, gelu.\"\n\n       \"Rock, marble, heart of oak with iron barr'd,\n        Frost, flint or adamants, are not so hard.\"\n\nI give, I bribe, I send presents, but they are refused. [5846]_Rusticus est\nCoridon, nec munera curat Alexis_. I protest, I swear, I weep,\n\n[5847]   ------\"odioque rependit amores,\n        Irrisu lachrymas\"------\n\n\"She neglects me for all this, she derides me,\" contemns me, she hates me,\n\"Phillida flouts me:\" _Caute, feris, quercu durior Eurydice_, stiff,\nchurlish, rocky still.\n\nAnd 'tis most true, many gentlewomen are so nice, they scorn all suitors,\ncrucify their poor paramours, and think nobody good enough for them, as\ndainty to please as Daphne herself.\n\n[5848] \"Multi illum petiere, illa aspernate petentes,\n        Nec quid Hymen, quid amor, quid sint connubia curat.\"\n\n       \"Many did woo her, but she scorn'd them still,\n        And said she would not marry by her will.\"\n\nOne while they will not marry, as they say at least, (when as they intend\nnothing less) another while not yet, when 'tis their only desire, they rave\nupon it. She will marry at last, but not him: he is a proper man indeed,\nand well qualified, but he wants means: another of her suitors hath good\nmeans, but he wants wit; one is too old, another too young, too deformed,\nshe likes not his carriage: a third too loosely given, he is rich, but base\nborn: she will be a gentlewoman, a lady, as her sister is, as her mother\nis: she is all out as fair, as well brought up, hath as good a portion, and\nshe looks for as good a match, as Matilda or Dorinda: if not, she is\nresolved as yet to tarry, so apt are young maids to boggle at every object,\nso soon won or lost with every toy, so quickly diverted, so hard to be\npleased. In the meantime, _quot torsit amantes_? one suitor pines away,\nlanguisheth in love, _mori quot denique cogit!_ another sighs and grieves,\nshe cares not: and which [5849]Siroza objected to Ariadne,\n\n       \"Nec magis Euryali gemitu, lacrymisque moveris,\n          Quam prece turbati flectitur ora sati.\n        Tu juvenem, quo non formosior alter in urbe,\n          Spernis, et insano cogis amore mori.\"\n\n       \"Is no more mov'd with those sad sighs and tears,\n        Of her sweetheart, than raging sea with prayers:\n        Thou scorn'st the fairest youth in all our city,\n        And mak'st him almost mad for love to die:\"\n\nThey take a pride to prank up themselves, to make young men. enamoured,--\n[5850]_captare viros et spernere capias_, to dote on them, and to run mad\nfor their sakes,\n\n[5851]  ------\"sed nullis illa movetur\n        Fletibus, aut voces ullas tractabilis audit.\"\n\n       \"Whilst niggardly their favours they discover,\n        They love to be belov'd, yet scorn the lover.\"\n\nAll suit and service is too little for them, presents too base: _Tormentis\ngaudet amantis--et spoliis_. As Atalanta they must be overrun, or not won.\nMany young men are as obstinate, and as curious in their choice, as\ntyrannically proud, insulting, deceitful, false-hearted, as irrefragable\nand peevish on the other side; Narcissus-like,\n\n[5852] \"Multi illum juvenes, multae petiere puellae,\n        Sed fuit in tenera tam dira superbia forma,\n        Nulli illum juvenes, nullas petiere puellae.\"\n\n       \"Young men and maids did to him sue,\n        But in his youth, so proud, so coy was he,\n        Young men and maids bade him adieu.\"\n\nEcho wept and wooed him by all means above the rest, Love me for pity, or\npity me for love, but he was obstinate, _Ante ait emoriar quam sit tibi\ncopia nostri_, \"he would rather die than give consent.\" Psyche ran whining\nafter Cupid,\n\n[5853] \"Formosum tua te Psyche formosa requirit,\n        Et poscit te dia deum, puerumque puella;\"\n\n       \"Fair Cupid, thy fair Psyche to thee sues,\n        A lovely lass a fine young gallant woos;\"\n\nbut he rejected her nevertheless. Thus many lovers do hold out so long,\ndoting on themselves, stand in their own light, till in the end they come\nto be scorned and rejected, as Stroza's Gargiliana was,\n\n       \"Te juvenes, te odere senes, desertaque langues,\n        Quae fueras procerum publica cura prius.\"\n\n       \"Both young and old do hate thee scorned now,\n        That once was all their joy and comfort too.\"\n\nAs Narcissus was himself,\n\n        ------\"Who despising many.\n        Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.\"\n\nThey begin to be contemned themselves of others, as he was of his shadow,\nand take up with a poor curate, or an old serving-man at last, that might\nhave had their choice of right good matches in their youth; like that\ngenerous mare, in [5854]Plutarch, which would admit of none but great\nhorses, but when her tail was cut off and mane shorn close, and she now saw\nherself so deformed in the water, when she came to drink, _ab asino\nconscendi se passa_, she was contented at last to be covered by an ass. Yet\nthis is a common humour, will not be left, and cannot be helped.\n\n[5855] \"Hanc volo quae non vult, illam quae vult ego nolo:\n        Vincere vult animos, non satiare Venus.\"\n\n       \"I love a maid, she loves me not: full fain\n        She would have me, but I not her again;\n        So love to crucify men's souls is bent:\n        But seldom doth it please or give consent.\"\n\n\"Their love danceth in a ring, and Cupid hunts them round about; he dotes,\nis doted on again.\" _Dumque petit petitur, pariterque accedit et ardet_,\ntheir affection cannot be reconciled. Oftentimes they may and will not,\n'tis their own foolish proceedings that mars all, they are too distrustful\nof themselves, too soon dejected: say she be rich, thou poor: she young,\nthou old; she lovely and fair, thou most ill-favoured and deformed; she\nnoble, thou base: she spruce and fine, but thou an ugly clown: _nil\ndesperandum_, there's hope enough yet: _Mopso Nisa datur, quid non speremus\namantes_? Put thyself forward once more, as unlikely matches have been and\nare daily made, see what will be the event. Many leave roses and gather\nthistles, loathe honey and love verjuice: our likings are as various as our\npalates. But commonly they omit opportunities, _oscula qui sumpsit_, &c.,\nthey neglect the usual means and times.\n\n       \"He that will not when he may,\n        When he will he shall have nay.\"\n\nThey look to be wooed, sought after, and sued to. Most part they will and\ncannot, either for the above-named reasons, or for that there is a\nmultitude of suitors equally enamoured, doting all alike; and where one\nalone must speed, what shall become of the rest? Hero was beloved of many,\nbut one did enjoy her; Penelope had a company of suitors, yet all missed of\ntheir aim. In such cases he or they must wisely and warily unwind\nthemselves, unsettle his affections by those rules above prescribed,--\n[5856]_quin stultos excutit ignes_, divert his cogitations, or else bravely\nbear it out, as Turnus did, _Tua sit Lavinia conjux_, when he could not get\nher, with a kind of heroical scorn he bid Aeneas take her, or with a milder\nfarewell, let her go. _Et Phillida solus habeto_, \"Take her to you, God\ngive you joy, sir.\" The fox in the emblem would eat no grapes, but why?\nbecause he could not get them; care not then for that which may not be had.\n\nMany such inconveniences, lets, and hindrances there are, which cross their\nprojects and crucify poor lovers, which sometimes may, sometimes again\ncannot be so easily removed. But put case they be reconciled all, agreed\nhitherto, suppose this love or good liking be between two alone, both\nparties well pleased, there is _mutuus amor_, mutual love and great\naffection; yet their parents, guardians, tutors, cannot agree, thence all\nis dashed, the match is unequal: one rich, another poor: _durus pater_, a\nhard-hearted, unnatural, a covetous father will not marry his son, except\nhe have so much money, _ita in aurum omnes insaniunt_, as [5857]Chrysostom\nnotes, nor join his daughter in marriage, to save her dowry, or for that he\ncannot spare her for the service she doth him, and is resolved to part with\nnothing whilst he lives, not a penny, though he may peradventure well give\nit, he will not till he dies, and then as a pot of money broke, it is\ndivided amongst them that gaped after it so earnestly. Or else he wants\nmeans to set her out, he hath no money, and though it be to the manifest\nprejudice of her body and soul's health, he cares not, he will take no\nnotice of it, she must and shall tarry. Many slack and careless parents,\n_iniqui patres_, measure their children's affections by their own, they are\nnow cold and decrepit themselves, past all such youthful conceits, and they\nwill therefore starve their children's genus, have them _a pueris [5858]\nillico nasci senes_, they must not marry, _nec earum affines esse rerum\nquas secum fert adolescentia: ex sua libidine moderatur quae est nunc, non\nquae olim fuit_: as he said in the comedy: they will stifle nature, their\nyoung bloods must not participate of youthful pleasures, but be as they are\nthemselves old on a sudden. And 'tis a general fault amongst most parents\nin bestowing of their children, the father wholly respects wealth, when\nthrough his folly, riot, indiscretion, he hath embezzled his estate, to\nrecover himself, he confines and prostitutes his eldest son's love and\naffection to some fool, or ancient, or deformed piece for money.\n\n[5859] \"Phanaretae ducet filiam, rufam, illam virginem,\n        Caesiam, sparso ore, adunco naso\"------\n\nand though his son utterly dislike, with Clitipho in the comedy, _Non\npossum pater_: If she be rich, _Eia_ (he replies) _ut elegans est, credas\nanimum ibi esse_? he must and shall have her, she is fair enough, young\nenough, if he look or hope to inherit his lands, he shall marry, not when\nor whom he loves, _Arconidis hujus filiam_, but whom his father commands,\nwhen and where he likes, his affection must dance attendance upon him. His\ndaughter is in the same predicament forsooth, as an empty boat, she must\ncarry what, where, when, and whom her father will. So that in these\nbusinesses the father is still for the best advantage; now the mother\nrespects good kindred, must part the son a proper woman. All which [5860]\nLivy exemplifies, _dec. 1. lib. 4._ a gentleman and a yeoman wooed a wench\nin Rome (contrary to that statute that the gentry and commonalty must not\nmatch together); the matter was controverted: the gentleman was preferred\nby the mother's voice, _quae quam splendissimis nuptiis jungi puellam\nvolebat_: the overseers stood for him that was most worth, &c. But parents\nought not to be so strict in this behalf, beauty is a dowry of itself all\nsufficient, [5861]_Virgo formosa, etsi oppido pauper, abunde dotata est_,\n[5862]Rachel was so married to Jacob, and Bonaventure, [5863]_in 4. sent_,\n\"denies that he so much as venially sins, that marries a maid for\ncomeliness of person.\" The Jews, Deut. xxi. 11, if they saw amongst the\ncaptives a beautiful woman, some small circumstances observed, might take\nher to wife. They should not be too severe in that kind, especially if\nthere be no such urgent occasion, or grievous impediment. 'Tis good for a\ncommonwealth. [5864]Plato holds, that in their contracts \"young men should\nnever avoid the affinity of poor folks, or seek after rich.\" Poverty and\nbase parentage may be sufficiently recompensed by many other good\nqualities, modesty, virtue, religion, and choice bringing up, [5865]\"I am\npoor, I confess, but am I therefore contemptible, and an abject? Love\nitself is naked, the graces; the stars, and Hercules clad in a lion's\nskin.\" Give something to virtue, love, wisdom, favour, beauty, person; be\nnot all for money. Besides, you must consider that _Amor cogi non potest_,\nlove cannot be compelled, they must affect as they may: [5866]_Fatum est in\npartibus illis quas sinus abscondit_, as the saying is, marriage and\nhanging goes by destiny, matches are made in heaven.\n\n       \"It lies not in our power to love or hate,\n        For will in us is overrul'd by fate.\"\n\nA servant maid in [5867]Aristaenetus loved her mistress's minion, which\nwhen her dame perceived, _furiosa aemulatione_ in a jealous humour she\ndragged her about the house by the hair of the head, and vexed her sore.\nThe wench cried out, [5868]\"O mistress, fortune hath made my body your\nservant, but not my soul!\" Affections are free, not to be commanded.\nMoreover it may be to restrain their ambition, pride, and covetousness, to\ncorrect those hereditary diseases of a family, God in his just judgment\nassigns and permits such matches to be made. For I am of Plato and [5869]\nBodine's mind, that families have their bounds and periods as well as\nkingdoms, beyond which for extent or continuance they shall not exceed, six\nor seven hundred years, as they there illustrate by a multitude of\nexamples, and which Peucer and [5870]Melancthon approve, but in a perpetual\ntenor (as we see by many pedigrees of knights, gentlemen, yeomen) continue\nas they began, for many descents with little alteration. Howsoever let\nthem, I say, give something to youth, to love; they must not think they can\nfancy whom they appoint; [5871]_Amor enim non imperatur, affectus liber si\nquis alius et vices exigens_, this is a free passion, as Pliny said in a\npanegyric of his, and may not be forced: Love craves liking, as the saying\nis, it requires mutual affections, a correspondency: _invito non datur nec\naufertur_, it may not be learned, Ovid himself cannot teach us how to love,\nSolomon describe, Apelles paint, or Helen express it. They must not\ntherefore compel or intrude; [5872]_quis enim_ (as Fabius urgeth) _amare\nalieno animo potest_? but consider withal the miseries of enforced\nmarriages; take pity upon youth: and such above the rest as have daughters\nto bestow, should be very careful and provident to marry them in due time.\nSiracides cap. 7. vers. 25. calls it \"a weighty matter to perform, so to\nmarry a daughter to a man of understanding in due time:\" _Virgines enim\ntempestive locandae_, as [5873]Lemnius admonisheth, _lib. 1. cap. 6._\nVirgins must be provided for in season, to prevent many diseases, of which\n[5874]Rodericus a Castro _de morbis mulierum, lib. 2. cap. 3._ and Lod.\nMercatus _lib. 2. de mulier. affect, cap. 4, de melanch. virginum et\nviduarum_, have both largely discoursed. And therefore as well to avoid\nthese feral maladies, 'tis good to get them husbands betimes, as to prevent\nsome other gross inconveniences, and for a thing that I know besides; _ubi\nnuptiarum tempus et aetas advenerit_, as Chrysostom adviseth, let them not\ndefer it; they perchance will marry themselves else, or do worse. If\nNevisanus the lawyer do not impose, they may do it by right: for as he\nproves out of Curtius, and some other civilians, Sylvae, _nup. lib. 2.\nnumer. 30._ [5875]\"A maid past twenty-five years of age, against her\nparents' consent may marry such a one as is unworthy of, and inferior to\nher, and her father by law must be compelled to give her a competent\ndowry.\" Mistake me not in the mean time, or think that I do apologise here\nfor any headstrong, unruly, wanton flirts. I do approve that of St. Ambrose\n(_Comment. in Genesis xxiv. 51_), which he hath written touching Rebecca's\nspousals, \"A woman should give unto her parents the choice of her husband,\n[5876]lest she be reputed to be malapert and wanton, if she take upon her\nto make her own choice; [5877]for she should rather seem to be desired by a\nman, than to desire a man herself.\" To those hard parents alone I retort\nthat of Curtius, (in the behalf of modester maids), that are too remiss and\ncareless of their due time and riper years. For if they tarry longer, to\nsay truth, they are past date, and nobody will respect them. A woman with\nus in Italy (saith [5878]Aretine's Lucretia) twenty-four years of age, \"is\nold already, past the best, of no account.\" An old fellow, as Lycistrata\nconfesseth in [5879]Aristophanes, _etsi sit canus, cito puellam virginem\nducat uxorem_, and 'tis no news for an old fellow to marry a young wench:\nbut as he follows it, _mulieris brevis occasio est, etsi hoc non\napprehenderit, nemo vult ducere uxorem, expectans vero sedet_; who cares\nfor an old maid? she may set, &c. A virgin, as the poet holds, _lasciva et\npetulans puella virgo_, is like a flower, a rose withered on a sudden.\n\n[5880] \"Quam modo nascentem rutilus conspexit Eous,\n        Hanc rediens sero vespere vidit anum.\"\n\n       \"She that was erst a maid as fresh as May,\n        Is now an old crone, time so steals away.\"\n\nLet them take time then while they may, make advantage of youth, and as he\nprescribes,\n\n[5881] \"Collige virgo rosas dum flos novus et nova pubes,\n        Et memor esto aevum sic properare tuum.\"\n\n       \"Fair maids, go gather roses in the prime,\n        And think that as a flower so goes on time.\"\n\nLet's all love, _dum vires annique sinunt_, while we are in the flower of\nyears, fit for love matters, and while time serves: for\n\n[5882] \"Soles occidere et redire possunt,\n        Nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux,\n        Nox est perpetuo una dormienda.\"\n\n[5883] \"Suns that set may rise again,\n        But if once we loss this light,\n        'Tis with us perpetual night.\"\n\n_Volat irrevocabile tempus_, time past cannot be recalled. But we need no\nsuch exhortation, we are all commonly too forward: yet if there be any\nescape, and all be not as it should, as Diogenes struck the father when the\nson swore, because he taught him no better, if a maid or young man\nmiscarry, I think their parents oftentimes, guardians, overseers,\ngovernors, _neque vos_ (saith [5884]Chrysostom) _a supplicio immunes\nevadetis, si non statim ad nuptias_, &c. are in as much fault, and as\nseverely to be punished as their children, in providing for them no sooner.\n\nNow for such as have free liberty to bestow themselves, I could wish that\ngood counsel of the comical old man were put in practice,\n\n[5885] \"Opulentiores pauperiorum ut filias\n        Indotas dicant uxores domum:\n        Et multo fiet civitas concordior,\n        Et invidia nos minore utemur, quam utimur.\"\n\n       \"That rich men would marry poor maidens some,\n        And that without dowry, and so bring them home,\n        So would much concord be in our city,\n        Less envy should we have, much more pity.\"\n\nIf they would care less for wealth, we should have much more content and\nquietness in a commonwealth. Beauty, good bringing up, methinks, is a\nsufficient portion of itself, [5886]_Dos est sua forma puellis_, \"her\nbeauty is a maiden's dower,\" and he doth well that will accept of such a\nwife. Eubulides, in [5887]Aristaenetus, married a poor man's child, _facie\nnon illaetabili_, of a merry countenance, and heavenly visage, in pity of\nher estate, and that quickly. Acontius coming to Delos, to sacrifice to\nDiana, fell in love with Cydippe, a noble lass, and wanting means to get\nher love, flung a golden apple into her lap, with this inscription upon it,\n\n       \"Juro tibi sane per mystica sacra Dianae,\n        Me tibi venturum comitem, sponsumque futurum.\"\n\n       \"I swear by all the rites of Diana,\n        I'll come and be thy husband if I may.\"\n\nShe considered of it, and upon some small inquiry of his person and estate,\nwas married unto him.\n\n       \"Blessed is the wooing,\n        That is not long a doing.\"\n\nAs the saying is; when the parties are sufficiently known to each other,\nwhat needs such scrupulosity, so many circumstances? dost thou know her\nconditions, her bringing-up, like her person? let her means be what they\nwill, take her without any more ado. [5888]Dido and Aeneas were\naccidentally driven by a storm both into one cave, they made a match upon\nit; Massinissa was married to that fair captive Sophonisba, King Syphax'\nwife, the same day that he saw her first, to prevent Scipio Laelius, lest\nthey should determine otherwise of her. If thou lovest the party, do as\nmuch: good education and beauty is a competent dowry, stand not upon money.\n_Erant olim aurei homines_ (saith Theocritus) _et adamantes redamabant_, in\nthe golden world men did so, (in the reign of [5889]Ogyges belike, before\nstaggering Ninus began to domineer) if all be true that is reported: and\nsome few nowadays will do as much, here and there one; 'tis well done\nmethinks, and all happiness befall them for so doing. [5890]Leontius, a\nphilosopher of Athens, had a fair daughter called Athenais, _multo corporis\nlepore ac Venere_, (saith mine author) of a comely carriage, he gave her no\nportion but her bringing up, _occulto formae, praesagio_, out of some\nsecret foreknowledge of her fortune, bestowing that little which he had\namongst his other children. But she, thus qualified, was preferred by some\nfriends to Constantinople, to serve Pulcheria, the emperor's sister, of\nwhom she was baptised and called Eudocia. Theodosius, the emperor, in short\nspace took notice of her excellent beauty and good parts, and a little\nafter, upon his sister's sole commendation, made her his wife: 'twas nobly\ndone of Theodosius. [5891]Rudophe was the fairest lady in her days in all\nEgypt; she went to wash her, and by chance, (her maids meanwhile looking\nbut carelessly to her clothes) an eagle stole away one of her shoes, and\nlaid it in Psammeticus the King of Egypt's lap at Memphis: he wondered at\nthe excellency of the shoe and pretty foot, but more _Aquilae, factum_, at\nthe manner of the bringing of it: and caused forthwith proclamation to be\nmade, that she that owned that shoe should come presently to his court; the\nvirgin came, and was forthwith married to the king. I say this was\nheroically done, and like a prince: I commend him for it, and all such as\nhave means, that will either do (as he did) themselves, or so for love,\n&c., marry their children. If he be rich, let him take such a one as wants,\nif she be virtuously given; for as Siracides, cap. 7. ver. 19. adviseth,\n\"Forego not a wife and good woman; for her grace is above gold.\" If she\nhave fortunes of her own, let her make a man. Danaus of Lacedaemon had a\nmany daughters to bestow, and means enough for them all, he never stood\ninquiring after great matches, as others used to do, but [5892]sent for a\ncompany of brave young gallants to his house, and bid his daughters choose\nevery one one, whom she liked best, and take him for her husband, without\nany more ado. This act of his was much approved in those times. But in this\niron age of ours, we respect riches alone, (for a maid must buy her husband\nnow with a great dowry, if she will have him) covetousness and filthy lucre\nmars all good matches, or some such by-respects. Crales, a Servian prince\n(as Nicephorus Gregoras _Rom. hist. lib. 6._ relates it,) was an earnest\nsuitor to Eudocia, the emperor's sister; though her brother much desired\nit, yet she could not [5893]abide him, for he had three former wives, all\nbasely abused; but the emperor still, _Cralis amicitiam magni faciens_,\nbecause he was a great prince, and a troublesome neighbour, much desired\nhis affinity, and to that end betrothed his own daughter Simonida to him, a\nlittle girl five years of age (he being forty-five,) and five [5894]years\nolder than the emperor himself: such disproportionable and unlikely matches\ncan wealth and a fair fortune make. And yet not that alone, it is not only\nmoney, but sometimes vainglory, pride, ambition, do as much harm as\nwretched covetousness itself in another extreme. If a yeoman have one sole\ndaughter, he must overmatch her, above her birth and calling, to a\ngentleman forsooth, because of her great portion, too good for one of her\nown rank, as he supposeth: a gentleman's daughter and heir must be married\nto a knight baronet's eldest son at least; and a knight's only daughter to\na baron himself, or an earl, and so upwards, her great dower deserves it.\nAnd thus striving for more honour to their wealth, they undo their\nchildren, many discontents follow, and oftentimes they ruinate their\nfamilies. [5895]Paulus Jovius gives instance in Galeatius the Second, that\nheroical Duke of Milan, _externas affinitates, decoras quidem regio fastu,\nsed sibi et posteris damnosas et fere exitiales quaesivit_; he married his\neldest son John Galeatius to Isabella the King of France his sister, but\nshe was _socero tam gravis, ut ducentis millibus aureorum constiterit_, her\nentertainment at Milan was so costly that it almost undid him. His daughter\nViolanta was married to Lionel Duke of Clarence, the youngest son to Edward\nthe Third, King of England, but, _ad ejus adventum tantae opes tam\nadmirabili liberalitate profusae sunt, ut opulentissimorum regum splendorem\nsuperasse videretur_, he was welcomed with such incredible magnificence,\nthat a king's purse was scarce able to bear it; for besides many rich\npresents of horses, arms, plate, money, jewels, &c., he made one dinner for\nhim and his company, in which were thirty-two messes and as much provision\nleft, _ut relatae a mensa dapes decem millibus hominum sufficerent_, as\nwould serve ten thousand men: but a little after Lionel died, _novae nuptae\net intempestivis conviviis operam dans_, &c., and to the duke's great loss,\nthe solemnity was ended. So can titles, honours, ambition, make many brave,\nbut unfortunate matches of all sides for by-respects, (though both crazed\nin body and mind, most unwilling, averse, and often unfit,) so love is\nbanished, and we feel the smart of it in the end. But I am too lavish\nperadventure in this subject.\n\nAnother let or hindrance is strict and severe discipline, laws and rigorous\ncustoms, that forbid men to marry at set times, and in some places; as\napprentices, servants, collegiates, states of lives in copyholds, or in\nsome base inferior offices, [5896]_Velle licet_ in such cases, _potiri non\nlicet_, as he said. They see but as prisoners through a grate, they covet\nand catch, but _Tantalus a labris_, &c. Their love is lost, and vain it is\nin such an estate to attempt. [5897]_Gravissimum est adamare nec potiri_,\n'tis a grievous thing to love and not enjoy. They may, indeed, I deny not,\nmarry if they will, and have free choice, some of them; but in the meantime\ntheir case is desperate, _Lupum auribus tenent_, they hold a wolf by the\nears, they must either burn or starve. 'Tis _cornutum sophisma_, hard to\nresolve, if they marry they forfeit their estates, they are undone, and\nstarve themselves through beggary and want: if they do not marry, in this\nheroical passion they furiously rage, are tormented, and torn in pieces by\ntheir predominate affections. Every man hath not the gift of continence,\nlet him [5898]pray for it then, as Beza adviseth in his Tract _de\nDivortiis_, because God hath so called him to a single life, in taking away\nthe means of marriage. [5899]Paul would have gone from Mysia to Bithynia,\nbut the spirit suffered him not, and thou wouldst peradventure be a married\nman with all thy will, but that protecting angel holds it not fit. The\ndevil too sometimes may divert by his ill suggestions, and mar many good\nmatches, as the same [5900]Paul was willing to see the Romans, but hindered\nof Satan he could not. There be those that think they are necessitated by\nfate, their stars have so decreed, and therefore they grumble at their hard\nfortune, they are well inclined to marry, but one rub or other is ever in\nthe way; I know what astrologers say in this behalf, what Ptolemy\n_quadripartit. Tract. 4. cap. 4._ Skoner _lib. 1. cap. 12._ what Leovitius\n_genitur. exempl. 1._ which Sextus ab Heminga takes to be the horoscope of\nHieronymus Wolfius, what Pezelius, Origanaus and Leovitius his illustrator\nGarceus, _cap. 12._ what Junctine, Protanus, Campanella, what the rest, (to\nomit those Arabian conjectures _a parte conjugii, a parte lasciviae,\ntriplicitates veneris_, &c., and those resolutions upon a question, _an\namica potiatur_, &c.) determine in this behalf, viz. _an sit natus conjugem\nhabiturus, facile an difficulter sit sponsam impetraturus, quot conjuges,\nquo tempore, quales decernantur nato uxores, de mutuo amore conjugem_, both\nin men's and women's genitures, by the examination of the seventh house the\nalmutens, lords and planets there, _a [Symbol: Sun]d et [Symbol:\nMoon-3/4]a_ &c., by particular aphorisms, _Si dominus 7'mae in 7'ma vel\nsecunda nobilem decernit uxorem, servam aut ignobilem si duodecima. Si\nVenus in 12'ma, &c., with many such, too tedious to relate. Yet let no man\nbe troubled, or find himself grieved with such predictions, as Hier.\nWolfius well saith in his astrological [5901]dialogue, _non sunt\npraetoriana decreta_, they be but conjectures, the stars incline, but not\nenforce,\n\n[5902] \"Sidera corporibus praesunt caelestia nostris,\n        Sunt ea de vili condita namque luto:\n        Cogere sed nequeunt animum ratione fruentem,\n        Quippe sub imperio solius ipse dei est.\"\n\nwisdom, diligence, discretion, may mitigate if not quite alter such\ndecrees, _Fortuna sua a cujusque fingitur moribus_, [5903]_Qui cauti,\nprudentes, voti compotes_, &c., let no man then be terrified or molested\nwith such astrological aphorisms, or be much moved, either to vain hope or\nfear, from such predictions, but let every man follow his own free will in\nthis case, and do as he sees cause. Better it is indeed to marry than burn,\nfor their soul's health, but for their present fortunes, by some other\nmeans to pacify themselves, and divert the stream of this fiery torrent, to\ncontinue as they are, [5904]rest satisfied, _lugentes virginitatis florem\nsic aruisse_, deploring their misery with that eunuch in Libanius, since\nthere is no help or remedy, and with Jephtha's daughter to bewail their\nvirginities.\n\nOf like nature is superstition, those rash vows of monks and friars, and\nsuch as live in religious orders, but far more tyrannical and much worse.\nNature, youth, and his furious passion forcibly inclines, and rageth on the\none side; but their order and vow checks them on the other. [5905]_Votoque\nsuo sua forma repugnat._ What merits and indulgences they heap unto\nthemselves by it, what commodities, I know not; but I am sure, from such\nrash vows, and inhuman manner of life, proceed many inconveniences, many\ndiseases, many vices, mastupration, satyriasis, [5906]priapismus,\nmelancholy, madness, fornication, adultery, buggery, sodomy, theft, murder,\nand all manner of mischiefs: read but Bale's Catalogue of Sodomites, at the\nvisitation of abbeys here in England, Henry Stephan. his Apol. for\nHerodotus, that which Ulricus writes in one of his epistles, [5907]\"that\nPope Gregory when he saw 600 skulls and bones of infants taken out of a\nfishpond near a nunnery, thereupon retracted that decree of priests'\nmarriages, which was the cause of such a slaughter, was much grieved at it,\nand purged himself by repentance.\" Read many such, and then ask what is to\nbe done, is this vow to be broke or not? No, saith Bellarmine, _cap. 38.\nlib. de Monach._ _melius est scortari et uri quam de voto coelibatus ad\nnuptias transire_, better burn or fly out, than to break thy vow. And\nCoster in his _Enchirid. de coelibat. sacerdotum_, saith it is absolutely\n_gravius peccatum_, [5908]\"a greater sin for a priest to marry, than to\nkeep a concubine at home.\" Gregory de Valence, _cap. 6. de coelibat._\nmaintains the same, as those of Essei and Montanists of old. Insomuch that\nmany votaries, out of a false persuasion of merit and holiness in this\nkind, will sooner die than marry, though it be to the saving of their\nlives. [5909]Anno 1419. Pius 2, Pope, James Rossa, nephew to the King of\nPortugal, and then elect Archbishop of Lisbon, being very sick at Florence,\n[5910]\"when his physicians told him, that his disease was such, he must\neither lie with a wench, marry, or die, cheerfully chose to die.\" Now they\ncommended him for it; but St. Paul teacheth otherwise, \"Better marry than\nburn,\" and as St. Hierome gravely delivers it, _Aliae, sunt leges Caesarum,\naliae Christi, aliud Papinianus, aliud Paulus noster praecipit_, there's a\ndifference betwixt God's ordinances and men's laws: and therefore Cyprian\n_Epist. 8._ boldly denounceth, _impium est, adulterum est, sacrilegum est,\nquodcunque humano furore statuitur, ut dispositio divina violetur_, it is\nabominable, impious, adulterous, and sacrilegious, what men make and ordain\nafter their own furies to cross God's laws. [5911]Georgius Wicelius, one of\ntheir own arch divines (_Inspect. eccles. pag. 18_) exclaims against it,\nand all such rash monastical vows, and would have such persons seriously to\nconsider what they do, whom they admit, _ne in posterum querantur de\ninanibus stupris_, lest they repent it at last. For either, as he follows\nit, [5912]you must allow them concubines, or suffer them to marry, for\nscarce shall you find three priests of three thousand, _qui per aetatem non\nament_, that are not troubled with burning lust. Wherefore I conclude it is\nan unnatural and impious thing to bar men of this Christian liberty, too\nsevere and inhuman an edict.\n\n[5913] _The silly wren, the titmouse also,\n        The little redbreast have their election,\n        They fly I saw and together gone,\n        Whereas hem list, about environ\n        As they of kinde have inclination,\n        And as nature impress and guide,\n        Of everything list to provide.\n\n        But man alone, alas the hard stond,\n        Full cruelly by kinds ordinance\n        Constrained is, and by statutes bound,\n        And debarred from all such pleasance:\n        What meaneth this, what is this pretence\n        Of laws, I wis, against all right of kinde\n        Without a cause, so narrow men to binde?_\n\nMany laymen repine still at priests' marriages above the rest, and not at\nclergymen only, but of all the meaner sort and condition, they would have\nnone marry but such as are rich and able to maintain wives, because their\nparish belike shall be pestered with orphans, and the world full of\nbeggars: but [5914]these are hard-hearted, unnatural, monsters of men,\nshallow politicians, they do not [5915]consider that a great part of the\nworld is not yet inhabited as it ought, how many colonies into America,\nTerra Australis incognita, Africa, may be sent? Let them consult with Sir\nWilliam Alexander's Book of Colonies, Orpheus Junior's Golden Fleece,\nCaptain Whitburne, Mr. Hagthorpe, &c. and they shall surely be otherwise\ninformed. Those politic Romans were of another mind, they thought their\ncity and country could never be too populous. [5916]Adrian the emperor said\nhe had rather have men than money, _malle se hominum adjectione ampliare\nimperium, quam pecunia_. Augustus Caesar made an oration in Rome _ad\ncaelibus_, to persuade them to marry; some countries compelled them to\nmarry of old, as [5917]Jews, Turks, Indians, Chinese, amongst the rest in\nthese days, who much wonder at our discipline to suffer so many idle\npersons to live in monasteries, and often marvel how they can live honest.\n[5918]In the isle of Maragnan, the governor and petty king there did wonder\nat the Frenchmen, and admire how so many friars, and the rest of their\ncompany could live without wives, they thought it a thing impossible, and\nwould not believe it. If these men should but survey our multitudes of\nreligious houses, observe our numbers of monasteries all over Europe, 18\nnunneries in Padua, in Venice 34 cloisters of monks, 28 of nuns, &c. _ex\nungue leonem_, 'tis to this proportion, in all other provinces and cities,\nwhat would they think, do they live honest? Let them dissemble as they\nwill, I am of Tertullian's mind, that few can continue but by compulsion.\n[5919]\"O chastity\" (saith he) \"thou art a rare goddess in the world, not so\neasily got, seldom continuate: thou mayst now and then be compelled, either\nfor defect of nature, or if discipline persuade, decrees enforce:\" or for\nsome such by-respects, sullenness, discontent, they have lost their first\nloves, may not have whom they will themselves, want of means, rash vows,\n&c. But can he willingly contain? I think not. Therefore, either out of\ncommiseration of human imbecility, in policy, or to prevent a far worse\ninconvenience, for they hold some of them as necessary as meat and drink,\nand because vigour of youth, the state and temper of most men's bodies do\nso furiously desire it, they have heretofore in some nations liberally\nadmitted polygamy and stews, a hundred thousand courtesans in Grand Cairo\nin Egypt, as [5920]Radzivilus observes, are tolerated, besides boys: how\nmany at Fez, Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, &c., and still in many other\nprovinces and cities of Europe they do as much, because they think young\nmen, churchmen, and servants amongst the rest, can hardly live honest. The\nconsideration of this belike made Vibius, the Spaniard, when his friend\n[5921]Crassus, that rich Roman gallant, lay hid in the cave, _ut voluptatis\nquam aetas illa desiderat copiam faceret_, to gratify him the more, send\ntwo [5922]lusty lasses to accompany him all that while he was there\nimprisoned, And Surenus, the Parthian general, when he warred against the\nRomans, to carry about with him 200 concubines, as the Swiss soldiers do\nnow commonly their wives. But, because this course is not generally\napproved, but rather contradicted as unlawful and abhorred, [5923]in most\ncountries they do much encourage them to marriage, give great rewards to\nsuch as have many children, and mulct those that will not marry, _Jus trium\nliberorum_, and in Agellius, _lib. 2. cap. 15._ Elian. _lib. 6. cap. 5._\nValerius, _lib. 1. cap. 9._ [5924]We read that three children freed the\nfather from painful offices, and five from all contribution. \"A woman shall\nbe saved by bearing children.\" Epictetus would have all marry, and as\n[5925]Plato will, _6 de legibus_, he that marrieth not before 35 years of\nhis age, must be compelled and punished, and the money consecrated to\n[5926]Juno's temple, or applied to public uses. They account him, in some\ncountries, unfortunate that dies without a wife, a most unhappy man, as\n[5927]Boethius infers, and if at all happy, yet _infortunio felix_, unhappy\nin his supposed happiness. They commonly deplore his estate, and much\nlament him for it: O, my sweet son, &c. See Lucian, _de Luctu_, Sands _fol.\n83_, &c.\n\nYet, notwithstanding, many with us are of the opposite part, they are\nmarried themselves, and for others, let them burn, fire and flame, they\ncare not, so they be not troubled with them. Some are too curious, and some\ntoo covetous, they may marry when they will both for ability and means, but\nso nice, that except as Theophilus the emperor was presented, by his mother\nEuprosune, with all the rarest beauties of the empire in the great chamber\nof his palace at once, and bid to give a golden apple to her he liked best.\nIf they might so take and choose whom they list out of all the fair maids\ntheir nation affords, they could happily condescend to marry: otherwise,\n&c., why should a man marry, saith another epicurean rout, what's matrimony\nbut a matter of money? why should free nature be entrenched on, confined or\nobliged, to this or that man or woman, with these manacles of body and\ngoods? &c. There are those too that dearly love, admire and follow women\nall their lives long, _sponsi Penelopes_, never well but in their company,\nwistly gazing on their beauties, observing close, hanging after them,\ndallying still with them, and yet dare not, will not marry. Many poor\npeople, and of the meaner sort, are too distrustful of God's providence,\n\"they will not, dare not for such worldly respects,\" fear of want, woes,\nmiseries, or that they shall light, as [5928]\"Lemnius saith, on a scold, a\nslut, or a bad wife.\" And therefore, [5929]_Tristem Juventam venere deserta\ncolunt_, they are resolved to live single, as [5930]Epaminondas did,\n[5931]_Nil ait esse prius, melius nil coelibe vita_, and ready with\nHippolitus to abjure all women, [5932]_Detestor omnes, horreo, fugio,\nexecror_, &c. But,\n\n       \"Hippolite nescis quod fugis vitae bonum,\n        Hippolite nescis\"------\n\n\"alas, poor Hippolitus, thou knowest not what thou sayest, 'tis otherwise,\nHippolitus.\" [5933]Some make a doubt, _an uxor literato sit ducenda_,\nwhether a scholar should marry, if she be fair she will bring him back from\nhis grammar to his horn book, or else with kissing and dalliance she will\nhinder his study; if foul with scolding, he cannot well intend to do both,\nas Philippus Beroaldus, that great Bononian doctor, once writ, _impediri\nenim studia literarum_, &c., but he recanted at last, and in a solemn sort\nwith true conceived words he did ask the world and all women forgiveness.\nBut you shall have the story as he relates himself, in his Commentaries on\nthe sixth of Apuleius. For a long time I lived a single life, _et ab uxore\nducenda semper abhorrui, nec quicquam libero lecto censui jucundius_. I\ncould not abide marriage, but as a rambler, _erraticus ac volaticus amator_\n(to use his own words) _per multiplices amores discurrebam_, I took a\nsnatch where I could get it; nay more, I railed at marriage downright, and\nin a public auditory, when I did interpret that sixth Satire of Juvenal,\nout of Plutarch and Seneca, I did heap up all the dicteries I could against\nwomen; but now recant with Stesichorus, _palinodiam cano, nec poenitet\ncenseri in ordine maritorum_, I approve of marriage, I am glad I am a\n[5934]married man, I am heartily glad I have a wife, so sweet a wife, so\nnoble a wife, so young, so chaste a wife, so loving a wife, and I do wish\nand desire all other men to marry; and especially scholars, that as of old\nMartia did by Hortensius, Terentia by Tullius, Calphurnia to Plinius,\nPudentilla to Apuleius, [5935]hold the candle whilst their husbands did\nmeditate and write, so theirs may do them, and as my dear Camilla doth to\nme. Let other men be averse, rail then and scoff at women, and say what\nthey can to the contrary, _vir sine uxore malorum expers est_, &c., a\nsingle man is a happy man, &c., but this is a toy. [5936]_Nec dulces amores\nsperne puer, neque tu choreas_; these men are too distrustful and much to\nblame, to use such speeches, [5937]_Parcite paucorum diffundere, crimen in\nomnes_. \"They must not condemn all for some.\" As there be many bad, there\nbe some good wives; as some be vicious, some be virtuous. Read what Solomon\nhath said in their praises, Prov. xiii. and Siracides, cap. 26 et 30,\n\"Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days\nshall be double. A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and she shall\nfulfil the years of his life in peace. A good wife is a good portion\" (and\nxxxvi. 24), \"an help, a pillar of rest,\" _columina quietis_, [5938] _Qui\ncapit uxorem, fratrem capit atque sororem_. And 30, \"He that hath no wife\nwandereth to and fro mourning.\" _Minuuntur atrae conjuge curae_, women are\nthe sole, only joy, and comfort of a man's life, born _ad usum et lusum\nhominum, firmamenta familiae_,\n\n[5939] \"Delitiae humani generis, solatia vitae.\n        Blanditiae noctis, placidissima cura diei,\n        Vota virum, juvenum spes,\" &c.\n\n[5940]\"A wife is a young man's mistress, a middle age's companion, an old\nman's nurse:\" _Particeps laetorum et tristium_, a prop, a help, &c.\n\n[5941] \"Optima viri possessio est uxor benevola,\n        Mitigans iram et avertens animam ejus a tristitia.\"\n\n       \"Man's best possession is a loving wife,\n        She tempers anger and diverts all strife.\"\n\nThere is no joy, no comfort, no sweetness, no pleasure in the world like to\nthat of a good wife,\n\n[5942] \"Quam cum chara domi conjux, fidusque maritus\n        Unanimes degunt\"------\n\nsaith our Latin Homer, she is still the same in sickness and in health, his\neye, his hand, his bosom friend, his partner at all times, his other self,\nnot to be separated by any calamity, but ready to share all sorrow,\ndiscontent, and as the Indian women do, live and die with him, nay more, to\ndie presently for him. Admetus, king of Thessaly, when he lay upon his\ndeath-bed, was told by Apollo's Oracle, that if he could get anybody to die\nfor him, he should live longer yet, but when all refused, his parents,\n_etsi decrepiti_, friends and followers forsook him, Alcestus, his wife,\nthough young, most willingly undertook it; what more can be desired or\nexpected? And although on the other side there be an infinite number of bad\nhusbands (I should rail downright against some of them), able to discourage\nany women; yet there be some good ones again, and those most observant of\nmarriage rites. An honest country fellow (as Fulgosus relates it) in the\nkingdom of Naples, [5943]at plough by the seaside, saw his wife carried\naway by Mauritanian pirates, he ran after in all haste, up to the chin\nfirst, and when he could wade no longer, swam, calling to the governor of\nthe ship to deliver his wife, or if he must not have her restored, to let\nhim follow as a prisoner, for he was resolved to be a galley-slave, his\ndrudge, willing to endure any misery, so that he might but enjoy his dear\nwife. The Moors seeing the man's constancy, and relating the whole matter\nto their governors at Tunis, set them both free, and gave them an honest\npension to maintain themselves during their lives. I could tell many\nstories to this effect; but put case it often prove otherwise, because\nmarriage is troublesome, wholly therefore to avoid it, is no argument;\n[5944]\"He that will avoid trouble must avoid the world.\" (Eusebius\n_praepar. Evangel. 5. cap. 50._) Some trouble there is in marriage I deny\nnot, _Etsi grave sit matrimonium_, saith Erasmus, _edulcatur tamen multis_,\n&c., yet there be many things to [5945]sweeten it, a pleasant wife,\n_placens uxor_, pretty children, _dulces nati, deliciae filiorum hominum_,\nthe chief delight of the sons of men; Eccles. ii. 8. &c. And howsoever\nthough it were all troubles, [5946]_utilitatis publicae causa devorandum,\ngrave quid libenter subeundum_, it must willingly be undergone for public\ngood's sake,\n\n[5947] \"Audite (populus) haec, inquit Susarion,\n        Malae sunt mulieres, veruntamen O populares,\n        Hoc sine malo domum inhabitare non licet.\"\n\n       \"Hear me, O my countrymen, saith Susarion,\n        Women are naught, yet no life without one.\"\n\n[5948]_Malum est mulier, sed necessarium malum._ They are necessary evils,\nand for our own ends we must make use of them to have issue, [5949]\n_Supplet Venus ac restituit humanum genus_, and to propagate the church.\nFor to what end is a man born? why lives he, but to increase the world? and\nhow shall he do that well, if he do not marry? _Matrimonium humano generi\nimmortalitatem tribuit_, saith Nevisanus, matrimony makes us immortal, and\naccording to [5950]Tacitus, 'tis _firmissimum imperii munimentum_, the sole\nand chief prop of an empire. [5951]_Indigne vivit per quem non vivit et\nalter_, [5952]which Pelopidas objected to Epaminondas, he was an unworthy\nmember of a commonwealth, that left not a child after him to defend it, and\nas [5953]Trismegistus to his son Tatius, \"have no commerce with a single\nman:\" Holding belike that a bachelor could not live honestly as he should,\nand with Georgius Wicelius, a great divine and holy man, who of late by\ntwenty-six arguments commends marriage as a thing most necessary for all\nkinds of persons, most laudable and fit to be embraced: and is persuaded\nwithal, that no man can live and die religiously, and as he ought, without\na wife, _persuasus neminem posse neque pie vivere, neque bene mori citra\nuxorem_, he is false, an enemy to the commonwealth, injurious to himself,\ndestructive to the world, an apostate to nature, a rebel against heaven and\nearth. Let our wilful, obstinate, and stale bachelors ruminate of this, \"If\nwe could live without wives,\" as Marcellus Numidicus said in [5954]\nAgellius, \"we would all want them; but because we cannot, let all marry,\nand consult rather to the public good, than their own private pleasure or\nestate.\" It were an happy thing, as wise [5955]Euripides hath it, if we\ncould buy children with gold and silver, and be so provided, _sine mulierum\ncongressu_, without women's company; but that may not be:\n\n[5956] \"Orbis jacebit squallido turpis situ,\n        Vanum sine ullis classibus stabit mare,\n        Alesque coelo deerit et sylvis fera.\"\n\n       \"Earth, air, sea, land eftsoon would come to nought,\n        The world itself should be to ruin brought.\"\n\nNecessity therefore compels us to marry.\n\nBut what do I trouble myself, to find arguments to persuade to, or commend\nmarriage? behold a brief abstract of all that which I have said, and much\nmore, succinctly, pithily, pathetically, perspicuously, and elegantly\ndelivered in twelve motions to mitigate the miseries of marriage, by [5957]\nJacobus de Voragine,\n\n_1. Res est? habes quae tucatur et augeat.--2. Non est? habes quae\nquaerat.--3. Secundae res sunt? felicitas duplicatur.--4. Adversae sunt?\nConsolatur, adsidet, onus participat ut tolerabile fiat.--5. Domi es?\nsolitudinis taedium pellit.--6. Foras? Discendentem visu prosequitur,\nabsentem desiderat, redeuntem laeta excipit.--7. Nihil jucundum absque\nsocietate? Nulla societas matrimonio suavior.--8. Vinculum conjugalis\ncharitatis adamentinum.--9. Accrescit dulcis affinium turba, duplicatur\nnumerus parentum, fratrum, sororum, nepotum.--10. Pulchra sis prole\nparens.--11. Lex Mosis sterilitatem matrimonii execratur, quanto amplius\ncoelibatum?--12. Si natura poenam non effugit, ne voluntas quidem\neffugiet_.\n\n1. Hast thou means? thou hast none to keep and increase it.--2. Hast none?\nthou hast one to help to get it.--3. Art in prosperity? thine happiness is\ndoubled.--4. Art in adversity? she'll comfort, assist, bear a part of thy\nburden to make it more tolerable.--5. Art at home? she'll drive away\nmelancholy.--6. Art abroad? she looks after thee going from home, wishes\nfor thee in thine absence, and joyfully welcomes thy return.--7. There's\nnothing delightsome without society, no society so sweet as matrimony.--8.\nThe band of conjugal love is adamantine.--9. The sweet company of kinsmen\nincreaseth, the number of parents is doubled, of brothers, sisters,\nnephews.--10. Thou art made a father by a fair and happy issue.--11. Moses\ncurseth the barrenness of matrimony, how much more a single life?--12. If\nnature escape not punishment, surely thy will shall not avoid it.\n\nAll this is true, say you, and who knows it not? but how easy a matter is\nit to answer these motives, and to make an _Antiparodia_ quite opposite\nunto it? To exercise myself I will essay:\n\n1. Hast thou means? thou hast one to spend it.--2. Hast none? thy beggary\nis increased.--3. Art in prosperity? thy happiness is ended.--4. Art in\nadversity? like Job's wife she'll aggravate thy misery, vex thy soul, make\nthy burden intolerable.--5. Art at home? she'll scold thee out of\ndoors.--6. Art abroad? If thou be wise keep thee so, she'll perhaps graft\nhorns in thine absence, scowl on thee coming home.--7. Nothing gives more\ncontent than solitariness, no solitariness like this of a single life,--8.\nThe band of marriage is adamantine, no hope of losing it, thou art\nundone.--9. Thy number increaseth, thou shalt be devoured by thy wife's\nfriends.--10. Thou art made a cornuto by an unchaste wife, and shalt bring\nup other folks' children instead of thine own.--11. Paul commends marriage,\nyet he prefers a single life.--12. Is marriage honourable? What an immortal\ncrown belongs to virginity?\n\nSo Siracides himself speaks as much as may be for and against women, so\ndoth almost every philosopher plead pro and con, every poet thus argues the\ncase (though what cares _vulgus nominum_ what they say?): so can I conceive\nperadventure, and so canst thou: when all is said, yet since some be good,\nsome bad, let's put it to the venture. I conclude therefore with Seneca,\n\n        ------\"cur Toro viduo jaces?\n        Tristem juventam solve: mine luxus rape,\n        Effunde habenas, optimos vitae dies\n        Effluere prohibe.\"\n\n\"Why dost thou lie alone, let thy youth and best days to pass away?\" Marry\nwhilst thou mayst, _donec viventi canities abest morosa_, whilst thou art\nyet able, yet lusty, [5958]_Elige cui dicas, tu mihi sola places_, make thy\nchoice, and that freely forthwith, make no delay, but take thy fortune as\nit falls. 'Tis true,\n\n[5959] \"--calamitosus est qui inciderit\n        In malam uxorem, felix qui in bonam,\"\n\n'Tis a hazard both ways I confess, to live single or to marry, [5960]_Nam\net uxorem ducere, et non ducere malum est_, it may be bad, it may be good,\nas it is a cross and calamity on the one side, so 'tis a sweet delight, an\nincomparable happiness, a blessed estate, a most unspeakable benefit, a\nsole content, on the other; 'tis all in the proof. Be not then so wayward,\nso covetous, so distrustful, so curious and nice, but let's all marry,\n_mutuos foventes amplexus_; \"Take me to thee, and thee to me,\" tomorrow is\nSt. Valentine's day, let's keep it holiday for Cupid's sake, for that great\ngod Love's sake, for Hymen's sake, and celebrate [5961]Venus' vigil with\nour ancestors for company together, singing as they did,\n\n       \"Crasam et qui nunquam amavit, quique amavit, eras amet,\n        Ver novum, ver jam canorum, ver natus orbis est,\n        Vere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites,\n        Et nemus coma resolvit, &c.------\n        Cras amet,\" &c.------\n\n       \"Let those love now who never loved before,\n        And those who always loved now love the more;\n        Sweet loves are born with every opening spring;\n        Birds from the tender boughs their pledges sing,\" &c.\n\nLet him that is averse from marriage read more in Barbarus _de re uxor.\nlib. 1. cap. 1._ Lemnius _de institut. cap. 4._ P.

God send us all good\nwives, every man his wish in this kind, and me mine!\n\n[5965] _And God that all this world hath ywrought\n        Send him his Love that hath it so deere bought_.\n\nIf all parties be pleased, ask their banns, 'tis a match.

[5972]_Hymen O Hymenae,\nHymen ades O Hymenaee!

III. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Jealousy, its Equivocations, Name, Definition, Extent,\nseveral kinds; of Princes, Parents, Friends. In Beasts, Men: before\nmarriage, as Co-rivals; or after, as in this place_.\n\nValescus de Taranta _cap. de Melanchol._ Aelian Montaltus, Felix Platerus,\nGuianerius, put jealousy for a cause of melancholy, others for a symptom;\nbecause melancholy persons amongst these passions and perturbations of the\nmind, are most obnoxious to it. But methinks for the latitude it hath, and\nthat prerogative above other ordinary symptoms, it ought to be treated of\nas a species apart, being of so great and eminent note, so furious a\npassion, and almost of as great extent as love itself, as [5982]Benedetto\nVarchi holds, \"no love without a mixture of jealousy,\" _qui non zelat, non\namat_. For these causes I will dilate, and treat of it by itself, as a\nbastard-branch or kind of love-melancholy, which, as heroical love goeth\ncommonly before marriage, doth usually follow, torture, and crucify in like\nsort, deserves therefore to be rectified alike, requires as much care and\nindustry, in setting out the several causes of it, prognostics and cures.\nWhich I have more willingly done, that he that is or hath been jealous, may\nsee his error as in a glass; he that is not, may learn to detest, avoid it\nhimself, and dispossess others that are anywise affected with it.\n\nJealousy is described and defined to be [5983]\"a certain suspicion which\nthe lover hath of the party he chiefly loveth, lest he or she should be\nenamoured of another:\" or any eager desire to enjoy some beauty alone, to\nhave it proper to himself only: a fear or doubt, lest any foreigner should\nparticipate or share with him in his love. Or (as [5984]Scaliger adds) \"a\nfear of losing her favour whom he so earnestly affects.\" Cardan calls it \"a\n[5985]zeal for love, and a kind of envy lest any man should beguile us.\"\n[5986]Ludovicus Vives defines it in the very same words, or little\ndiffering in sense.\n\nThere be many other jealousies, but improperly so called all; as that of\nparents, tutors, guardians over their children, friends whom they love, or\nsuch as are left to their wardship or protection.\n\n[5987] \"Storax non rediit hac nocte a coena Aeschinus,\n        Neque servulorum quispiam qui adversum ierant?\"\n\nAs the old man in the comedy cried out in a passion, and from a solicitous\nfear and care he had of his adopted son; [5988]\"not of beauty, but lest\nthey should miscarry, do amiss, or any way discredit, disgrace\" (as Vives\nnotes) \"or endanger themselves and us.\" [5989]Aegeus was so solicitous for\nhis son Theseus, (when he went to fight with the Minotaur) of his success,\nlest he should be foiled, [5990]_Prona est timori semper in pejus fides_.\nWe are still apt to suspect the worst in such doubtful cases, as many wives\nin their husband's absence, fond mothers in their children's, lest if\nabsent they should be misled or sick, and are continually expecting news\nfrom them, how they do fare, and what is become of them, they cannot endure\nto have them long out of their sight: oh my sweet son, O my dear child, &c.\nPaul was jealous over the Church of Corinth, as he confesseth, 2 Cor. xi.\n12. \"With a godly jealousy, to present them a pure virgin to Christ;\" and\nhe was afraid still, lest as the serpent beguiled Eve, through his\nsubtlety, so their minds should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in\nChrist. God himself, in some sense, is said to be jealous, [5991]\"I am a\njealous God, and will visit:\" so Psalm lxxix. 5. \"Shall thy jealousy burn\nlike fire for ever?\" But these are improperly called jealousies, and by a\nmetaphor, to show the care and solicitude they have of them. Although some\njealousies express all the symptoms of this which we treat of, fear,\nsorrow, anguish, anxiety, suspicion, hatred, &c., the object only varied.\nThat of some fathers is very eminent, to their sons and heirs; for though\nthey love them dearly being children, yet now coming towards man's estate\nthey may not well abide them, the son and heir is commonly sick of the\nfather, and the father again may not well brook his eldest son, _inde\nsimultates, plerumque contentiones et inimicitiae_; but that of princes is\nmost notorious, as when they fear co-rivals (if I may so call them)\nsuccessors, emulators, subjects, or such as they have offended. [5992]\n_Omnisque potestas impatiens consortis erit_: \"they are still suspicious,\nlest their authority should be diminished,\" [5993]as one observes; and as\nComineus hath it, [5994]\"it cannot be expressed what slender causes they\nhave of their grief and suspicion, a secret disease, that commonly lurks\nand breeds in princes' families.\" Sometimes it is for their honour only, as\nthat of Adrian the emperor, [5995]\"that killed all his emulators.\" Saul\nenvied David; Domitian Agricola, because he did excel him, obscure his\nhonour, as he thought, eclipse his fame. Juno turned Praetus' daughters\ninto kine, for that they contended with her for beauty; [5996]Cyparissae,\nking Eteocles' children, were envied of the goddesses for their excellent\ngood parts, and dancing amongst the rest, saith [5997]Constantine, \"and for\nthat cause flung headlong from heaven, and buried in a pit, but the earth\ntook pity of them, and brought out cypress trees to preserve their\nmemories.\" [5998]Niobe, Arachne, and Marsyas, can testify as much. But it\nis most grievous when it is for a kingdom itself, or matters of commodity,\nit produceth lamentable effects, especially amongst tyrants, _in despotico\nImperio_, and such as are more feared than beloved of their subjects, that\nget and keep their sovereignty by force and fear. [5999]_Quod civibus\ntenere te invitis scias_, &c., as Phalaris, Dionysius, Periander held\ntheirs. For though fear, cowardice, and jealousy, in Plutarch's opinion, be\nthe common causes of tyranny, as in Nero, Caligula, Tiberius, yet most take\nthem to be symptoms. For [6000]\"what slave, what hangman\" (as Bodine well\nexpresseth this passion, _l. 2. c. 5. de rep_.) \"can so cruelly torture a\ncondemned person, as this fear and suspicion? Fear of death, infamy,\ntorments, are those furies and vultures that vex and disquiet tyrants, and\ntorture them day and night, with perpetual terrors and affrights, envy,\nsuspicion, fear, desire of revenge, and a thousand such disagreeing\nperturbations, turn and affright the soul out of the hinges of health, and\nmore grievously wound and pierce, than those cruel masters can exasperate\nand vex their apprentices or servants, with clubs, whips, chains, and\ntortures.\" Many terrible examples we have in this kind, amongst the Turks\nespecially, many jealous outrages; [6001]Selimus killed Kornutus his\nyoungest brother, five of his nephews, Mustapha Bassa, and divers others.\n[6002]Bajazet the second Turk, jealous of the valour and greatness of\nAchmet Bassa, caused him to be slain. [6003]Suleiman the Magnificent\nmurdered his own son Mustapha; and 'tis an ordinary thing amongst them, to\nmake away their brothers, or any competitors, at the first coming to the\ncrown: 'tis all the solemnity they use at their fathers' funerals. What mad\npranks in his jealous fury did Herod of old commit in Jewry, when he\nmassacred all the children of a year old? [6004]Valens the emperor in\nConstantinople, when as he left no man alive of quality in his kingdom that\nhad his name begun with Theo; Theodoti, Theognosti, Theodosii, Theoduli,\n&c. They went all to their long home, because a wizard told him that name\nshould succeed in his empire. And what furious designs hath [6005]Jo.\nBasilius, that Muscovian tyrant, practised of late? It is a wonder to read\nthat strange suspicion, which Suetonius reports of Claudius Caesar, and of\nDomitian, they were afraid of every man they saw: and which Herodian of\nAntoninus and Geta, those two jealous brothers, the one could not endure so\nmuch as the other's servants, but made away him, his chiefest followers,\nand all that belonged to him, or were his well-wishers. [6006]Maximinus\n\"perceiving himself to be odious to most men, because he was come to that\nheight of honour out of base beginnings, and suspecting his mean parentage\nwould be objected to him, caused all the senators that were nobly\ndescended, to be slain in a jealous humour, turned all the servants of\nAlexander his predecessor out of doors, and slew many of them, because they\nlamented their master's death, suspecting them to be traitors, for the love\nthey bare to him.\" When Alexander in his fury had made Clitus his dear\nfriend to be put to death, and saw now (saith [6007]Curtius) an alienation\nin his subjects' hearts, none durst talk with him, he began to be jealous\nof himself, lest they should attempt as much on him, \"and said they lived\nlike so many wild beasts in a wilderness, one afraid of another.\" Our\nmodern stories afford us many notable examples. [6008]Henry the Third of\nFrance, jealous of Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, _anno_ 1588, caused\nhim to be murdered in his own chamber. [6009]Louis the Eleventh was so\nsuspicious, he durst not trust his children, every man about him he\nsuspected for a traitor; many strange tricks Comineus telleth of him. How\njealous was our Henry the [6010]Fourth of King Richard the Second, so long\nas he lived, after he was deposed? and of his own son Henry in his latter\ndays? which the prince well perceiving, came to visit his father in his\nsickness, in a watchet velvet gown, full of eyelet holes, and with needles\nsticking in them (as an emblem of jealousy), and so pacified his suspicious\nfather, after some speeches and protestations, which he had used to that\npurpose. Perpetual imprisonment, as that of Robert [6011]Duke of Normandy,\nin the days of Henry the First, forbidding of marriage to some persons,\nwith such like edicts and prohibitions, are ordinary in all states. In a\nword ([6012]as he said) three things cause jealousy, a mighty state, a rich\ntreasure, a fair wife; or where there is a cracked title, much tyranny, and\nexactions. In our state, as being freed from all these fears and miseries,\nwe may be most secure and happy under the reign of our fortunate prince:\n\n[6013] \"His fortune hath indebted him to none\n        But to all his people universally;\n        And not to them but for their love alone,\n        Which they account as placed worthily.\n        He is so set, he hath no cause to be\n        Jealous, or dreadful of disloyalty;\n        The pedestal whereon his greatness stands.\n        Is held of all our hearts, and all our hands.\"\n\nBut I rove, I confess. These equivocations, jealousies, and many such,\nwhich crucify the souls of men, are not here properly meant, or in this\ndistinction of ours included, but that alone which is for beauty, tending\nto love, and wherein they can brook no co-rival, or endure any\nparticipation: and this jealousy belongs as well to brute beasts, as men.\nSome creatures, saith [6014]Vives, swans, doves, cocks, bulls, &c., are\njealous as well as men, and as much moved, for fear of communion.\n\n[6015] \"Grege pro toto bella juvenci,\n        Si con jugio timuere suo,\n        Poscunt timidi praelia cervi,\n        Et mugitus dant concepti signa furoris.\"\n\n       \"In Venus' cause what mighty battles make\n        Your raving bulls, and stirs for their herd's sake:\n        And harts and bucks that are so timorous,\n        Will fight and roar, if once they be but jealous.\"\n\nIn bulls, horses, goats, this is most apparently discerned. Bulls\nespecially, _alium in pascuis non admittit_, he will not admit another bull\nto feed in the same pasture, saith [6016]Oppin: which Stephanus Bathorius,\nlate king of Poland, used as an impress, with that motto, _Regnum non capit\nduos_. R. T. in his Blazon of Jealousy, telleth a story of a swan about\nWindsor, that finding a strange cock with his mate, did swim I know not how\nmany miles after to kill him, and when he had so done, came back and killed\nhis hen; a certain truth, he saith, done upon Thames, as many watermen, and\nneighbour gentlemen, can tell. _Fidem suam liberet_; for my part, I do\nbelieve it may be true; for swans have ever been branded with that epithet\nof jealousy.\n\n[6017] _The jealous swanne against his death that singeth,\n        And eke the owle that of death bode bringeth_.\n\n[6018]Some say as much of elephants, that they are more jealous than any\nother creatures whatsoever; and those old Egyptians, as [6019]Pierius\ninformeth us, express in their hieroglyphics, the passion of jealousy by a\ncamel; [6020]because that fearing the worst still about matters of venery,\nhe loves solitudes, that he may enjoy his pleasure alone, _et in quoscunque\nobvios insurgit, Zelolypiae stimulis agitatus_, he will quarrel and fight\nwith whatsoever comes next, man or beast, in his jealous fits. I have read\nas much of [6021]crocodiles; and if Peter Martyr's authority be authentic,\n_legat. Babylonicae lib. 3._ you shall have a strange tale to that purpose\nconfidently related. Another story of the jealousy of dogs, see in Hieron.\nFabricius, _Tract. 3. cap. 5. de loquela animalium_.\n\nBut this furious passion is most eminent in men, and is as well amongst\nbachelors as married men. If it appear amongst bachelors, we commonly call\nthem rivals or co-rivals, a metaphor derived from a river, _rivales, a\n[6022]rivo_; for as a river, saith Acron in Hor. _Art. Poet._ and Donat in\nTer. _Eunuch._ divides a common ground between two men, and both\nparticipate of it, so is a woman indifferent between two suitors, both\nlikely to enjoy her; and thence comes this emulation, which breaks out many\ntimes into tempestuous storms, and produceth lamentable effects, murder\nitself, with much cruelty, many single combats. They cannot endure the\nleast injury done unto them before their mistress, and in her defence will\nbite off one another's noses; they are most impatient of any flout,\ndisgrace, lest emulation or participation in that kind. [6023]_Lacerat\nlacerium Largi mordax Memnius_. Memnius the Roman (as Tully tells the\nstory, _de oratore, lib. 2._), being co-rival with Largus Terracina, bit\nhim by the arm, which fact of his was so famous, that it afterwards grew to\na proverb in those parts. [6024]Phaedria could not abide his co-rival\nThraso; for when Parmeno demanded, _numquid aliud imperas_? whether he\nwould command him any more service: \"No more\" (saith he) \"but to speak in\nhis behalf, and to drive away his co-rival if he could.\" Constantine, in\nthe eleventh book of his husbandry, _cap. 11_, hath a pleasant tale of the\npine-tree; [6025]she was once a fair maid, whom Pineus and Boreas, two\nco-rivals, dearly sought; but jealous Boreas broke her neck, &c. And in his\neighteenth chapter he telleth another tale of [6026]Mars, that in his\njealousy slew Adonis. Petronius calleth this passion _amantium furiosum\naemulationem_, a furious emulation; and their symptoms are well expressed\nby Sir Geoffrey Chaucer in his first Canterbury Tale. It will make the\nnearest and dearest friends fall out; they will endure all other things to\nbe common, goods, lands, moneys, participate of each pleasure, and take in\ngood part any disgraces, injuries in another kind; but as Propertius well\ndescribes it in an elegy of his, in this they will suffer nothing, have no\nco-rivals.\n\n[6027] \"Tu mihi vel ferro pectus, vel perde veneno,\n          A domina tantum te modo tolle mea:\n        Te socium vitae te corporis esse licebit,\n          Te dominum admitto rebus amice meis.\n        Lecto te solum, lecto te deprecor uno,\n          Rivalem possum non ego ferre Jovem.\"\n\n       \"Stab me with sword, or poison strong\n          Give me to work my bane:\n        So thou court not my lass, so thou\n          From mistress mine refrain.\n        Command myself, my body, purse,\n          As thine own goods take all,\n        And as my ever dearest friend,\n          I ever use thee shall.\n        O spare my love, to have alone\n          Her to myself I crave,\n        Nay, Jove himself I'll not endure\n          My rival for to have.\"\n\nThis jealousy, which I am to treat of, is that which belongs to married\nmen, in respect of their own wives; to whose estate, as no sweetness,\npleasure, happiness can be compared in the world, if they live quietly and\nlovingly together; so if they disagree or be jealous, those bitter pills of\nsorrow and grief, disastrous mischiefs, mischances, tortures, gripings,\ndiscontents, are not to be separated from them. A most violent passion it\nis where it taketh place, an unspeakable torment, a hellish torture, an\ninfernal plague, as Ariosto calls it, \"a fury, a continual fever, full of\nsuspicion, fear, and sorrow, a martyrdom, a mirth-marring monster. The\nsorrow and grief of heart of one woman jealous of another, is heavier than\ndeath,\" Ecclus. xxviii. 6. as [6028]Peninnah did Hannah, \"vex her and\nupbraid her sore.\" 'Tis a main vexation, a most intolerable burden, a\ncorrosive to all content, a frenzy, a madness itself; as [6029]Beneditto\nVarchi proves out of that select sonnet of Giovanni de la Casa, that\nreverend lord, as he styles him.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Causes of Jealousy. Who are most apt. Idleness, melancholy,\nimpotency, long absence, beauty, wantonness, naught themselves.\nAllurements, from time, place, persons, bad usage, causes_.\n\nAstrologers make the stars a cause or sign of this bitter passion, and out\nof every man's horoscope will give a probable conjecture whether he will be\njealous or no, and at what time, by direction of the significators to their\nseveral promissors: their aphorisms are to be read in Albubater, Pontanus,\nSchoner, Junctine, &c. Bodine, _cap. 5. meth. hist._ ascribes a great cause\nto the country or clime, and discourseth largely there of this subject,\nsaying, that southern men are more hot, lascivious, and jealous, than such\nas live in the north; they can hardly contain themselves in those hotter\nclimes, but are most subject to prodigious lust. Leo Afer telleth\nincredible things almost, of the lust and jealousy of his countrymen of\nAfrica, and especially such as live about Carthage, and so doth every\ngeographer of them in [6030]Asia, Turkey, Spaniards, Italians. Germany hath\nnot so many drunkards, England tobacconists, France dancers, Holland\nmariners, as Italy alone hath jealous husbands. And in [6031]Italy some\naccount them of Piacenza more jealous than the rest. In [6032]Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Scandia, Poland, Muscovy, they are not so troubled with\nthis feral malady, although Damianus a Goes, which I do much wonder at, in\nhis topography of Lapland, and Herbastein of Russia, against the stream of\nall other geographers, would fasten it upon those northern inhabitants.\nAltomarius Poggius, and Munster in his description of Baden, reports that\nmen and women of all sorts go commonly into the baths together, without all\nsuspicion, \"the name of jealousy\" (saith Munster) \"is not so much as once\nheard of among them.\" In Friesland the women kiss him they drink to, and\nare kissed again of those they pledge. The virgins in Holland go hand in\nhand with young men from home, glide on the ice, such is their harmless\nliberty, and lodge together abroad without suspicion, which rash Sansovinus\nan Italian makes a great sign of unchastity. In France, upon small\nacquaintance, it is usual to court other men's wives, to come to their\nhouses, and accompany them arm in arm in the streets, without imputation.\nIn the most northern countries young men and maids familiarly dance\ntogether, men and their wives, [6033]which, Siena only excepted, Italians\nmay not abide. The [6034]Greeks, on the other side, have their private\nbaths for men and women, where they must not come near, nor so much as see\none another: and as [6035]Bodine observes _lib. 5. de repub._ \"the Italians\ncould never endure this,\" or a Spaniard, the very conceit of it would make\nhim mad: and for that cause they lock up their women, and will not suffer\nthem to be near men, so much as in the [6036]church, but with a partition\nbetween. He telleth, moreover, how that \"when he was ambassador in England,\nhe heard Mendoza the Spanish legate finding fault with it, as a filthy\ncustom for men and women to sit promiscuously in churches together; but Dr.\nDale the master of the requests told him again, that it was indeed a filthy\ncustom in Spain, where they could not contain themselves from lascivious\nthoughts in their holy places, but not with us.\" Baronius in his Annals,\nout of Eusebius, taxeth Licinius the emperor for a decree of his made to\nthis effect, _Jubens ne viri simul cum mulieribus in ecclesia interessent_:\nfor being prodigiously naught himself, _aliorum naturam ex sua vitiosa\nmente spectavit_, he so esteemed others. But we are far from any such\nstrange conceits, and will permit our wives and daughters to go to the\ntavern with a friend, as Aubanus saith, _modo absit lascivia_, and suspect\nnothing, to kiss coming and going, which, as Erasmus writes in one of his\nepistles, they cannot endure. England is a paradise for women, and hell for\nhorses: Italy a paradise for horses, hell for women, as the diverb goes.\nSome make a question whether this headstrong passion rage more in women\nthan men, as Montaigne l. 3. But sure it is more outrageous in women, as\nall other melancholy is, by reason of the weakness of their sex. Scaliger\n_Poet. lib. cap. 13._ concludes against women: [6037]\"Besides their\ninconstancy, treachery, suspicion, dissimulation, superstition, pride,\"\n(for all women are by nature proud) \"desire of sovereignty, if they be\ngreat women,\" (he gives instance in Juno) \"bitterness and jealousy are the\nmost remarkable affections.\"\n\n       \"Sed neque fulvus aper media tam fulvus in ira est,\n        Fulmineo rapidos dum rotat ore canes.\n        Nec leo,\" &c.------\n\n       \"Tiger, boar, bear, viper, lioness,\n        A woman's fury cannot express.\"\n\n[6038]Some say redheaded women, pale-coloured, black-eyed, and of a shrill\nvoice, are most subject to jealousy.\n\n[6039] \"High colour in a woman choler shows,\n        Naught are they, peevish, proud, malicious;\n        But worst of all, red, shrill, and jealous.\"\n\nComparisons are odious, I neither parallel them with others, nor debase\nthem any more: men and women are both bad, and too subject to this\npernicious infirmity. It is most part a symptom and cause of melancholy, as\nPlater and Valescus teach us: melancholy men are apt to be jealous, and\njealous apt to be melancholy.\n\n       \"Pale jealousy, child of insatiate love,\n        Of heart-sick thoughts which melancholy bred,\n        A hell-tormenting fear, no faith can move,\n        By discontent with deadly poison fed;\n        With heedless youth and error vainly led.\n        A mortal plague, a virtue-drowning flood,\n        A hellish fire not quenched but with blood.\"\n\nIf idleness concur with melancholy, such persons are most apt to be\njealous; 'tis [6040]Nevisanus' note, \"an idle woman is presumed to be\nlascivious, and often jealous.\" _Mulier cum sola cogitat, male cogitat_:\nand 'tis not unlikely, for they have no other business to trouble their\nheads with.\n\nMore particular causes be these which follow. Impotency first, when a man\nis not able of himself to perform those dues which he ought unto his wife:\nfor though he be an honest liver, hurt no man, yet Trebius the lawyer may\nmake a question, _an suum cuique tribuat_, whether he give every one their\nown; and therefore when he takes notice of his wants, and perceives her to\nbe more craving, clamorous, insatiable and prone to lust than is fit, he\nbegins presently to suspect, that wherein he is defective, she will satisfy\nherself, she will be pleased by some other means. Cornelius Gallus hath\nelegantly expressed this humour in an epigram to his Lychoris.\n\n[6041] \"Jamque alios juvenes aliosque requirit amores,\n          Me vocat imbellem decrepitumque senem,\" &c.\n\nFor this cause is most evident in old men, that are cold and dry by nature,\nand married, _succi plenis_, to young wanton wives; with old doting\nJanivere in Chaucer, they begin to mistrust all is not well,\n\n        ------_She was young and he was old,\n        And therefore he feared to be a cuckold_.\n\nAnd how should it otherwise be? old age is a disease of itself, loathsome,\nfull of suspicion and fear; when it is at best, unable, unfit for such\nmatters. [6042]_Tam apta nuptiis quam bruma messibus_, as welcome to a\nyoung woman as snow in harvest, saith Nevisanus: _Et si capis juvenculam,\nfaciet tibi cornua_: marry a lusty maid and she will surely graft horns on\nthy head. [6043]\"All women are slippery, often unfaithful to their\nhusbands\" (as Aeneas Sylvius _epist. 38._ seconds him), \"but to old men\nmost treacherous:\" they had rather _mortem amplexarier_, lie with a corse\nthan such a one: [6044]_Oderunt illum pueri, contemnunt mulieres_. On the\nother side many men, saith Hieronymus, are suspicious of their wives,\n[6045]if they be lightly given, but old folks above the rest. Insomuch that\nshe did not complain without a cause in [6046]Apuleius, of an old bald\nbedridden knave she had to her good man: \"Poor woman as I am, what shall I\ndo? I have an old grim sire to my husband, as bald as a coot, as little and\nas unable as a child,\" a bedful of bones, \"he keeps all the doors barred\nand locked upon me, woe is me, what shall I do?\" He was jealous, and she\nmade him a cuckold for keeping her up: suspicion without a cause, hard\nusage is able of itself to make a woman fly out, that was otherwise honest,\n\n[6047]  ------\"plerasque bonas tractatio pravas\n        Esse facit,\"------\n\n\"bad usage aggravates the matter.\" _Nam quando mulieres cognoscunt maritum\nhoc advertere, licentius peccant_, [6048]as Nevisanus holds, when a woman\nthinks her husband watcheth her, she will sooner offend; [6049]_Liberius\npeccant, et pudor omnis abest_, rough handling makes them worse: as the\ngoodwife of Bath in Chaucer brags,\n\n       _In his own grease I made him frie\n        For anger and for every jealousie_.\n\nOf two extremes, this of hard usage is the worst. 'Tis a great fault (for\nsome men are _uxorii_) to be too fond of their wives, to dote on them as\n[6050]Senior Deliro on his Fallace, to be too effeminate, or as some do, to\nbe sick for their wives, breed children for them, and like the [6051]\nTiberini lie in for them, as some birds hatch eggs by turns, they do all\nwomen's offices: Caelius Rhodiginus _ant. lect. Lib. 6. cap. 24._ makes\nmention of a fellow out of Seneca, [6052]that was so besotted on his wife,\nhe could not endure a moment out of her company, he wore her scarf when he\nwent abroad next his heart, and would never drink but in that cup she began\nfirst. We have many such fondlings that are their wives' packhorses and\nslaves, (_nam grave malum uxor superans virum suum_, as the comical poet\nhath it, there's no greater misery to a man than to let his wife domineer)\nto carry her muff, dog, and fan, let her wear the breeches, lay out, spend,\nand do what she will, go and come whither, when she will, they give\nconsent.\n\n       \"Here, take my muff, and, do you hear, good man;\n        Now give me pearl, and carry you my fan,\" &c.\n\n[6053]  ------\"poscit pallam, redimicula, inaures;\n        Curre, quid hic cessas? vulgo vult illa videri,\n        Tu pete lecticas\"------\n\nmany brave and worthy men have trespassed in this kind, _multos foras\nclaros domestica haec destruxit infamia_, and many noble senators and\nsoldiers (as [6054]Pliny notes) have lost their honour, in being _uxorii_,\nso sottishly overruled by their wives; and therefore Cato in Plutarch made\na bitter jest on his fellow-citizens, the Romans, \"we govern all the world\nabroad, and our wives at home rule us.\" These offend in one extreme; but\ntoo hard and too severe, are far more offensive on the other. As just a\ncause may be long absence of either party, when they must of necessity be\nmuch from home, as lawyers, physicians, mariners, by their professions; or\notherwise make frivolous, impertinent journeys, tarry long abroad to no\npurpose, lie out, and are gadding still, upon small occasions, it must\nneeds yield matter of suspicion, when they use their wives unkindly in the\nmeantime, and never tarry at home, it cannot use but engender some such\nconceit.\n\n[6055] \"Uxor si cessas amare te cogitat\n        Aut tote amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi,\n        Ex tibi bene esse soli, quum sibi sit male.\"\n\n       \"If thou be absent long, thy wife then thinks,\n        Th' art drunk, at ease, or with some pretty minx,\n        'Tis well with thee, or else beloved of some,\n        Whilst she poor soul doth fare full ill at home.\"\n\nHippocrates, the physician, had a smack of this disease; for when he was to\ngo home as far as Abdera, and some other remote cities of Greece, he writ\nto his friend Dionysius (if at least those [6056]Epistles be his) [6057]\n\"to oversee his wife in his absence, (as Apollo set a raven to watch his\nCoronis) although she lived in his house with her father and mother, who be\nknew would have a care of her; yet that would not satisfy his jealousy, he\nwould have his special friend Dionysius to dwell in his house with her all\nthe time of his peregrination, and to observe her behaviour, how she\ncarried herself in her husband's absence, and that she did not lust after\nother men. [6058]For a woman had need to have an overseer to keep her\nhonest; they are bad by nature, and lightly given all, and if they be not\ncurbed in time, as an unpruned tree, they will be full of wild branches,\nand degenerate of a sudden.\" Especially in their husband's absence: though\none Lucretia were trusty, and one Penelope, yet Clytemnestra made Agamemnon\ncuckold; and no question there be too many of her conditions. If their\nhusbands tarry too long abroad upon unnecessary business, well they may\nsuspect: or if they run one way, their wives at home will fly out another,\n_quid pro quo_. Or if present, and give them not that content which they\nought, [6059]_Primum ingratae, mox invisae noctes quae per somnum\ntransiguntur_, they cannot endure to lie alone, or to fast long. [6060]\nPeter Godefridus, in his second book of Love, and sixth chapter, hath a\nstory out of St. Anthony's life, of a gentleman, who, by that good man's\nadvice, would not meddle with his wife in the passion week, but for his\npains she set a pair of horns on his head. Such another he hath out of\nAbstemius, one persuaded a new married man, [6061]\"to forbear the three\nfirst nights, and he should all his lifetime after be fortunate in cattle,\"\nbut his impatient wife would not tarry so long: well he might speed in\ncattle, but not in children. Such a tale hath Heinsius of an impotent and\nslack scholar, a mere student, and a friend of his, that seeing by chance a\nfine damsel sing and dance, would needs marry her, the match was soon made,\nfor he was young and rich, _genis gratus, corpore glabellus, arte\nmultiscius, et fortuna opulentus_, like that Apollo in [6062]Apuleius. The\nfirst night, having liberally taken his liquor (as in that country they do)\nmy fine scholar was so fuzzled, that he no sooner was laid in bed, but he\nfell fast asleep, never waked till morning, and then much abashed,\n_purpureis formosa rosis cum Aurora ruberet_; when the fair morn with\npurple hue 'gan shine, he made an excuse, I know not what, out of\nHippocrates Cous, &c., and for that time it went current: but when as\nafterward he did not play the man as he should do, she fell in league with\na good fellow, and whilst he sat up late at his study about those\ncriticisms, mending some hard places in Festus or Pollux, came cold to bed,\nand would tell her still what he had done, she did not much regard what he\nsaid, &c. [6063]\"She would have another matter mended much rather, which he\ndid not conceive was corrupt:\" thus he continued at his study late, she at\nher sport, _alibi enim festivas noctes agitabat_, hating all scholars for\nhis sake, till at length he began to suspect, and turned a little yellow,\nas well he might; for it was his own fault; and if men be jealous in such\ncases ([6064]as oft it falls out) the mends is in their own hands, they\nmust thank themselves. Who will pity them, saith Neander, or be much\noffended with such wives, _si deceptae prius viros decipiant, et cornutos\nreddant_, if they deceive those that cozened them first. A lawyer's wife in\n[6065]Aristaenetus, because her husband was negligent in his business,\n_quando lecto danda opera_, threatened to cornute him: and did not stick to\ntell Philinna, one of her gossips, as much, and that aloud for him to hear:\n\"If he follow other men's matters and leave his own, I'll have an orator\nshall plead my cause,\" I care not if he know it.\n\nA fourth eminent cause of jealousy may be this, when he that is deformed,\nand as Pindarus of Vulcan, _sine gratiis natus_, hirsute, ragged, yet\nvirtuously given, will marry some fair nice piece, or light housewife,\nbegins to misdoubt (as well he may) she doth not affect him. [6066]_Lis est\ncum forma magna pudicitiae_, beauty and honesty have ever been at odds.\nAbraham was jealous of his wife because she was fair: so was Vulcan of his\nVenus, when he made her creaking shoes, saith [6067]Philostratus, _ne\nmaecharetur, sandalio scilicet deferente_, that he might hear by them when\nshe stirred, which _Mars indigne ferre_, [6068]was not well pleased with.\nGood cause had Vulcan to do as he did, for she was no honester than she\nshould be. Your fine faces have commonly this fault; and it is hard to\nfind, saith Francis Philelphus in an epistle to Saxola his friend, a rich\nman honest, a proper woman not proud or unchaste. \"Can she be fair and\nhonest too?\"\n\n[6069] \"Saepe etenim oculuit picta sese hydra sub herba,\n        Sub specie formae, incauto se saepe marito\n        Nequam animus vendit,\"------\n\nHe that marries a wife that is snowy fair alone, let him look, saith [6070]\nBarbarus, for no better success than Vulcan had with Venus, or Claudius\nwith Messalina. And 'tis impossible almost in such cases the wife should\ncontain, or the good man not be jealous: for when he is so defective, weak,\nill-proportioned, unpleasing in those parts which women most affect, and\nshe most absolutely fair and able on the other side, if she be not very\nvirtuously given, how can she love him? and although she be not fair, yet\nif he admire her and think her so, in his conceit she is absolute, he holds\nit impossible for any man living not to dote as he doth, to look on her and\nnot lust, not to covet, and if he be in company with her, not to lay siege\nto her honesty: or else out of a deep apprehension of his infirmities,\ndeformities, and other men's good parts, out of his own little worth and\ndesert, he distrusts himself, (for what is jealousy but distrust?) he\nsuspects she cannot affect him, or be not so kind and loving as she should,\nshe certainly loves some other man better than himself.\n\n[6071]Nevisanus, _lib. 4. num. 72_, will have barrenness to be a main cause\nof jealousy. If her husband cannot play the man, some other shall, they\nwill leave no remedies unessayed, and thereupon the good man grows jealous;\nI could give an instance, but be it as it is.\n\nI find this reason given by some men, because they have been formerly\nnaught themselves, they think they may be so served by others, they turned\nup trump before the cards were shuffled; they shall have therefore _legem\ntalionis_, like for like.\n\n[6072] \"Ipse miser docui, quo posset ludere pacto\n        Custodes, eheu nunc premor arte mea.\"\n\n       \"Wretch as I was, I taught her bad to be,\n        And now mine own sly tricks are put upon me.\"\n\n_Mala mens, malus animus_, as the saying is, ill dispositions cause ill\nsuspicions.\n\n[6073] \"There is none jealous, I durst pawn my life,\n        But he that hath defiled another's wife,\n        And for that he himself hath gone astray,\n        He straightway thinks his wife will tread that way.\"\n\nTo these two above-named causes, or incendiaries of this rage, I may very\nwell annex those circumstances of time, place, persons, by which it ebbs\nand flows, the fuel of this fury, as [6074]Vives truly observes; and such\nlike accidents or occasions, proceeding from the parties themselves, or\nothers, which much aggravate and intend this suspicious humour. For many\nmen are so lasciviously given, either out of a depraved nature, or too much\nliberty, which they do assume unto themselves, by reason of their\ngreatness, in that they are noble men, (for _licentiae peccandi, et\nmultitudo peccantium_ are great motives) though their own wives be never so\nfair, noble, virtuous, honest, wise, able, and well given, they must have\nchange.\n\n[6075] \"Qui cum legitimi junguntur foedere lecti,\n        Virtute egregiis, facieque domoque puellis,\n        Scorta tamen, foedasque lupas in fornice quaerunt,\n        Et per adulterium nova carpere gaudia tentant.\"\n\n       \"Who being match'd to wives most virtuous,\n        Noble, and fair, fly out lascivious.\"\n\n_Quod licet ingratum est_, that which is ordinary, is unpleasant. Nero\n(saith Tacitus) abhorred Octavia his own wife, a noble virtuous lady, and\nloved Acte, a base quean in respect. [6076]Cerinthus rejected Sulpitia, a\nnobleman's daughter, and courted a poor servant maid.--_tanta est aliena in\nmesse voluptas_, for that [6077]\"stolen waters be more pleasant:\" or as\nVitellius the emperor was wont to say, _Jucundiores amores, qui cum\npericulo habentur_, like stolen venison, still the sweetest is that love\nwhich is most difficultly attained: they like better to hunt by stealth in\nanother man's walk, than to have the fairest course that may be at game of\ntheir own.\n\n[6078] \"Aspice ut in coelo modo sol, modo luna ministret,\n        Sic etiam nobis una pella parum est.\"\n\n       \"As sun and moon in heaven change their course,\n        So they change loves, though often to the worse.\"\n\nOr that some fair object so forcibly moves them, they cannot contain\nthemselves, be it heard or seen they will be at it. [6079]Nessus, the\ncentaur, was by agreement to carry Hercules and his wife over the river\nEvenus; no sooner had he set Dejanira on the other side, but he would have\noffered violence unto her, leaving Hercules to swim over as he could: and\nthough her husband was a spectator, yet would he not desist till Hercules,\nwith a poisoned arrow, shot him to death. [6080]Neptune saw by chance that\nThessalian Tyro, Eunippius' wife, he forthwith, in the fury of his lust,\ncounterfeited her husband's habit, and made him cuckold. Tarquin heard\nCollatine commend his wife, and was so far enraged, that in the midst of\nthe night to her he went. [6081]Theseus stole Ariadne, _vi rapuit_ that\nTrazenian Anaxa, Antiope, and now being old, Helen, a girl not yet ready\nfor a husband. Great men are most part thus affected all, \"as a horse they\nneigh,\" saith [6082]Jeremiah, after their neighbours' wives,--_ut visa\npullus adhinnit equa_: and if they be in company with other women, though\nin their own wives' presence, they must be courting and dallying with them.\nJuno in Lucian complains of Jupiter that he was still kissing Ganymede\nbefore her face, which did not a little offend her: and besides he was a\ncounterfeit Amphitryo, a bull, a swan, a golden shower, and played many\nsuch bad pranks, too long, too shameful to relate.\n\nOr that they care little for their own ladies, and fear no laws, they dare\nfreely keep whores at their wives' noses. 'Tis too frequent with noblemen\nto be dishonest; _Pielas, probitas, fides, privata bona sunt_, as [6083]he\nsaid long since, piety, chastity, and such like virtues are for private\nmen: not to be much looked after in great courts: and which Suetonius of\nthe good princes of his time, they might be all engraven in one ring, we\nmay truly hold of chaste potentates of our age. For great personages will\nfamiliarly run out in this kind, and yield occasion of offence. [6084]\nMontaigne, in his Essays, gives instate in Caesar, Mahomet the Turk, that\nsacked Constantinople, and Ladislaus, king of Naples, that besieged\nFlorence: great men, and great soldiers, are commonly great, &c., _probatum\nest_, they are good doers. Mars and Venus are equally balanced in their\nactions,\n\n[6085] \"Militis in galea nidum fecere columbae,\n        Apparet Marti quam sit amica Venus.\"\n\n       \"A dove within a headpiece made her nest,\n        'Twixt Mars and Venus see an interest.\"\n\nEspecially if they be bald, for bald men have ever been suspicious (read\nmore in Aristotle, _Sect. 4. prob. 19._) as Galba, Otho, Domitian, and\nremarkable Caesar amongst the rest. [6086]_Urbani servate uxores, maechum\ncalvum adducimus_; besides, this bald Caesar, saith Curio in Sueton, was\n_omnium mulierum vir_; he made love to Eunoe, queen of Mauritania; to\nCleopatra; to Posthumia, wife to Sergius Sulpitius; to Lollia, wife to\nGabinius; to Tertulla, of Crassus; to Mutia, Pompey's wife, and I know not\nhow many besides: and well he might, for, if all be true that I have read,\nhe had a license to lie with whom he list. _Inter alios honores Caesari\ndecretos_ (as Sueton, _cap. 52. de Julio_, and Dion, _lib. 44._ relate)\n_jus illi datum, cum quibuscunque faeminis se jungendi_. Every private\nhistory will yield such variety of instances: otherwise good, wise,\ndiscreet men, virtuous and valiant, but too faulty in this. Priamus had\nfifty sons, but seventeen alone lawfully begotten. [6087]Philippus Bonus\nleft fourteen bastards. Lorenzo de Medici, a good prince and a wise, but,\nsaith Machiavel, [6088]prodigiously lascivious. None so valiant as\nCastruccius Castrucanus, but, as the said author hath it, [6089]none so\nincontinent as he was. And 'tis not only predominant in grandees this\nfault: but if you will take a great man's testimony, 'tis familiar with\nevery base soldier in France, (and elsewhere, I think). \"This vice\" ([6090]\nsaith mine author) \"is so common with us in France, that he is of no\naccount, a mere coward, not worthy the name of a soldier, that is not a\nnotorious whoremaster.\" In Italy he is not a gentleman, that besides his\nwife hath not a courtesan and a mistress. 'Tis no marvel, then, if poor\nwomen in such cases be jealous, when they shall see themselves manifestly\nneglected, contemned, loathed, unkindly used: their disloyal husbands to\nentertain others in their rooms, and many times to court ladies to their\nfaces: other men's wives to wear their jewels: how shall a poor woman in\nsuch a case moderate her passion? [6091]_Quis tibi nunc Dido cernenti talia\nsensus_?\n\nHow, on the other side, shall a poor man contain himself from this feral\nmalady, when he shall see so manifest signs of his wife's inconstancy?\nwhen, as Milo's wife, she dotes upon every young man she sees, or, as\n[6092]Martial's Sota,--_deserto sequitur Clitum marito_, \"deserts her\nhusband and follows Clitus.\" Though her husband be proper and tall, fair\nand lovely to behold, able to give contentment to any one woman, yet she\nwill taste of the forbidden fruit: Juvenal's Iberina to a hair, she is as\nwell pleased with one eye as one man. If a young gallant come by chance\ninto her presence, a fastidious brisk, that can wear his clothes well in\nfashion, with a lock, jingling spur, a feather, that can cringe, and withal\ncompliment, court a gentlewoman, she raves upon him, \"O what a lovely\nproper man he was,\" another Hector, an Alexander, a goodly man, a demigod,\nhow sweetly he carried himself, with how comely a grace, _sic oculos, sic\nille manus, sic ora ferebat_, how neatly he did wear his clothes! [6093]\n_Quam sese ore ferens, quam forti pectore et armis_, how bravely did he\ndiscourse, ride, sing, and dance, &c., and then she begins to loathe her\nhusband, _repugnans osculatur_, to hate him and his filthy beard, his\ngoatish complexion, as Doris said of Polyphemus, [6094]_totus qui saniem,\ntotus ut hircus olet_, he is a rammy fulsome fellow, a goblin-faced fellow,\nhe smells, he stinks, _Et caepas simul alliumque ructat_ [6095]--_si quando\nad thalamum_, &c., how like a dizzard, a fool, an ass, he looks, how like a\nclown he behaves himself! [6096]she will not come near him by her own good\nwill, but wholly rejects him, as Venus did her fuliginous Vulcan, at last,\n_Nec Deus hunc mensa, Dea nec dignata cubili est_. [6097]So did Lucretia, a\nlady of Senae, after she had but seen Euryalus, _in Eurialum tota\nferebatur, domum reversa_, &c., she would not hold her eyes off him in his\npresence,-- [6098]_tantum egregio decus enitet ore_, and in his absence\ncould think of none but him, _odit virum_, she loathed her husband\nforthwith, might not abide him:\n\n[6099] \"Et conjugalis negligens tori, viro\n        Praesente, acerbo nauseat fastidio;\"\n\n       \"All against the laws of matrimony,\n        She did abhor her husband's phis'nomy;\"\n\nand sought all opportunity to see her sweetheart again. Now when the good\nman shall observe his wife so lightly given, \"to be so free and familiar\nwith every gallant, her immodesty and wantonness,\" (as [6100]Camerarius\nnotes) it must needs yield matter of suspicion to him, when she still\npranks up herself beyond her means and fortunes, makes impertinent\njourneys, unnecessary visitations, stays out so long, with such and such\ncompanions, so frequently goes to plays, masks, feasts, and all public\nmeetings, shall use such immodest [6101]gestures, free speeches, and withal\nshow some distaste of her own husband; how can he choose, \"though he were\nanother Socrates, but be suspicious, and instantly jealous?\" [6102]\n_Socraticas tandem faciet transcendere metas_; more especially when he\nshall take notice of their more secret and sly tricks, which to cornute\ntheir husbands they commonly use (_dum ludis, ludos haec te facit_) they\npretend love, honour, chastity, and seem to respect them before all men\nliving, saints in show, so cunningly can they dissemble, they will not so\nmuch as look upon another man in his presence, [6103]so chaste, so\nreligious, and so devout, they cannot endure the name or sight of a quean,\na harlot, out upon her! and in their outward carriage are most loving and\nofficious, will kiss their husband, and hang about his neck (dear husband,\nsweet husband), and with a composed countenance salute him, especially when\nhe comes home; or if he go from home, weep, sigh, lament, and take upon\nthem to be sick and swoon (like Jocundo's wife in [6104]Ariosto, when her\nhusband was to depart), and yet arrant, &c. they care not for him,\n\n       \"Aye me, the thought (quoth she) makes me so 'fraid,\n        That scarce the breath abideth in my breast;\n        Peace, my sweet love and wife, Jocundo said,\n        And weeps as fast, and comforts her his best, &c.\n        All this might not assuage the woman's pain,\n        Needs must I die before you come again,\n        Nor how to keep my life I can devise,\n        The doleful days and nights I shall sustain,\n        From meat my mouth, from sleep will keep mine eyes, &c.\n        That very night that went before the morrow,\n        That he had pointed surely to depart,\n        Jocundo's wife was sick, and swoon'd for sorrow\n        Amid his arms, so heavy was her heart.\"\n\nAnd yet for all these counterfeit tears and protestations, Jocundo coming\nback in all haste for a jewel he had forgot,\n\n       \"His chaste and yoke-fellow he found\n        Yok'd with a knave, all honesty neglected,\n        The adulterer sleeping very sound,\n        Yet by his face was easily detected:\n        A beggar's brat bred by him from his cradle.,\n        And now was riding on his master's saddle.\"\n\nThus can they cunningly counterfeit, as [6105]Platina describes their\ncustoms, \"kiss their husbands, whom they had rather see hanging on a\ngallows, and swear they love him dearer than their own lives, whose soul\nthey would not ransom for their little dog's,\"\n\n        ------\"similis si permutatio detur,\n        Morte viri cupiunt aniniani servare catellae.\"\n\nMany of them seem to be precise and holy forsooth, and will go to such a\n[6106]church, to hear such a good man by all means, an excellent man, when\n'tis for no other intent (as he follows it) than \"to see and to be seen, to\nobserve what fashions are in use, to meet some pander, bawd, monk, friar,\nor to entice some good fellow.\" For they persuade themselves, as [6107]\nNevisanus shows, \"That it is neither sin nor shame to lie with a lord or\nparish priest, if he be a proper man;\" [6108]\"and though she kneel often,\nand pray devoutly, 'tis\" (saith Platina) \"not for her husband's welfare, or\nchildren's good, or any friend, but for her sweetheart's return, her\npander's health.\" If her husband would have her go, she feigns herself\nsick, [6109]_Et simulat subito condoluisse caput_: her head aches, and she\ncannot stir: but if her paramour ask as much, she is for him in all\nseasons, at all hours of the night. [6110]In the kingdom of Malabar, and\nabout Goa in the East Indies, the women are so subtile that, with a certain\ndrink they give them to drive away cares as they say, [6111]\"they will make\nthem sleep for twenty-four hours, or so intoxicate them that they can\nremember nought of that they saw done, or heard, and, by washing of their\nfeet, restore them again, and so make their husbands cuckolds to their\nfaces.\" Some are ill-disposed at all times, to all persons they like,\nothers more wary to some few, at such and such seasons, as Augusta, Livia,\n_non nisi plena navi vectorem tollebat_. But as he said,\n\n[6112] \"No pen could write, no tongue attain to tell,\n        By force of eloquence, or help of art,\n        Of women's treacheries the hundredth part.\"\n\nBoth, to say truth, are often faulty; men and women give just occasions in\nthis humour of discontent, aggravate and yield matter of suspicion: but\nmost part of the chief causes proceed from other adventitious accidents and\ncircumstances, though the parties be free, and both well given themselves.\nThe indiscreet carriage of some lascivious gallant (_et e contra_ of some\nlight woman) by his often frequenting of a house, bold unseemly gestures,\nmay make a breach, and by his over-familiarity, if he be inclined to\nyellowness, colour him quite out. If he be poor, basely born, saith\nBeneditto Varchi, and otherwise unhandsome, he suspects him the less; but\nif a proper man, such as was Alcibiades in Greece, and Castruccius\nCastrucanus in Italy, well descended, commendable for his good parts, he\ntaketh on the more, and watcheth his doings. [6113]Theodosius the emperor\ngave his wife Eudoxia a golden apple when he was a suitor to her, which she\nlong after bestowed upon a young gallant in the court, of her especial\nacquaintance. The emperor, espying this apple in his hand, suspected\nforthwith, more than was, his wife's dishonesty, banished him the court,\nand from that day following forbare to accompany her any more. [6114]A rich\nmerchant had a fair wife; according to his custom he went to travel; in his\nabsence a good fellow tempted his wife; she denied him; yet he, dying a\nlittle after, gave her a legacy for the love he bore her. At his return,\nher jealous husband, because she had got more by land than he had done at\nsea, turned her away upon suspicion.\n\nNow when those other circumstances of time and place, opportunity and\nimportunity shall concur, what will they not effect?\n\n       \"Fair opportunity can win the coyest she that is,\n        So wisely he takes time, as he'll be sure he will not miss:\n        Then lie that loves her gamesome vein, and tempers toys with art,\n        Brings love that swimmeth in her eyes to dive into her heart.\"\n\nAs at plays, masks, great feasts and banquets, one singles out his wife to\ndance, another courts her in his presence, a third tempts her, a fourth\ninsinuates with a pleasing compliment, a sweet smile, ingratiates himself\nwith an amphibological speech, as that merry companion in the [6115]\nSatirist did to his Glycerium, [6116]_adsidens et interiorem palmam\namabiliter concutiens_,\n\n       \"Quod meus hortus habet sumat impune licebit,\n        Si dederis nobis quod tuus hortus habet;\"\n\nwith many such, &c., and then as he saith,\n\n[6117] _She may no while in chastity abide.\n        That is assaid on every side_.\n\nFor after al great feast, [6118]_Vino saepe suum nescit amica virum_. Noah\n(saith [6119]Hierome) \"showed his nakedness in his drunkenness, which for\nsix hundred years he had covered in soberness.\" Lot lay with his daughters\nin his drink, as Cyneras with Myrrha,--[6120]_quid enim Venus ebria curat_?\nThe most continent may be overcome, or if otherwise they keep bad company,\nthey that are modest of themselves, and dare not offend, \"confirmed by\n[6121]others, grow impudent, and confident, and get an ill habit.\"\n\n[6122] \"Alia quaestus gratia matrimonium corrumpit,\n        Alia peccans multas vult morbi habere socias.\"\n\nOr if they dwell in suspected places, as in an infamous inn, near some\nstews, near monks, friars, Nevisanus adds, where be many tempters and\nsolicitors, idle persons that frequent their companies, it may give just\ncause of suspicion. Martial of old inveighed against them that\ncounterfeited a disease to go to the bath; for so, many times,\n\n        ------\"relicto\n        Conjuge Penelope venit, abit Helene.\"\n\nAeneas Sylvius puts in a caveat against princes' courts, because there be\n_tot formosi juvenes qui promittunt_, so many brave suitors to tempt, &c.\n[6123]\"If you leave her in such a place, you shall likely find her in\ncompany you like not, either they come to her, or she is gone to them.\"\n[6124]Kornmannus makes a doubting jest in his lascivious country, _Virginis\nillibata censeatur ne castitas ad quam frequentur accedant scholares_? And\nBaldus the lawyer scoffs on, _quum scholaris, inquit, loquitur cum puella,\nnon praesumitur ei dicere, Pater noster_, when a scholar talks with a maid,\nor another man's wife in private, it is presumed he saith not a _pater\nnoster_. Or if I shall see a monk or a friar climb up a ladder at midnight\ninto a virgin's or widow's chamber window, I shall hardly think he then\ngoes to administer the sacraments, or to take her confession. These are the\nordinary causes of jealousy, which are intended or remitted as the\ncircumstances vary.\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n_Symptoms of Jealousy, Fear, Sorrow, Suspicion, strange Actions, Gestures,\nOutrages, Locking up, Oaths, Trials, Laws, &c._\n\nOf all passions, as I have already proved, love is most violent, and of\nthose bitter potions which this love-melancholy affords, this bastard\njealousy is the greatest, as appears by those prodigious symptoms which it\nhath, and that it produceth. For besides fear and sorrow, which is common\nto all melancholy, anxiety of mind, suspicion, aggravation, restless\nthoughts, paleness, meagreness, neglect of business, and the like, these\nmen are farther yet misaffected, and in a higher strain. 'Tis a more\nvehement passion, a more furious perturbation, a bitter pain, a fire, a\npernicious curiosity, a gall corrupting the honey of our life, madness,\nvertigo, plague, hell, they are more than ordinarily disquieted, they lose\n_bonum pacis_, as [6125]Chrysostom observes; and though they be rich, keep\nsumptuous tables, be nobly allied, yet _miserrimi omnium sunt_, they are\nmost miserable, they are more than ordinarily discontent, more sad, _nihil\ntristius_, more than ordinarily suspicious. Jealousy, saith [6126]Vives,\n\"begets unquietness in the mind, night and day: he hunts after every word\nhe hears, every whisper, and amplifies it to himself\" (as all melancholy\nmen do in other matters) \"with a most unjust calumny of others, he\nmisinterprets everything is said or done, most apt to mistake or\nmisconstrue,\" he pries into every corner, follows close, observes to a\nhair. 'Tis proper to jealousy so to do,\n\n       \"Pale hag, infernal fury, pleasure's smart,\n        Envy's observer, prying in every part.\"\n\nBesides those strange gestures of staring, frowning, grinning, rolling of\neyes, menacing, ghastly looks, broken pace, interrupt, precipitate,\nhalf-turns. He will sometimes sigh, weep, sob for anger. _Nempe suos imbres\netiam ista tonitrua fundunt_,[6127]--swear and belie, slander any man,\ncurse, threaten, brawl, scold, fight; and sometimes again flatter and speak\nfair, ask forgiveness, kiss and coll, condemn his rashness and folly, vow,\nprotest, and swear he will never do so again; and then eftsoons, impatient\nas he is, rave, roar, and lay about him like a madman, thump her sides,\ndrag her about perchance, drive her out of doors, send her home, he will be\ndivorced forthwith, she is a whore, &c., and by-and-by with all submission\ncompliment, entreat her fair, and bring her in again, he loves her dearly,\nshe is his sweet, most kind and loving wife, he will not change, nor leave\nher for a kingdom; so he continues off and on, as the toy takes him, the\nobject moves him, but most part brawling, fretting, unquiet he is, accusing\nand suspecting not strangers only, but brothers and sisters, father and\nmother, nearest and dearest friends. He thinks with those Italians,\n\n       \"Chi non tocca parentado,\n        Tocca mai e rado.\"\n\nAnd through fear conceives unto himself things almost incredible and\nimpossible to be effected. As a heron when she fishes, still prying on all\nsides; or as a cat doth a mouse, his eye is never off hers; he gloats on\nhim, on her, accurately observing on whom she looks, who looks at her, what\nshe saith, doth, at dinner, at supper, sitting, walking, at home, abroad,\nhe is the same, still inquiring, maundering, gazing, listening, affrighted\nwith every small object; why did she smile, why did she pity him, commend\nhim? why did she drink twice to such a man? why did she offer to kiss, to\ndance? &c., a whore, a whore, an arrant whore. All this he confesseth in\nthe poet,\n\n[6128] \"Omnia me terrent, timidus sum, ignosce timori.\n        Et miser in tunica suspicor esse virum.\n        Me laedit si multa tibi dabit oscula mater,\n        Me soror, et cum qua dormit amica simul.\"\n\n       \"Each thing affrights me, I do fear,\n        Ah pardon me my fear,\n        I doubt a man is hid within\n        The clothes that thou dost wear.\"\n\nIs it not a man in woman's apparel? is not somebody in that great chest, or\nbehind the door, or hangings, or in some of those barrels? may not a man\nsteal in at the window with a ladder of ropes, or come down the chimney,\nhave a false key, or get in when he is asleep? If a mouse do but stir, or\nthe wind blow, a casement clatter, that's the villain, there he is: by his\ngoodwill no man shall see her, salute her, speak with her, she shall not go\nforth of his sight, so much as to do her needs. [6129]_Non ita bovem\nargus_, &c. Argus did not so keep his cow, that watchful dragon the golden\nfleece, or Cerberus the coming in of hell, as he keeps his wife. If a dear\nfriend or near kinsman come as guest to his house, to visit him, he will\nnever let him be out of his own sight and company, lest, peradventure, &c.\nIf the necessity of his business be such that he must go from home, he doth\neither lock her up, or commit her with a deal of injunctions and\nprotestations to some trusty friends, him and her he sets and bribes to\noversee: one servant is set in his absence to watch another, and all to\nobserve his wife, and yet all this will not serve, though his business be\nvery urgent, he will when he is halfway come back in all post haste, rise\nfrom supper, or at midnight, and be gone, and sometimes leave his business\nundone, and as a stranger court his own wife in some disguised habit.\nThough there be no danger at all, no cause of suspicion, she live in such a\nplace, where Messalina herself could not be dishonest if she would, yet he\nsuspects her as much as if she were in a bawdy-house, some prince's court,\nor in a common inn, where all comers might have free access. He calls her\non a sudden all to nought, she is a strumpet, a light housewife, a bitch,\nan arrant whore. No persuasion, no protestation can divert this passion,\nnothing can ease him, secure or give him satisfaction. It is most strange\nto report what outrageous acts by men and women have been committed in this\nkind, by women especially, that will run after their husbands into all\nplaces and companies, [6130]as Jovianus Pontanus's wife did by him, follow\nhim whithersoever he went, it matters not, or upon what business, raving\nlike Juno in the tragedy, miscalling, cursing, swearing, and mistrusting\nevery one she sees. Gomesius in his third book of the Life and Deeds of\nFrancis Ximenius, sometime archbishop of Toledo, hath a strange story of\nthat incredible jealousy of Joan queen of Spain, wife to King Philip,\nmother of Ferdinand and Charles the Fifth, emperors; when her husband\nPhilip, either for that he was tired with his wife's jealousy, or had some\ngreat business, went into the Low Countries: she was so impatient and\nmelancholy upon his departure, that she would scarce eat her meat, or\nconverse with any man; and though she were with child, the season of the\nyear very bad, the wind against her, in all haste she would to sea after\nhim. Neither Isabella her queen mother, the archbishop, or any other friend\ncould persuade her to the contrary, but she would after him. When she was\nnow come into the Low Countries, and kindly entertained by her husband, she\ncould not contain herself, [6131]\"but in a rage ran upon a yellow-haired\nwench,\" with whom she suspected her husband to be naught, \"cut off her\nhair, did beat her black and blue, and so dragged her about.\" It is an\nordinary thing for women in such cases to scratch the faces, slit the noses\nof such as they suspect; as Henry the Second's importune Juno did by\nRosamond at Woodstock; for she complains in a [6132]modern poet, she scarce\nspake,\n\n       \"But flies with eager fury to my face,\n        Offering me most unwomanly disgrace.\n        Look how a tigress, &c.\n        So fell she on me in outrageous wise,\n        As could disdain and jealousy devise.\"\n\nOr if it be so they dare not or cannot execute any such tyrannical\ninjustice, they will miscall, rail and revile, bear them deadly hate and\nmalice, as [6133]Tacitus observes, \"The hatred of a jealous woman is\ninseparable against such as she suspects.\"\n\n[6134] \"Nulla vis flammae tumidique venti\n        Tanta, nec teli metuanda torti.\n        Quanta cum conjux viduata taedis\n                          Ardet et odit.\"\n\n       \"Winds, weapons, flames make not such hurly burly,\n        As raving women turn all topsy-turvy.\"\n\nSo did Agrippina by Lollia, and Calphurnia in the days of Claudius. But\nwomen are sufficiently curbed in such cases, the rage of men is more\neminent, and frequently put in practice. See but with what rigour those\njealous husbands tyrannise over their poor wives. In Greece, Spain, Italy,\nTurkey, Africa, Asia, and generally over all those hot countries, [6135]\n_Mulieres vestrae terra vestra, arate sicut vultis_. Mahomet in his Alcoran\ngives this power to men, your wives are as your land, till them, use them,\nentreat them fair or foul, as you will yourselves. [6136]_Mecastor lege\ndura vivunt mulieres_, they lock them still in their houses, which are so\nmany prisons to them. will suffer nobody to come at them, or their wives to\nbe seen abroad,--_nec campos liceat lustrare patentes_. They must not so\nmuch as look out. And if they be great persons, they have eunuchs to keep\nthem, as the Grand Signior among the Turks, the Sophies of Persia, those\nTartarian Mogors, and Kings of China. _Infantes masculos castrant innumeros\nut regi serviant_, saith [6137]Riccius, \"they geld innumerable infants\" to\nthis purpose; the King of [6138]China \"maintains 10,000 eunuchs in his\nfamily to keep his wives.\" The Xeriffes of Barbary keep their courtesans in\nsuch a strict manner, that if any man come but in sight of them he dies for\nit; and if they chance to see a man, and do not instantly cry out, though\nfrom their windows, they must be put to death. The Turks have I know not\nhow many black, deformed eunuchs (for the white serve for other\nministeries) to this purpose sent commonly from Egypt, deprived in their\nchildhood of all their privities, and brought up in the seraglio at\nConstantinople to keep their wives; which are so penned up they may not\nconfer with any living man, or converse with younger women, have a cucumber\nor carrot sent into them for their diet, but sliced, for fear, &c. and so\nlive and are left alone to their unchaste thoughts all the days of their\nlives. The vulgar sort of women, if at any time they come abroad, which is\nvery seldom, to visit one another, or to go to their baths, are so covered,\nthat no man can see them, as the matrons were in old Rome, _lectica aut\nsella tecta, vectae_, so [6139]Dion and Seneca record, _Velatae totae\nincedunt_, which [6140]Alexander ab Alexandro relates of the Parthians,\n_lib. 5. cap. 24._ which, with Andreas Tiraquellus his commentator, I\nrather think should be understood of Persians. I have not yet said all,\nthey do not only lock them up, _sed et pudendis seras adhibent_: hear what\nBembus relates _lib. 6._ of his Venetian history, of those inhabitants that\ndwell about Quilon in Africa. _Lusitani, inquit, quorundum civitates\nadierunt: qui natis statim faeminis naturam consuunt, quoad urinae exitus\nne impediatur, easque quum adoleverint sic consutas in matrimonium\ncollocant, ut sponsi prima cura sit conglutinatas puellae oras ferro\ninterscindere_. In some parts of Greece at this day, like those old Jews,\nthey will not believe their wives are honest, _nisi pannum menstruatum\nprima nocte videant_: our countryman [6141]Sands, in his peregrination,\nsaith it is severely observed in Zanzynthus, or Zante; and Leo Afer in his\ntime at Fez, in Africa, _non credunt virginem esse nisi videant sanguineam\nmappam; si non, ad parentes pudore rejicitur_. Those sheets are publicly\nshown by their parents, and kept as a sign of incorrupt virginity. The Jews\nof old examined their maids _ex tenui membrana_, called Hymen, which\nLaurentius in his anatomy, Columbus _lib. 12. cap. 10._ Capivaccius _lib.\n4. cap. 11. de uteri affectibus_, Vincent, Alsarus Genuensis _quaesit. med.\ncent. 4._ Hieronymus Mercurialis _consult._ Ambros. Pareus, Julius Caesar\nClaudinus _Respons. 4._ as that also _de [6142]ruptura venarum ut sauguis\nfluat_, copiously confute; 'tis no sufficient trial they contend. And yet\nothers again defend it, Gaspar Bartholinus _Institut. Anat. lib. 1. cap.\n31._ Pinaeus of Paris, Albertus Magnus _de secret. mulier. cap. 9 & 10._\n&c. and think they speak too much in favour of women. [6143] Ludovicus\nBoncialus _lib. 4. cap. 2. muliebr._ _naturalem illam uteri labiorum\nconstrictionem, in qua virginitatem consistere volunt, astringentibus\nmedicinis fieri posse vendicat, et si defloratae sint, astutae\n[6144]mulieres (inquit) nos fallunt in his. Idem Alsarius Crucius Genuensis\niisdem fere verbis_. Idem Avicenna _lib. 3. Fen. 20. Tract. 1, cap. 47._\n[6145]Rhasis _Continent. lib. 24._ Rodericus a Castro _de nat. mul. lib. 1.\ncap. 3._ An old bawdy nurse in [6146]Aristaenetus, (like that Spanish\nCaelestina, [6147]_quae, quinque mille virgines fecit mulieres, totidemque\nmulieres arte sua virgines_) when a fair maid of her acquaintance wept and\nmade her moan to her, how she had been deflowered, and now ready to be\nmarried, was afraid it would be perceived, comfortably replied, _Noli\nvereri filia_, &c. \"Fear not, daughter, I'll teach thee a trick to help\nit.\" _Sed haec extra callem._ To what end are all those astrological\nquestions, _an sit virgo, an sit casta, an sit mulier_? and such strange\nabsurd trials in Albertus Magnus, Bap. Porta, _Mag. lib. 2. cap. 21._ in\nWecker. _lib. 5. de secret_, by stones, perfumes, to make them piss, and\nconfess I know not what in their sleep; some jealous brain was the first\nfounder of them. And to what passion may we ascribe those severe laws\nagainst jealousy, Num. v. 14, Adulterers Deut. cap. 22. v. xxii. as amongst\nthe Hebrews, amongst the Egyptians (read [6148]Bohemus _l. 1. c. 5. de mor.\ngen._ of the Carthaginians, _cap. 6._ of Turks, _lib. 2. cap. 11._) amongst\nthe Athenians of old, Italians at this day, wherein they are to be severely\npunished, cut in pieces, burned, _vivi-comburio_, buried alive, with\nseveral expurgations, &c. are they not as so many symptoms of incredible\njealousy? we may say the same of those vestal virgins that fetched water in\na sieve, as Tatia did in Rome, _anno ab. urb. condita 800._ before the\nsenators; and [6149]Aemilia, _virgo innocens_, that ran over hot irons, as\nEmma, Edward the Confessor's mother did, the king himself being a\nspectator, with the like. We read in Nicephorus, that Chunegunda the wife\nof Henricus Bavarus emperor, suspected of adultery, _insimulata adulterii\nper ignitos vomeres illaesa transiit_, trod upon red hot coulters, and had\nno harm: such another story we find in Regino _lib. 2._ In Aventinus and\nSigonius of Charles the Third and his wife Richarda, _an._ 887, that was so\npurged with hot irons. Pausanias saith, that he was once an eyewitness of\nsuch a miracle at Diana's temple, a maid without any harm at all walked\nupon burning coals. Pius Secund. in his description of Europe, _c. 46._\nrelates as much, that it was commonly practised at Diana's temple, for\nwomen to go barefoot over hot coals, to try their honesties: Plinius,\nSolinus, and many writers, make mention of [6150]Geronia's temple, and\nDionysius Halicarnassus, _lib. 3._ of Memnon's statue, which were used to\nthis purpose. Tatius _lib. 6._ of Pan his cave, (much like old St.\nWilfrid's needle in Yorkshire) wherein they did use to try, maids,\n[6151]whether they were honest; when Leucippe went in, _suavissimus\nexaudiri sonus caepit_ Austin _de civ. Dei lib. 10. c. 16._ relates many\nsuch examples, all which Lavater _de spectr. part. 1. cap. 19_ contends to\nbe done by the illusion of devils; though Thomas _quaest. 6. de polentia_,\n&c. ascribes it to good angels. Some, saith [6152]Austin, compel their\nwives to swear they be honest, as if perjury were a lesser sin than\nadultery; [6153]some consult oracles, as Phaerus that blind king of Egypt.\nOthers reward, as those old Romans used to do; if a woman were contented\nwith one man, _Corona pudicitiae donabatur_, she had a crown of chastity\nbestowed on her. When all this will not serve, saith Alexander Gaguinus,\n_cap. 5. descript. Muscoviae_, the Muscovites, if they suspect their wives,\nwill beat them till they confess, and if that will not avail, like those\nwild Irish, be divorced at their pleasures, or else knock them on the\nheads, as the old [6154]Gauls have done in former ages.

Despair, Madness, to make away themselves and\nothers_.\n\nThose which are jealous, most part, if they be not otherwise relieved,\n[6155]\"proceed from suspicion to hatred, from hatred to frenzy, madness,\ninjury, murder and despair.\"\n\n[6156] \"A plague by whose most damnable effect.\n        Divers in deep despair to die have sought,\n        By which a man to madness near is brought,\n        As well with causeless as with just suspect.\"\n\nIn their madness many times, saith [6157]Vives, they make away themselves\nand others. Which induceth Cyprian to call it, _Foecundam et multiplicem\nperniciem, fontem cladium et seminarium delictorum_, a fruitful mischief,\nthe seminary of offences, and fountain of murders. Tragical examples are\ntoo common in this kind, both new and old, in all ages, as of [6158]\nCephalus and Procris, [6159]Phaereus of Egypt, Tereus, Atreus, and\nThyestes. [6160]Alexander Phaereus was murdered of his wife, _ob pellicatus\nsuspitionem_, Tully saith. Antoninus Verus was so made away by Lucilla;\nDemetrius the son of Antigonus, and Nicanor, by their wives. Hercules\npoisoned by Dejanira, [6161]Caecinna murdered by Vespasian, Justina, a\nRoman lady, by her husband. [6162]Amestris, Xerxes' wife, because she found\nher husband's cloak in Masista's house, cut off Masista, his wife's paps,\nand gave them to the dogs, flayed her besides, and cut off her ears, lips,\ntongue, and slit the nose of Artaynta her daughter. Our late writers are\nfull of such outrages.\n\n[6163]Paulus Aemilius, in his history of France, hath a tragical story of\nChilpericus the First his death, made away by Ferdegunde his queen. In a\njealous humour he came from hunting, and stole behind his wife, as she was\ndressing and combing her head in the sun, gave her a familiar touch with\nhis wand, which she mistaking for her lover, said, \"Ah Landre, a good\nknight should strike before, and not behind:\" but when she saw herself\nbetrayed by his presence, she instantly took order to make him away.\nHierome Osorius, in his eleventh book of the deeds of Emanuel King of\nPortugal, to this effect hath a tragical narration of one Ferdinandus\nChalderia, that wounded Gotherinus, a noble countryman of his, at Goa in\nthe East Indies, [6164]\"and cut off one of his legs, for that he looked as\nhe thought too familiarly upon his wife, which was afterwards a cause of\nmany quarrels, and much bloodshed.\" Guianerius _cap. 36. de aegritud.\nmatr._ speaks of a silly jealous fellow, that seeing his child new-born\nincluded in a caul, thought sure a [6165]Franciscan that used to come to\nhis house, was the father of it, it was so like the friar's cowl, and\nthereupon threatened the friar to kill him: Fulgosus of a woman in\nNarbonne, that cut off her husband's privities in the night, because she\nthought he played false with her. The story of Jonuses Bassa, and fair\nManto his wife, is well known to such as have read the Turkish history; and\nthat of Joan of Spain, of which I treated in my former section. Her\njealousy, saith Gomesius, was the cause of both their deaths: King Philip\ndied for grief a little after, as [6166]Martian his physician gave it out,\n\"and she for her part after a melancholy discontented life, misspent in\nlurking-holes and corners, made an end of her miseries.\" Felix Plater, in\nthe first book of his observations, hath many such instances, of a\nphysician of his acquaintance, [6167]\"that was first mad through jealousy,\nand afterwards desperate:\" of a merchant [6168]\"that killed his wife in the\nsame humour, and after precipitated himself:\" of a doctor of law that cut\noff his man's nose: of a painter's wife in Basil, anno 1600, that was\nmother of nine children and had been twenty-seven years married, yet\nafterwards jealous, and so impatient that she became desperate, and would\nneither eat nor drink in her own house, for fear her husband should poison\nher. 'Tis a common sign this; for when once the humours are stirred, and\nthe imagination misaffected, it will vary itself in divers forms; and many\nsuch absurd symptoms will accompany, even madness itself. Skenkius\n_observat. lib. 4. cap. de Uter._ hath an example of a jealous woman that\nby this means had many fits of the mother: and in his first book of some\nthat through jealousy ran mad: of a baker that gelded himself to try his\nwife's honesty, &c. Such examples are too common.\n\n\nMEMB. IV.\n\nSUBSECT I.--_Cure of Jealousy; by avoiding occasions, not to be idle: of\ngood counsel; to contemn it, not to watch or lock them up: to dissemble it,\n&c._\n\nAs of all other melancholy, some doubt whether this malady may be cured or\nno, they think 'tis like the [6169]gout, or Switzers, whom we commonly call\nWalloons, those hired soldiers, if once they take possession of a castle,\nthey can never be got out.\n\n       \"Qui timet ut sua sit, ne quis sibi subtrahat illam,\n        Ille Machaonia vix ope salvus est.\"\n\n[6170] \"This is the cruel wound against whose smart,\n        No liquor's force prevails, or any plaister,\n        No skill of stars, no depth of magic art,\n        Devised by that great clerk Zoroaster,\n        A wound that so infects the soul and heart,\n        As all our sense and reason it doth master;\n        A wound whose pang and torment is so durable,\n        As it may rightly called be incurable.\"\n\nYet what I have formerly said of other melancholy, I will say again, it may\nbe cured or mitigated at least by some contrary passion, good counsel and\npersuasion, if it be withstood in the beginning, maturely resisted, and as\nthose ancients hold, [6171]\"the nails of it be pared before they grow too\nlong.\" No better means to resist or repel it than by avoiding idleness, to\nbe still seriously busied about some matters of importance, to drive out\nthose vain fears, foolish fantasies and irksome suspicions out of his head,\nand then to be persuaded by his judicious friends, to give ear to their\ngood counsel and advice, and wisely to consider, how much he discredits\nhimself, his friends, dishonours his children, disgraceth his family,\npublisheth his shame, and as a trumpeter of his own misery, divulgeth,\nmacerates, grieves himself and others; what an argument of weakness it is,\nhow absurd a thing in its own nature, how ridiculous, how brutish a\npassion, how sottish, how odious; for as [6172]Hierome well hath it, _Odium\nsui facit, et ipse novissime sibi odio est_, others hate him, and at last\nhe hates himself for it; how harebrain a disease, mad and furious. If he\nwill but hear them speak, no doubt he may be cured. [6173]Joan, queen of\nSpain, of whom I have formerly spoken, under pretence of changing air was\nsent to Complutum, or Alcada de las Heneras, where Ximenius the archbishop\nof Toledo then lived, that by his good counsel (as for the present she was)\nshe might be eased. [6174]\"For a disease of the soul, if concealed,\ntortures and overturns it, and by no physic can sooner be removed than by a\ndiscreet man's comfortable speeches.\" I will not here insert any\nconsolatory sentences to this purpose, or forestall any man's invention,\nbut leave it every one to dilate and amplify as he shall think fit in his\nown judgment: let him advise with Siracides _cap. 9. 1._ \"Be not jealous\nover the wife of thy bosom;\" read that comfortable and pithy speech to this\npurpose of Ximenius, in the author himself, as it is recorded by Gomesius;\nconsult with Chaloner _lib. 9. de repub. Anglor._ or Caelia in her\nepistles, &c. Only this I will add, that if it be considered aright, which\ncauseth this jealous passion, be it just or unjust, whether with or without\ncause, true or false, it ought not so heinously to be taken; 'tis no such\nreal or capital matter, that it should make so deep a wound. 'Tis a blow\nthat hurts not, an insensible smart, grounded many times upon false\nsuspicion alone, and so fostered by a sinister conceit. If she be not\ndishonest, he troubles and macerates himself without a cause; or put case\nwhich is the worst, he be a cuckold, it cannot be helped, the more he stirs\nin it, the more he aggravates his own misery. How much better were it in\nsuch a case to dissemble or contemn it? why should that be feared which\ncannot be redressed? _multae tandem deposuerunt_ (saith [6175]Vives) _quum\nflecti maritos non posse vident_, many women, when they see there is no\nremedy, have been pacified; and shall men be more jealous than women? 'Tis\nsome comfort in such a case to have companions, _Solamen miseris socios\nhabuisse doloris_; Who can say he is free? Who can assure himself he is not\none _de praeterito_, or secure himself _de futuro_? If it were his case\nalone, it were hard; but being as it is almost a common calamity, 'tis not\nso grievously to be taken. If a man have a lock, which every man's key will\nopen, as well as his own, why should he think to keep it private to\nhimself? In some countries they make nothing of it, _ne nobiles quidem_,\nsaith [6176]Leo Afer, in many parts of Africa (if she be past fourteen)\nthere's not a nobleman that marries a maid, or that hath a chaste wife;\n'tis so common; as the moon gives horns once a month to the world, do they\nto their husbands at least. And 'tis most part true which that Caledonian\nlady, [6177]Argetocovus, a British prince's wife, told Julia Augusta, when\nshe took her up for dishonesty, \"We Britons are naught at least with some\nfew choice men of the better sort, but you Romans lie with every base\nknave, you are a company of common whores.\" Severus the emperor in his time\nmade laws for the restraint of this vice; and as [6178]Dion Nicaeus relates\nin his life, _tria millia maechorum_, three thousand cuckold-makers, or\n_naturae monetam adulterantes_, as Philo calls them, false coiners, and\nclippers of nature's money, were summoned into the court at once. And yet,\n_Non omnem molitor quae fluit undam videt_, \"the miller sees not all the\nwater that goes by his mill:\" no doubt, but, as in our days, these were of\nthe commonalty, all the great ones were not so much as called in question\nfor it. [6179]Martial's Epigram I suppose might have been generally applied\nin those licentious times, _Omnia solus habes_, &c., thy goods, lands,\nmoney, wits are thine own, _Uxorem sed habes Candide cum populo_; but\nneighbour Candidus your wife is common: husband and cuckold in that age it\nseems were reciprocal terms; the emperors themselves did wear Actaeon's\nbadge; how many Caesars might I reckon up together, and what a catalogue of\ncornuted kings and princes in every story? Agamemnon, Menelaus, Philippus\nof Greece, Ptolomeus of Egypt, Lucullus, Caesar, Pompeius, Cato, Augustus,\nAntonius, Antoninus, &c., that wore fair plumes of bull's feathers in their\ncrests. The bravest soldiers and most heroical spirits could not avoid it.\nThey have been active and passive in this business, they have either given\nor taken horns. [6180]King Arthur, whom we call one of the nine worthies,\nfor all his great valour, was unworthily served by Mordred, one of his\nround table knights: and Guithera, or Helena Alba, his fair wife, as Leland\ninterprets it, was an arrant honest woman. _Parcerem libenter_ (saith mine\n[6181]author) _Heroinarum laesae majestati, si non historiae veritas aurem\nvellicaret_, I could willingly wink at a fair lady's faults, but that I am\nbound by the laws of history to tell the truth: against his will, God\nknows, did he write it, and so do I repeat it. I speak not of our times all\nthis while, we have good, honest, virtuous men and women, whom fame, zeal,\nfear of God, religion and superstition contains: and yet for all that, we\nhave many knights of this order, so dubbed by their wives, many good women\nabused by dissolute husbands. In some places, and such persons you may as\nsoon enjoin them to carry water in a sieve, as to keep themselves honest.\nWhat shall a man do now in such a case? What remedy is to be had? how shall\nhe be eased? By suing a divorce? this is hard to be effected: _si non\ncaste, tamen caute_ they carry the matter so cunningly, that though it be\nas common as simony, as clear and as manifest as the nose in a man's face,\nyet it cannot be evidently proved, or they likely taken in the fact: they\nwill have a knave Gallus to watch, or with that Roman [6182]Sulpitia, all\nmade fast and sure,\n\n       \"Ne se Cadurcis destitutam fasciis,\n        Nudam Caleno concumbentem videat.\"\n\n\"she will hardly be surprised by her husband, be he never so wary.\" Much\nbetter then to put it up: the more he strives in it, the more he shall\ndivulge his own shame: make a virtue of necessity, and conceal it. Yea, but\nthe world takes notice of it, 'tis in every man's mouth: let them talk\ntheir pleasure, of whom speak they not in this sense? From the highest to\nthe lowest they are thus censured all: there is no remedy then but\npatience. It may be 'tis his own fault, and he hath no reason to complain,\n'tis _quid pro quo_, she is bad, he is worse: [6183]\"Bethink thyself, hast\nthou not done as much for some of thy neighbours? why dost thou require\nthat of thy wife, which thou wilt not perform thyself?\" Thou rangest like a\ntown bull, [6184]\"why art thou so incensed if she tread, awry?\"\n\n[6185] \"Be it that some woman break chaste wedlock's laws,\n        And leaves her husband and becomes unchaste:\n        Yet commonly it is not without cause,\n        She sees her man in sin her goods to waste,\n        She feels that he his love from her withdraws,\n        And hath on some perhaps less worthy placed.\n        Who strike with sword, the scabbard them may strike,\n        And sure love craveth love, like asketh like.\"\n\n_Ea semper studebit_, saith [6186]Nevisanus, _pares reddere vices_, she\nwill quit it if she can. And therefore, as well adviseth Siracides, _cap.\nix. 1._ \"teach her not an evil lesson against thyself,\" which as Jansenius,\nLyranus, on his text, and Carthusianus interpret, is no otherwise to be\nunderstood than that she do thee not a mischief. I do not excuse her in\naccusing thee; but if both be naught, mend thyself first; for as the old\nsaying is, a good husband makes a good wife.\n\nYea but thou repliest, 'tis not the like reason betwixt man and woman,\nthrough her fault my children are bastards, I may not endure it; [6187]_Sit\namarulenta, sit imperiosa prodiga_, &c. Let her scold, brawl, and spend, I\ncare not, _modo sit casta_, so she be honest, I could easily bear it; but\nthis I cannot, I may not, I will not; \"my faith, my fame, mine eye must not\nbe touched,\" as the diverb is, _Non patitur tactum fama, fides, oculus._ I\nsay the same of my wife, touch all, use all, take all but this. I\nacknowledge that of Seneca to be true, _Nullius boni jucunda possessio sine\nsocio_, there is no sweet content in the possession of any good thing\nwithout a companion, this only excepted, I say, \"This.\" And why this? Even\nthis which thou so much abhorrest, it may be for thy progeny's good, [6188]\nbetter be any man's son than thine, to be begot of base Irus, poor Seius,\nor mean Mevius, the town swineherd's, a shepherd's son: and well is he,\nthat like Hercules he hath any two fathers; for thou thyself hast\nperadventure more diseases than a horse, more infirmities of body and mind,\na cankered soul, crabbed conditions, make the worst of it, as it is _vulnus\ninsanabile, sic vulnus insensibile_, as it is incurable, so it is\ninsensible. But art thou sure it is so? [6189]_res agit ille tuas_? \"doth\nhe so indeed?\" It may be thou art over-suspicious, and without a cause as\nsome are: if it be _octimestris partus_, born at eight months, or like him,\nand him, they fondly suspect he got it; if she speak or laugh familiarly\nwith such or such men, then presently she is naught with them; such is thy\nweakness; whereas charity, or a well-disposed mind, would interpret all\nunto the best. St. Francis, by chance seeing a friar familiarly kissing\nanother man's wife, was so far from misconceiving it, that he presently\nkneeled down and thanked God there was so much charity left: but they on\nthe other side will ascribe nothing to natural causes, indulge nothing to\nfamiliarity, mutual society, friendship: but out of a sinister suspicion,\npresently lock them close, watch them, thinking by those means to prevent\nall such inconveniences, that's the way to help it; whereas by such tricks\nthey do aggravate the mischief. 'Tis but in vain to watch that which will\naway.\n\n[6190] \"Nec custodiri si velit ulla potest;\n        Nec mentem servare potes, licet omnia serves;\n        Omnibus exclusis, intus adulter erit.\"\n\n       \"None can be kept resisting for her part;\n        Though body be kept close, within her heart\n        Advoutry lurks, t'exclude it there's no art.\"\n\nArgus with a hundred eyes cannot keep her, _et hunc unus saepe fefellit\namor_, as in [6191]Ariosto,\n\n       \"If all our hearts were eyes, yet sure they said\n        We husbands of our wives should be betrayed.\"\n\nHierome holds, _Uxor impudica servari non potest, pudica non debet, infida\ncustos castitatis est necessitas_, to what end is all your custody? A\ndishonest woman cannot be kept, an honest woman ought not to be kept,\nnecessity is a keeper not to be trusted. _Difficile custoditur, quod plures\namant_; that which many covet, can hardly be preserved, as [6192]\nSalisburiensis thinks. I am of Aeneas Sylvius' mind, [6193]\"Those jealous\nItalians do very ill to lock up their wives; for women are of such a\ndisposition, they will most covet that which is denied most, and offend\nleast when they have free liberty to trespass.\" It is in vain to lock her\nup if she be dishonest; _et tyrranicum imperium_, as our great Mr.\nAristotle calls it, too tyrannical a task, most unfit: for when she\nperceives her husband observes her and suspects, _liberius peccat_, saith\n[6194]Nevisanus. [6195]_Toxica Zelotypo dedit uxor moecha marito_, she is\nexasperated, seeks by all means to vindicate herself, and will therefore\noffend, because she is unjustly suspected. The best course then is to let\nthem have their own wills, give them free liberty, without any keeping.\n\n       \"In vain our friends from this do us dehort,\n        For beauty will be where is most resort.\"\n\nIf she be honest as Lucretia to Collatinus, Laodamia to Protesilaus,\nPenelope to her Ulysses, she will so continue her honour, good name,\ncredit, _Penelope conjux semper Ulyssis ero_; \"I shall always be Penelope\nthe wife of Ulysses.\" And as Phocias' wife in [6196]Plutarch, called her\nhusband \"her wealth, treasure, world, joy, delight, orb and sphere,\" she\nwill hers. The vow she made unto her good man; love, virtue, religion,\nzeal, are better keepers than all those locks, eunuchs, prisons; she will\nnot be moved:\n\n[6197] \"At mihi vel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat,\n        Aut pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras,\n        Pallentes umbras Erebi, noctemque profundam,\n        Ante pudor quam te violem, aut tua jura resolvam.\"\n\n       \"First I desire the earth to swallow me.\n        Before I violate mine honesty,\n        Or thunder from above drive me to hell,\n        With those pale ghosts, and ugly nights to dwell.\"\n\nShe is resolved with Dido to be chaste; though her husband be false, she\nwill be true: and as Octavia writ to her Antony,\n\n[6198] \"These walls that here do keep me out of sight,\n        Shall keep me all unspotted unto thee,\n        And testify that I will do thee right,\n        I'll never stain thine house, though thou shame me.\"\n\nTurn her loose to all those Tarquins and Satyrs, she will not be tempted.\nIn the time of Valence the Emperor, saith [6199]St. Austin, one Archidamus,\na Consul of Antioch, offered a hundred pounds of gold to a fair young wife,\nand besides to set her husband free, who was then _sub gravissima\ncustodia_, a dark prisoner, _pro unius noctis concubitu_: but the chaste\nmatron would not accept of it. [6200]When Ode commended Theana's fine arm\nto his fellows, she took him up short, \"Sir, 'tis not common:\" she is\nwholly reserved to her husband. [6201]Bilia had an old man to her spouse,\nand his breath stunk, so that nobody could abide it abroad; \"coming home\none day he reprehended his wife, because she did not tell him of it: she\nvowed unto him, she had told him, but she thought every man's breath had\nbeen as strong as his.\" [6202]Tigranes and Armena his lady were invited to\nsupper by King Cyrus: when they came home, Tigranes asked his wife, how she\nliked Cyrus, and what she did especially commend in him? \"she swore she did\nnot observe him; when he replied again, what then she did observe, whom she\nlooked on? She made answer, her husband, that said he would die for her\nsake.\" Such are the properties and conditions of good women: and if she be\nwell given, she will so carry herself; if otherwise she be naught, use all\nthe means thou canst, she will be naught, _Non deest animus sed corruptor_,\nshe hath so many lies, excuses, as a hare hath muses, tricks, panders,\nbawds, shifts, to deceive, 'tis to no purpose to keep her up, or to reclaim\nher by hard usage. \"Fair means peradventure may do somewhat.\" [6203]\n_Obsequio vinces aptius ipse tuo._ Men and women are both in a predicament\nin this behalf, no sooner won, and better pacified. _Duci volunt, non\ncogi_: though she be as arrant a scold as Xanthippe, as cruel as Medea, as\nclamorous as Hecuba, as lustful as Messalina, by such means (if at all) she\nmay be reformed. Many patient [6204]Grizels, by their obsequiousness in\nthis kind, have reclaimed their husbands from their wandering lusts. In\nNova Francia and Turkey (as Leah, Rachel, and Sarah did to Abraham and\nJacob) they bring their fairest damsels to their husbands' beds; Livia\nseconded the lustful appetites of Augustus: Stratonice, wife to King\nDiotarus, did not only bring Electra, a fair maid, to her good man's bed,\nbut brought up the children begot on her, as carefully as if they had been\nher own. Tertius Emilius' wife, Cornelia's mother, perceiving her husband's\nintemperance, _rem dissimulavit_, made much of the maid, and would take no\nnotice of it. A new-married man, when a pickthank friend of his, to curry\nfavour, had showed him his wife familiar in private with a young gallant,\ncourting and dallying, &c. Tush, said he, let him do his worst, I dare\ntrust my wife, though I dare not trust him. The best remedy then is by fair\nmeans; if that will not take place, to dissemble it as I say, or turn it\noff with a jest: hear Guexerra's advice in this case, _vel joco excipies,\nvel silentio eludes_; for if you take exceptions at everything your wife\ndoth, Solomon's wisdom, Hercules' valour, Homer's learning, Socrates'\npatience, Argus' vigilance, will not serve turn. Therefore _Minus malum_,\n[6205]a less mischief, Nevisanus holds, _dissimulare_, to be [6206]_Cunarum\nemptor_, a buyer of cradles, as the proverb is, than to be too solicitous.\n[6207]\"A good fellow, when his wife was brought to bed before her time,\nbought half a dozen of cradles beforehand for so many children, as if his\nwife should continue to bear children every two months.\" [6208]Pertinax the\nEmperor, when one told him a fiddler was too familiar with his empress,\nmade no reckoning of it. And when that Macedonian Philip was upbraided with\nhis wife's dishonesty, _cum tot victor regnorum ac populorum esset_, &c., a\nconqueror of kingdoms could not tame his wife (for she thrust him out of\ndoors), he made a jest of it. _Sapientes portant cornua in pectore, stulti\nin fronte_, saith Nevisanus, wise men bear their horns in their hearts,\nfools on their foreheads. Eumenes, king of Pergamus, was at deadly feud\nwith Perseus of Macedonia, insomuch that Perseus hearing of a journey he\nwas to take to Delphos, [6209]set a company of soldiers to intercept him in\nhis passage; they did it accordingly, and as they supposed left him stoned\nto death. The news of this fact was brought instantly to Pergamus; Attalus,\nEumenes' brother, proclaimed himself king forthwith, took possession of the\ncrown, and married Stratonice the queen. But by-and-by, when contrary news\nwas brought, that King Eumenes was alive, and now coming to the city, he\nlaid by his crown, left his wife, as a private man went to meet him, and\ncongratulate his return. Eumenes, though he knew all particulars passed,\nyet dissembling the matter, kindly embraced his brother, and took his wife\ninto his favour again, as if on such matter had been heard of or done.\nJocundo, in Ariosto, found his wife in bed with a knave, both asleep, went\nhis ways, and would not so much as wake them, much less reprove them for\nit. [6210]An honest fellow finding in like sort his wife had played false\nat tables, and borne a man too many, drew his dagger, and swore if he had\nnot been his very friend, he would have killed him. Another hearing one had\ndone that for him, which no man desires to be done by a deputy, followed in\na rage with his sword drawn, and having overtaken him, laid adultery to his\ncharge; the offender hotly pursued, confessed it was true; with which\nconfession he was satisfied, and so left him, swearing that if he had\ndenied it, he would not have put it up. How much better is it to do thus,\nthan to macerate himself, impatiently to rave and rage, to enter an action\n(as Arnoldus Tilius did in the court of Toulouse, against Martin Guerre his\nfellow-soldier, for that he counterfeited his habit, and was too familiar\nwith his wife), so to divulge his own shame, and to remain for ever a\ncuckold on record? how much better be Cornelius Tacitus than Publius\nCornutus, to condemn in such cases, or take no notice of it? _Melius sic\nerrare, quam Zelotypiae curis_, saith Erasmus, _se conficere_, better be a\nwittol and put it up, than to trouble himself to no purpose. And though he\nwill not _omnibus dormire_, be an ass, as he is an ox, yet to wink at it as\nmany do is not amiss at some times, in some cases, to some parties, if it\nbe for his commodity, or some great man's sake, his landlord, patron,\nbenefactor, (as Calbas the Roman saith [6211]Plutarch did by Maecenas, and\nPhayllus of Argos did by King Philip, when he promised him an office on\nthat condition he might lie with his wife) and so let it pass:\n\n[6212] \"pol me haud poenitet,\n        Scilicet boni dimidium dividere cum Jove,\"\n\n\"it never troubles me\" (saith Amphitrio) \"to be cornuted by Jupiter,\" let\nit not molest thee then; be friends with her;\n\n[6213] \"Tu cum Alcmena uxore antiquam in gratiam\n        Redi\"------\n\n\"Receive Alcmena to your grace again;\" let it, I say, make no breach of\nlove between you. Howsoever the best way is to contemn it, which\n[6214]Henry II. king of France advised a courtier of his, jealous of his\nwife, and complaining of her unchasteness, to reject it, and comfort\nhimself; for he that suspects his wife's incontinency, and fears the Pope's\ncurse, shall never live a merry hour, or sleep a quiet night: no remedy but\npatience. When all is done according to that counsel of [6215]Nevisanus,\n_si vitium uxoris corrigi non potest, ferendum est_: if it may not be\nhelped, it must be endured. _Date veniam et sustinete taciti_, 'tis\nSophocles' advice, keep it to thyself, and which Chrysostom calls\n_palaestram philosophiae, et domesticum gymnasium_ a school of philosophy,\nput it up. There is no other cure but time to wear it out, _Injuriarum\nremedium est oblivio_, as if they had drunk a draught of Lethe in\nTrophonius' den: to conclude, age will bereave her of it, dies _dolorem\nminuit_, time and patience must end it.\n\n[6216] \"The mind's affections patience will appease,\n        It passions kills, and healeth each disease.\"\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_By prevention before, or after Marriage, Plato's Community,\nmarry a Courtesan, Philters, Stews, to marry one equal in years, fortunes,\nof a good family, education, good place, to use them well, &c._\n\nOf such medicines as conduce to the cure of this malady, I have\nsufficiently treated; there be some good remedies remaining, by way of\nprevention, precautions, or admonitions, which if rightly practised, may do\nmuch good. Plato, in his Commonwealth, to prevent this mischief belike,\nwould have all things, wives and children, all as one: and which Caesar in\nhis Commentaries observed of those old Britons, that first inhabited this\nland, they had ten or twelve wives allotted to such a family, or\npromiscuously to be used by so many men; not one to one, as with us, or\nfour, five, or six to one, as in Turkey. The [6217]Nicholaites, a set that\nsprang, saith Austin, from Nicholas the deacon, would have women\nindifferent; and the cause of this filthy sect, was Nicholas the deacon's\njealousy, for which when he was condemned to purge himself of his offence,\nhe broached his heresy, that it was lawful to lie with one another's wives,\nand for any man to lie with his: like to those [6218]Anabaptists in\nMunster, that would consort with other men's wives as the spirit moved\nthem: or as [6219]Mahomet, the seducing prophet, would needs use women as\nhe list himself, to beget prophets; two hundred and five, their Alcoran\nsaith, were in love with him, and [6220]he as able as forty men. Amongst\nthe old Carthaginians, as [6221]Bohemus relates out of Sabellicus., the\nking of the country lay with the bride the first night, and once in a year\nthey went promiscuously all together. Munster _Cosmog. lib. 3. cap. 497._\nascribes the beginning of this brutish custom (unjustly) to one Picardus, a\nFrenchman, that invented a new sect of Adamites, to go naked as Adam did,\nand to use promiscuous venery at set times. When the priest repeated that\nof Genesis, \"Increase and multiply,\" out [6222]went the candles in the\nplace where they met, \"and without all respect of age, persons, conditions,\ncatch that catch may, every man took her that came next,\" &c.; some fasten\nthis on those ancient Bohemians and Russians: [6223]others on the\ninhabitants of Mambrium, in the Lucerne valley in Piedmont; and, as I read,\nit was practised in Scotland amongst Christians themselves, until King\nMalcolm's time, the king or the lord of the town had their maidenheads. In\nsome parts of [6224]India in our age, and those [6225]islanders, [6226]as\namongst the Babylonians of old, they will prostitute their wives and\ndaughters (which Chalcocondila, a Greek modern writer, for want of better\nintelligence, puts upon us Britons) to such travellers or seafaring men as\ncome amongst them by chance, to show how far they were from this feral vice\nof jealousy, and how little they esteemed it. The kings of Calecut, as\n[6227]Lod. Vertomannus relates, will not touch their wives, till one of\ntheir Biarmi or high priests have lain first with them, to sanctify their\nwombs. But those Esai and Montanists, two strange sects of old, were in\nanother extreme, they would not marry at all, or have any society with\nwomen, [6228]\"because of their intemperance they held them all to be\nnaught.\" Nevisanus the lawyer, _lib. 4. num. 33. sylv. nupt._ would have\nhim that is inclined to this malady, to prevent the worst, marry a quean,\n_Capiens meretricem, hoc habet saltem boni quod non decipitur, quia scit\neam sic esse, quod non contingit aliis_. A fornicator in Seneca\nconstuprated two wenches in a night; for satisfaction, the one desired to\nhang him, the other to marry him. [6229] Hierome, king of Syracuse in\nSicily, espoused himself to Pitho, keeper of the stews; and Ptolemy took\nThais a common whore to be his wife, had two sons, Leontiscus and Lagus by\nher, and one daughter Irene: 'tis therefore no such unlikely thing. [6230]A\ncitizen of Engubine gelded himself to try his wife's honesty, and to be\nfreed from jealousy; so did a baker in [6231] Basil, to the same intent.\nBut of all other precedents in this kind, that of [6232]Combalus is most\nmemorable; who to prevent his master's suspicion, for he was a beautiful\nyoung man, and sent by Seleucus his lord and king, with Stratonice the\nqueen to conduct her into Syria, fearing the worst, gelded himself before\nhe went, and left his genitals behind him in a box sealed up. His mistress\nby the way fell in love with him, but he not yielding to her, was accused\nto Seleucus of incontinency, (as that Bellerophon was in like case, falsely\ntraduced by Sthenobia, to King Praetus her husband, _cum non posset ad\ncoitum inducere)_ and that by her, and was therefore at his corning home\ncast into prison: the day of hearing appointed, he was sufficiently cleared\nand acquitted, by showing his privities, which to the admiration of the\nbeholders he had formerly cut off. The Lydians used to geld women whom they\nsuspected, saith Leonicus _var. hist. Tib. 3. cap. 49._ as well as men. To\nthis purpose [6233]Saint Francis, because he used to confess women in\nprivate, to prevent suspicion, and prove himself a maid, stripped himself\nbefore the Bishop of Assise and others: and Friar Leonard for the same\ncause went through Viterbium in Italy, without any garments.\n\nOur pseudo-Catholics, to help these inconveniences which proceed from\njealousy, to keep themselves and their wives honest, make severe laws;\nagainst adultery present death; and withal fornication, a venal sin, as a\nsink to convey that furious and swift stream of concupiscence, they appoint\nand permit stews, those punks and pleasant sinners, the more to secure\ntheir wives in all populous cities, for they hold them as necessary as\nchurches; and howsoever unlawful, yet to avoid a greater mischief, to be\ntolerated in policy, as usury, for the hardness of men's hearts; and for\nthis end they have whole colleges of courtesans in their towns and cities.\nOf [6234]Cato's mind belike, that would have his servants (_cum ancillis\ncongredi coitus causa, definito aere, ut graviora facinora evitarent,\ncaeteris interim interdicens_) familiar with some such feminine creatures,\nto avoid worse mischiefs in his house, and made allowance for it. They hold\nit impossible for idle persons, young, rich, and lusty, so many servants,\nmonks, friars, to live honest, too tyrannical a burden to compel them to be\nchaste, and most unfit to suffer poor men, younger brothers and soldiers at\nall to marry, as those diseased persons, votaries, priests, servants.\nTherefore, as well to keep and ease the one as the other, they tolerate and\nwink at these kind of brothel-houses and stews. Many probable arguments\nthey have to prove the lawfulness, the necessity, and a toleration of them,\nas of usury; and without question in policy they are not to be\ncontradicted: but altogether in religion. Others prescribe filters, spells,\ncharms to keep men and women honest. [6235]_Mulier ut alienum virum non\nadmittat praeter suum: Accipe fel hirci, et adipem, et exsicca, calescat in\noleo, &c., et non alium praeter et amabit. In Alexi. Porta, &c., plura\ninvenies, et multo his absurdiora, uti et in Rhasi, ne mulier virum\nadmittat, et maritum solum diligat_, &c. But these are most part Pagan,\nimpious, irreligious, absurd, and ridiculous devices.\n\nThe best means to avoid these and like inconveniences are, to take away the\ncauses and occasions. To this purpose [6236]Varro writ _Satyram Menippeam_,\nbut it is lost. [6237]Patritius prescribes four rules to be observed in\nchoosing of a wife (which who so will may read); Fonseca, the Spaniard, in\nhis _45. c. Amphitheat. Amoris_, sets down six special cautions for men,\nfour for women; Sam. Neander out of Shonbernerus, five for men, five for\nwomen; Anthony Guivarra many good lessons; [6238]Cleobulus two alone,\nothers otherwise; as first to make a good choice in marriage, to invite\nChrist to their wedding, and which [6239]St. Ambrose adviseth, _Deum\nconjugii praesidem habere_, and to pray to him for her, _A Domino enim\ndatur uxor prudens_, Prov. xix. ) not to be too rash and precipitate in his\nelection, to run upon the first he meets, or dote on every stout fair piece\nhe sees, but to choose her as much by his ears as eyes, to be well advised\nwhom he takes, of what age, &c., and cautelous in his proceedings. An old\nman should not marry a young woman, nor a young woman an old man, [6240]\n_Quam male inaequales veniunt ad arata juvenci!_ such matches must needs\nminister a perpetual cause of suspicion, and be distasteful to each other.\n\n[6241] \"Noctua ut in tumulis, super atque cadavera bubo,\n        Talis apud Sophoclem nostra puella sedet.\"\n\n       \"Night-crows on tombs, owl sits on carcass dead,\n        So lies a wench with Sophocles in bed.\"\n\nFor Sophocles, as [6242]Atheneus describes him, was a very old man, as cold\nas January, a bedfellow of bones, and doted yet upon Archippe, a young\ncourtesan, than which nothing can be more odious. [6243]_Senex maritus\nuxori juveni ingratus est_, an old man is a most unwelcome guest to a young\nwench, unable, unfit:\n\n[6244] \"Amplexus suos fugiunt puellae,\n        Omnis horret amor Venusque Hymenque.\"\n\nAnd as in like case a good fellow that had but a peck of corn weekly to\ngrind, yet would needs build a new mill for it, found his error eftsoons,\nfor either he must let his mill lie waste, pull it quite down, or let\nothers grind at it. So these men, &c.\n\nSeneca therefore disallows all such unseasonable matches, _habent enim\nmaledicti locum crebrae nuptiae._ And as [6245]Tully farther inveighs,\n\"'tis unfit for any, but ugly and filthy in old age.\" _Turpe senilis amor_,\none of the three things [6246]God hateth. Plutarch, in his book _contra\nColeten_, rails downright at such kind of marriages, which are attempted by\nold men, _qui jam corpore impotenti, et a voluptatibus deserti, peccant\nanimo_, and makes a question whether in some cases it be tolerable at least\nfor such a man to marry,--_qui Venerem affectat sine viribus_, \"that is now\npast those venerous exercises,\" \"as a gelded man lies with a virgin and\nsighs,\" Ecclus. xxx. 20, and now complains with him in Petronius, _funerata\nest haec pars jam, quad fuit olim Achillea_, he is quite done,\n\n[6247] \"Vixit puellae nuper idoneus,\n        Et militavit non sine gloria.\"\n\nBut the question is whether he may delight himself as those Priapeian\npopes, which, in their decrepit age, lay commonly between two wenches every\nnight, _contactu formosarum, et contrectatione, num adhuc gaudeat_; and as\nmany doting sires do to their own shame, their children's undoing, and\ntheir families' confusion: he abhors it, _tanquam ab agresti et furioso\ndomino fugiendum_, it must be avoided as a bedlam master, and not obeyed.\n\n[6248] \"Alecto------\n        Ipsa faces praefert nubentibus, et malus Hymen\n        Triste ululat,\"------\n\nthe devil himself makes such matches. [6249]Levinus Lemnius reckons up\nthree things which generally disturb the peace of marriage: the first is\nwhen they marry intempestive or unseasonably, \"as many mortal men marry\nprecipitately and inconsiderately, when they are effete and old: the second\nwhen they marry unequally for fortunes and birth: the third, when a sick\nimpotent person weds one that is sound, _novae nuptae spes frustratur_:\nmany dislikes instantly follow.\" Many doting dizzards, it may not be\ndenied, as Plutarch confesseth, [6250]\"recreate themselves with such\nobsolete, unseasonable and filthy remedies\" (so he calls them), \"with a\nremembrance of their former pleasures, against nature they stir up their\ndead flesh:\" but an old lecher is abominable; _mulier tertio nubens_,\n[6251]Nevisanus holds, _praesumitur lubrica, et inconstans_, a woman that\nmarries a third time may be presumed to be no honester than she should. Of\nthem both, thus Ambrose concludes in his comment upon Luke, [6252]\"they\nthat are coupled together, not to get children, but to satisfy their lust,\nare not husbands, but fornicators,\" with whom St. Austin consents:\nmatrimony without hope of children, _non matrimonium, sed concubium dici\ndebet_, is not a wedding but a jumbling or coupling together. In a word\n(except they wed for mutual society, help and comfort one of another, in\nwhich respects, though [6253]Tiberius deny it, without question old folks\nmay well marry) for sometimes a man hath most need of a wife, according to\nPuccius, when he hath no need of a wife; otherwise it is most odious, when\nan old Acherontic dizzard, that hath one foot in his grave, _a\nsilicernium_, shall flicker after a young wench that is blithe and bonny,\n\n[6254]  ------\"salaciorque\n        Verno passere, et albulis columbis.\"\n\nWhat can be more detestable?\n\n[6255] \"Tu cano capite amas senex nequissime\n        Jam plenus aetatis, animaque foetida,\n        Senex hircosus tu osculare mulierem?\n        Utine adiens vomitum potius excuties.\"\n\n       \"Thou old goat, hoary lecher, naughty man,\n        With stinking breath, art thou in love?\n        Must thou be slavering? she spews to see\n        Thy filthy face, it doth so move.\"\n\nYet, as some will, it is much more tolerable for an old man to marry a\nyoung woman (our ladies' match they call it) for _cras erit mulier_, as he\nsaid in Tully. Cato the Roman, Critobulus in [6256]Xenophon,\n[6257]Tiraquellus of late, Julius Scaliger, &c., and many famous precedents\nwe have in that kind; but not _e contra_: 'tis not held fit for an ancient\nwoman to match with a young man. For as Varro will, _Anus dum ludit morti\ndelitias facit_, 'tis Charon's match between [6258]Cascus and Casca, and\nthe devil himself is surely well pleased with it. And, therefore, as the\n[6259]poet inveighs, thou old Vetustina bedridden quean, that art now skin\nand bones,\n\n       \"Cui tres capilli, quatuorque sunt dentes,\n        Pectus cicadae, crusculumque formicae,\n        Rugosiorem quae geris stola frontem,\n        Et arenaram cassibus pares mammas.\"\n\n       \"That hast three hairs, four teeth, a breast\n        Like grasshopper, an emmet's crest,\n        A skin more rugged than thy coat,\n        And drugs like spider's web to boot.\"\n\nMust thou marry a youth again? And yet _ducentas ire nuptum post mortes\namant_: howsoever it is, as [6260]Apuleius gives out of his Meroe,\n_congressus annosus, pestilens, abhorrendus_, a pestilent match,\nabominable, and not to be endured. In such case how can they otherwise\nchoose but be jealous, how should they agree one with another? This\ninequality is not in years only, but in birth, fortunes, conditions, and\nall good [6261]qualities, _si qua voles apte nubere, nube pari_, 'tis my\ncounsel, saith Anthony Guiverra, to choose such a one. _Civis Civem ducat,\nNobilis Nobilem_, let a citizen match with a citizen, a gentleman with a\ngentlewoman; he that observes not this precept (saith he) _non generum sed\nmalum Genium, non nurum sed Furiam, non vitae Comitem, sed litis fomitem\ndomi habebit_, instead of a fair wife shall have a fury, for a fit\nson-in-law a mere fiend, &c. examples are too frequent.\n\nAnother main caution fit to be observed is this, that though they be equal\nin years, birth, fortunes, and other conditions, yet they do not omit\nvirtue and good education, which Musonius and Antipater so much inculcate\nin Stobeus:\n\n[6262] \"Dos est magna parentum\n        Virtus, et metuens alterius viri\n        Certo foedere castitas.\"\n\nIf, as Plutarch adviseth, one must eat _modium salis_, a bushel of salt\nwith him, before he choose his friend, what care should be had in choosing\na wife, his second self, how solicitous should he be to know her qualities\nand behaviour; and when he is assured of them, not to prefer birth,\nfortune, beauty, before bringing up, and good conditions. [6263]Coquage god\nof cuckolds, as one merrily said, accompanies the goddess Jealousy, both\nfollow the fairest, by Jupiter's appointment, and they sacrifice to them\ntogether: beauty and honesty seldom agree; straight personages have often\ncrooked manners; fair faces, foul vices; good complexions, ill conditions.\n_Suspicionis plena res est, et insidiarum_, beauty (saith [6264]Chrysostom)\nis full of treachery and suspicion: he that hath a fair wife, cannot have a\nworse mischief, and yet most covet it, as if nothing else in marriage but\nthat and wealth were to be respected. [6265]Francis Sforza, Duke of Milan,\nwas so curious in this behalf, that he would not marry the Duke of Mantua's\ndaughter, except he might see her naked first: which Lycurgus appointed in\nhis laws, and Morus in his Utopian Commonwealth approves. [6266]In Italy,\nas a traveller observes, if a man have three or four daughters, or more,\nand they prove fair, they are married eftsoons: if deformed, they change\ntheir lovely names of Lucia, Cynthia, Camaena, call them Dorothy, Ursula,\nBridget, and so put them into monasteries, as if none were fit for\nmarriage, but such as are eminently fair: but these are erroneous tenets: a\nmodest virgin well conditioned, to such a fair snout-piece, is much to be\npreferred. If thou wilt avoid them, take away all causes of suspicion and\njealousy, marry a coarse piece, fetch her from Cassandra's [6267]temple,\nwhich was wont in Italy to be a sanctuary of all deformed maids, and so\nshalt thou be sure that no man will make thee cuckold, but for spite. A\ncitizen of Bizance in France had a filthy, dowdy, deformed slut to his\nwife, and finding her in bed with another man, cried out as one amazed; _O\nmiser! quae te necessitas huc adegit_? O thou wretch, what necessity\nbrought thee hither? as well he might; for who can affect such a one? But\nthis is warily to be understood, most offend in another extreme, they\nprefer wealth before beauty, and so she be rich, they care not how she\nlook; but these are all out as faulty as the rest. _Attendenda uxoris\nforma_, as [6268]Salisburiensis adviseth, _ne si alteram aspexeris, mox eam\nsordere putes_, as the Knight in Chaucer, that was married to an old woman,\n\n       _And all day after hid him as an owl,\n        So woe was his wife looked so foul_.\n\nHave a care of thy wife's complexion, lest whilst thou seest another, thou\nloathest her, she prove jealous, thou naught,\n\n[6269] \"Si tibi deformis conjux, si serva venusta,\n        Ne utaris serva,\"------\n\nI can perhaps give instance. _Molestum est possidere, quod nemo habere\ndignetur_, a misery to possess that which no man likes: on the other side,\n_Difficile custoditur quod plures amant._ And as the bragging soldier\nvaunted in the comedy, _nimia est miseria pulchrum esse hominem nimis._\nScipio did never so hardly besiege Carthage, as these young gallants will\nbeset thine house, one with wit or person, another with wealth, &c. If she\nhe fair, saith Guazzo, she will be suspected howsoever. Both extremes are\nnaught, _Pulchra cito adamatur, foeda facile concupiscit_, the one is soon\nbeloved, the other loves: one is hardly kept, because proud and arrogant,\nthe other not worth keeping; what is to be done in this case? Ennius in\nMenelippe adviseth thee as a friend to take _statam formam, si vis habere\nincolumem pudicitiam_, one of a middle size, neither too fair nor too foul,\n[6270]_Nec formosa magis quam mihi casta placet_, with old Cato, though fit\nlet her beauty be, _neque lectissima, neque illiberalis_, between both.\nThis I approve; but of the other two I resolve with Salisburiensis,\n_caeteris paribus_, both rich alike, endowed alike, _majori miseria\ndeformis habetur quam formosa servatur_, I had rather marry a fair one, and\nput it to the hazard, than be troubled with a blowze; but do as thou wilt,\nI speak only of myself.\n\nHowsoever, _quod iterum maneo_, I would advise thee thus much, be she fair\nor foul, to choose a wife out of a good kindred, parentage, well brought\nup, in an honest place.\n\n[6271] \"Primum animo tibi proponas quo sanguine creta.\n        Qua forma, qua aetate, quibusque ante omnia virgo\n        Moribus, in junctos veniat nova nupta penates.\"\n\nHe that marries a wife out of a suspected inn or alehouse, buys a horse in\nSmithfield, and hires a servant in Paul's, as the diverb is, shall likely\nhave a jade to his horse, a knave for his man, an arrant honest woman to\nhis wife. _Filia praesumitur, esse matri similis_, saith [6272]Nevisanus?\n\"Such [6273]a mother, such a daughter;\" _mali corvi malum ovum._, cat to\nher kind.\n\n[6274] \"Scilicet expectas ut tradat mater honestos\n        Atque alios mores quam quos habet?\"\n\n\"If the mother be dishonest, in all likelihood the daughter will\n_matrizare_, take after her in all good qualities,\"\n\n       \"Creden' Pasiphae non tauripotente futuram\n        Tauripetam?\"------\n\n\"If the dam trot, the foal will not amble.\" My last caution is, that a\nwoman do not bestow herself upon a fool, or an apparent melancholy person;\njealousy is a symptom of that disease, and fools have no moderation.\nJustina, a Roman lady, was much persecuted, and after made away by her\njealous husband, she caused and enjoined this epitaph, as a caveat to\nothers, to be engraven on her tomb:\n\n[6275] \"Discite ab exemplo Justinae, discite patres,\n        Ne nubat fatuo filia vestra viro,\" &c.\n\n       \"Learn parents all, and by Justina's case,\n        Your children to no dizzards for to place.\"\n\nAfter marriage, I can give no better admonitions than to use their wives\nwell, and which a friend of mine told me that was a married man, I will\ntell you as good cheap, saith Nicostratus in [6276]Stobeus, to avoid future\nstrife, and for quietness' sake, \"when you are in bed, take heed of your\nwife's flattering speeches over night, and curtain, sermons in the\nmorning.\" Let them do their endeavour likewise to maintain them to their\nmeans, which [6277]Patricius ingeminates, and let them have liberty with\ndiscretion, as time and place requires: many women turn queans by\ncompulsion, as [6278]Nevisanus observes, because their husbands are so\nhard, and keep them so short in diet and apparel, _paupertas cogit eas\nmeretricari_, poverty and hunger, want of means, makes them dishonest, or\nbad usage; their churlish behaviour forceth them to fly out, or bad\nexamples, they do it to cry quittance. In the other extreme some are too\nliberal, as the proverb is, _Turdus malum sibi cacat_, they make a rod for\ntheir own tails, as Candaules did to Gyges in [6279]Herodotus, commend his\nwife's beauty himself, and besides would needs have him see her naked.\nWhilst they give their wives too much liberty to gad abroad, and bountiful\nallowance, they are accessory to their own miseries; _animae uxorum pessime\nolent_, as Plautus jibes, they have deformed souls, and by their painting\nand colours procure _odium mariti_, their husband's hate,\nespecially,--[6280] _cum misere viscantur labra mariti_. Besides, their\nwives (as [6281]Basil notes) _Impudenter se exponunt masculorum aspectibus,\njactantes tunicas, et coram tripudiantes_, impudently thrust themselves\ninto other men's companies, and by their indecent wanton carriage provoke\nand tempt the spectators. Virtuous women should keep house; and 'twas well\nperformed and ordered by the Greeks,\n\n[6282]  ------\"mulier ne qua in publicum\n        Spectandam se sine arbitro praebeat viro:\"\n\nwhich made Phidias belike at Elis paint Venus treading on a tortoise, a\nsymbol of women's silence and housekeeping. For a woman abroad and alone,\nis like a deer broke out of a park, _quam mille venatores insequuntur_,\nwhom every hunter follows; and besides in such places she cannot so well\nvindicate herself, but as that virgin Dinah (Gen. xxxiv., 2,) \"going for to\nsee the daughters of the land,\" lost her virginity, she may be defiled and\novertaken of a sudden: _Imbelles damae quid nisi praeda sumus_? [6283]\n\nAnd therefore I know not what philosopher he was, that would have women\ncome but thrice abroad all their time, [6284]\"to be baptised, married, and\nburied;\" but he was too strait-laced. Let them have their liberty in good\nsort, and go in good sort, _modo non annos viginti aetatis suae domi\nrelinquant_, as a good fellow said, so that they look not twenty years\nyounger abroad than they do at home, they be not spruce, neat, angels\nabroad, beasts, dowdies, sluts at home; but seek by all means to please and\ngive content to their husbands: to be quiet above all things, obedient,\nsilent and patient; if they be incensed, angry, chid a little, their wives\nmust not [6285]cample again, but take it in good part. An honest woman, I\ncannot now tell where she dwelt, but by report an honest woman she was,\nhearing one of her gossips by chance complain of her husband's impatience,\ntold her an excellent remedy for it, and gave her withal a glass of water,\nwhich when he brawled she should hold still in her mouth, and that _toties\nquoties_, as often as he chid; she did so two or three times with good\nsuccess, and at length seeing her neighbour, gave her great thanks for it,\nand would needs know the ingredients, [6286]she told her in brief what it\nwas, \"fair water,\" and no more: for it was not the water, but her silence\nwhich performed the cure. Let every froward woman imitate this example, and\nbe quiet within doors, and (as [6287]M. Aurelius prescribes) a necessary\ncaution it is to be observed of all good matrons that love their credits,\nto come little abroad, but follow their work at home, look to their\nhousehold affairs and private business, _oeconomiae incumbentes_, be sober,\nthrifty, wary, circumspect, modest, and compose themselves to live to their\nhusbands' means, as a good housewife should do,\n\n[6288] \"Quae studiis gavisa coli, partita labores\n        Fallet opus cantu, formae assimulata coronae\n        Cura puellaris, circum fusosque rotasque\n        Cum volvet,\" &c.\n\nHowsoever 'tis good to keep them private, not in prison;\n\n[6289] \"Quisquis custodit uxorem vectibus et seris,\n        Etsi sibi sapiens, stultus est, et nihil sapit.\"\n\nRead more of this subject, _Horol. princ. lib. 2. per totum._ Arnisaeus,\n_polit._ Cyprian, Tertullian, Bossus _de mulier. apparat._ Godefridus _de\nAmor. lib. 2. cap. 4._ Levinus Lemnius _cap. 54. de institut._ Christ.\nBarbaras _de re uxor. lib. 2. cap. 2._ Franciscus Patritius _de institut.\nReipub. lib. 4.

Neander, &c.\n\nThese cautions concern him; and if by those or his own discretion otherwise\nhe cannot moderate himself, his friends must not be wanting by their\nwisdom, if it be possible, to give the party grieved satisfaction, to\nprevent and remove the occasions, objects, if it may be to secure him. If\nit be one alone, or many, to consider whom he suspects or at what times, in\nwhat places he is most incensed, in what companies. [6290]Nevisanus makes a\nquestion whether a young physician ought to be admitted in cases of\nsickness, into a new-married man's house, to administer a julep, a syrup,\nor some such physic. The Persians of old would not suffer a young physician\nto come amongst women. [6291]Apollonides Cous made Artaxerxes cuckold, and\nwas after buried alive for it. A goaler in Aristaenetus had a fine young\ngentleman to his prisoner; [6292]in commiseration of his youth and person\nhe let him loose, to enjoy the liberty of the prison, but he unkindly made\nhim a cornuto. Menelaus gave good welcome to Paris a stranger, his whole\nhouse and family were at his command, but he ungently stole away his best\nbeloved wife. The like measure was offered to Agis king of Lacedaemon, by\n[6293] Alcibiades an exile, for his good entertainment, he was too familiar\nwith Timea his wife, begetting a child of her, called Leotichides: and\nbragging moreover when he came home to Athens, that he had a son should be\nking of the Lacedaemonians. If such objects were removed, no doubt but the\nparties might easily be satisfied, or that they could use them gently and\nentreat them well, not to revile them, scoff at, hate them, as in such\ncases commonly they do, 'tis a human infirmity, a miserable vexation, and\nthey should not add grief to grief, nor aggravate their misery, but seek to\nplease, and by all means give them content, by good counsel, removing such\noffensive objects, or by mediation of some discreet friends. In old Rome\nthere was a temple erected by the matrons to that [6294]_Viriplaca Dea_,\nanother to Venus _verticorda, quae maritos uxoribus reddebat benevolos_,\nwhither (if any difference happened between man and wife) they did\ninstantly resort: there they did offer sacrifice, a white hart, Plutarch\nrecords, _sine felle_, without the gall, (some say the like of Juno's\ntemple) and make their prayers for conjugal peace; before some [6295]\nindifferent arbitrators and friends, the matter was heard between man and\nwife, and commonly composed. In our times we want no sacred churches, or\ngood men to end such controversies, if use were made, of them. Some say\nthat precious stone called [6296]beryllus, others a diamond, hath excellent\nvirtue, _contra hostium injurias, et conjugatos invicem conciliare_, to\nreconcile men and wives, to maintain unity and love; you may try this when\nyou will, and as you see cause. If none of all these means and cautions\nwill take place, I know not what remedy to prescribe, or whither such\npersons may go for ease, except they can get into the same [6297]Turkey\nparadise, \"Where they shall have as many fair wives as they will\nthemselves, with clear eyes, and such as look on none but their own\nhusbands,\" no fear, no danger of being cuckolds; or else I would have them\nobserve that strict rule of [6298]Alphonsus, to marry a deaf and dumb man\nto a blind woman. If this will not help, let them, to prevent the worst,\nconsult with an [6299]astrologer, and see whether the significators in her\nhoroscope agree with his, that they be not _in signis et partibus odiose\nintuentibus aut imperantibus, sed mutuo et amice antisciis et\nobedientibus_, otherwise (as they hold) there will be intolerable enmities\nbetween them: or else get them _sigillum veneris_, a characteristical seal\nstamped in the day and hour of Venus, when she is fortunate, with such and\nsuch set words and charms, which Villanovanus and Leo Suavius prescribe,\n_ex sigillis magicis Salomonis, Hermetis, Raguelis_, &c., with many such,\nwhich Alexis, Albertus, and some of our natural magicians put upon us: _ut\nmulier cum aliquo adulterare non possit, incide de capillis ejus_, &c., and\nhe shall surely be gracious in all women's eyes, and never suspect or\ndisagree with his own wife so long as he wears it. If this course be not\napproved, and other remedies may not be had, they must in the last place\nsue for a divorce; but that is somewhat difficult to effect, and not all\nout so fit. For as Felisacus in his tract _de justa uxore_ urgeth, if that\nlaw of Constantine the Great, or that of Theodosius and Valentinian,\nconcerning divorce, were in use in our times, _innumeras propemodum viduas\nhaberemus, et coelibes viros_, we should have almost no married couples\nleft. Try therefore those former remedies; or as Tertullian reports of\nDemocritus, that put out his eyes, [6300]because he could not look upon a\nwoman without lust, and was much troubled to see that which he might not\nenjoy; let him make himself blind, and so he shall avoid that care and\nmolestation of watching his wife. One other sovereign remedy I could\nrepeat, an especial antidote against jealousy, an excellent cure, but I am\nnot now disposed to tell it, not that like a covetous empiric I conceal it\nfor any gain, but some other reasons, I am not willing to publish it: if\nyou be very desirous to know it, when I meet you next I will peradventure\ntell you what it is in your ear. This is the best counsel I can give; which\nhe that hath need of, as occasion serves, may apply unto himself. In the\nmean time,--_dii talem terris avertite pestem_, [6301]as the proverb is,\nfrom heresy, jealousy and frenzy, good Lord deliver us.\n\n\nSECT. IV. MEMB. I.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Religious Melancholy. Its object God; what his beauty is; How\nit allures. The parts and parties affected_.\n\nThat there is such a distinct species of love melancholy, no man hath ever\nyet doubted: but whether this subdivision of [6302]Religious Melancholy be\nwarrantable, it may be controverted.\n\n[6303] \"Pergite Pieridies, medio nec calle vagantem\n        Linquite me, qua nulla pedum vestigia ducunt,\n        Nulla rotae currus testantur signa priores.\"\n\nI have no pattern to follow as in some of the rest, no man to imitate. No\nphysician hath as yet distinctly written of it as of the other; all\nacknowledge it a most notable symptom, some a cause, but few a species or\nkind. [6304]Areteus, Alexander, Rhasis, Avicenna, and most of our late\nwriters, as Gordonius, Fuchsius, Plater, Bruel, Montaltus, &c. repeat it as\na symptom. [6305]Some seem to be inspired of the Holy Ghost, some take upon\nthem to be prophets, some are addicted to new opinions, some foretell\nstrange things, _de statu mundi et Antichristi_, saith Gordonius. Some will\nprophesy of the end of the world to a day almost, and the fall of the\nAntichrist, as they have been addicted or brought up; for so melancholy\nworks with them, as [6306]Laurentius holds. If they have been precisely\ngiven, all their meditations tend that way, and in conclusion produce\nstrange effects, the humour imprints symptoms according to their several\ninclinations and conditions, which makes [6307]Guianerius and [6308]Felix\nPlater put too much devotion, blind zeal, fear of eternal punishment, and\nthat last judgment for a cause of those enthusiastics and desperate\npersons: but some do not obscurely make a distinct species of it, dividing\nlove melancholy into that whose object is women; and into the other whose\nobject is God. Plato, in _Convivio_, makes mention of two distinct furies;\nand amongst our neoterics, Hercules de Saxonia _lib. 1. pract. med. cap.\n16. cap. de Melanch._ doth expressly treat of it in a distinct species.\n[6309] \"Love melancholy\" (saith he) \"is twofold; the first is that (to\nwhich peradventure some will not vouchsafe this name or species of\nmelancholy) affection of those which put God for their object, and are\naltogether about prayer, fasting, &c., the other about women.\" Peter\nForestus in his observations delivereth as much in the same words: and\nFelix Platerus _de mentis alienat. cap. 3._ _frequentissima est ejus\nspecies, in qua curanda saepissime multum fui impeditus_; 'tis a frequent\ndisease; and they have a ground of what they say, forth of Areteus and\nPlato. [6310]Areteus, an old author, in his third book _cap. 6._ doth so\ndivide love melancholy, and derives this second from the first, which comes\nby inspiration or otherwise. [6311]Plato in his Phaedrus hath these words,\n\"Apollo's priests in Delphos, and at Dodona, in their fury do many pretty\nfeats, and benefit the Greeks, but never in their right wits.\" He makes\nthem all mad, as well he might; and he that shall but consider that\nsuperstition of old, those prodigious effects of it (as in its place I will\nshew the several furies of our fatidici dii, pythonissas, sibyls,\nenthusiasts, pseudoprophets, heretics, and schismatics in these our latter\nages) shall instantly confess, that all the world again cannot afford so\nmuch matter of madness, so many stupendous symptoms, as superstition,\nheresy, schism have brought out: that this species alone may be paralleled\nto all the former, has a greater latitude, and more miraculous effects;\nthat it more besots and infatuates men, than any other above named\nwhatsoever, does more harm, works more disquietness to mankind, and has\nmore crucified the souls of mortal men (such hath been the devil's craft)\nthan wars, plagues, sicknesses, dearth, famine, and all the rest.\n\nGive me but a little leave, and I will set before your eyes in brief a\nstupendous, vast, infinite ocean of incredible madness and folly: a sea\nfull of shelves and rocks, sands, gulfs, euripes and contrary tides, full\nof fearful monsters, uncouth shapes, roaring waves, tempests, and siren\ncalms, halcyonian seas, unspeakable misery, such comedies and tragedies,\nsuch absurd and ridiculous, feral and lamentable fits, that I know not\nwhether they are more to be pitied or derided, or may be believed, but that\nwe daily see the same still practised in our days, fresh examples, _nova\nnovitia_, fresh objects of misery and madness, in this kind that are still\nrepresented unto us, abroad, at home, in the midst of us, in our bosoms.\n\nBut before I can come to treat of these several errors and obliquities,\ntheir causes, symptoms, affections, &c., I must say something necessarily\nof the object of this love, God himself, what this love is, how it\nallureth, whence it proceeds, and (which is the cause of all our miseries)\nhow we mistake, wander and swerve from it.\n\nAmongst all those divine attributes that God doth vindicate to himself,\neternity, omnipotency, immutability, wisdom, majesty, justice, mercy, &c.,\nhis [6312]beauty is not the least, one thing, saith David, have I desired\nof the Lord, and that I will still desire, to behold the beauty of the\nLord, Psal. xxvii. 4. And out of Sion, which is the perfection of beauty,\nhath God shined, Psal. 1. 2. All other creatures are fair, I confess, and\nmany other objects do much enamour us, a fair house, a fair horse, a comely\nperson. [6313]\"I am amazed,\" saith Austin, \"when 1 look up to heaven and\nbehold the beauty of the stars, the beauty of angels, principalities,\npowers, who can express it? who can sufficiently commend, or set out this\nbeauty which appears in us? so fair a body, so fair a face, eyes, nose,\ncheeks, chin, brows, all fair and lovely to behold; besides the beauty of\nthe soul which cannot be discerned. If we so labour and be so much affected\nwith the comeliness of creatures, how should we be ravished with that\nadmirable lustre of God himself?\" If ordinary beauty have such a\nprerogative and power, and what is amiable and fair, to draw the eyes and\nears, hearts and affections of all spectators unto it, to move, win,\nentice, allure: how shall this divine form ravish our souls, which is the\nfountain and quintessence of all beauty? _Coelum pulchrum, sed pulchrior\ncoeli fabricator_; if heaven be so fair, the sun so fair, how much fairer\nshall he be, that made them fair? \"For by the greatness and beauty of the\ncreatures, proportionally, the maker of them is seen,\" Wisd. xiii. 5. If\nthere be such pleasure in beholding a beautiful person alone, and as a\nplausible sermon, he so much affect us, what shall this beauty of God\nhimself, that is infinitely fairer than all creatures, men, angels, &c.\n[6314] _Omnis pulchritudo florem, hominum, angelorum, et rerum omnium\npulcherrimarum ad Dei pulchritudinem collata, nox est et tenebrae_, all\nother beauties are night itself, mere darkness to this our inexplicable,\nincomprehensible, unspeakable, eternal, infinite, admirable and divine\nbeauty. This lustre, _pulchritudo omnium pulcherrima._ This beauty and\n[6315] \"splendour of the divine Majesty,\" is it that draws all creatures to\nit, to seek it, love, admire, and adore it; and those heathens, pagans,\nphilosophers, out of those relics they have yet left of God's image, are so\nfar forth incensed, as not only to acknowledge a God; but, though after\ntheir own inventions, to stand in admiration of his bounty, goodness, to\nadore and seek him; the magnificence and structure of the world itself, and\nbeauty of all his creatures, his goodness, providence, protection,\nenforceth them to love him, seek him, fear him, though a wrong way to adore\nhim: but for us that are Christians, regenerate, that are his adopted sons,\nilluminated by his word, having the eyes of our hearts and understandings\nopened; how fairly doth he offer and expose himself? _Ambit nos Deus_\n(Austin saith) _donis et forma sua_, he woos us by his beauty, gifts,\npromises, to come unto him; [6316]\"the whole Scripture is a message, an\nexhortation, a love letter to this purpose;\" to incite us, and invite us,\n[6317]God's epistle, as Gregory calls it, to his creatures. He sets out his\nson and his church in that epithalamium or mystical song of Solomon, to\nenamour us the more, comparing his head \"to fine gold, his locks curled and\nblack as a raven,\" Cant. iv. 5. \"his eyes like doves on rivers of waters,\nwashed with milk, his lips as lilies, drooping down pure juice, his hands\nas rings of gold set with chrysolite: and his church to a vineyard, a\ngarden enclosed, a fountain of living waters, an orchard of pomegranates,\nwith sweet scents of saffron, spike, calamus and cinnamon, and all the\ntrees of incense, as the chief spices, the fairest amongst women, no spot\nin her, [6318]his sister, his spouse, undefiled, the only daughter of her\nmother, dear unto her, fair as the moon, pure as the sun, looking out as\nthe morning;\" that by these figures, that glass, these spiritual eyes of\ncontemplation, we might perceive some resemblance of his beauty, the love\nbetween his church and him. And so in the xlv. Psalm this beauty of his\nchurch is compared to a \"queen in a vesture of gold of Ophir, embroidered\nraiment of needlework, that the king might take pleasure in her beauty.\" To\nincense us further yet, [6319]John, in his apocalypse, makes a description\nof that heavenly Jerusalem, the beauty, of it, and in it the maker of it;\n\"Likening it to a city of pure gold, like unto clear glass, shining and\ngarnished with all manner of precious stones, having no need of sun or\nmoon: for the lamb is the light of it, the glory of God doth illuminate it:\nto give us to understand the infinite glory, beauty and happiness of it.\"\nNot that it is no fairer than these creatures to which it is compared, but\nthat this vision of his, this lustre of his divine majesty, cannot\notherwise be expressed to our apprehensions, \"no tongue can tell, no heart\ncan conceive it,\" as Paul saith. Moses himself, Exod. xxxiii. 18. when he\ndesired to see God in his glory, was answered that he might not endure it,\nno man could see his face and live. _Sensibile forte destruit sensum_, a\nstrong object overcometh the sight, according to that axiom in philosophy:\n_fulgorem solis ferre non potes, multo magis creatoris_; if thou canst not\nendure the sunbeams, how canst thou endure that fulgor and brightness of\nhim that made the sun? The sun itself and all that we can imagine, are but\nshadows of it, 'tis _visio praecellens_, as [6320]Austin calls it, the\nquintessence of beauty this, \"which far exceeds the beauty of heavens, sun\nand moon, stars, angels, gold and silver, woods, fair fields, and\nwhatsoever is pleasant to behold.\" All those other beauties fail, vary, are\nsubject to corruption, to loathing; [6321]\"But this is an immortal vision,\na divine beauty, an immortal love, an indefatigable love and beauty, with\nsight of which we shall never be tired nor wearied, but still the more we\nsee the more we shall covet him.\" [6322]\"For as one saith, where this\nvision is, there is absolute beauty; and where is that beauty, from the\nsame fountain comes all pleasure and happiness; neither can beauty,\npleasure, happiness, be separated from his vision or sight, or his vision,\nfrom beauty, pleasure, happiness.\" In this life we have but a glimpse of\nthis beauty and happiness: we shall hereafter, as John saith, see him as he\nis: thine eyes, as Isaiah promiseth, xxxiii. 17. \"shall behold the king in\nhis glory,\" then shall we be perfectly enamoured, have a full fruition of\nit, desire, [6323]behold and love him alone as the most amiable and fairest\nobject, or _summum bonum_, or chiefest good.\n\nThis likewise should we now have done, had not our will been corrupted; and\nas we are enjoined to love God with all our heart, and all our soul: for to\nthat end were we born, to love this object, as [6324]Melancthon\ndiscourseth, and to enjoy it. \"And him our will would have loved and sought\nalone as our _summum bonum_, or principal good, and all other good things\nfor God's sake: and nature, as she proceeded from it, would have sought\nthis fountain; but in this infirmity of human nature this order is\ndisturbed, our love is corrupt:\" and a man is like that monster in\n[6325]Plato, composed of a Scylla, a lion and a man; we are carried away\nheadlong with the torrent of our affections: the world, and that infinite\nvariety of pleasing objects in it, do so allure and enamour us, that we\ncannot so much as look towards God, seek him, or think on him as we should:\nwe cannot, saith Austin, _Rempub._ _coelestem cogitare_, we cannot contain\nourselves from them, their sweetness is so pleasing to us. Marriage, saith\n[6326] Gualter, detains many; \"a thing in itself laudable, good and\nnecessary, but many, deceived and carried away with the blind love of it,\nhave quite laid aside the love of God, and desire of his glory. Meat and\ndrink hath overcome as many, whilst they rather strive to please, satisfy\ntheir guts and belly, than to serve God and nature.\" Some are so busied\nabout merchandise to get money, they lose their own souls, whilst\ncovetously carried, and with an insatiable desire of gain, they forget God;\nas much we may say of honour, leagues, friendships, health, wealth, and all\nother profits or pleasures in this life whatsoever. [6327]\"In this world\nthere be so many beautiful objects, splendours and brightness of gold,\nmajesty of glory, assistance of friends, fair promises, smooth words,\nvictories, triumphs, and such an infinite company of pleasing beauties to\nallure us, and draw us from God, that we cannot look after him.\" And this\nis it which Christ himself, those prophets and apostles so much thundered\nagainst, 1 John, xvii. 15, dehort us from; \"love not the world, nor the\nthings that are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the\nFather is not in him,\" 16. \"For all that is in the world, as lust of the\nflesh, the lust of the eyes, and pride of life, is not of the Father, but\nof the world: and the world passeth away and the lust thereof; but he that\nfulfilleth the will of God abideth for ever. No man, saith our Saviour, can\nserve two masters, but he must love the one and hate the other,\" &c.,\n_bonos vel malos mores, boni vel mali faciunt amores_, Austin well infers:\nand this is that which all the fathers inculcate. He cannot ([6328]Austin\nadmonisheth) be God's friend, that is delighted with the pleasures of the\nworld: \"make clean thine heart, purify thine heart; if thou wilt see this\nbeauty, prepare thyself for it. It is the eye of contemplation by which we\nmust behold it, the wing of meditation which lifts us up and rears our\nsouls with the motion of our hearts, and sweetness of contemplation:\" so\nsaith Gregory cited by [6329]Bonaventure. And as [6330]Philo Judeus seconds\nhim, \"he that loves God, will soar aloft and take him wings; and leaving\nthe earth fly up to heaven, wander with sun and moon, stars, and that\nheavenly troop, God himself being his guide.\" If we desire to see him, we\nmust lay aside all vain objects, which detain us and dazzle our eyes, and\nas [6331]Ficinus adviseth us, \"get us solar eyes, spectacles as they that\nlook on the sun: to see this divine beauty, lay aside all material objects,\nall sense, and then thou shalt see him as he is.\" Thou covetous wretch, as\n[6332]Austin expostulates, \"why dost thou stand gaping on this dross,\nmuck-hills, filthy excrements? behold a far fairer object, God himself woos\nthee; behold him, enjoy him, he is sick for love.\" Cant. v. he invites thee\nto his sight, to come into his fair garden, to eat and drink with him, to\nbe merry with him, to enjoy his presence for ever. [6333]Wisdom cries out\nin the streets besides the gates, in the top of high places, before the\ncity, at the entry of the door, and bids them give ear to her instruction,\nwhich is better than gold or precious stones; no pleasures can be compared\nto it: leave all then and follow her, _vos exhortor o amici et obsecro._\nIn. [6334]Ficinus's words, \"I exhort and beseech you, that you would\nembrace and follow this divine love with all your hearts and abilities, by\nall offices and endeavours make this so loving God propitious unto you.\"\nFor whom alone, saith [6335]Plotinus, \"we must forsake the kingdoms and\nempires of the whole earth, sea, land, and air, if we desire to be\nengrafted into him, leave all and follow him.\"\n\nNow, forasmuch as this love of God is a habit infused of God, as [6336]\nThomas holds, _l. 2. quaest. 23._ \"by which a man is inclined to love God\nabove all, and his neighbour as himself,\" we must pray to God that he will\nopen our eyes, make clear our hearts, that we may be capable of his\nglorious rays, and perform those duties that he requires of us, Deut. vi.\nand Josh. xxiii. \"to love God above all, and our neighbour as ourself, to\nkeep his commandments.\" \"In this we know,\" saith John, c. v. 2, \"we love\nthe children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.\" \"This is\nthe love of God, that we keep his commandments; he that loveth not, knoweth\nnot God, for God is love,\" cap. iv. 8, \"and he that dwelleth in love,\ndwelleth in God, and God in him;\" for love pre-supposeth knowledge, faith,\nhope, and unites us to God himself, as [6337]Leon Hebreus delivereth unto\nus, and is accompanied with the fear of God, humility, meekness, patience,\nall those virtues, and charity itself. For if we love God, we shall love\nour neighbour, and perform the duties which are required at our hands, to\nwhich we are exhorted, 1 Cor. xv. 4, 5; Ephes. iv.; Colos. iii.; Rom. xii.\nWe shall not be envious or puffed up, or boast, disdain, think evil, or be\nprovoked to anger, \"but suffer all things; endeavour to keep the unity of\nthe spirit in the bond of peace.\" Forbear one another, forgive one another,\nclothe the naked, visit the sick, and perform all those works of mercy,\nwhich [6338]Clemens Alexandrinus calls _amoris et amicitiae, impletionem et\nextentionem_, the extent and complement of love; and that not for fear or\nworldly respects, but _ordine ad Deum_, for the love of God himself. This\nwe shall do if we be truly enamoured; but we come short in both, we neither\nlove God nor our neighbour as we should. Our love in spiritual things is\ntoo [6339]defective, in worldly things too excessive, there is a jar in\nboth. We love the world too much; God too little; our neighbour not at all,\nor for our own ends. _Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat._ \"The chief thing\nwe respect is our commodity;\" and what we do is for fear of worldly\npunishment, for vainglory, praise of men, fashion, and such by respects,\nnot for God's sake. We neither know God aright, nor seek, love or worship\nhim as we should. And for these defects, we involve ourselves into a\nmultitude of errors, we swerve from this true love and worship of God:\nwhich is a cause unto us of unspeakable miseries; running into both\nextremes, we become fools, madmen, without sense, as now in the next place\n1 will show you.\n\nThe parties affected are innumerable almost, and scattered over the face of\nthe earth, far and near, and so have been in all precedent ages, from the\nbeginning of the world to these times, of all sorts and conditions. For\nmethod's sake I will reduce them to a twofold division, according to those\ntwo extremes of excess and defect, impiety and superstition, idolatry and\natheism. Not that there is any excess of divine worship or love of God;\nthat cannot be, we cannot love God too much, or do our duty as we ought, as\nPapists hold, or have any perfection in this life, much less supererogate:\nwhen we have all done, we are unprofitable servants. But because we do\n_aliud agere_, zealous without knowledge, and too solicitous about that\nwhich is not necessary, busying ourselves about impertinent, needless,\nidle, and vain ceremonies, _populo ut placerent_, as the Jews did about\nsacrifices, oblations, offerings, incense, new moons, feasts, &c., but\nIsaiah taxeth them, i. 12, \"who required this at your hands?\" We have too\ngreat opinion of our own worth, that we can satisfy the law: and do more\nthan is required at our hands, by performing those evangelical counsels,\nand such works of supererogation, merit for others, which Bellarmine,\nGregory de Valentia, all their Jesuits and champions defend, that if God\nshould deal in rigour with them, some of their Franciscans and Dominicans\nare so pure, that nothing could be objected to them. Some of us again are\ntoo dear, as we think, more divine and sanctified than others, of a better\nmettle, greater gifts, and with that proud Pharisee, contemn others in\nrespect of ourselves, we are better Christians, better learned, choice\nspirits, inspired, know more, have special revelation, perceive God's\nsecrets, and thereupon presume, say and do that many times which is not\nbefitting to be said or done. Of this number are all superstitious\nidolaters, ethnics, Mahometans, Jews, heretics, [6340]enthusiasts,\ndivinators, prophets, sectaries, and schismatics. Zanchius reduceth such\ninfidels to four chief sects; but I will insist and follow mine own\nintended method: all which with many other curious persons, monks, hermits,\n&c., may be ranged in this extreme, and fight under this superstitious\nbanner, with those rude idiots, and infinite swarms of people that are\nseduced by them. In the other extreme or in defect, march those impious\nepicures, libertines, atheists, hypocrites, infidels, worldly, secure,\nimpenitent, unthankful, and carnal-minded men, that attribute all to\nnatural causes, that will acknowledge no supreme power; that have\ncauterised consciences, or live in a reprobate sense; or such desperate\npersons as are too distrustful of his mercies. Of these there be many\nsubdivisions, diverse degrees of madness and folly, some more than other,\nas shall be shown in the symptoms: and yet all miserably out, perplexed,\ndoting, and beside themselves for religion's sake. For as [6341]Zanchy well\ndistinguished, and all the world knows religion is twofold, true or false;\nfalse is that vain superstition of idolaters, such as were of old, Greeks,\nRomans, present Mahometans, &c. _Timorem deorum inanem_, [6342]Tully could\nterm it; or as Zanchy defines it, _Ubi falsi dii, aut falso cullu colitur\nDeus_, when false gods, or that God is falsely worshipped. And 'tis a\nmiserable plague, a torture of the soul, a mere madness, _Religiosa\ninsania_, [6343]Meteran calls it, or _insanus error_, as [6344]Seneca, a\nfrantic error; or as Austin, _Insanus animi morbus_, a furious disease of\nthe soul; _insania omnium insanissima_, a quintessence of madness;\n[6345]for he that is superstitious can never be quiet. 'Tis proper to man\nalone, _uni superbia, avaritia, superstitio_, saith Plin. _lib. 7. cap. 1._\n_atque etiam post saevit de futuro_, which wrings his soul for the present,\nand to come: the greatest misery belongs to mankind, a perpetual servitude,\na slavery, [6346]_Ex timore timor_, a heavy yoke, the seal of damnation, an\nintolerable burden. They that are superstitious are still fearing,\nsuspecting, vexing themselves with auguries, prodigies, false tales,\ndreams, idle, vain works, unprofitable labours, as [6347]Boterus observes,\n_cura mentis ancipite versantur_: enemies to God and to themselves. In a\nword, as Seneca concludes, _Religio Deum colit, superstitio destruit_,\nsuperstition destroys, but true religion honours God. True religion, _ubi\nverus Deus vere colitur_, where the true God is truly worshipped, is the\nway to heaven, the mother of virtues, love, fear, devotion, obedience,\nknowledge, &c. It rears the dejected soul of man, and amidst so many cares,\nmiseries, persecutions, which this world affords, it is a sole ease, an\nunspeakable comfort, a sweet reposal, _Jugum suave, et leve_, a light yoke,\nan anchor, and a haven. It adds courage, boldness, and begets generous\nspirits: although tyrants rage, persecute, and that bloody Lictor or\nsergeant be ready to martyr them, _aut lita, aut morere_, (as in those\npersecutions of the primitive Church, it was put in practice, as you may\nread in Eusebius and others) though enemies be now ready to invade, and all\nin an uproar, [6348]_Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidos ferient ruinae_,\nthough heaven should fall on his head, he would not be dismayed. But as a\ngood Christian prince once made answer to a menacing Turk, _facile\nscelerata hominum arma contemnit, qui del praesidio tutus est_: or as\n[6349] Phalaris writ to Alexander in a wrong cause, he nor any other enemy\ncould terrify him, for that he trusted in God. _Si Deus nobiscum, quis\ncontra nos_? In all calamities, persecutions whatsoever, as David did, 2\nSam. ii. 22, he will sing with him, \"the Lord is my rock, my fortress, my\nstrength, my refuge, the tower and horn of my salvation,\" &c. In all\ntroubles and adversities, Psal. xlvi. 1. \"God is my hope and help, still\nready to be found, I will not therefore fear,\" &c., 'tis a fear expelling\nfear; he hath peace of conscience, and is full of hope, which is (saith\n[6350]Austin) _vita vitae mortalis_, the life of this our mortal life, hope\nof immortality, the sole comfort of our misery: otherwise, as Paul saith,\nwe of all others were most wretched, but this makes us happy,\ncounterpoising our hearts in all miseries; superstition torments, and is\nfrom the devil, the author of lies; but this is from God himself, as\nLucian, that Antiochian priest, made his divine confession in\n[6351]Eusebius, _Auctor nobis de Deo Deus est_, God is the author of our\nreligion himself, his word is our rule, a lantern to us, dictated by the\nHoly Ghost, he plays upon our hearts as many harpstrings, and we are his\ntemples, he dwelleth in us, and we in him.\n\nThe part affected of superstition, is the brain, heart, will,\nunderstanding, soul itself, and all the faculties of it, _totum\ncompositum_, all is mad and dotes: now for the extent, as I say, the world\nitself is the subject of it, (to omit that grand sin of atheism,) all times\nhave been misaffected, past, present, \"there is not one that doth good, no\nnot one, from the prophet to the priest,\" &c. A lamentable thing it is to\nconsider, how many myriads of men this idolatry and superstition (for that\ncomprehends all) hath infatuated in all ages, besotted by this blind zeal,\nwhich is religion's ape, religion's bastard, religion's shadow, false\nglass. For where God hath a temple, the devil will have a chapel: where God\nhath sacrifices, the devil will have his oblations: where God hath\nceremonies, the devil will have his traditions: where there is any\nreligion, the devil will plant superstition; and 'tis a pitiful sight to\nbehold and read, what tortures, miseries, it hath procured, what slaughter\nof souls it hath made, how it rageth amongst those old Persians, Syrians,\nEgyptians, Greeks, Romans, Tuscans, Gauls, Germans, Britons, &c. _Britannia\njam hodie celebrat tam attonite_, saith [6352]Pliny, _tantis ceremoniis_\n(speaking of superstition) _ut dedisse Persis videri possit._ The Britons\nare so stupendly superstitious in their ceremonies, that they go beyond\nthose Persians. He that shall but read in Pausanias alone, those gods,\ntemples, altars, idols, statues, so curiously made with such infinite cost\nand charge, amongst those old Greeks, such multitudes of them and frequent\nvarieties, as [6353]Gerbelius truly observes, may stand amazed, and never\nenough wonder at it; and thank God withal, that by the light of the Gospel,\nwe are so happily freed from that slavish idolatry in these our days. But\nheretofore, almost in all countries, in all places, superstition hath\nblinded the hearts of men; in all ages what a small portion hath the true\nchurch ever been! _Divisum imperium cum Jove Daemon habet._ [6354]The\npatriarchs and their families, the Israelites a handful in respect, Christ\nand his apostles, and not all of them, neither. Into what straits hath it\nbeen compinged, a little flock! how hath superstition on the other side\ndilated herself, error, ignorance, barbarism, folly, madness, deceived,\ntriumphed, and insulted over the most wise discreet, and understanding man,\nphilosophers, dynasts, monarchs, all were involved and overshadowed in this\nmist, in more than Cimmerian darkness. [6355]_Adeo ignara superstitio\nmentes hominum depravat, et nonnunquam sapientum animos transversos agit._\nAt this present, _quota pars!_ How small a part is truly religious! How\nlittle in respect! Divide the world into six parts, and one, or not so\nmuch, as Christians; idolaters and Mahometans possess almost Asia, Africa,\nAmerica, Magellanica. The kings of China, great Cham, Siam, and Borneo,\nPegu, Deccan, Narsinga, Japan, &c., are gentiles, idolaters, and many other\npetty princes in Asia, Monomotopa, Congo, and I know not how many Negro\nprinces in Africa, all Terra Australis incognita most of America pagans,\ndiffering all in their several superstitions; and yet all idolaters. The\nMahometans extend themselves over the great Turk's dominions in Europe,\nAfrica, Asia, to the Xeriffes in Barbary, and its territories in Fez, Sus,\nMorocco, &c. The Tartar, the great Mogor, the Sophy of Persia, with most of\ntheir dominions and subjects, are at this day Mahometans. See how the devil\nrageth: those at odds, or differing among themselves, some for [6356]Ali,\nsome Enbocar, for Acmor, and Ozimen, those four doctors, Mahomet's\nsuccessors, and are subdivided into seventy-two inferior sects, as\n[6357]Leo Afer reports. The Jews, as a company of vagabonds, are scattered\nover all parts; whose story, present estate, progress from time to time, is\nfully set down by [6358]Mr. Thomas Jackson, Doctor of Divinity, in his\ncomment on the creed. A fifth part of the world, and hardly that, now\nprofesseth CHRIST, but so inlarded and interlaced with several\nsuperstitions, that there is scarce a sound part to be found, or any\nagreement amongst them. Presbyter John, in Africa, lord of those\nAbyssinians, or Ethiopians, is by his profession a Christian, but so\ndifferent from us, with such new absurdities and ceremonies, such liberty,\nsuch a mixture of idolatry and paganism, [6359]that they keep little more\nthan a bare title of Christianity. They suffer polygamy, circumcision,\nstupend fastings, divorce as they will themselves, &c., and as the papists\ncall on the Virgin Mary, so do they on Thomas Didymus before Christ.\n[6360]The Greek or Eastern Church is rent from this of the West, and as\nthey have four chief patriarchs, so have they four subdivisions, besides\nthose Nestorians, Jacobins, Syrians, Armenians, Georgians, &c., scattered\nover Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, &c., Greece, Walachia, Circassia, Bulgaria,\nBosnia, Albania, Illyricum, Sclavonia, Croatia, Thrace, Servia, Rascia, and\na sprinkling amongst the Tartars, the Russians, Muscovites, and most of\nthat great duke's (czar's) subjects, are part of the Greek Church, and\nstill Christians: but as [6361]one saith, _temporis successu multas illi\naddiderunt superstitiones._ In process of time they have added so many\nsuperstitions, they be rather semi-Christians than otherwise. That which\nremains is the Western Church with us in Europe, but so eclipsed with\nseveral schisms, heresies and superstitions, that one knows not where to\nfind it. The papists have Italy, Spain, Savoy, part of Germany, France,\nPoland, and a sprinkling in the rest of Europe. In America, they hold all\nthat which Spaniards inhabit, Hispania Nova, Castella Aurea, Peru, &c. In\nthe East Indies, the Philippines, some small holds about Goa, Malacca,\nZelan, Ormus, &c., which the Portuguese got not long since, and those\nland-leaping Jesuits have essayed in China, Japan, as appears by their\nyearly letters; in Africa they have Melinda, Quiloa, Mombaze, &c., and some\nfew towns, they drive out one superstition with another. Poland is a\nreceptacle of all religions, where Samosetans, Socinians, Photinians (now\nprotected in Transylvania and Poland), Arians, Anabaptists are to be found,\nas well as in some German cities. Scandia is Christian, but [6362]Damianus\nA-Goes, the Portugal knight, complains, so mixed with magic, pagan rites\nand ceremonies, they may be as well counted idolaters: what Tacitus\nformerly said of a like nation, is verified in them, [6363]\"A people\nsubject to superstition, contrary to religion.\" And some of them as about\nLapland and the Pilapians, the devil's possession to this day, _Misera haec\ngens_ (saith mine [6364]author) _Satanae hactenus possessio,--et quod\nmaxime mirandum et dolendum_, and which is to be admired and pitied; if any\nof them be baptised, which the kings of Sweden much labour, they die within\nseven or nine days after, and for that cause they will hardly be brought to\nChristianity, but worship still the devil, who daily appears to them. In\ntheir idolatrous courses, _Gandentibus diis patriis, quos religiose\ncolunt_, &c. Yet are they very superstitious, like our wild Irish: though\nthey of the better note, the kings of Denmark and Sweden themselves, that\ngovern them, be Lutherans; the remnant are Calvinists, Lutherans, in\nGermany equally mixed. And yet the emperor himself, dukes of Lorraine,\nBavaria, and the princes, electors, are most part professed papists. And\nthough some part of France and Ireland, Great Britain, half the cantons in\nSwitzerland, and the Low Countries, be Calvinists, more defecate than the\nrest, yet at odds amongst themselves, not free from superstition. And which\n[6365]Brochard, the monk, in his description of the Holy Land, after he had\ncensured the Greek church, and showed their errors, concluded at last,\n_Faxit Deus ne Latinis multa irrepserint stultifies_, I say God grant there\nbe no fopperies in our church. As a dam of water stopped in one place\nbreaks out into another, so doth superstition. I say nothing of\nAnabaptists, Socinians, Brownists, Familists, &c. There is superstition in\nour prayers, often in our hearing of sermons, bitter contentions,\ninvectives, persecutions, strange conceits, besides diversity of opinions,\nschisms, factions, &c. But as the Lord (Job xlii. cap. 7. v.) said to\nEliphaz, the Temanite, and his two friends, \"his wrath was kindled against\nthem, for they had not spoken of him things that were right:\" we may justly\nof these schismatics and heretics, how wise soever in their own conceits,\n_non recte loquuntur de Deo_, they speak not, they think not, they write\nnot well of God, and as they ought. And therefore, _Quid quaeso mi Dorpi_,\nas Erasmus concludes to Dorpius, _hisce Theologis faciamus, aut quid\npreceris, nisi forte fidelem medicum, qui cerebro medeatur_? What shall we\nwish them, but _sanam mentem_, and a good physician? But more of their\ndifferences, paradoxes, opinions, mad pranks, in the symptoms: I now hasten\nto the causes.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Causes of Religious melancholy. From the Devil by miracles,\napparitions, oracles. His instruments or factors, politicians, Priests,\nImpostors, Heretics, blind guides. In them simplicity, fear, blind zeal,\nignorance, solitariness, curiosity, pride, vainglory, presumption, &c. his\nengines, fasting, solitariness, hope, fear, &c._\n\nWe are taught in Holy Scripture, that the \"Devil rangeth abroad like a\nroaring lion, still seeking whom he may devour:\" and as in several shapes,\nso by several engines and devices he goeth about to seduce us; sometimes he\ntransforms himself into an angel of light; and is so cunning that he is\nable, if it were possible, to deceive the very elect. He will be worshipped\nas [6366]God himself, and is so adored by the heathen, and esteemed. And in\nimitation of that divine power, as [6367]Eusebius observes, [6368]to abuse\nor emulate God's glory, as Dandinus adds, he will have all homage,\nsacrifices, oblations, and whatsoever else belongs to the worship of God,\nto be done likewise unto him, _similis erit altissimo_, and by this means\ninfatuates the world, deludes, entraps, and destroys many a thousand souls.\nSometimes by dreams, visions (as God to Moses by familiar conference), the\ndevil in several shapes talks with them: in the [6369]Indies it is common,\nand in China nothing so familiar as apparitions, inspirations, oracles, by\nterrifying them with false prodigies, counterfeit miracles, sending storms,\ntempests, diseases, plagues (as of old in Athens there was Apollo,\nAlexicacus, Apollo [Greek: loimios], _pestifer et malorum depulsor_),\nraising wars, seditions by spectrums, troubling their consciences, driving\nthem to despair, terrors of mind, intolerable pains; by promises, rewards,\nbenefits, and fair means, he raiseth such an opinion of his deity and\ngreatness, that they dare not do otherwise than adore him, do as he will\nhave them, they dare not offend him. And to compel them more to stand in\nawe of him, [6370]\"he sends and cures diseases, disquiets their spirits\"\n(as Cyprian saith), \"torments and terrifies their souls, to make them adore\nhim: and all his study, all his endeavour is to divert them from true\nreligion to superstition: and because he is damned himself, and in an\nerror, he would have all the world participate of his errors, and be damned\nwith him.\" The _primum mobile_, therefore, and first mover of all\nsuperstition, is the devil, that great enemy of mankind, the principal\nagent, who in a thousand several, shapes, after diverse fashions, with\nseveral engines, illusions, and by several names hath deceived the\ninhabitants of the earth, in several places and countries, still rejoicing\nat their falls. \"All the world over before Christ's time, he freely\ndomineered, and held the souls of men in most slavish subjection\" (saith\n[6371]Eusebius) \"in diverse forms, ceremonies, and sacrifices, till\nChrist's coming,\" as if those devils of the air had shared the earth\namongst them, which the Platonists held for gods ([6372]_Ludus deorum\nsumus_), and were our governors and keepers. In several places, they had\nseveral rites, orders, names, of which read Wierus _de praestigiis\ndaemonum, lib. 1. cap. 5._ [6373]Strozzius Cicogna, and others; Adonided\namongst the Syrians; Adramalech amongst the Capernaites, Asiniae amongst\nthe Emathites; Astartes with the Sidonians; Astaroth with the Palestines;\nDagon with the Philistines; Tartary with the Hanaei; Melchonis amongst the\nAmmonites: Beli the Babylonians; Beelzebub and Baal with the Samaritans and\nMoabites; Apis, Isis, and Osiris amongst the Egyptians; Apollo Pythius at\nDelphos, Colophon, Ancyra, Cuma, Erythra; Jupiter in Crete, Venus at\nCyprus, Juno at Carthage, Aesculapius at Epidaurus, Diana at Ephesus,\nPallas at Athens, &c. And even in these our days, both in the East and West\nIndies, in Tartary, China, Japan, &c., what strange idols, in what\nprodigious forms, with what absurd ceremonies are they adored? What strange\nsacraments, like ours of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, what goodly\ntemples, priests, sacrifices they had in America, when the Spaniards first\nlanded there, let Acosta the Jesuit relate, _lib. 5. cap. 1, 2, 3, 4_, &c.,\nand how the devil imitated the Ark and the children of Israel's coming out\nof Egypt; with many such. For as Lipsius well discourseth out of the\ndoctrine of the Stoics, _maxime cupiunt adorationem hominum_, now and of\nold, they still and most especially desire to be adored by men. See but\nwhat Vertomannus, _l. 5. c. 2._ Marcus Polus, Lerius, Benzo, P. Martyr in\nhis _Ocean Decades_, Acosta, and Mat. Riccius _expedit. Christ. in Sinus,\nlib. 1._ relate. [6374]Eusebius wonders how that wise city of Athens, and\nflourishing kingdoms of Greece, should be so besotted; and we in our times,\nhow. those witty Chinese, so perspicacious in all other things should be so\ngulled, so tortured with superstition, so blind as to worship stocks and\nstones. But it is no marvel, when we see all out as great effects amongst\nChristians themselves; how are those Anabaptists, Arians, and Papists above\nthe rest, miserably infatuated! Mars, Jupiter, Apollo, and Aesculapius,\nhave resigned their interest, names, and offices to Saint George.\n\n       \"([6375](Maxime bellorum rector, quem nostra juventus\n        Pro Mavorte colit.)\"------\n\nSt. Christopher, and a company of fictitious saints, Venus to the Lady of\nLoretto. And as those old Romans had several distinct gods, for divers\noffices, persons, places, so have they saints, as [6376]Lavater well\nobserves out of Lactantius, _mutato nomine tantum_, 'tis the same spirit or\ndevil that deludes them still. The manner how, as I say, is by rewards,\npromises, terrors, affrights, punishments. In a word, fair and foul means,\nhope and fear. How often hath Jupiter, Apollo, Bacchus, and the rest, sent\nplagues in [6377]Greece and Italy, because their sacrifices were neglected?\n\n[6378] \"Dii multa neglecti dederunt\n        Hesperiae mala luctuosae,\"\n\nto terrify them, to arouse them up, and the like: see but Livy, Dionysius\nHalicarnassaeus, Thucydides, Pausanius, Philostratus, [6379]Polybius,\nbefore the battle of Cannae, _prodigiis signis, ostentis, templa cuncta,\nprivates etiam aedes scatebant._ Oeneus reigned in Aetolia, and because he\ndid not sacrifice to Diana with his other gods (see more in Labanius his\nDiana), she sent a wild boar, _insolitae magnitudinis, qui terras et\nhomines misere depascebatur_, to spoil both men and country, which was\nafterwards killed by Meleager. So Plutarch in the Life of Lucullus relates,\nhow Mithridates, king of Pontus, at the siege of Cizicum, with all his\nnavy, was overthrown by Proserpina, for neglecting of her holy day. She\nappeared in a vision to Aristagoras in the night, _Cras inquit tybicinem\nLybicum cum tybicine pontico committam_ (\"tomorrow I will cause a contest\nbetween a Libyan and a Pontic minstrel\"), and the day following this enigma\nwas understood; for with a great south wind which came from Libya, she\nquite overwhelmed Mithridates' army. What prodigies and miracles, dreams,\nvisions, predictions, apparitions, oracles, have been of old at Delphos,\nDodona, Trophonius' den, at Thebes, and Lebaudia, of Jupiter Ammon in\nEgypt, Amphiaraus in Attica, &c.; what strange cures performed by Apollo\nand Aesculapius? Juno's image and that of [6380]Fortune spake, [6381]Castor\nand Pollux fought in person for the Romans against Hannibal's army, as\nPallas, Mars, Juno, Venus, for Greeks and Trojans, &c. Amongst our\npseudo-Catholics nothing so familiar as such miracles; how many cures done\nby our lady of Loretto, at Sichem! of old at our St. Thomas's shrine, &c.\n[6382]St. Sabine was seen to fight for Arnulphus, duke of Spoleto.\n[6383]St. George fought in person for John the Bastard of Portugal, against\nthe Castilians; St. James for the Spaniards in America. In the battle of\nBannockburn, where Edward the Second, our English king, was foiled by the\nScots, St. Philanus' arm was seen to fight (if [6384]Hector Boethius doth\nnot impose), that was before shut up in a silver cap-case; another time, in\nthe same author, St. Magnus fought for them. Now for visions, revelations,\nmiracles, not only out of the legend, out of purgatory, but everyday comes\nnews from the Indies, and at home read the Jesuits' Letters, Ribadineira,\nThurselinus, Acosta, Lippomanus, Xaverius, Ignatius' Lives, &c., and tell\nme what difference?\n\nHis ordinary instruments or factors which he useth, as God himself, did\ngood kings, lawful magistrates, patriarchs, prophets, to the establishing\nof his church, [6385]are politicians, statesmen, priests, heretics, blind\nguides, impostors, pseudoprophets, to propagate his superstition. And first\nto begin of politicians, it hath ever been a principal axiom with them to\nmaintain religion or superstition, which they determine of, alter and vary\nupon all occasions, as to them seems best, they make religion mere policy,\na cloak, a human invention, _nihil aeque valet ad regendos vulgi animos ac\nsuperstitio_, as [6386]Tacitus and [6387]Tully hold. Austin, _l. 4. de\ncivitat. Dei. c. 9._ censures Scaevola saying and acknowledging _expedire\ncivitates religione falli_, that it was a fit thing cities should be\ndeceived by religion, according to the diverb, _Si mundus vult decipi,\ndecipiatur_, if the world will be gulled, let it be gulled, 'tis good\nhowsoever to keep it in subjection. 'Tis that [6388]Aristotle and\n[6389]Plato inculcate in their politics, \"Religion neglected, brings plague\nto the city, opens a gap to all naughtiness.\" 'Tis that which all our late\npoliticians ingeminate. Cromerus, _l. 2. pol. hist._ Boterus, _l. 3. de\nincrementis urbium._ Clapmarius, _l. 2. c. 9. de Arcanis rerump. cap. 4.\nlib. 2. polit._ Captain Machiavel will have a prince by all means to\ncounterfeit religion, to be superstitious in show at least, to seem to be\ndevout, frequent holy exercises, honour divines, love the church, affect\npriests, as Numa, Lycurgus, and such lawmakers were and did, _non ut his\nfidem habeant, sed ut subditos religionis metu facilius in officio\ncontineant_, to keep people in obedience. [6390]_Nam naturaliter_ (as\nCardan writes) _lex Christiana lex est pietatis, justitiae, fidei,\nsimplicitatis_, &c. But this error of his, Innocentius Jentilettus, a\nFrench lawyer, _theorem. 9. comment. 1. de Relig_, and Thomas Bozius in his\nbook _de ruinis gentium et Regnorum_ have copiously confuted. Many\npoliticians, I dare not deny, maintain religion as a true means, and\nsincerely speak of it without hypocrisy, are truly zealous and religious\nthemselves. Justice and religion are the two chief props and supporters of\na well-governed commonwealth: but most of them are but Machiavellians,\ncounterfeits only for political ends; for _solus rex_ (which Campanella,\n_cap. 18. atheismi triumphali_ observes), as amongst our modern Turks,\n_reipub. Finis_, as knowing [6391]_magnus ejus in animos imperium_; and\nthat, as [6392]Sabellicus delivers, \"A man without religion, is like a\nhorse without a bridle.\" No way better to curb than superstition, to\nterrify men's consciences, and to keep them in awe: they make new laws,\nstatutes, invent new religions, ceremonies, as so many stalking horses, to\ntheir ends. [6393]_Haec enim (religio) si falsa sit, dummodo vera credatur,\nanimorum ferociam domat, libidines coercet, subditos principi obsequentes\nefficit._ [6394]Therefore (saith [6395]Polybius of Lycurgus), \"did he\nmaintain ceremonies, not that he was superstitious himself, but that he had\nperceived mortal men more apt to embrace paradoxes than aught else, and\ndurst attempt no evil things for fear of the gods.\" This was Zamolcus's\nstratagem amongst the Thracians, Numa's plot, when he said he had\nconference with the nymph Aegeria, and that of Sertorius with a hart; to\nget more credit to their decrees, by deriving them from the gods; or else\nthey did all by divine instinct, which Nicholas Damascen well observes of\nLycurgus, Solon, and Minos, they had their laws dictated, _monte sacro_, by\nJupiter himself. So Mahomet referred his new laws to the [6396]angel\nGabriel, by whose direction he gave out they were made. Caligula in Dion\nfeigned himself to be familiar with Castor and Pollux, and many such, which\nkept those Romans under (who, as Machiavel proves, _lib. 1. disput. cap.\n11. et 12._ were _Religione maxime moti_, most superstitious): and did curb\nthe people more by this means, than by force of arms, or severity of human\nlaws. _Sola plebecula eam agnoscebat_ (saith Vaninus, _dial. 1. lib. 4. de\nadmirandis naturae arcanis_) speaking of religion, _que facile decipitur,\nmagnates vero et philosophi nequaquam_, your grandees and philosophers had\nno such conceit, _sed ad imperii conformationem et amplificationem quam\nsine praetextu religionis tueri non poterant_; and many thousands in all\nages have ever held as much, Philosophers especially, _animadvertebant hi\nsemper haec esse fabellas, attamen ob metum publicae potestatis silere\ncogebantur_ they were still silent for fear of laws, &c. To this end that\nSyrian Phyresides, Pythagoras his master, broached in the East amongst the\nheathens, first the immortality of the soul, as Trismegistus did in Egypt,\nwith a many of feigned gods. Those French and Briton Druids in the West\nfirst taught, saith [6397]Caesar, _non interire animas_ (that souls did not\ndie), \"but after death to go from one to another, that so they might\nencourage them to virtue.\" 'Twas for a politic end, and to this purpose the\nold [6398]poets feigned those elysian fields, their Aeacus, Minos, and\nRhadamanthus, their infernal judges, and those Stygian lakes, fiery\nPhlegethons, Pluto's kingdom, and variety of torments after death. Those\nthat had done well, went to the elysian fields, but evil doers to Cocytus,\nand to that burning lake of [6399]hell with fire, and brimstone for ever to\nbe tormented. 'Tis this which [6400]Plato labours for in his Phaedon, _et\n9. de rep._ The Turks in their Alcoran, when they set down rewards, and\nseveral punishments for every particular virtue and vice, [6401]when they\npersuade men, that they that die in battle shall go directly to heaven, but\nwicked livers to eternal torment, and all of all sorts (much like our\npapistical purgatory), for a set time shall be tortured in their graves, as\nappears by that tract which John Baptista Alfaqui, that Mauritanian priest,\nnow turned Christian, hath written in his confutation of the Alcoran. After\na man's death two black angels, Nunquir and Nequir (so they call them) come\nto him to his grave and punish him for his precedent sins; if he lived\nwell, they torture him the less; if ill, _per indesinentes cruciatus ad\ndiem fudicii_, they incessantly punish him to the day of judgment, _Nemo\nviventium qui ad horum mentionem non totus horret et contremiscit_, the\nthought of this crucifies them all their lives long, and makes them spend\ntheir days in fasting and prayer, _ne mala haec contingant_, &c. A Tartar\nprince, saith Marcus Polus, _lib. 1. cap. 23._ called Senex de Montibus,\nthe better to establish his government amongst his subjects, and to keep\nthem in awe, found a convenient place in a pleasant valley, environed with\nhills, in [6402]\"which he made a delicious park full of odoriferous flowers\nand fruits, and a palace of all worldly contents,\" that could possibly be\ndevised, music, pictures, variety of meats, &c., and chose out a certain\nyoung man, whom with a [6403]soporiferous potion he so benumbed, that he\nperceived nothing: \"and so fast asleep as he was, caused him to be conveyed\ninto this fair garden:\" where after he had lived awhile in all such\npleasures a sensual man could desire, [6404]\"He cast him into a sleep\nagain, and brought him forth, that when he awaked he might tell others he\nhad been in Paradise.\" The like he did for hell, and by this means brought\nhis people to subjection. Because heaven and hell are mentioned in the\nscriptures, and to be believed necessary by Christians: so cunningly can\nthe devil and his ministers, in imitation of true religion, counterfeit and\nforge the like, to circumvent and delude his superstitious followers. Many\nsuch tricks and impostures are acted by politicians, in China especially,\nbut with what effect I will discourse in the symptoms.\n\nNext to politicians, if I may distinguish them, are some of our priests\n(who make religion policy), if not far beyond them, for they domineer over\nprinces and statesmen themselves. _Carnificinam exercent_, one saith they\ntyrannise over men's consciences more than any other tormentors whatsoever,\npartly for their commodity and gain; _Religionem enim omnium abusus_ (as\n[6405]Postellus holds), _quaestus scilicet sacrificum in causa est_: for\nsovereignty, credit, to maintain their state and reputation, out of\nambition and avarice, which are their chief supporters: what have they not\nmade the common people believe? Impossibilities in nature, incredible\nthings; what devices, traditions, ceremonies, have they not invented in all\nages to keep men in obedience, to enrich themselves? _Quibus quaestui sunt\ncapti superstitione animi_, as [6406]Livy saith. Those Egyptian priests of\nold got all the sovereignty into their hands, and knowing, as [6407]Curtius\ninsinuates, _nulla res efficacius multitudinem regit quam superstitio;\nmelius vatibus quam ducibus parent, vana religione capti, etiam impotentes\nfaeminae_; the common people will sooner obey priests than captains, and\nnothing so forcible as superstition, or better than blind zeal to rule a\nmultitude; have so terrified and gulled them, that it is incredible to\nrelate. All nations almost have been besotted in this kind; amongst our\nBritons and old Gauls the Druids; magi in Persia; philosophers in Greece;\nChaldeans amongst the Oriental; Brachmanni in India; Gymnosophists in\nEthiopia; the Turditanes in Spain; Augurs in Rome, have insulted; Apollo's\npriests in Greece, Phaebades and Pythonissae, by their oracles and\nphantasms; Amphiaraus and his companions; now Mahometan and pagan priests,\nwhat can they not effect? How do they not infatuate the world? _Adeo\nubique_ (as [6408]Scaliger writes of the Mahometan priests), _tum gentium\ntum locorum, gens ista sacrorum ministra, vulgi secat spes, ad ea quae ipsi\nfingunt somnia_, \"so cunningly can they gull the commons in all places and\ncountries.\" But above all others, that high priest of Rome, the dam of that\nmonstrous and superstitious brood, the bull-bellowing pope, which now\nrageth in the West, that three-headed Cerberus hath played his part. [6409]\n\"Whose religion at this day is mere policy, a state wholly composed of\nsuperstition and wit, and needs nothing but wit and superstition to\nmaintain it, that useth colleges and religious houses to as good purpose as\nforts and castles, and doth more at this day\" by a company of scribbling\nparasites, fiery-spirited friars, zealous anchorites, hypocritical\nconfessors, and those praetorian soldiers, his Janissary Jesuits, and that\ndissociable society, as [6410]Languis terms it, _postremus diaboli conatus\net saeculi excrementum_, that now stand in the fore front of the battle,\nwill have a monopoly of, and engross all other learning, but domineer in\ndivinity, [6411]_Excipiunt soli totius vulnera belli_, and fight alone\nalmost (for the rest are but his dromedaries and asses), than ever he could\nhave done by garrisons and armies. What power of prince, or penal law, be\nit never so strict, could enforce men to do that which for conscience' sake\nthey will voluntarily undergo? And as to fast from all flesh, abstain from\nmarriage, rise to their prayers at midnight, whip themselves, with\nstupendous fasting and penance, abandon the world, wilful poverty, perform\ncanonical and blind obedience, to prostrate their goods, fortunes, bodies,\nlives, and offer up themselves at their superior's feet, at his command?\nWhat so powerful an engine as superstition? which they right well\nperceiving, are of no religion at all themselves: _Primum enim_ (as Calvin\nrightly suspects, the tenor and practice of their life proves), _arcanae\nillius theologiae, quod apud eos regnat, caput est, nullum esse deum_, they\nhold there is no God, as Leo X. did, Hildebrand the magician, Alexander\nVI., Julius II., mere atheists, and which the common proverb amongst them\napproves, [6412]\"The worst Christians of Italy are the Romans, of the\nRomans the priests are wildest, the lewdest priests are preferred to be\ncardinals, and the baddest men amongst the cardinals is chosen to be pope,\"\nthat is an epicure, as most part the popes are, infidels and Lucianists,\nfor so they think and believe; and what is said of Christ to be fables and\nimpostures, of heaven and hell, day of judgment, paradise, immortality of\nthe soul, are all,\n\n[6413] \"Rumores vacui, verbaque inania,\n        Et par sollicito fabula somnio.\"\n\n\"Dreams, toys, and old wives' tales.\" Yet as so many [6414]whetstones to\nmake other tools cut, but cut not themselves, though they be of no religion\nat all, they will make others most devout and superstitious, by promises\nand threats, compel, enforce from, and lead them by the nose like so many\nbears in a line; when as their end is not to propagate the church, advance\nGod's kingdom, seek His glory or common good, but to enrich themselves, to\nenlarge their territories, to domineer and compel them to stand in awe, to\nlive in subjection to the See of Rome. For what otherwise care they? _Si\nmundus vult decipi, decipiatur_, \"since the world wishes to be gulled, let\nit be gulled,\" 'tis fit it should be so. And for which [6415]Austin cites\nVarro to maintain his Roman religion, we may better apply to them: _multa\nvera, quae vulgus scire non est utile; pleraque falsa, quae tamen uliter\nexistimare populum expedit_; some things are true, some false, which for\ntheir own ends they will not have the gullish commonalty take notice of. As\nwell may witness their intolerable covetousness, strange forgeries,\nfopperies, fooleries, unrighteous subtleties, impostures, illusions, new\ndoctrines, paradoxes, traditions, false miracles, which they have still\nforged, to enthral, circumvent and subjugate them, to maintain their own\nestates. [6416]One while by bulls, pardons, indulgencies, and their\ndoctrines of good works, that they be meritorious, hope of heaven, by that\nmeans they have so fleeced the commonalty, and spurred on this free\nsuperstitious horse, that he runs himself blind, and is an ass to carry\nburdens. They have so amplified Peter's patrimony, that from a poor bishop,\nhe is become _Rex Regum, Dominus dominantium_, a demigod, as his canonists\nmake him (Felinus and the rest), above God himself. And for his wealth and\n[6417] temporalities, is not inferior to many kings: [6418]his cardinals,\nprinces' companions; and in every kingdom almost, abbots, priors, monks,\nfriars, &c., and his clergy, have engrossed a [6419]third part, half, in\nsome places all, into their hands. Three princes, electors in Germany,\nbishops; besides Magdeburg, Spire, Saltsburg, Breme, Bamberg, &c. In\nFrance, as Bodine _lib. de repub._ gives us to understand, their revenues\nare 12,300,000 livres; and of twelve parts of the revenues in France, the\nchurch possesseth seven. The Jesuits, a new sect, begun in this age, have,\nas [6420]Middendorpius and [6421]Pelargus reckon up, three or four hundred\ncolleges in Europe, and more revenues than many princes. In France, as\nArnoldus proves, in thirty years they have got _bis centum librarum millia\nannua_, 200,000_l_. I say nothing of the rest of their orders. We have had\nin England, as Armachanus demonstrates, above 30,000 friars at once, and as\n[6422]Speed collects out of Leland and others, almost 600 religious houses,\nand near 200,000_l._ in revenues of the old rent belonging to them, besides\nimages of gold, silver, plate, furniture, goods and ornaments, as\n[6423]Weever calculates, and esteems them at the dissolution of abbeys,\nworth a million of gold. How many towns in every kingdom hath superstition\nenriched? What a deal of money by musty relics, images, idolatry, have\ntheir mass-priests engrossed, and what sums have they scraped by their\nother tricks! Loretto in Italy, Walsingham in England, in those days. _Ubi\nomnia auro nitent_, \"where everything shines with gold,\" saith Erasmus, St.\nThomas's shrine, &c., may witness. [6424]Delphos so renowned of old in\nGreece for Apollo's oracle, _Delos commune conciliabulum et emporium sola\nreligions manitum_; Dodona, whose fame and wealth were sustained by\nreligion, were not so rich, so famous. If they can get but a relic of some\nsaint, the Virgin Mary's picture, idols or the like, that city is for ever\nmade, it needs no other maintenance. Now if any of these their impostures\nor juggling tricks be controverted, or called in question: if a magnanimous\nor zealous Luther, an heroical Luther, as [6425]Dithmarus Calls him, dare\ntouch the monks' bellies, all is in a combustion, all is in an uproar:\nDemetrius and his associates are ready to pull him in pieces, to keep up\ntheir trades, [6426] \"Great is Diana of the Ephesians:\" with a mighty shout\nof two hours long they will roar and not be pacified.\n\nNow for their authority, what by auricular confession, satisfaction,\npenance, Peter's keys, thunderings, excommunications, &c., roaring bulls,\nthis high priest of Rome, shaking his Gorgon's head, hath so terrified the\nsoul of many a silly man, insulted over majesty itself, and swaggered\ngenerally over all Europe for many ages, and still doth to some, holding\nthem as yet in slavish subjection, as never tyrannising Spaniards did by\ntheir poor Negroes, or Turks by their galley-slaves. [6427]\"The bishop of\nRome\" (saith Stapleton, a parasite of his, _de mag. Eccles. lib. 2. cap.\n1._) \"hath done that without arms, which those Roman emperors could never\nachieve with forty legions of soldiers,\" deposed kings, and crowned them\nagain with his foot, made friends, and corrected at his pleasure, &c.\n[6428] \"'Tis a wonder,\" saith Machiavel, _Florentinae, his. lib. 1._ \"what\nslavery King Henry II. endured for the death of Thomas a Beckett, what\nthings he was enjoined by the Pope, and how he submitted himself to do that\nwhich in our times a private man would not endure,\" and all through\nsuperstition. [6429]Henry IV. disposed of his empire, stood barefooted with\nhis wife at the gates of Canossus. [6430]Frederic the Emperor was trodden\non by Alexander III., another held Adrian's stirrup, King John kissed the\nknees of Pandulphos the Pope's legate, See. What made so many thousand\nChristians travel from France, Britain, &c., into the Holy Land, spend such\nhuge sums of money, go a pilgrimage so familiarly to Jerusalem, to creep\nand crouch, but slavish superstition? What makes them so freely venture\ntheir lives, to leave their native countries, to go seek martyrdom in the\nIndies, but superstition? to be assassins, to meet death, murder kings, but\na false persuasion of merit, of canonical or blind obedience which they\ninstil into them, and animate them by strange illusions, hope of being\nmartyrs and saints: such pretty feats can the devil work by priests, and so\nwell for their own advantage can they play their parts. And if it were not\nyet enough, by priests and politicians to delude mankind, and crucify the\nsouls of men, he hath more actors in his tragedy, more irons in the fire,\nanother scene of heretics, factious, ambitious wits, insolent spirits,\nschismatics, impostors, false prophets, blind guides, that out of pride,\nsingularity, vainglory, blind zeal, cause much more madness yet, set all in\nan uproar by their new doctrines, paradoxes, figments, crotchets, make new\ndivisions, subdivisions, new sects, oppose one superstition to another, one\nkingdom to another, commit prince and subjects, brother against brother,\nfather against son, to the ruin and destruction of a commonwealth, to the\ndisturbance of peace, and to make a general confusion of all estates. How\ndid those Arians rage of old? how many did they circumvent? Those\nPelagians, Manichees, &c., their names alone would make a just volume. How\nmany silly souls have impostors still deluded, drawn away, and quite\nalienated from Christ! Lucian's Alexander Simon Magus, whose statue was to\nbe seen and adored in Rome, saith Justin Martyr, _Simoni deo sancto_, &c.,\nafter his decease. [6431]Apollonius Tianeus, Cynops, Eumo, who by\ncounterfeiting some new ceremonies and juggling tricks of that Dea Syria,\nby spitting fire, and the like, got an army together of 40,000 men, and did\nmuch harm: with _Eudo de stellis_, of whom Nubrigensis speaks, _lib. 1.\ncap. 19._ that in King Stephen's days imitated most of Christ's miracles,\nfed I know not how many people in the wilderness, and built castles in the\nair, &c., to the seducing of multitudes of poor souls. In Franconia, 1476,\na base illiterate fellow took upon him to be a prophet, and preach, John\nBeheim by name, a neatherd at Nicholhausen, he seduced 30,000 persons, and\nwas taken by the commonalty to be a most holy man, come from heaven. [6432]\n\"Tradesmen left their shops, women their distaffs, servants ran from their\nmasters, children from their parents, scholars left their tutors, all to\nhear him, some for novelty, some for zeal. He was burnt at last by the\nBishop of Wartzburg, and so he and his heresy vanished together.\" How many\nsuch impostors, false prophets, have lived in every king's reign? what\nchronicles will not afford such examples? that as so many _ignes fatui_,\nhave led men out of the way, terrified some, deluded others, that are apt\nto be carried about by the blast of every wind, a rude inconstant\nmultitude, a silly company of poor souls, that follow all, and are\ncluttered together like so many pebbles in a tide. What prodigious follies,\nmadness, vexations, persecutions, absurdities, impossibilities, these\nimpostors, heretics, &c., have thrust upon the world, what strange effects\nshall be shown in the symptoms.\n\nNow the means by which, or advantages the devil and his infernal ministers\ntake, so to delude and disquiet the world with such idle ceremonies, false\ndoctrines, superstitious fopperies, are from themselves, innate fear,\nignorance, simplicity, hope and fear, those two battering cannons and\nprincipal engines, with their objects, reward and punishment, purgatory,\n_Limbus Patrum_, &c. which now more than ever tyrannise; [6433]\"for what\nprovince is free from atheism, superstition, idolatry, schism, heresy,\nimpiety, their factors and followers?\" thence they proceed, and from that\nsame decayed image of God, which is yet remaining in us.\n\n[6434] \"Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri\n        Jussit.\"------\n\nOur own conscience doth dictate so much unto us, we know there is a God and\nnature doth inform us; _Nulla gens tam barbara_ (saith Tully) _cui non\ninsideat haec persuasio Deum esse; sed nec Scytha, nec Groecus, nec Persa,\nnec Hyperboreus dissentiet_ (as Maximus Tyrius the Platonist _ser. 1._\nfarther adds) _nec continentis nec insularum habitator_, let him dwell\nwhere he will, in what coast soever, there is no nation so barbarous that\nis not persuaded there is a God. It is a wonder to read of that infinite\nsuperstition amongst the Indians in this kind, of their tenets in America,\n_pro suo quisque libitu varias res venerabantur superstitiose, plantas,\nanimalia, montes, &c. omne quod amabant aut horrebant_ (some few places\nexcepted as he grants, that had no God at all). So \"the heavens declare the\nglory of God, and the firmament declares his handy work,\" Psalm xix. \"Every\ncreature will evince it;\" _Praesentemque refert quaelibet herba deum.\nNolentes sciunt, fatentur inviti_, as the said Tyrius proceeds, will or\nnill, they must acknowledge it. The philosophers, Socrates, Plato,\nPlotinus, Pythagoras, Trismegistus, Seneca, Epictetus, those Magi, Druids,\n&c. went as far as they could by the light of nature; [6435]_multa\npraeclara, de natura Dei seripta reliquerunt_, \"writ many things well of\nthe nature of God, but they had but a confused light, a glimpse,\"\n\n[6436] \"Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna\n        Est iter in sylvis,\"------\n\n\"as he that walks by moonshine in a wood,\" they groped in the dark; they\nhad a gross knowledge, as he in Euripides, _O Deus quicquid es, sive\ncoelum, sive terra, sive aliud quid_, and that of Aristotle, _Ens entium\nmiserere mei._ And so of the immortality of the soul, and future happiness.\n_Immortalitatem animae_ (saith Hierom) _Pythagoras somniavit, Democritus\nnon credidit in consolalionem damnationis suae Socrates in carcere\ndisputavit; Indus, Persa, Cothus, &c. Philosophantur._ So some said this,\nsome that, as they conceived themselves, which the devil perceiving, led\nthem farther out (as [6437]Lemnius observes) and made them worship him as\ntheir God with stocks and stones, and torture themselves to their own\ndestruction, as he thought fit himself, inspired his priests and ministers\nwith lies and fictions to prosecute the same, which they for their own ends\nwere as willing to undergo, taking advantage of their simplicity, fear and\nignorance. For the common people are as a flock of sheep, a rude,\nilliterate rout, void many times of common sense, a mere beast, _bellua\nmultorum capitum_, will go whithersoever they are led: as you lead a ram\nover a gap by the horns, all the rest will follow, [6438]_Non qua eundum,\nsed qua itur_, they will do as they see others do, and as their prince will\nhave them, let him be of what religion he will, they are for him. Now for\nthose idolaters, Maxentius and Licinius, then for Constantine a Christian.\n[6439]_Qui Christum negant male pereant, acclamatum est Decies_, for two\nhours' space; _qui Christum non colunt, Augusti inimici sunt, acclamatum\nest ter decies_; and by and by idolaters again under that Apostate\nJulianus; all Arians under Constantius, good Catholics again under\nJovinianus, \"And little difference there is between the discretion of men\nand children in this case, especially of old folks and women,\" as [6440]\nCardan discourseth, \"when, as they are tossed with fear and superstition,\nand with other men's folly and dishonesty.\" So that I may say their\nignorance is a cause of their superstition, a symptom, and madness itself:\n_Supplicii causa est, sappliciumque sui._ Their own fear, folly, stupidity,\nto be deplored lethargy, is that which gives occasion to the other, and\npulls these miseries on their own heads. For in all these religions and\nsuperstitions, amongst our idolaters, you shall find that the parties first\naffected, are silly, rude, ignorant people, old folks, that are naturally\nprone to superstition, weak women, or some poor, rude, illiterate persons,\nthat are apt to be wrought upon, and gulled in this kind, prone without\neither examination or due consideration (for they take up religion a trust,\nas at mercers' they do their wares) to believe anything. And the best means\nthey have to broach first, or to maintain it when they have done, is to\nkeep them still in ignorance: for \"ignorance is the mother of devotion,\" as\nall the world knows, and these times can amply witness. This hath been the\ndevil's practice, and his infernal ministers in all ages; not as our\nSaviour by a few silly fishermen, to confound the wisdom of the world, to\nsave publicans and sinners, but to make advantage of their ignorance, to\nconvert them and their associates; and that they may better effect what\nthey intend, they begin, as I say, with poor, [6441]stupid, illiterate\npersons. So Mahomet did when he published his Alcoran, which is a piece of\nwork (saith [6442]Bredenbachius) \"full of nonsense, barbarism, confusion,\nwithout rhyme, reason, or any good composition, first published to a\ncompany of rude rustics, hog-rubbers, that had no discretion, judgment,\nart, or understanding, and is so still maintained.\" For it is a part of\ntheir policy to let no man comment, dare to dispute or call in question to\nthis day any part of it, be it never so absurd, incredible, ridiculous,\nfabulous as it is, must be believed _implicite_, upon pain of death no man\nmust dare to contradict it, \"God and the emperor,\" &c. What else do our\npapists, but by keeping the people in ignorance vent and broach all their\nnew ceremonies and traditions, when they conceal the scripture, read it in\nLatin, and to some few alone, feeding the slavish people in the meantime\nwith tales out of legends, and such like fabulous narrations? Whom do they\nbegin with but collapsed ladies, some few tradesmen, superstitious old\nfolks, illiterate persons, weak women, discontent, rude, silly companions,\nor sooner circumvent? So do all our schismatics and heretics. Marcus and\nValentinian heretics, in [6443]Irenaeus, seduced first I know not how many\nwomen, and made them believe they were prophets. [6444]Friar Cornelius of\nDort seduced a company of silly women. What are all our Anabaptists,\nBrownists, Barrowists, familists, but a company of rude, illiterate,\ncapricious, base fellows? What are most of our papists, but stupid,\nignorant and blind bayards? how should they otherwise be, when as they are\nbrought up and kept still in darkness? [6445]\"If their pastors\" (saith\nLavater) \"have done their duties, and instructed their flocks as they\nought, in the principles of Christian religion, or had not forbidden them\nthe reading of scriptures, they had not been as they are.\" But being so\nmisled all their lives in superstition, and carried hoodwinked like hawks,\nhow can they prove otherwise than blind idiots, and superstitious asses?\nwhat else shall we expect at their hands? Neither is it sufficient to keep\nthem blind, and in Cimmerian darkness, but withal, as a schoolmaster doth\nby his boys, to make them follow their books, sometimes by good hope,\npromises and encouragements, but most of all by fear, strict discipline,\nseverity, threats and punishment, do they collogue and soothe up their\nsilly auditors, and so bring them into a fools' paradise. _Rex eris aiunt,\nsi recte facies_, do well, thou shalt be crowned; but for the most part by\nthreats, terrors, and affrights, they tyrannise and terrify their\ndistressed souls: knowing that fear alone is the sole and only means to\nkeep men in obedience, according to that hemistichium of Petronius, _primus\nin orbe deos fecit timor_, the fear of some divine and supreme powers,\nkeeps men in obedience, makes the people do their duties: they play upon\ntheir consciences; [6446]which was practised of old in Egypt by their\npriests; when there was an eclipse, they made the people believe God was\nangry, great miseries were to come; they take all opportunities of natural\ncauses, to delude the people's senses, and with fearful tales out of\npurgatory, feigned apparitions, earthquakes in Japonia or China, tragical\nexamples of devils, possessions, obsessions, false miracles, counterfeit\nvisions, &c. They do so insult over and restrain them, never hoby so dared\na lark, that they will not [6447]offend the least tradition, tread, or\nscarce look awry: _Deus bone_ ([6448]Lavater exclaims) _quot hoc commentum\nde purgatorio misere afflixit!_ good God, how many men have been miserably\nafflicted by this fiction of purgatory!\n\nTo these advantages of hope and fear, ignorance and simplicity, he hath\nseveral engines, traps, devices, to batter and enthral, omitting no\nopportunities, according to men's several inclinations, abilities, to\ncircumvent and humour them, to maintain his superstitions, sometimes to\nstupefy, besot them: sometimes again by oppositions, factions, to set all\nat odds and in an uproar; sometimes he infects one man, and makes him a\nprincipal agent; sometimes whole cities, countries. If of meaner sort, by\nstupidity, canonical obedience, blind zeal, &c. If of better note, by\npride, ambition, popularity, vainglory. If of the clergy and more eminent,\nof better parts than the rest, more learned, eloquent, he puffs them up\nwith a vain conceit of their own worth, _scientia inflati_, they begin to\nswell, and scorn all the world in respect of themselves, and thereupon turn\nheretics, schismatics, broach new doctrines, frame new crotchets and the\nlike; or else out of too much learning become mad, or out of curiosity they\nwill search into God's secrets, and eat of the forbidden fruit; or out of\npresumption of their holiness and good gifts, inspirations, become\nprophets, enthusiasts, and what not? Or else if they be displeased,\ndiscontent, and have not (as they suppose) preferment to their worth, have\nsome disgrace, repulse, neglected, or not esteemed as they fondly value\nthemselves, or out of emulation, they begin presently to rage and rave,\n_coelum terrae, miscent_, they become so impatient in an instant, that a\nwhole kingdom cannot contain them, they will set all in a combustion, all\nat variance, to be revenged of their adversaries. [6449]Donatus, when he\nsaw Cecilianus preferred before him in the bishopric of Carthage, turned\nheretic, and so did Arian, because Alexander was advanced: we have examples\nat home, and too many experiments of such persons. If they be laymen of\nbetter note, the same engines of pride, ambition, emulation and jealousy,\ntake place, they will be gods themselves: [6450]Alexander in India, after\nhis victories, became so insolent, he would be adored for a god: and those\nRoman emperors came to that height of madness, they must have temples built\nto them, sacrifices to their deities, Divus Augustus, D. Claudius, D.\nAdrianus: [6451]Heliogabalus, \"put out that vestal fire at Rome, expelled\nthe virgins, and banished all other religions all over the world, and would\nbe the sole God himself.\" Our Turks, China kings, great Chams, and Mogors\ndo little less, assuming divine and bombast titles to themselves; the\nmeaner sort are too credulous, and led with blind zeal, blind obedience, to\nprosecute and maintain whatsoever their sottish leaders shall propose, what\nthey in pride and singularity, revenge, vainglory, ambition, spleen, for\ngain, shall rashly maintain and broach, their disciples make a matter of\nconscience, of hell and damnation, if they do it not, and will rather\nforsake wives, children, house and home, lands, goods, fortunes, life\nitself, than omit or abjure the least tittle of it, and to advance the\ncommon cause, undergo any miseries, turn traitors, assassins,\npseudomartyrs, with full assurance and hope of reward in that other world,\nthat they shall certainly merit by it, win heaven, be canonised for saints.\n\nNow when they are truly possessed with blind zeal, and misled with\nsuperstition, he hath many other baits to inveigle and infatuate them\nfarther yet, to make them quite mortified and mad, and that under colour of\nperfection, to merit by penance, going woolward, whipping, alms, fastings,\n&c. An. 1320. there was a sect of [6452]whippers in Germany, that, to the\nastonishment of the beholders, lashed, and cruelly tortured themselves. I\ncould give many other instances of each particular. But these works so done\nare meritorious, _ex opere operato, ex condigno_, for themselves and\nothers, to make them macerate and consume their bodies, _specie virtutis et\numbra_, those evangelical counsels are propounded, as our pseudo-Catholics\ncall them, canonical obedience, wilful poverty, [6453]vows of chastity,\nmonkery, and a solitary life, which extend almost to all religions and\nsuperstitions, to Turks, Chinese, Gentiles, Abyssinians, Greeks, Latins,\nand all countries. Amongst the rest, fasting, contemplation, solitariness,\nare as it were certain rams by which the devil doth batter and work upon\nthe strongest constitutions. _Nonnulli_ (saith Peter Forestus) _ob longas\ninedias, studia et meditationes coelestes, de rebus sacris et religione\nsemper agitant_, by fasting overmuch, and divine meditations, are overcome.\nNot that fasting is a thing of itself to be discommended, for it is an\nexcellent means to keep the body in subjection, a preparative to devotion,\nthe physic of the soul, by which chaste thoughts are engendered, true zeal,\na divine spirit, whence wholesome counsels do proceed, concupiscence is\nrestrained, vicious and predominant lusts and humours are expelled. The\nfathers are very much in commendation of it, and, as Calvin notes,\n\"sometimes immoderate. [6454]The mother of health, key of heaven, a\nspiritual wing to arear us, the chariot of the Holy Ghost, banner of\nfaith,\" &c. And 'tis true they say of it, if it be moderately and\nseasonably used, by such parties as Moses, Elias, Daniel, Christ, and his\n[6455]apostles made use of it; but when by this means they will\nsupererogate, and as [6456]Erasmus well taxeth, _Coelum non sufficere\nputant suis meritis._ Heaven is too small a reward for it; they make choice\nof times and meats, buy and sell their merits, attribute more to them than\nto the ten Commandments, and count it a greater sin to eat meat in Lent,\nthan to kill a man, and as one sayeth, _Plus respiciunt assum piscem, quam\nChristum crucifixum, plus salmonem quam Solomonem, quibus in ore Christus,\nEpicurus in corde_, \"pay more respect to a broiled fish than to Christ\ncrucified, more regard to salmon than to Solomon, have Christ on their\nlips, but Epicurus in their hearts,\" when some counterfeit, and some\nattribute more to such works of theirs than to Christ's death and passion;\nthe devil sets in a foot, strangely deludes them, and by that means makes\nthem to overthrow the temperature of their bodies, and hazard their souls.\nNever any strange illusions of devils amongst hermits, anchorites, never\nany visions, phantasms, apparitions, enthusiasms, prophets, any\nrevelations, but immoderate fasting, bad diet, sickness, melancholy,\nsolitariness, or some such things, were the precedent causes, the\nforerunners or concomitants of them. The best opportunity and sole occasion\nthe devil takes to delude them. Marcilius Cognatus, _lib. 1. cont. cap. 7._\nhath many stories to this purpose, of such as after long fasting have been\nseduced by devils; and [6457]\"'tis a miraculous thing to relate\" (as Cardan\nwrites) \"what strange accidents proceed from fasting; dreams, superstition,\ncontempt of torments, desire of death, prophecies, paradoxes, madness;\nfasting naturally prepares men to these things.\" Monks, anchorites, and the\nlike, after much emptiness, become melancholy, vertiginous, they think they\nhear strange noises, confer with hobgoblins, devils, rivel up their bodies,\n_et dum hostem insequimur_, saith Gregory, _civem quem diligimus,\ntrucidamus_, they become bare skeletons, skin and bones; _Carnibus\nabstinentes proprias carnes devorant, ut nil praeter cutem et ossa sit\nreliquum._ Hilarion, as [6458]Hierome reports in his life, and Athanasius\nof Antonius, was so bare with fasting, \"that the skin did scarce stick to\nthe bones; for want of vapours he could not sleep, and for want of sleep\nbecame idleheaded, heard every night infants cry, oxen low, wolves howl,\nlions roar\" (as he thought), \"clattering of chains, strange voices, and the\nlike illusions of devils.\" Such symptoms are common to those that fast\nlong, are solitary, given to contemplation, overmuch solitariness and\nmeditation. Not that these things (as I said of fasting) are to be\ndiscommended of themselves, but very behoveful in some cases and good:\nsobriety and contemplation join our souls to God, as that heathen\n[6459]Porphyry can tell us. [6460]\"Ecstasy is a taste of future happiness,\nby which we are united unto God, a divine melancholy, a spiritual wing,\"\nBonaventure terms it, to lift us up to heaven; but as it is abused, a mere\ndotage, madness, a cause and symptom of religious melancholy. [6461]\"If you\nshall at any time see\" (saith Guianerius) \"a religious person\nover-superstitious, too solitary, or much given to fasting, that man will\ncertainly be melancholy, thou mayst boldly say it, he will be so.\" P.\nForestus hath almost the same words, and [6462]Cardan _subtil, lib. 18. et\ncap. 40. lib. 8. de rerum varietate_, \"solitariness, fasting, and that\nmelancholy humour, are the causes of all hermits' illusions.\" Lavater, _de\nspect. cap. 19. part. 1._ and _part. 1. cap. 10._ puts solitariness a main\ncause of such spectrums and apparitions; none, saith he, so melancholy as\nmonks and hermits, the devil's hath melancholy; [6463]\"none so subject to\nvisions and dotage in this kind, as such as live solitary lives, they hear\nand act strange things in their dotage.\" [6464]Polydore Virgil, _lib. 2.\nprodigiis_, \"holds that those prophecies and monks' revelations? nuns,\ndreams, which they suppose come from God, to proceed wholly _ab instinctu\ndaemonum_, by the devil's means;\" and so those enthusiasts, Anabaptists,\npseudoprophets from the same cause. [6465]Fracastorius, _lib. 2. de\nintellect_, will have all your pythonesses, sibyls, and pseudoprophets to\nbe mere melancholy, so doth Wierus prove, _lib. 1. cap. 8. et l. 3. cap.\n7._ and Arculanus in 9 Rhasis, that melancholy is a sole cause, and the\ndevil together, with fasting and solitariness, of such sibylline\nprophecies, if there were ever such, which with [6466]Casaubon and others I\njustly except at; for it is not likely that the Spirit of God should ever\nreveal such manifest revelations and predictions of Christ, to those\nPythonissae witches, Apollo's priests, the devil's ministers, (they were no\nbetter) and conceal them from his own prophets; for these sibyls set down\nall particular circumstances of Christ's coming, and many other future\naccidents far more perspicuous and plain than ever any prophet did. But,\nhowsoever, there be no Phaebades or sibyls, I am assured there be other\nenthusiasts, prophets, _dii Fatidici_, Magi, (of which read Jo. Boissardus,\nwho hath laboriously collected them into a great [6467]volume of late, with\nelegant pictures, and epitomised their lives) &c., ever have been in all\nages, and still proceeding from those causes, [6468]_qui visiones suas\nenarrant, somniant futura, prophetisant, et ejusmodi deliriis agitati,\nSpiritum Sanctum sibi communicari putant_. That which is written of Saint\nFrancis' five wounds, and other such monastical effects, of him and others,\nmay justly be referred to this our melancholy; and that which Matthew Paris\nrelates of the [6469]monk of Evesham, who saw heaven and hell in a vision;\nof [6470]Sir Owen, that went down into Saint Patrick's purgatory in King\nStephen's days, and saw as much; Walsingham of him that showed as much by\nSaint Julian. Beda, _lib. 5. cap. 13. 14. 15. et 20._ reports of King\nSebba, _lib. 4. cap. 11. eccles. hist._ that saw strange [6471]visions; and\nStumphius Helvet Cornic, a cobbler of Basle, that beheld rare apparitions\nat Augsburg, [6472]in Germany. Alexander ab Alexandro, _gen. dier. lib. 6.\ncap. 21._ of an enthusiastical prisoner, (all out as probable as that of\nEris Armenius, in Plato's tenth dialogue _de Repub._ that revived again ten\ndays after he was killed in a battle, and told strange wonders, like those\ntales Ulysses related to Alcinous in Homer, or Lucian's _vera historia_\nitself) was still after much solitariness, fasting, or long sickness, when\ntheir brains were addled, and their bellies as empty of meat as their heads\nof wit. Florilegus hath many such examples, _fol. 191._ one of Saint\nGultlake of Crowald that fought with devils, but still after long fasting,\novermuch solitariness, [6473]the devil persuaded him therefore to fast, as\nMoses and Elias did, the better to delude him. [6474]In the same author is\nrecorded Carolus Magnus vision _an._ 185. or ecstasies, wherein he saw\nheaven and hell after much fasting and meditation. So did the devil of old\nwith Apollo's priests. Amphiaraus and his fellows, those Egyptians, still\nenjoin long fasting before he would give any oracles, _triduum a cibo et\nvino abstinerent_, [6475]before they gave any answers, as Volateran _lib.\n13. cap. 4._ records, and Strabo _Geog. lib. 14._ describes Charon's den,\nin the way between Tralles and Nissum, whither the priests led sick and\nfanatic men: but nothing performed without long fasting, no good to be\ndone. That scoffing [6476]Lucian conducts his Menippus to hell by the\ndirections of that Chaldean Mithrobarzanes, but after long fasting, and\nsuch like idle preparation. Which the Jesuits right well perceiving of what\nforce this fasting and solitary meditation is, to alter men's minds, when\nthey would make a man mad, ravish him, improve him beyond himself, to\nundertake some great business of moment, to kill a king, or the like,\n[6477]they bring him into a melancholy dark chamber, where he shall see no\nlight for many days together, no company, little meat, ghastly pictures of\ndevils all about him, and leave him to lie as he will himself, on the bare\nfloor in this chamber of meditation, as they call it, on his back, side,\nbelly, till by this strange usage they make him quite mad and beside\nhimself. And then after some ten days, as they find him animated and\nresolved, they make use of him. The devil hath many such factors, many such\nengines, which what effect they produce, you shall hear in the following\nsymptoms.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Symptoms general, love to their own sect, hate of all other\nreligions, obstinacy, peevishness, ready to undergo any danger or cross for\nit; Martyrs, blind zeal, blind obedience, fastings, vows, belief of\nincredibilities, impossibilities: Particular of Gentiles, Mahometans, Jews,\nChristians; and in them, heretics old, and new, schismatics, schoolmen,\nprophets, enthusiasts, &c._\n\n_Fleat Heraclitus, an rideat Democritus_? in attempting to speak of these\nsymptoms, shall I laugh with Democritus, or weep with Heraclitus? they are\nso ridiculous and absurd on the one side, so lamentable and tragical on the\nother: a mixed scene offers itself, so full of errors and a promiscuous\nvariety of objects, that I know not in what strain to represent it. When I\nthink of the Turkish paradise, those Jewish fables, and pontifical rites,\nthose pagan superstitions, their sacrifices, and ceremonies, as to make\nimages of all matter, and adore them when they have done, to see them, kiss\nthe pyx, creep to the cross, &c. I cannot choose but laugh with Democritus:\nbut when I see them whip and torture themselves, grind their souls for toys\nand trifles, desperate, and now ready to die, I cannot but weep with\nHeraclitus. When I see a priest say mass, with all those apish gestures,\nmurmurings, &c. read the customs of the Jews' synagogue, or Mahometa\nMeschites, I must needs [6478]laugh at their folly, _risum teneatis amici_?\nbut when I see them make matters of conscience of such toys and trifles, to\nadore the devil, to endanger their souls, to offer their children to their\nidols, &c. I must needs condole their misery. When I see two superstitious\norders contend _pro aris et focis_, with such have and hold, _de lana,\ncaprina_, some write such great volumes to no purpose, take so much pains\nto so small effect, their satires, invectives, apologies, dull and gross\nfictions; when I see grave learned men rail and scold like butter-women,\nmethinks 'tis pretty sport, and fit [6479]for Calphurnius and Democritus to\nlaugh at. But when I see so much blood spilt, so many murders and\nmassacres, so many cruel battles fought, &c. 'tis a fitter subject for\nHeraclitus to lament. [6480]As Merlin when he sat by the lake side with\nVortigern, and had seen the white and red dragon fight, before he began to\ninterpret or to speak, _in fletum prorupit_, fell a weeping, and then\nproceeded to declare to the king what it meant. I should first pity and\nbewail this misery of human kind with some passionate preface, wishing mine\neyes a fountain of tears, as Jeremiah did, and then to my task. For it is\nthat great torture, that infernal plague of mortal men, _omnium pestium\npestilentissima superstitio_, and able of itself alone to stand in\nopposition to all other plagues, miseries and calamities whatsoever; far\nmore cruel, more pestiferous, more grievous, more general, more violent, of\na greater extent. Other fears and sorrows, grievances of body and mind, are\ntroublesome for the time; but this is for ever, eternal damnation, hell\nitself, a plague, a fire: an inundation hurts one province alone, and the\nloss may be recovered; but this superstition involves all the world almost,\nand can never be remedied. Sickness and sorrows come and go, but a\nsuperstitious soul hath no rest; [6481]_superstitione imbutus animus\nnunquam quietus esse potest_, no peace, no quietness. True religion and\nsuperstition are quite opposite, _longe diversa carnificina et pietas_, as\nLactantius describes, the one erects, the other dejects; _illorum pietas,\nmera impietus_; the one is an easy yoke, the other an intolerable burden,\nan absolute tyranny; the one a sure anchor, a haven; the other a\ntempestuous ocean; the one makes, the other mars; the one is wisdom, the\nother is folly, madness, indiscretion; the one unfeigned, the other a\ncounterfeit; the one a diligent observer, the other an ape; one leads to\nheaven, the other to hell. But these differences will more evidently appear\nby their particular symptoms. What religion is, and of what parts it doth\nconsist, every catechism will tell you, what symptoms it hath, and what\neffects it produceth: but for their superstitions, no tongue can tell them,\nno pen express, they are so many, so diverse, so uncertain, so inconstant,\nand so different from themselves. _Tot mundi superstitiones quot coelo\nstellae_, one saith, there be as many superstitions in the world, as there\nbe stars in heaven, or devils themselves that are the first founders of\nthem: with such ridiculous, absurd symptoms and signs, so many several\nrites, ceremonies, torments and vexations accompanying, as may well express\nand beseem the devil to be the author and maintainer of them. I will only\npoint at some of them, _ex ungue leonem_ guess at the rest, and those of\nthe chief kinds of superstition, which beside us Christians now domineer\nand crucify the world, Gentiles, Mahometans, Jews, &c.\n\nOf these symptoms some be general, some particular to each private sect:\ngeneral to all, are, an extraordinary love and affection they bear and show\nto such as are of their own sect, and more than Vatinian hate to such as\nare opposite in religion, as they call it, or disagree from them in their\nsuperstitious rites, blind zeal, (which is as much a symptom as a cause,)\nvain fears, blind obedience, needless works, incredibilities,\nimpossibilities, monstrous rites and ceremonies, wilfulness, blindness,\nobstinacy, &c. For the first, which is love and hate, as [6482]Montanus\nsaith, _nulla firmior amicitia quam quae contrahitur hinc; nulla discordia\nmajor, quam quae a religione fit_; no greater concord, no greater discord\nthan that which proceeds from religion, it is incredible to relate, did not\nour daily experience evince it, what factions, _quam teterrimae factiones_,\n(as [6483]Rich. Dinoth writes) have been of late for matters of religion in\nFrance, and what hurlyburlies all over Europe for these many years. _Nihil\nest quod tam impotentur rapiat homines, quam suscepta de salute opinio;\nsiquidem pro ea omnes gentes corpora et animas devovere solent, et\narctissimo necessitudinis vinculo se invicem colligare._ We are all\nbrethren in Christ, servants of one Lord, members of one body, and\ntherefore are or should be at least dearly beloved, inseparably allied in\nthe greatest bond of love and familiarity, united partakers not only of the\nsame cross, but coadjutors, comforters, helpers, at all times, upon all\noccasions: as they did in the primitive church, Acts the 5. they sold their\npatrimonies, and laid them at the apostles' feet, and many such memorable\nexamples of mutual love we have had under the ten general persecutions,\nmany since. Examples on the other side of discord none like, as our Saviour\nsaith, he came therefore into the world to set father against son, &c. In\nimitation of whom the devil belike ([6484]_nam superstitio irrepsit verae\nreligionis imitatrix_, superstition is still religion's ape, as in all\nother things, so in this) doth so combine and glue together his\nsuperstitious followers in love and affection, that they will live and die\ntogether: and what an innate hatred hath he still inspired to any other\nsuperstition opposite? How those old Romans were affected, those ten\npersecutions may be a witness, and that cruel executioner in Eusebius, _aut\nlita aut morere_, sacrifice or die. No greater hate, more continuate,\nbitter faction, wars, persecution in all ages, than for matters of\nreligion, no such feral opposition, father against son, mother against\ndaughter, husband against wife, city against city, kingdom against kingdom:\nas of old at Tentira and Combos:\n\n[6485] \"Immortale odium, et nunquam sanabile vulnus,\n        Inde furor vulgo, quod numina vicinorum\n        Odit uterque locus, quum solos credit habendos\n        Esse deos quos ipse colat.\"------\n\n       \"Immortal hate it breeds, a wound past cure,\n        And fury to the commons still to endure:\n        Because one city t' other's gods as vain\n        Deride, and his alone as good maintain.\"\n\nThe Turks at this day count no better of us than of dogs, so they commonly\ncall us giaours, infidels, miscreants, make that their main quarrel and\ncause of Christian persecution. If he will turn Turk, he shall be\nentertained as a brother, and had in good esteem, a Mussulman or a\nbeliever, which is a greater tie to them than any affinity or\nconsanguinity. The Jews stick together like so many burrs; but as for the\nrest, whom they call Gentiles, they do hate and abhor, they cannot endure\ntheir Messiah should be a common saviour to us all, and rather, as\n[6486]Luther writes, \"than they that now scoff at them, curse them,\npersecute and revile them, shall be coheirs and brethren with them, or have\nany part or fellowship with their Messiah, they would crucify their Messiah\nten times over, and God himself, his angels, and all his creatures, if it\nwere possible, though they endure a thousand hells for it.\" Such is their\nmalice towards us. Now for Papists, what in a common cause, for the\nadvancement of their religion they will endure, our traitors and\npseudo-Catholics will declare unto us; and how bitter on the other side to\ntheir adversaries, how violently bent, let those Marian times record, as\nthose miserable slaughters at Merindol and Cabriers, the Spanish\ninquisition, the Duke of Alva's tyranny in the Low Countries, the French\nmassacres and civil wars. [6487]_Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum_.\n\"Such wickedness did religion persuade.\" Not there only, but all over\nEurope, we read of bloody battles, racks and wheels, seditions, factions,\noppositions.\n\n[6488]  ------\"obvia signis\n        Signa, pares aquilas, et pila minantia pilis,\"\n\nInvectives and contentions. They had rather shake hands with a Jew, Turk,\nor, as the Spaniards do, suffer Moors to live amongst them, and Jews, than\nProtestants; \"my name\" (saith [6489]Luther) \"is more odious to them than\nany thief or murderer.\" So it is with all heretics and schismatics\nwhatsoever: and none so passionate, violent in their tenets, opinions,\nobstinate, wilful, refractory, peevish, factious, singular and stiff in\ndefence of them; they do not only persecute and hate, but pity all other\nreligions, account them damned, blind, as if they alone were the true\nchurch, they are the true heirs, have the fee-simple of heaven by a\npeculiar donation, 'tis entailed on them and their posterities, their\ndoctrine sound, _per funem aureum de coelo delapsa doctrinci_, \"let down\nfrom, heaven by a golden rope,\" they alone are to be saved, The Jews at\nthis day are so incomprehensibly proud and churlish, saith [6490]Luther,\nthat _soli salvari, soli domini terrarum salutari volunt._ And as\n[6491]Buxtorfius adds, \"so ignorant and self-willed withal, that amongst\ntheir most understanding Rabbins you shall find nought but gross dotage,\nhorrible hardness of heart, and stupendous obstinacy, in all their actions,\nopinions, conversations: and yet so zealous with all, that no man living\ncan be more, and vindicate themselves for the elect people of GOD.\" 'Tis so\nwith all other superstitious sects, Mahometans, Gentiles in China, and\nTartary: our ignorant Papists, Anabaptists, Separatists, and peculiar\nchurches of Amsterdam, they alone, and none but they can be saved.\n[6492]\"Zealous\" (as Paul saith, Rom. x. 2.) \"without knowledge,\" they will\nendure any misery, any trouble, suffer and do that which the sunbeams will\nnot endure to see, _Religionis acti Furiis_, all extremities, losses and\ndangers, take any pains, fast, pray, vow chastity, wilful poverty, forsake\nall and follow their idols, die a thousand deaths as some Jews did to\nPilate's soldiers, in like case, _exertos praebentes jugulos, et manifeste\nprae se ferentes_, (as Josephus hath it) _cariorem esse rita sibi legis\npatriae observationem_, rather than abjure, or deny the least particle of\nthat religion which their fathers profess, and they themselves have been\nbrought up in, be it never so absurd, ridiculous, they will embrace it, and\nwithout farther inquiry or examination of the truth, though it be\nprodigiously false, they will believe it; they will take much more pains to\ngo to hell, than we shall do to heaven. Single out the most ignorant of\nthem, convince his understanding, show him his errors, grossness, and\nabsurdities of his sect. _Non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris_, he will not\nbe persuaded. As those pagans told the Jesuits in Japona, [6493]they would\ndo as their forefathers have done: and with Ratholde the Frisian Prince, go\nto hell for company, if most of their friends went thither: they will not\nbe moved, no persuasion, no torture can stir them. So that papists cannot\nbrag of their vows, poverty, obedience, orders, merits, martyrdoms,\nfastings, alms, good works, pilgrimages: much and more than all this, I\nshall show you, is, and hath been done by these superstitious Gentiles,\nPagans, Idolaters and Jews: their blind zeal and idolatrous superstition in\nall kinds is much at one; little or no difference, and it is hard to say\nwhich is the greatest, which is the grossest. For if a man shall duly\nconsider those superstitious rites amongst the Ethnics in Japan, the\nBannians in Gusart, the Chinese idolaters, [6494]Americans of old, in\nMexico especially, Mahometan priests, he shall find the same government\nalmost, the same orders and ceremonies, or so like, that they may seem all\napparently to be derived from some heathen spirit, and the Roman hierarchy\nno better than the rest. In a word, this is common to all superstition,\nthere is nothing so mad and absurd, so ridiculous, impossible, incredible,\nwhich they will not believe, observe, and diligently perform, as much as in\nthem lies; nothing so monstrous to conceive, or intolerable to put in\npractice, so cruel to suffer, which they will not willingly undertake. So\npowerful a thing is superstition. [6495]\"O Egypt\" (as Trismegistus\nexclaims) \"thy religion is fables, and such as posterity will not believe.\"\nI know that in true religion itself, many mysteries are so apprehended\nalone by faith, as that of the Trinity, which Turks especially deride,\nChrist's incarnation, resurrection of the body at the last day, _quod ideo\ncredendum_ (saith Tertullian) _quod incredible_, &c. many miracles not to\nbe controverted or disputed of. _Mirari non rimari sapientia vera est_,\nsaith [6496]Gerhardus; _et in divinis_ (as a good father informs us)\n_quaedam credenda, quaedam admiranda_, &c. some things are to be believed,\nembraced, followed with all submission and obedience, some again admired.\nThough Julian the apostate scoff at Christians in this point, _quod\ncaptivemus intellectum in obsequium fidei_, saying, that the Christian\ncreed is like the Pythagorean _Ipse dixit_, we make our will and\nunderstanding too slavishly subject to our faith, without farther\nexamination of the truth; yet as Saint Gregory truly answers, our creed is\n_altioris praestantiae_, and much more divine; and as Thomas will, _pie\nconsideranti semper suppetunt rationes, ostendentes credibilitatem in\nmysteriis supernaturalibus_, we do absolutely believe it, and upon good\nreasons, for as Gregory well informeth us; _Fides non habet meritum, ubi\nhumana ratio quaerit experimentum_; that faith hath no merit, is not worth\nthe name of faith, that will not apprehend without a certain demonstration:\nwe must and will believe God's word; and if we be mistaken or err in our\ngeneral belief, as [6497]Richardus de _Sancto Victore_, vows he will say to\nChrist himself at the day of judgment; \"Lord, if we be deceived, thou alone\nhast deceived us:\" thus we plead. But for the rest I will not justify that\npontificial consubstantiation, that which [6498]Mahometans and Jews justly\nexcept at, as Campanella confesseth, _Atheismi triumphat. cap. 12. fol.\n125_, _difficillimum dogma esse, nec aliud subjectum magis haereticorum\nblasphemiis, et stultis irrisionibus politicorum reperiri_. They hold it\nimpossible, _Deum in pane manducari_; and besides they scoff at it, _vide\ngentem comedentem Deum suum, inquit quidam Maurus_. [6499]_Hunc Deum muscae\net vermes irrident, quum ipsum polluunt et devorant, subditus est igni,\naquae, et latrones furantur, pixidem auream humi prosternunt, et se tamen\nnon defendit hic Deus. Qui fieri potest, ut sit integer in singulis hostiae\nparticulis, idem corpus numero, tam multis locis, caelo, terra_, &c. But he\nthat shall read the [6500]Turks' Alcoran, the Jews' Talmud, and papists'\ngolden legend, in the mean time will swear that such gross fictions,\nfables, vain traditions, prodigious paradoxes and ceremonies, could never\nproceed from any other spirit, than that of the devil himself, which is the\nauthor of confusion and lies; and wonder withal how such wise men as have\nbeen of the Jews, such learned understanding men as Averroes, Avicenna, or\nthose heathen philosophers, could ever be persuaded to believe, or to\nsubscribe to the least part of them: _aut fraudem non detegere_: but that\nas [6501]Vanninus answers, _ob publicae, potestatis formidinem allatrare\nphilosophi non audebant_, they durst not speak for fear of the law. But I\nwill descend to particulars: read their several symptoms and then guess.\n\nOf such symptoms as properly belong to superstition, or that irreligious\nreligion, I may say as of the rest, some are ridiculous, some again feral\nto relate. Of those ridiculous, there can be no better testimony than the\nmultitude of their gods, those absurd names, actions, offices they put upon\nthem, their feasts, holy days, sacrifices, adorations, and the like. The\nEgyptians that pretended so great antiquity, 300 kings before Amasis: and\nas Mela writes, 13,000 years from the beginning of their chronicles, that\nbragged so much of their knowledge of old, for they invented arithmetic,\nastronomy, geometry: of their wealth and power, that vaunted of 20,000\ncities: yet at the same time their idolatry and superstition was most\ngross: they worshipped, as Diodorus Siculus records, sun and moon under the\nname of Isis and Osiris, and after, such men as were beneficial to them, or\nany creature that did them good. In the city of Bubasti they adored a cat,\nsaith Herodotus. Ibis and storks, an ox: (saith Pliny) [6502]leeks and\nonions, Macrobius,\n\n[6503] \"Porrum et caepe deos imponere nubibus ausi,\n        Hos tu Nile deos colis.\"------\n\nScoffing [6504]Lucian in his _vera Historia_: which, as he confesseth\nhimself, was not persuasively written as a truth, but in comical fashion to\nglance at the monstrous fictions and gross absurdities of writers and\nnations, to deride without doubt this prodigious Egyptian idolatry, feigns\nthis story of himself: that when he had seen the Elysian fields, and was\nnow coming away, Rhadamanthus gave him a mallow root, and bade him pray to\nthat when he was in any peril or extremity; which he did accordingly; for\nwhen he came to Hydamordia in the island of treacherous women, he made his\nprayers to his root, and was instantly delivered. The Syrians, Chaldeans,\nhad as many proper gods of their own invention; see the said Lucian _de dea\nSyria._ Morney _cap. 22. de veritat. relig._ Guliel. Stuckius\n[6505]_Sacrorum Sacrificiorumque Gentil. descript._ Peter Faber Semester,\n_l. 3. c. 1, 2, 3._ Selden _de diis Syris_, Purchas' pilgrimage, [6506]\nRosinus of the Romans, and Lilius Giraldus of the Greeks. The Romans\nborrowed from all, besides their own gods, which were _majorum_ and\n_minorum gentium_, as Varro holds, certain and uncertain; some celestial,\nselect, and great ones, others indigenous and Semi-dei, Lares, Lemures,\nDioscuri, Soteres, and Parastatae, _dii tutelares_ amongst the Greeks: gods\nof all sorts, for all functions; some for the land, some for sea; some for\nheaven, some for hell; some for passions, diseases, some for birth, some\nfor weddings, husbandry, woods, waters, gardens, orchards, &c. All actions\nand offices, Pax-Quies, Salus, Libertas, Felicitas, Strenua, Stimula,\nHorta, Pan, Sylvanus, Priapus, Flora, Cloacina, Stercutius, Febris, Pallor,\nInvidia, Protervia, Risus, Angerona, Volupia, Vacuna, Viriplaca, Veneranda,\nPales, Neptunia, Doris, kings, emperors, valiant men that had done any good\noffices for them, they did likewise canonise and adore for gods, and it was\nusually done, _usitatum apud antiquos_, as [6507]Jac. Boissardus well\nobserves, _deificare homines qui beneficiis mortales juvarent_, and the\ndevil was still ready to second their intents, _statim se ingessit illorum\nsepulchris, statuis, templis, aris_, &c. he crept into their temples,\nstatues, tombs, altars, and was ready to give oracles, cure diseases, do\nmiracles, &c. as by Jupiter, Aesculapius, Tiresias, Apollo, Mopsus,\nAmphiaraus, &c. _dii et Semi-dii._ For so they were _Semi-dii_, demigods,\nsome _medii inter Deos et homines_, as Max. [6508]Tyrius, the Platonist,\n_ser. 26. et 27_, maintains and justifies in many words. \"When a good man\ndies, his body is buried, but his soul, _ex homine daemon evadit_, becomes\nforthwith a demigod, nothing disparaged with malignity of air, or variety\nof forms, rejoiceth, exults and sees that perfect beauty with his eyes. Now\nbeing deified, in commiseration he helps his poor friends here on earth,\nhis kindred and allies, informs, succours, &c. punisheth those that are bad\nand do amiss, as a good genius to protect and govern mortal men appointed\nby the gods, so they will have it, ordaining some for provinces, some for\nprivate men, some for one office, some for another. Hector and Achilles\nassist soldiers to this day; Aesculapius all sick men, the Dioscuri\nseafaring men, &c. and sometimes upon occasion they show themselves. The\nDioscuri, Hercules and Aesculapius, he saw himself (or the devil in his\nlikeness) _non somnians sed vigilans ipse vidi_:\" So far Tyrius. And not\ngood men only do they thus adore, but tyrants, monsters, devils, (as [6509]\nStuckius inveighs) Neros, Domitians, Heliogables, beastly women, and arrant\nwhores amongst the rest. \"For all intents, places, creatures, they assign\ngods;\"\n\n       \"Et domibus, tectis, thermis, et equis soleatis\n        Assignare solent genios\"------\n\nsaith Prudentius. Cuna for cradles, Diverra for sweeping houses, Nodina\nknots, Prema, Pramunda, Hymen, Hymeneus, for weddings; Comus the god of\ngood fellows, gods of silence, of comfort, Hebe goddess of youth, _Mena\nmenstruarum_, &c. male and female gods, of all ages, sexes and dimensions,\nwith beards, without beards, married, unmarried, begot, not born at all,\nbut, as Minerva, start out of Jupiter's head. Hesiod reckons up at least\n30,000 gods, Varro 300 Jupiters. As Jeremy told them, their gods were to\nthe multitude of cities;\n\n       \"Quicquid humus, pelagus, coelum miserabile gignit\n        Id dixere deos, colles, freta, flumina, flammas.\"\n\n       \"Whatever heavens, sea, and land begat,\n        Hills, seas, and rivers, God was this and that.\"\n\nAnd which was most absurd, they made gods upon such ridiculous occasions;\n\"As children make babies\" (so saith [6510]Morneus), \"their poets make\ngods,\" _et quos adorant in templis, ludunt in Theatris_, as Lactantius\nscoffs. Saturn, a man, gelded himself, did eat his own children, a cruel\ntyrant driven out of his kingdom by his son Jupiter, as good a god as\nhimself, a wicked lascivious paltry king of Crete, of whose rapes, lusts,\nmurders, villainies, a whole volume is too little to relate. Venus, a\nnotorious strumpet, as common as a barber's chair, Mars, Adonis, Anchises'\nwhore, is a great she-goddess, as well as the rest, as much renowned by\ntheir poets, with many such; and these gods so fabulously and foolishly\nmade, _ceremoniis, hymnis, et canticis celebrunt_; their errors, _luctus et\ngaudia, amores, iras, nuptias et liberorum procreationes_ ([6511]as\nEusebius well taxeth), weddings, mirth and mournings, loves, angers, and\nquarrelling they did celebrate in hymns, and sing of in their ordinary\nsongs, as it were publishing their villainies. But see more of their\noriginals. When Romulus was made away by the sedition of the senators, to\npacify the people, [6512]Julius Proculus gave out that Romulus was taken up\nby Jupiter into heaven, and therefore to be ever after adored for a god\namongst the Romans. Syrophanes of Egypt had one only son, whom he dearly\nloved; he erected his statue in his house, which his servants did adorn\nwith garlands, to pacify their master's wrath when he was angry, so by\nlittle and little he was adored for a god. This did Semiramis for her\nhusband Belus, and Adrian the emperor by his minion Antinous. Flora was a\nrich harlot in Rome, and for that she made the commonwealth her heir, her\nbirthday was solemnised long after; and to make it a more plausible\nholiday, they made her goddess of flowers, and sacrificed to her amongst\nthe rest. The matrons of Rome, as Dionysius Halicarnassaeus relates,\nbecause at their entreaty Coriolanus desisted from his wars, consecrated a\nchurch _Fortunes muliebri_; and [6513]Venus Barbata had a temple erected,\nfor that somewhat was amiss about hair, and so the rest. The citizens\n[6514]of Alabanda, a small town in Asia Minor, to curry favour with the\nRomans (who then warred in Greece with Perseus of Macedon, and were\nformidable to these parts), consecrated a temple to the City of Rome, and\nmade her a goddess, with annual games and sacrifices; so a town of houses\nwas deified, with shameful flattery of the one side to give, and\nintolerable arrogance on the other to accept, upon so vile and absurd an\noccasion. Tully writes to Atticus, that his daughter Tulliola might be made\na goddess, and adored as Juno and Minerva, and as well she deserved it.\nTheir holy days and adorations were all out as ridiculous; those Lupercals\nof Pan, Florales of Flora, Bona dea, Anna Perenna, Saturnals, &c., as how\nthey were celebrated, with what lascivious and wanton gestures, bald\nceremonies, [6515]by what bawdy priests, how they hang their noses over the\nsmoke of sacrifices, saith [6516]Lucian, and lick blood like flies that was\nspilled about the altars. Their carved idols, gilt images of wood, iron,\nivory, silver, brass, stone, _olim truncus eram_, &c., were most absurd, as\nbeing their own workmanship; for as Seneca notes, _adorant ligneos deos, et\nfabros interim qui fecerunt, contemnunt_, they adore work, contemn the\nworkman; and as Tertullian follows it, _Si homines non essent diis\npropitii, non essent dii_, had it not been for men, they had never been\ngods, but blocks, and stupid statues in which mice, swallows, birds make\ntheir nests, spiders their webs, and in their very mouths laid their\nexcrements. Those images, I say, were all out as gross as the shapes in\nwhich they did represent them: Jupiter with a ram's head, Mercury a dog's,\nPan like a goat, Heccate with three heads, one with a beard, another\nwithout; see more in Carterius and [6517]Verdurius of their monstrous forms\nand ugly pictures: and, which was absurder yet, they told them these images\ncame from heaven, as that of Minerva in her temple at Athens, _quod e coelo\ncecidisse credebant accolae_, saith Pausanias. They formed some like\nstorks, apes, bulls, and yet seriously believed: and that which was impious\nand abominable, they made their gods notorious whoremasters, incestuous\nSodomites (as commonly they were all, as well as Jupiter, Mars, Apollo,\nMercury, Neptune, &c.), thieves, slaves, drudges (for Apollo and Neptune\nmade tiles in Phrygia), kept sheep, Hercules emptied stables, Vulcan a\nblacksmith, unfit to dwell upon the earth for their villainies, much less\nin heaven, as [6518]Mornay well saith, and yet they gave them out to be\nsuch; so weak and brutish, some to whine, lament, and roar, as Isis for her\nson and Cenocephalus, as also all her weeping priests; Mars in Homer to be\nwounded, vexed; Venus ran away crying, and the like; than which what can be\nmore ridiculous? _Nonne ridiculum lugere quod colas, vel colere quod\nlugeas_? (which [6519]Minutius objects) _Si dii, cur plangitis? si mortui,\ncur adoratis_? that it is no marvel if [6520]Lucian, that adamantine\npersecutor of superstition, and Pliny could so scoff at them and their\nhorrible idolatry as they did; if Diagoras took Hercules' image, and put it\nunder his pot to seethe his pottage, which was, as he said, his 13th\nlabour. But see more of their fopperies in Cypr. _4. tract, de Idol.\nvarietat._ Chrysostom _advers. Gentil._ Arnobius _adv. Gentes._ Austin, _de\nciv. dei._ Theodoret. _de curat. Graec. affect._ Clemens Alexandrinus,\nMinutius Felix, Eusebius, Lactantius, Stuckius, &c. Lamentable, tragical,\nand fearful those symptoms are, that they should be so far forth affrighted\nwith their fictitious gods, as to spend the goods, lives, fortunes,\nprecious time, best days in their honour, to [6521]sacrifice unto them, to\ntheir inestimable loss, such hecatombs, so many thousand sheep, oxen with\ngilded horns, goats, as [6522]Croesus, king of Lydia, [6523] Marcus\nJulianus, surnamed _ob crebras hostias Victimarius, et Tauricremus_, and\nthe rest of the Roman emperors usually did with such labour and cost; and\nnot emperors only and great ones, _pro communi bono_, were at this charge,\nbut private men for their ordinary occasions. Pythagoras offered a hundred\noxen for the invention of a geometrical problem, and it was an ordinary\nthing to sacrifice in [6524]Lucian's time, \"a heifer for their good health,\nfour oxen for wealth, a hundred for a kingdom, nine bulls for their safe\nreturn from Troja to Pylus,\" &c. Every god almost had a peculiar\nsacrifice--the Sun horses, Vulcan fire, Diana a white hart, Venus a turtle,\nCeres a hog, Proserpine a black lamb, Neptune a bull (read more in [6525]\nStuckius at large), besides sheep, cocks, corals, frankincense, to their\nundoings, as if their gods were affected with blood or smoke. \"And surely\"\n([6526]saith he) \"if one should but repeat the fopperies of mortal men, in\ntheir sacrifices, feasts, worshipping their gods, their rites and\nceremonies, what they think of them, of their diet, houses, orders, &c.,\nwhat prayers and vows they make; if one should but observe their absurdity\nand madness, he would burst out a laughing, and pity their folly.\" For what\ncan be more absurd than their ordinary prayers, petitions, [6527]requests,\nsacrifices, oracles, devotions? of which we have a taste in Maximus Tyrius,\n_serm. 1._ Plato's Alcibiades Secundus, Persius _Sat. 2._ Juvenal. _Sat.\n10._ there likewise exploded, _Mactant opimas et pingues hostias deo quasi\nesurienti, profundunt vina tanquam sitienti, lumina accendunt velut in\ntenebris agenti_ (Lactantius, _lib. 2. cap. 6_). As if their gods were\nhungry, athirst, in the dark, they light candles, offer meat and drink. And\nwhat so base as to reveal their counsels and give oracles, _e viscerum\nsterquiliniis_, out of the bowels and excremental parts of beasts?\n_sordidos deos_ Varro truly calls them therefore, and well he might. I say\nnothing of their magnificent and sumptuous temples, those majestical\nstructures: to the roof of Apollo Didymeus' temple, _ad branchidas_, as\n[6528]Strabo writes, a thousand oaks did not suffice. Who can relate the\nglorious splendour, and stupend magnificence, the sumptuous building of\nDiana at Ephesus, Jupiter Ammon's temple in Africa, the Pantheon at Rome,\nthe Capitol, the Sarapium at Alexandria, Apollo's temple at Daphne in the\nsuburbs of Antioch. The great temple at Mexico so richly adorned, and so\ncapacious (for 10,000 men might stand in it at once), that fair Pantheon of\nCusco, described by Acosta in his Indian History, which eclipses both Jews\nand Christians. There were in old Jerusalem, as some write, 408 synagogues;\nbut new Cairo reckons up (if [6529]Radzivilus may be believed) 6800\nmosques; Fez 400, whereof 50 are most magnificent, like St. Paul's in\nLondon. Helena built 300 fair churches in the Holy Land, but one Bassa hath\nbuilt 400 mosques. The Mahometans have 1000 monks in a monastery; the like\nsaith Acosta of Americans; Riccius of the Chinese, for men and women,\nfairly built; and more richly endowed some of them, than Arras in Artois,\nFulda in Germany, or St. Edmund's-Bury in England with us: who can describe\nthose curious and costly statues, idols, images, so frequently mentioned in\nPausanias? I conceal their donaries, pendants, other offerings, presents,\nto these their fictitious gods daily consecrated. [6530]Alexander, the son\nof Amyntas, king of Macedonia, sent two statues of pure gold to Apollo at\nDelphos. [6531]Croesus, king of Lydia dedicated a hundred golden tiles in\nthe same place with a golden altar: no man came empty-handed to their\nshrines. But these are base offerings in respect; they offered men\nthemselves alive. The Leucadians, as Strabo writes, sacrificed every year a\nman, _averruncandae, deorum irae, causa_, to pacify their gods, _de montis\npraecipitio dejecerent_, &c. and they did voluntarily undergo it. The Decii\ndid so sacrifice, _Diis manibus_; Curtius did leap into the gulf. Were they\nnot all strangely deluded to go so far to their oracles, to be so gulled by\nthem, both in war and peace, as Polybius relates (which their argurs,\npriests, vestal virgins can witness), to be so superstitious, that they\nwould rather lose goods and lives than omit any ceremonies, or offend their\nheathen gods? Nicias, that generous and valiant captain of the Greeks,\noverthrew the Athenian navy, by reason of his too much superstition, [6532]\nbecause the augurs told him it was ominous to set sail from the haven of\nSyracuse whilst the moon was eclipsed; he tarried so long till his enemies\nbesieged him, he and all his army were overthrown. The [6533]Parthians of\nold were so sottish in this kind, they would rather lose a victory, nay\nlose their own lives, than fight in the night, 'twas against their\nreligion. The Jews would make no resistance on the Sabbath, when Pompeius\nbesieged Jerusalem; and some Jewish Christians in Africa, set upon by the\nGoths, suffered themselves upon the same occasion to be utterly vanquished.\nThe superstition of the Dibrenses, a bordering town in Epirus, besieged by\nthe Turks, is miraculous almost to report. Because a dead dog was flung\ninto the only fountain which the city had, they would die of thirst all,\nrather than drink of that [6534]unclean water, and yield up the city upon\nany conditions. Though the praetor and chief citizens began to drink first,\nusing all good persuasions, their superstition was such, no saying would\nserve, they must all forthwith die or yield up the city. _Vix ausum ipse\ncredere_ (saith [6535]Barletius) _tantam superstitionem, vel affirmare\nlevissimam hanc causam tantae rei vel magis ridiculam, quum non dubitem\nrisum potius quum admirationem posteris excitaturam._ The story was too\nridiculous, he was ashamed to report it, because he thought nobody would\nbelieve it. It is stupend to relate what strange effects this idolatry and\nsuperstition hath brought forth of the latter years in the Indies and those\nbordering parts: [6536]in what feral shapes the [6537]devil is adored, _ne\nquid mali intentent_, as they say; for in the mountains betwixt Scanderoon\nand Aleppo, at this day, there are dwelling a certain kind of people called\nCoords, coming of the race of the ancient Parthians, who worship the devil,\nand allege this reason in so doing: God is a good man and will do no harm,\nbut the devil is bad and must be pleased, lest he hurt them. It is\nwonderful to tell how the devil deludes them, how he terrifies them, how\nthey offer men and women sacrifices unto him, a hundred at once, as they\ndid infants in Crete to Saturn of old, the finest children, like\nAgamemnon's Iphigenia, &c. At [6538]Mexico, when the Spaniards first\novercame them, they daily sacrificed _viva hominum corda e viventium\ncorporibus extracta_, the hearts of men yet living, 20,000 in a year\n(Acosta _lib. 5. cap. 20_) to their idols made of flour and men's blood,\nand every year 6000 infants of both sexes: and as prodigious to relate,\n[6539]how they bury their wives with husbands deceased, 'tis fearful to\nreport, and harder to believe,\n\n[6540] \"Nam certamen habent laethi quae viva sequatur\n        Conjugium, pudor, est non licuisse mori,\"\n\nand burn them alive, best goods, servants, horses, when a grandee dies,\n[6541]twelve thousand at once amongst the Tartar's, when a great Cham\ndeparts, or an emperor in America: how they plague themselves, which\nabstain from all that hath life, like those old Pythagoreans, with\nimmoderate fastings, [6542]as the Bannians about Surat, they of China, that\nfor superstition's sake never eat flesh nor fish all their lives, never\nmarry, but live in deserts and by-places, and some pray to their idols\ntwenty-four hours together without any intermission, biting of their\ntongues when they have done, for devotion's sake. Some again are brought to\nthat madness by their superstitious priests (that tell them such vain\nstories of immortality, and the joys of heaven in that other life), [6543]\nthat many thousands voluntarily break their own necks, as Cleombrotus\nAmborciatus, auditors of old, precipitate themselves, that they may\nparticipate of that unspeakable happiness in the other world. One poisons,\nanother strangles himself, and the King of China had done as much, deluded\nwith the vain hope, had he not been detained by his servant. But who can\nsufficiently tell of their several superstitions, vexations, follies,\ntorments? I may conclude with [6544]Possevinus, _Religifacit asperos mites,\nhomines e feris; superstitio ex hominibus feras_, religion makes wild\nbeasts civil, superstition makes wise men beasts and fools; and the\ndiscreetest that are, if they give way to it, are no better than dizzards;\nnay more, if that of Plotinus be true, _is unus religionis scopus, ut ei\nquem colimus similes fiamus_, that is the drift of religion to make us like\nhim whom we worship: what shall be the end of idolaters, but to degenerate\ninto stocks and stones? of such as worship these heathen gods, for _dii\ngentium daemonia_, [6545]but to become devils themselves? 'Tis therefore\n_exitiosus error, et maxime periculosus_, a most perilous and dangerous\nerror of all others, as [6546]Plutarch holds, _turbulenta passio hominem\nconsternans_, a pestilent, a troublesome passion, that utterly undoeth men.\nUnhappy superstition, [6547]Pliny calls it, _morte non finitur_, death\ntakes away life, but not superstition. Impious and ignorant are far more\nhappy than they which are superstitious, no torture like to it, none so\ncontinuate, so general, so destructive, so violent.\n\nIn this superstitious row, Jews for antiquity may go next to Gentiles: what\nof old they have done, what idolatries they have committed in their groves\nand high places, what their Pharisees, Sadducees, Scribes, Essei, and such\nsectaries have maintained, I will not so much as mention: for the present,\nI presume no nation under heaven can be more sottish, ignorant, blind,\nsuperstitious, wilful, obstinate, and peevish, tiring themselves with vain\nceremonies to no purpose; he that shall but read their Rabbins' ridiculous\ncomments, their strange interpretation of scriptures, their absurd\nceremonies, fables, childish tales, which they steadfastly believe, will\nthink they be scarce rational creatures; their foolish [6548]customs, when\nthey rise in the morning, and how they prepare themselves to prayer, to\nmeat, with what superstitious washings, how to their Sabbath, to their\nother feasts, weddings, burials, &c. Last of all, the expectation of their\nMessiah, and those figments, miracles, vain pomp that shall attend him, as\nhow he shall terrify the Gentiles, and overcome them by new diseases; how\nMichael the archangel shall sound his trumpet, how he shall gather all the\nscattered Jews in the Holy Land, and there make them a great banquet,\n[6549] \"Wherein shall be all the birds, beasts, fishes, that ever God made,\na cup of wine that grew in Paradise, and that hath been kept in Adam's\ncellar ever since.\" At the first course shall be served in that great ox in\nJob iv. 10., \"that every day feeds on a thousand hills,\" Psal. 1. 10., that\ngreat Leviathan, and a great bird, that laid an egg so big, [6550]\"that by\nchance tumbling out of the nest, it knocked down three hundred tall cedars,\nand breaking as it fell, drowned one hundred and sixty villages:\" this bird\nstood up to the knees in the sea, and the sea was so deep, that a hatchet\nwould not fall to the bottom in seven years: of their Messiah's [6551]wives\nand children; Adam and Eve, &c., and that one stupend fiction amongst the\nrest: when a Roman prince asked of rabbi Jehosua ben Hanania, why the Jews'\nGod was compared to a lion; he made answer, he compared himself to no\nordinary lion, but to one in the wood Ela, which, when he desired to see,\nthe rabbin prayed to God he might, and forthwith the lion set forward.\n[6552] \"But when he was four hundred miles from Rome he so roared that all\nthe great-bellied women in Rome made abortions, the city walls fell down,\nand when he came a hundred miles nearer, and roared the second time, their\nteeth fell out of their heads, the emperor himself fell down dead, and so\nthe lion went back.\" With an infinite number of such lies and forgeries,\nwhich they verily believe, feed themselves with vain hope, and in the mean\ntime will by no persuasions be diverted, but still crucify their souls with\na company of idle ceremonies, live like slaves and vagabonds, will not be\nrelieved or reconciled.\n\nMahometans are a compound of Gentiles, Jews, and Christians, and so absurd\nin their ceremonies, as if they had taken that which is most sottish out of\nevery one of them, full of idle fables in their superstitious law, their\nAlcoran itself a gallimaufry of lies, tales, ceremonies, traditions,\nprecepts, stolen from other sects, and confusedly heaped up to delude a\ncompany of rude and barbarous clowns. As how birds, beasts, stones, saluted\nMahomet when he came from Mecca, the moon came down from heaven to visit\nhim, [6553]how God sent for him, spake to him, &c., with a company of\nstupend figments of the angels, sun, moon, and stars, &c. Of the day of\njudgment, and three sounds to prepare to it, which must last fifty thousand\nyears of Paradise, which wholly consists in _coeundi et comedendi\nvoluptate_, and _pecorinis hominibus scriptum, bestialis beatitudo_, is so\nridiculous, that Virgil, Dante, Lucian, nor any poet can be more fabulous.\nTheir rites and ceremonies are most vain and superstitious, wine and\nswine's flesh are utterly forbidden by their law, [6554]they must pray five\ntimes a day; and still towards the south, wash before and after all their\nbodies over, with many such. For fasting, vows, religious orders,\nperegrinations, they go far beyond any papists, [6555]they fast a month\ntogether many times, and must not eat a bit till sun be set. Their\nkalendars, dervises, and torlachers, &c. are more [6556]abstemious some of\nthem, than Carthusians, Franciscans, Anchorites, forsake all, live\nsolitary, fare hard, go naked, &c. [6557]Their pilgrimages are as far as to\nthe river [6558]Ganges (which the Gentiles of those tracts likewise do), to\nwash themselves, for that river as they hold hath a sovereign virtue to\npurge them of all sins, and no man can be saved that hath not been washed\nin it. For which reason they come far and near from the Indies; _Maximus\ngentium omnium confluxus est_; and infinite numbers yearly resort to it.\nOthers go as far as Mecca to Mahomet's tomb, which journey is both\nmiraculous and meritorious. The ceremonies of flinging stones to stone the\ndevil, of eating a camel at Cairo by the way; their fastings, their running\ntill they sweat, their long prayers, Mahomet's temple, tomb, and building\nof it, would ask a whole volume to dilate: and for their pains taken in\nthis holy pilgrimage, all their sins are forgiven, and they reputed for so\nmany saints. And diverse of them with hot bricks, when they return, will\nput out their eyes, [6559]\"that they never after see any profane thing,\nbite out their tongues,\" &c. They look for their prophet Mahomet as Jews do\nfor their Messiah. Read more of their customs, rites, ceremonies, in\nLonicerus _Turcic. hist. tom. 1._ from the tenth to the twenty-fourth\nchapter. Bredenbachius, _cap. 4, 5, 6._ Leo Afer, _lib. 1._ Busbequius\nSabellicus, Purchas, _lib. 3. cap. 3, et 4, 5._ Theodorus Bibliander, &c.\nMany foolish ceremonies you shall find in them; and which is most to be\nlamented, the people are generally so curious in observing of them, that if\nthe least circumstance be omitted, they think they shall be damned, 'tis an\nirremissible offence, and can hardly be forgiven. I kept in my house\namongst my followers (saith Busbequius, sometime the Turk's orator in\nConstantinople) a Turkey boy, that by chance did eat shellfish, a meat\nforbidden by their law, but the next day when he knew what he had done, he\nwas not only sick to cast and vomit, but very much troubled in mind, would\nweep and [6560]grieve many days after, torment himself for his foul\noffence. Another Turk being to drink a cup of wine in his cellar, first\nmade a huge noise and filthy faces, [6561]\"to warn his soul, as he said,\nthat it should not be guilty of that foul fact which he was to commit.\"\nWith such toys as these are men kept in awe, and so cowed, that they dare\nnot resist, or offend the least circumstance of their law, for conscience'\nsake misled by superstition, which no human edict otherwise, no force of\narms, could have enforced.\n\nIn the last place are pseudo-Christians, in describing of whose\nsuperstitious symptoms, as a mixture of the rest, I may say that which St.\nBenedict once saw in a vision, one devil in the marketplace, but ten in a\nmonastery, because there was more work; in populous cities they would swear\nand forswear, lie, falsify, deceive fast enough of themselves, one devil\ncould circumvent a thousand; but in their religious houses a thousand\ndevils could scarce tempt one silly monk. All the principal devils, I\nthink, busy themselves in subverting Christians; Jews, Gentiles, and\nMahometans, are _extra caulem_, out of the fold, and need no such\nattendance, they make no resistance, [6562]_eos enim pulsare negligit, quos\nquieto jure possidere se sentit_, they are his own already: but Christians\nhave that shield of faith, sword of the Spirit to resist, and must have a\ngreat deal of battery before they can be overcome. That the devil is most\nbusy amongst us that are of the true church, appears by those several\noppositions, heresies, schisms, which in all ages he hath raised to subvert\nit, and in that of Rome especially, wherein Antichrist himself now sits and\nplays his prize. This mystery of iniquity began to work even in the\nApostles' time, many Antichrists and heretics' were abroad, many sprung up\nsince, many now present, and will be to the world's end, to dementate men's\nminds, to seduce and captivate their souls. Their symptoms I know not how\nbetter to express, than in that twofold division, of such as lead, and are\nled. Such as lead are heretics, schismatics, false prophets, impostors, and\ntheir ministers: they have some common symptoms, some peculiar. Common, as\nmadness, folly, pride, insolency, arrogancy, singularity, peevishness,\nobstinacy, impudence, scorn and contempt of all other sects: _Nullius\naddicti jurare in verba magistri_; [6563]they will approve of nought but\nwhat they first invent themselves, no interpretation good but what their\ninfallible spirit dictates: none shall be _in secundis_, no not _in\ntertiis_, they are only wise, only learned in the truth, all damned but\nthey and their followers, _caedem scripturarum faciunt ad materiam suam_,\nsaith Tertullian, they make a slaughter of Scriptures, and turn it as a\nnose of wax to their own ends. So irrefragable, in the mean time, that what\nthey have once said, they must and will maintain, in whole tomes,\nduplications, triplications, never yield to death, so self-conceited, say\nwhat you can. As [6564]Bernard (erroneously some say) speaks of P.\nAliardus, _omnes patres sic, atque ego sic._ Though all the Fathers,\nCouncils, the whole world contradict it, they care not, they are all one:\nand as [6565] Gregory well notes \"of such as are vertiginous, they think\nall turns round and moves, all err: when as the error is wholly in their\nown brains.\" Magallianus, the Jesuit, in his Comment on 1 Tim. xvi. 20, and\nAlphonsus _de castro lib. 1. adversus haereses_, gives two more eminent\nnotes or probable conjectures to know such men by, (they might have taken\nthemselves by the noses when they said it) [6566]\"First they affect\nnovelties and toys, and prefer falsehood before truth; [6567]secondly, they\ncare not what they say, that which rashness and folly hath brought out,\npride afterward, peevishness and contumacy shall maintain to the last\ngasp.\" Peculiar symptoms are prodigious paradoxes, new doctrines, vain\nphantasms, which are many and diverse as they themselves. [6568]Nicholaites\nof old, would have wives in common: Montanists will not marry at all, nor\nTatians, forbidding all flesh, Severians wine; Adamians go naked,\n[6569]because Adam did so in Paradise; and some [6570]barefoot all their\nlives, because God, Exod. iii. and Joshua v. bid Moses so to do; and Isaiah\nxx. was bid put off his shoes; Manichees hold that Pythagorean\ntransmigration of souls from men to beasts; [6571]\"the Circumcellions in\nAfrica, with a mad cruelty made away themselves, some by fire, water,\nbreaking their necks, and seduced others to do the like, threatening some\nif they did not,\" with a thousand such; as you may read in [6572]Austin\n(for there were fourscore and eleven heresies in his times, besides schisms\nand smaller factions) Epiphanius, Alphonsus _de Castro, Danaeus, Gab,\nPrateolus_, &c. Of prophets, enthusiasts and impostors, our Ecclesiastical\nstories afford many examples; of Elias and Christs, as our [6573]Eudo _de\nstellis_, a Briton in King Stephen's time, that went invisible, translated\nhimself from one to another in a moment, fed thousands with good cheer in\nthe wilderness, and many such; nothing so common as miracles, visions,\nrevelations, prophecies. Now what these brain-sick heretics once broach,\nand impostors set on foot, be it never so absurd, false, and prodigious,\nthe common people will follow and believe. It will run along like murrain\nin cattle, scab in sheep. _Nulla scabies_, as [6574]he said, _superstitione\nscabiosior_; as he that is bitten with a mad dog bites others, and all in\nthe end become mad; either out of affection of novelty, simplicity, blind\nzeal, hope and fear, the giddy-headed multitude will embrace it, and\nwithout further examination approve it.\n\n_Sed vetera querimur_, these are old, _haec prius fuere._ In our days we\nhave a new scene of superstitious impostors and heretics. A new company of\nactors, of Antichrists, that great Antichrist himself: a rope of hopes,\nthat by their greatness and authority bear down all before them: who from\nthat time they proclaimed themselves universal bishops, to establish their\nown kingdom, sovereignty, greatness, and to enrich themselves, brought in\nsuch a company of human traditions, purgatory, _Limbus Patrum, Infantum_,\nand all that subterranean geography, mass, adoration of saints, alms,\nfastings, bulls, indulgences, orders, friars, images, shrines, musty\nrelics, excommunications, confessions, satisfactions, blind obediences,\nvows, pilgrimages, peregrinations, with many such curious toys, intricate\nsubtleties, gross errors, obscure questions, to vindicate the better and\nset a gloss upon them, that the light of the Gospel was quite eclipsed,\ndarkness over all, the Scriptures concealed, legends brought in, religion\nbanished, hypocritical superstition exalted, and the Church itself [6575]\nobscured and persecuted: Christ and his members crucified more, saith\nBenzo, by a few necromantical, atheistical popes, than ever it was by\n[6576] Julian the Apostate, Porphyrius the Platonist, Celsus the physician,\nLibanius the Sophister; by those heathen emperors, Huns, Goths, and\nVandals. What each of them did, by what means, at what times, _quibus\nauxiliis_, superstition climbed to this height, tradition increased, and\nAntichrist himself came to his estate, let Magdeburgenses, Kemnisius,\nOsiander, Bale, Mornay, Fox, Usher, and many others relate. In the mean\ntime, he that shall but see their profane rites and foolish customs, how\nsuperstitiously kept, how strictly observed, their multitude of saints,\nimages, that rabble of Romish deities, for trades, professions, diseases,\npersons, offices, countries, places; St. George for England; St. Denis for\nFrance, Patrick, Ireland; Andrew, Scotland; Jago, Spain; &c. Gregory for\nstudents; Luke for painters; Cosmus and Damian for philosophers; Crispin,\nshoemakers; Katherine, spinners; &c. Anthony for pigs; Gallus, geese;\nWenceslaus, sheep; Pelagius, oxen; Sebastian, the plague; Valentine,\nfalling sickness; Apollonia, toothache; Petronella for agues; and the\nVirgin Mary for sea and land, for all parties, offices: he that shall\nobserve these things, their shrines, images, oblations, pendants,\nadorations, pilgrimages they make to them, what creeping to crosses, our\nLady of Loretto's rich [6577]gowns, her donaries, the cost bestowed on\nimages, and number of suitors; St. Nicholas Burge in France; our St.\nThomas's shrine of old at Canterbury; those relics at Rome, Jerusalem,\nGenoa, Lyons, Pratum, St. Denis; and how many thousands come yearly to\noffer to them, with what cost, trouble, anxiety, superstition (for forty\nseveral masses are daily said in some of their [6578]churches, and they\nrise at all hours of the night to mass, come barefoot, &c.), how they spend\nthemselves, times, goods, lives, fortunes, in such ridiculous observations;\ntheir tales and figments, false miracles, buying and selling of pardons,\nindulgences for 40,000 years to come, their processions on set days, their\nstrict fastings, monks, anchorites, friar mendicants, Franciscans,\nCarthusians, &c. Their vigils and fasts, their ceremonies at Christmas,\nShrovetide, Candlemas, Palm Sunday, Blaise, St. Martin, St. Nicholas' day;\ntheir adorations, exorcisms, &c., will think all those Grecian, Pagan,\nMahometan superstitions, gods, idols, and ceremonies, the name, time and\nplace, habit only altered, to have degenerated into Christians. Whilst they\nprefer traditions before Scriptures; those Evangelical Councils, poverty,\nobedience, vows, alms, fasting, supererogations, before God's Commandments;\ntheir own ordinances instead of his precepts, and keep them in ignorance,\nblindness, they have brought the common people into such a case by their\ncunning conveyances, strict discipline, and servile education, that upon\npain of damnation they dare not break the least ceremony, tradition, edict;\nhold it a greater sin to eat a bit of meat in Lent, than kill a man: their\nconsciences are so terrified, that they are ready to despair if a small\nceremony be omitted; and will accuse their own father, mother, brother,\nsister, nearest and dearest friends of heresy, if they do not as they do,\nwill be their chief executioners, and help first to bring a faggot to burn\nthem. What mulct, what penance soever is enjoined, they dare not but do it,\ntumble with St. Francis in the mire amongst hogs, if they be appointed, go\nwoolward, whip themselves, build hospitals, abbeys, &c., go to the East or\nWest Indies, kill a king, or run upon a sword point: they perform all,\nwithout any muttering or hesitation, believe all.\n\n[6579] \"Ut pueri infantes credunt signa omnia ahena\n        Vivere, et esse homines, et sic isti omnia ficta\n        Vera putant, credunt signis cor inesse ahenis.\"\n\n       \"As children think their babies live to be,\n        Do they these brazen images they see.\"\n\nAnd whilst the ruder sort are so carried headlong with blind zeal, are so\ngulled and tortured by their superstitions, their own too credulous\nsimplicity and ignorance, their epicurean popes and hypocritical cardinals\nlaugh in their sleeves, and are merry in their chambers with their punks,\nthey do _indulgere genio_, and make much of themselves. The middle sort,\nsome for private gain, hope of ecclesiastical preferment, (_quis expedivit\npsittaco suum [Greek: chaire]_) popularity, base flattery, must and will\nbelieve all their paradoxes and absurd tenets, without exception, and as\nobstinately maintain and put in practice all their traditions and\nidolatrous ceremonies (for their religion is half a trade) to the death;\nthey will defend all, the golden legend itself, with all the lies and tales\nin it: as that of St. George, St. Christopher, St. Winifred, St. Denis, &c.\nIt is a wonder to see how Nic. Harpsfield, that Pharisaical impostor,\namongst the rest, Ecclesiast. Hist. _cap. 22. saec prim, sex._, puzzles\nhimself to vindicate that ridiculous fable of St. Ursula and the eleven\nthousand virgins, as when they live, [6580]how they came to Cologne, by\nwhom martyred, &c., though he can say nothing for it, yet he must and will\napprove it: _nobilitavit (inquit) hoc saeculum Ursula cum comitibus, cujus\nhistoria utinam tam mihi esset expedita et certa, quam in animo meo certum\nac expeditum est, eam esse cum sodalibus beatam in coelis virginem._ They\nmust and will (I say) either out of blind zeal believe, vary their compass\nwith the rest, as the latitude of religion varies, apply themselves to the\ntimes, and seasons, and for fear and flattery are content to subscribe and\nto do all that in them lies to maintain and defend their present government\nand slavish religious schoolmen, canonists, Jesuits, friars, priests,\norators, sophisters, who either for that they had nothing else to do,\nluxuriant wits knew not otherwise how to busy themselves in those idle\ntimes, for the Church then had few or no open adversaries, or better to\ndefend their lies, fictions, miracles, transubstantiations, traditions,\npope's pardons, purgatories, masses, impossibilities, &c. with glorious\nshows, fair pretences, big words, and plausible wits, have coined a\nthousand idle questions, nice distinctions, subtleties, Obs and Sols, such\ntropological, allegorical expositions, to salve all appearances,\nobjections, such quirks and quiddities, _quodlibetaries_, as Bale saith of\nFerribrigge and Strode, instances, ampliations, decrees, glosses, canons,\nthat instead of sound commentaries, good preachers, are come in a company\nof mad sophisters, _primo secundo secundarii_, sectaries, Canonists,\nSorbonists, Minorites, with a rabble of idle controversies and questions,\n[6581]_an Papa sit Deus, an quasi Deus? An participet utramque Christi\nnaturam_? Whether it be as possible for God to be a humble bee or a gourd,\nas a man? Whether he can produce respect without a foundation or term, make\na whore a virgin? fetch Trajan's soul from hell, and how? with a rabble of\nquestions about hell-fire: whether it be a greater sin to kill a man, or to\nclout shoes upon a Sunday? whether God can make another God like unto\nhimself? Such, saith Kemnisius, are most of your schoolmen, (mere\nalchemists) 200 commentators on Peter Lambard; (_Pitsius catal. scriptorum\nAnglic._ reckons up 180 English commentators alone, on the matter of the\nsentences), Scotists, Thomists, Reals, Nominals, &c., and so perhaps that\nof St. [6582]Austin may be verified. _Indocti rapiunt coelum, docti interim\ndescendunt ad infernum._ Thus they continued in such error, blindness,\ndecrees, sophisms, superstitions; idle ceremonies and traditions were the\nsum of their new-coined holiness and religion, and by these knaveries and\nstratagems they were able to involve multitudes, to deceive the most\nsanctified souls, and, if it were possible, the very elect. In the mean\ntime the true Church, as wine and water mixed, lay hid and obscure to speak\nof, till Luther's time, who began upon a sudden to defecate, and as another\nsun to drive away those foggy mists of superstition, to restore it to that\npurity of the primitive Church. And after him many good and godly men,\ndivine spirits, have done their endeavours, and still do.\n\n[6583] \"And what their ignorance esteem'd so holy,\n        Our wiser ages do account as folly.\"\n\nBut see the devil, that will never suffer the Church to be quiet or at\nrest: no garden so well tilled but some noxious weeds grow up in it, no\nwheat but it hath some tares: we have a mad giddy company of precisians,\nschismatics, and some heretics, even, in our own bosoms in another extreme.\n[6584]_Dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt_; that out of too much\nzeal in opposition to Antichrist, human traditions, those Romish rites and\nsuperstitions, will quite demolish all, they will admit of no ceremonies at\nall, no fasting days, no cross in baptism, kneeling at communion, no church\nmusic, &c., no bishops' courts, no church government, rail at all our\nchurch discipline, will not hold their tongues, and all for the peace of\nthee, O Sion! No, not so much as degrees some of them will tolerate, or\nuniversities, all human learning, ('tis _cloaca diaboli_) hoods, habits,\ncap and surplice, such as are things indifferent in themselves, and wholly\nfor ornament, decency, or distinction's sake, they abhor, hate, and snuff\nat, as a stone-horse when he meets a bear: they make matters of conscience\nof them, and will rather forsake their livings than subscribe to them. They\nwill admit of no holidays, or honest recreations, as of hawking, hunting,\n&c., no churches, no bells some of them, because papists use them; no\ndiscipline, no ceremonies but what they invent themselves; no\ninterpretations of 'scriptures, no comments of fathers, no councils, but\nsuch as their own fantastical spirits dictate, or _recta ratio_, as\nSocinians, by which spirit misled, many times they broach as prodigious\nparadoxes as papists themselves. Some of them turn prophets, have secret\nrevelations, will be of privy council with God himself, and know all his\nsecrets, [6585]_ Per capillos spiritum sanctum tenent, et omnia sciunt cum\nsint asini omnium obstinatissimi_, a company of giddy heads will take upon\nthem to define how many shall be saved and who damned in a parish, where\nthey shall sit in heaven, interpret Apocalypses, (_Commentatores\npraecipites et vertiginosos_, one calls them, as well he might) and those\nhidden mysteries to private persons, times, places, as their own spirit\ninforms them, private revelations shall suggest, and precisely set down\nwhen the world shall come to an end, what year, what month, what day. Some\nof them again have such strong faith, so presumptuous, they will go into\ninfected houses, expel devils, and fast forty days, as Christ himself did;\nsome call God and his attributes into question, as Vorstius and Socinus;\nsome princes, civil magistrates, and their authorities, as Anabaptists,\nwill do all their own private spirit dictates, and nothing else. Brownists,\nBarrowists, Familists, and those Amsterdamian sects and sectaries, are led\nall by so many private spirits. It is a wonder to reveal what passages\nSleidan relates in his Commentaries, of Cretinck, Knipperdoling, and their\nassociates, those madmen of Munster in Germany; what strange enthusiasms,\nsottish revelations they had, how absurdly they carried themselves, deluded\nothers; and as profane Machiavel in his political disputations holds of\nChristian religion, in general it doth enervate, debilitate, take away\nmen's spirits and courage from them, _simpliciores reddit homines_, breeds\nnothing so courageous soldiers as that Roman: we may say of these peculiar\nsects, their religion takes away not spirits only, but wit and judgment,\nand deprives them of their understanding; for some of them are so far gone\nwith their private enthusiasms and revelations, that they are quite mad,\nout of their wits. What greater madness can there be, than for a man to\ntake upon him to be a God, as some do? to be the Holy Ghost, Elias, and\nwhat not? In [6586]Poland, 1518, in the reign of King Sigismund, one said\nhe was Christ, and got him twelve apostles, came to judge the world, and\nstrangely deluded the commons. [6587]One David George, an illiterate\npainter, not many years since, did as much in Holland, took upon him to be\nthe Messiah, and had many followers. Benedictus Victorinus Faventinus,\n_consil. 15_, writes as much of one Honorius, that thought he was not only\ninspired as a prophet, but that he was a God himself, and had\n[6588]familiar conference with God and his angels. Lavat. _de spect. c. 2.\npart. 8._ hath a story of one John Sartorious, that thought he was the\nprophet Elias, and _cap. 7._ of diverse others that had conference with\nangels, were saints, prophets. Wierus, _lib. 3. de Lamiis c. 7._ makes\nmention of a prophet of Groning that said he was God the Father; of an\nItalian and Spanish prophet that held as much. We need not rove so far\nabroad, we have familiar examples at home: Hackett that said he was Christ;\nCoppinger and Arthington his disciples; [6589]Burchet and Hovatus, burned\nat Norwich. We are never likely seven years together without some such new\nprophets that have several inspirations, some to convert the Jews, some\nfast forty days, go with Daniel to the lion's den; some foretell strange\nthings, some for one thing, some for another. Great precisians of mean\nconditions and very illiterate, most part by a preposterous zeal, fasting,\nmeditation, melancholy, are brought into those gross errors and\ninconveniences. Of those men I may conclude generally, that howsoever they\nmay seem to be discreet, and men of understanding in other matters,\ndiscourse well, _laesam habent imaginationem_, they are like comets, round\nin all places but where they blaze, _caetera sani_, they have impregnable\nwits many of them, and discreet otherwise, but in this their madness and\nfolly breaks out beyond measure, _in infinitum erumpit stultitia._ They are\ncertainly far gone with melancholy, if not quite mad, and have more need of\nphysic than many a man that keeps his bed, more need of hellebore than\nthose that are in Bedlam.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Prognostics of Religious Melancholy_.\n\nYou may guess at the prognostics by the symptoms. What can these signs fore\ntell otherwise than folly, dotage, madness, gross ignorance, despair,\nobstinacy, a reprobate sense, [6590]a bad end? What else can superstition,\nheresy produce, but wars, tumults, uproars, torture of souls, and despair,\na desolate land, as Jeremy teacheth, cap. vii. 34. when they commit\nidolatry, and walk after their own ways? how should it be otherwise with\nthem? what can they expect but \"blasting, famine, dearth,\" and all the\nplagues of Egypt, as Amos denounceth, cap. iv. vers. 9. 10. to be led into\ncaptivity? If our hopes be frustrate, \"we sow much and bring in little, eat\nand have not enough, drink and are not filled, clothe and be not warm,\" &c.\nHaggai i. 6. \"we look for much and it comes to little, whence is it? His\nhouse was waste, they came to their own houses,\" vers. 9. \"therefore the\nheaven stayed his dew, the earth his fruit.\" Because we are superstitious,\nirreligious, we do not serve God as we ought, all these plagues and\nmiseries come upon us; what can we look for else but mutual wars,\nslaughters, fearful ends in this life, and in the life to come eternal\ndamnation? What is it that hath caused so many feral battles to be fought,\nso much Christian blood shed, but superstition! That Spanish inquisition,\nracks, wheels, tortures, torments, whence do they proceed? from\nsuperstition. Bodine the Frenchman, in his [6591]_method. hist._ accounts\nEnglishmen barbarians, for their civil wars: but let him read those\nPharsalian fields [6592]fought of late in France for their religion, their\nmassacres, wherein by their own relations in twenty-four years, I know not\nhow many millions have been consumed, whole families and cities, and he\nshall find ours to be but velitations to theirs. But it hath ever been the\ncustom of heretics and idolaters, when they are plagued for their sins, and\nGod's just judgments come upon them, not to acknowledge any fault in\nthemselves, but still impute it unto others. In Cyprian's time it was much\ncontroverted between him and Demetrius an idolater, who should be the cause\nof those present calamities. Demetrius laid all the fault on Christians,\n(and so they did ever in the primitive church, as appears by the first book\nof [6593]Arnobius), [6594]\"that there were not such ordinary showers in\nwinter, the ripening heat in summer, so seasonable springs, fruitful\nautumns, no marble mines in the mountains, less gold and silver than of\nold; that husbandmen, seamen, soldiers, all were scanted, justice,\nfriendship, skill in arts, all was decayed,\" and that through Christians'\ndefault, and all their other miseries from them, _quod dii nostri a vobis\nnon colantur_, because they did not worship their gods. But Cyprian retorts\nall upon him again, as appears by his tract against him. 'Tis true the\nworld is miserably tormented and shaken with wars, dearth, famine, fire,\ninundations, plagues, and many feral diseases rage amongst us, _sed non ut\ntu quereris ista accidunt quod dii vestri a nobis non colantur, sed quod a\nvobis non colatur Deus, a quibus nec quaeritur, nec timetur_, not as thou\ncomplainest, that we do not worship your Gods, but because you are\nidolaters, and do not serve the true God, neither seek him, nor fear him as\nyou ought. Our papists object as much to us, and account us heretics, we\nthem; the Turks esteem of both as infidels, and we them as a company of\npagans, Jews against all; when indeed there is a general fault in us all,\nand something in the very best, which may justly deserve God's wrath, and\npull these miseries upon our heads. I will say nothing here of those vain\ncares, torments, needless works, penance, pilgrimages, pseudomartyrdom, &c.\nWe heap upon ourselves unnecessary troubles, observations; we punish our\nbodies, as in Turkey (saith [6595]Busbequius _leg. Turcic. ep. 3._) \"one\ndid, that was much affected with music, and to hear boys sing, but very\nsuperstitious; an old sibyl coming to his house, or a holy woman,\" (as that\nplace yields many) \"took him down for it, and told him, that in that other\nworld he should suffer for it; thereupon he flung his rich and costly\ninstruments which he had bedecked with jewels, all at once into the fire.\nHe was served in silver plate, and had goodly household stuff: a little\nafter, another religious man reprehended him in like sort, and from\nthenceforth he was served in earthen vessels, last of all a decree came\nforth, because Turks might not drink wine themselves, that neither Jew nor\nChristian then living in Constantinople, might drink any wine at all.\" In\nlike sort amongst papists, fasting at first was generally proposed as a\ngood thing; after, from such meats at set times, and then last of all so\nrigorously proposed, to bind the consciences upon pain of damnation. \"First\nFriday,\" saith Erasmus, \"then Saturday,\" _et nunc periclitatur dies\nMercurii_) and Wednesday now is in danger of a fast. [6596]\"And for such\nlike toys, some so miserably afflict themselves, to despair, and death\nitself, rather than offend, and think themselves good Christians in it,\nwhen as indeed they are superstitious Jews.\" So saith Leonardus Fuchsius, a\ngreat physician in his time. [6597]\"We are tortured in Germany with these\npopish edicts, our bodies so taken down, our goods so diminished, that if\nGod had not sent Luther, a worthy man, in time, to redress these mischiefs,\nwe should have eaten hay with our horses before this.\" [6598]As in fasting,\nso in all other superstitious edicts, we crucify one another without a\ncause, barring ourselves of many good and lawful things, honest disports,\npleasures and recreations; for wherefore did God create them but for our\nuse? Feasts, mirth, music, hawking, hunting, singing, dancing, &c. _non tam\nnecessitatibus nostris Deus inservit, sed in delicias amamur_, as Seneca\nnotes, God would have it so. And as Plato _2. de legibus_ gives out, _Deos\nlaboriosam hominum vitam miseratos_, the gods in commiseration of human\nestate sent Apollo, Bacchus, and the Muses, _qui cum voluptate tripudia et\nsoltationes nobis ducant_, to be merry with mortals, to sing and dance with\nus. So that he that will not rejoice and enjoy himself, making good use of\nsuch things as are lawfully permitted, _non est temperatus_, as he will,\n_sed superstitiosus._ \"There is nothing better for a man, than that he\nshould eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his\nlabour,\" Eccles. ii. 24. And as [6599]one said of hawking and hunting, _tot\nsolatia in hac aegri orbis calamitate, mortalibus taediis deus objecit_, I\nsay of all honest recreations, God hath therefore indulged them to refresh,\nease, solace and comfort us. But we are some of us too stern, too rigid,\ntoo precise, too grossly superstitious, and whilst we make a conscience of\nevery toy, with touch not, taste not, &c., as those Pythagoreans of old,\nand some Indians now, that will eat no flesh, or suffer any living creature\nto be killed, the Bannians about Guzzerat; we tyrannise over our brother's\nsoul, lose the right use of many good gifts; honest [6600]sports, games and\npleasant recreations, [6601]punish ourselves without a cause, lose our\nliberties, and sometimes our lives. Anno 1270, at [6602]Magdeburg in\nGermany, a Jew fell into a privy upon a Saturday, and without help could\nnot possibly get out; he called to his fellows for succour, but they denied\nit, because it was their Sabbath, _non licebat opus manuum exercere_; the\nbishop hearing of it, the next day forbade him to be pulled out, because it\nwas our Sunday. In the mean time the wretch died before Monday. We have\nmyriads of examples in this kind amongst those rigid Sabbatarians, and\ntherefore not without good cause, [6603]_Intolerabilem pertubationem_\nSeneca calls it, as well he might, an intolerable perturbation, that\ncauseth such dire events, folly, madness, sickness, despair, death of body\nand soul, and hell itself.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Cure of Religious Melancholy_.\n\nTo purge the world of idolatry and superstition, will require some\nmonster-taming Hercules, a divine Aesculapius, or Christ himself to come in\nhis own person, to reign a thousand years on earth before the end, as the\nMillenaries will have him. They are generally so refractory,\nself-conceited, obstinate, so firmly addicted to that religion in which\nthey have been bred and brought up, that no persuasion, no terror, no\npersecution, can divert them. The consideration of which, hath induced many\ncommonwealths to suffer them to enjoy their consciences as they will\nthemselves: a toleration of Jews is in most provinces of Europe. In Asia\nthey have their synagogues: Spaniards permit Moors to live amongst them:\nthe Mogullians, Gentiles: the Turks all religions. In Europe, Poland and\nAmsterdam are the common sanctuaries. Some are of opinion, that no man\nought to be compelled for conscience' sake, but let him be of what religion\nhe will, he may be saved, as Cornelius was formerly accepted, Jew, Turks,\nAnabaptists, &c. If he be an honest man, live soberly, and civilly in his\nprofession, (Volkelius, Crellius, and the rest of the Socinians, that now\nnestle themselves about Krakow and Rakow in Poland, have renewed this\nopinion) serve his own God, with that fear and reverence as he ought. _Sua\ncuique civitati_ (Laeli) _religio sit, nostra nobis_, Tully thought fit\nevery city should be free in this behalf, adore their own _Custodes et\nTopicos Deos_, tutelar and local gods, as Symmachus calls them. Isocrates\nadviseth Demonicus, \"when he came to a strange city, to [6604]worship by\nall means the gods of the place,\" _et unumquemque, Topicum deum sic coli\noportere, quomodo ipse praeceperit_: which Cecilius in [6605]Minutius\nlabours, and would have every nation _sacrorum ritus gentiles habere et\ndeos colere municipes_, keep their own ceremonies, worship their peculiar\ngods, which Pomponius Mela reports of the Africans, _Deos suos patrio more\nvenerantur_, they worship their own gods according to their own ordination.\nFor why should any one nation, as he there pleads, challenge that\nuniversality of God, _Deum suum quem nec ostendunt, nec vident,\ndiscurrantem silicet et ubique praesentem, in omnium mores, actus, et\noccultas, cogitationes inquirentem_, &c., as Christians do: let every\nprovince enjoy their liberty in this behalf, worship one God, or all as\nthey will, and are informed. The Romans built altars Diis Asiae, Europae,\nLybiae, _diis ignotis et peregrinis_: others otherwise, &c. Plinius\nSecundus, as appears by his Epistle to Trajan, would not have the\nChristians so persecuted, and in some time of the reign of Maximinus, as we\nfind it registered in Eusebius _lib. 9. cap. 9._ there was a decree made to\nthis purpose, _Nullus cogatur invitus ad hunc vel illum deorum cultum_,\n\"let no one be compelled against his will to worship any particular deity,\"\nand by Constantine in the 19th year of his reign as [6606]Baronius\ninformeth us, _Nemo alteri exhibeat molestiam, quod cujusque animus vult,\nhoc quisque transigat_, new gods, new lawgivers, new priests, will have new\nceremonies, customs and religions, to which every wise man as a good\nformalist should accommodate himself.\n\n[6607] \"Saturnus periit, perierunt et sua jura,\n        Sub Jove nunc mundus, jussa sequare Jovis.\"\n\nThe said Constantine the emperor, as Eusebius writes, flung down and\ndemolished all the heathen gods, silver, gold statues, altars, images and\ntemples, and turned them all to Christian churches, _infestus gentilium\nmonumentis ludibrio exposuit_; the Turk now converts them again to\nMahometan mosques. The like edict came forth in the reign of Arcadius and\nHonorius. [6608]Symmachus the orator in his days, to procure a general\ntoleration, used this argument, [6609]\"Because God is immense and infinite,\nand his nature cannot perfectly be known, it is convenient he should be as\ndiversely worshipped, as every man shall perceive or understand.\" It was\nimpossible, he thought, for one religion to be universal: you see that one\nsmall province can hardly be ruled by one law, civil or spiritual; and \"how\nshall so many distinct and vast empires of the world be united into one? It\nnever was, never will be\" Besides, if there be infinite planetary and\nfirmamental worlds, as [6610]some will, there be infinite genii or\ncommanding spirits belonging to each of them; and so, _per consequens_ (for\nthey will be all adored), infinite religions. And therefore let every\nterritory keep their proper rites and ceremonies, as their _dii tutelares_\nwill, so Tyrius calls them, \"and according to the quarter they hold,\" their\nown institutions, revelations, orders, oracles, which they dictate from\ntime to time, or teach their own priests or ministers. This tenet was\nstiffly maintained in Turkey not long since, as you may read in the third\nepistle of Busbequius, [6611]\"that all those should participate of eternal\nhappiness, that lived a holy and innocent life, what religion soever they\nprofessed.\" Rustan Bassa was a great patron of it; though Mahomet himself\nwas sent _virtute gladdi_, to enforce all, as he writes in his Alcoran, to\nfollow him. Some again will approve of this for Jews, Gentiles, infidels,\nthat are out of the fold, they can be content to give them all respect and\nfavour, but by no means to such as are within the precincts of our own\nchurch, and called Christians, to no heretics, schismatics, or the like;\nlet the Spanish inquisition, that fourth fury, speak of some of them, the\ncivil wars and massacres in France, our Marian times. [6612]Magillianus the\nJesuit will not admit of conference with a heretic, but severity and rigour\nto be used, _non illis verba reddere, sed furcas, figere oportet_; and\nTheodosius is commended in Nicephorus, _lib. 12. cap. 15._ [6613]\"That he\nput all heretics to silence.\" Bernard. _Epist. 180_, will have club law,\nfire and sword for heretics, [6614]\"compel them, stop their mouths not with\ndisputations, or refute them with reasons, but with fists;\" and this is\ntheir ordinary practice. Another company are as mild on the other side; to\navoid all heart-burning, and contentious wars and uproars, they would have\na general toleration in every kingdom, no mulct at all, no man for religion\nor conscience be put to death, which [6615]Thuanus the French historian\nmuch favours; our late Socinians defend; Vaticanus against Calvin in a\nlarge Treatise in behalf of Servetus, vindicates; Castilio, &c., Martin\nBallius and his companions, maintained this opinion not long since in\nFrance, whose error is confuted by Beza in a just volume. The medium is\nbest, and that which Paul prescribes, Gal. i. \"If any man shall fall by\noccasion, to restore such a one with the spirit of meekness, by all fair\nmeans, gentle admonitions;\" but if that will not take place, _Post unam et\nalteram admonitionem haereticum devita_, he must be excommunicate, as Paul\ndid by Hymenaeus, delivered over to Satan. _Immedicabile vulnus ense\nrecidendum est._ As Hippocrates said in physic, I may well say in divinity,\n_Quae ferro non curantur, ignis curat._ For the vulgar, restrain them by\nlaws, mulcts, burn their books, forbid their conventicles; for when the\ncause is taken away, the effect will soon cease. Now for prophets,\ndreamers, and such rude silly fellows, that through fasting, too much\nmeditation, preciseness, or by melancholy, are distempered: the best means\nto reduce them _ad sanam mentem_, is to alter their course of life, and\nwith conference, threats, promises, persuasions, to intermix physic.\nHercules de Saxonia, had such a prophet committed to his charge in Venice,\nthat thought he was Elias, and would fast as he did; he dressed a fellow in\nangel's attire, that said he came from heaven to bring him divine food, and\nby that means stayed his fast, administered his physic; so by the\nmeditation of this forged angel he was cured. [6616]Rhasis an Arabian,\n_cont. lib. 1. cap. 9_, speaks of a fellow that in like case complained to\nhim, and desired his help: \"I asked him\" (saith he) \"what the matter was;\nhe replied, I am continually meditating of heaven and hell, and methinks I\nsee and talk with fiery spirits, and smell brimstone, &c., and am so\ncarried away with these conceits, that I can neither eat, nor sleep, nor go\nabout my business: I cured him\" (saith Rhasis) \"partly by persuasion,\npartly by physic, and so have I done by many others.\" We have frequently\nsuch prophets and dreamers amongst us, whom we persecute with fire and\nfaggot: I think the most compendious cure, for some of them at least, had\nbeen in Bedlam. _Sed de his satis._\n\n\nMEMB. II.\n\nSUBSECT. I.--_Religious Melancholy in defect; parties affected, Epicures,\nAtheists, Hypocrites, worldly secure, Carnalists; all impious persons,\nimpenitent sinners, &c._\n\nIn that other extreme or defect of this love of God, knowledge, faith,\nfear, hope, &c. are such as err both in doctrine and manners, Sadducees,\nHerodians, libertines, politicians: all manner of atheists, epicures,\ninfidels, that are secure, in a reprobate sense, fear not God at all, and\nsuch are too distrustful and timorous, as desperate persons be. That grand\nsin of atheism or impiety, [6617]Melancthon calls it _monstrosam\nmelancholiam_, monstrous melancholy; or _venenatam melancholiam_, poisoned\nmelancholy. A company of Cyclops or giants, that war with the gods, as the\npoets feigned, antipodes to Christians, that scoff at all religion, at God\nhimself, deny him and all his attributes, his wisdom, power, providence,\nhis mercy and judgment.\n\n[6618] \"Esse aliquos manes, et subterranea regna,\n        Et contum, et Stygio ranas in gurgite nigras,\n        Atque una transire vadum tot millia cymba,\n        Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum aere lavantur.\"\n\nThat there is either heaven or hell, resurrection of the dead, pain,\nhappiness, or world to come, _credat Judaeus Apella_; for their parts they\nesteem them as so many poet's tales, bugbears, Lucian's Alexander; Moses,\nMahomet, and Christ are all as one in their creed. When those bloody wars\nin France for matters of religion (saith [6619]Richard Dinoth) were so\nviolently pursued between Huguenots and Papists, there was a company of\ngood fellows laughed them all to scorn, for being such superstitious fools,\nto lose their wives and fortunes, accounting faith, religion, immortality\nof the soul, mere fopperies and illusions. Such loose [6620]atheistical\nspirits are too predominant in all kingdoms. Let them contend, pray,\ntremble, trouble themselves that will, for their parts, they fear neither\nGod nor devil; but with that Cyclops in Euripides,\n\n       \"Haud ulla numina expavescunt caelitum,\n        Sed victimas uni deorum maximo,\n        Ventri offerunt, deos ignorant caeteros.\"\n\n       \"They fear no God but one,\n        They sacrifice to none.\n        But belly, and him adore,\n        For gods they know no more.\"\n\n\"Their God is their belly,\" as Paul saith, _Sancta mater saturitas;--quibus\nin solo vivendi causa palato est._ The idol, which they worship and adore,\nis their mistress; with him in Plautus, _mallem haec mulier me amet quam\ndii_, they had rather have her favour than the gods'. Satan is their guide,\nthe flesh is their instructor, hypocrisy their counsellor, vanity their\nfellow-soldier, their will their law, ambition their captain, custom their\nrule; temerity, boldness, impudence their art, toys their trading,\ndamnation their end. All their endeavours are to satisfy their lust and\nappetite, how to please their genius, and to be merry for the present,\n_Ede, lude, bibe, post mortem nulla voluptas_. [6621]\"The same condition is\nof men and of beasts; as the one dieth, so dieth the other,\" Eccles. iii.\n19. The world goes round,\n\n[6622]  ------\"truditur dies die,\n        Novaeque pergunt interire Lunae:\"\n\n[6623]They did eat and drink of old, marry, bury, bought, sold, planted,\nbuilt, and will do still. [6624]\"Our life is short and tedious, and in the\ndeath of a man there is no recovery, neither was any man known that hath\nreturned from the grave; for we are born at all adventure, and we shall be\nhereafter as though we had never been; for the breath is as smoke in our\nnostrils, &c., and the spirit vanisheth as the soft air.\" [6625]\"Come let\nus enjoy the pleasures that are present, let us cheerfully use the\ncreatures as in youth, let us fill ourselves with costly wine and\nointments, let not the flower of our life pass by us, let us crown\nourselves with rose-buds before they are withered,\" &c. [6626]_Vivamus mea\nLesbia et amemus_, &c. [6627] \"Come let us take our fill of love, and\npleasure in dalliance, for this is our portion, this is our lot.\"\n\n_Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis_.[6628] For the rest of\nheaven and hell, let children and superstitious fools believe it: for their\nparts, they are so far from trembling at the dreadful day of judgment that\nthey wish with Nero, _Me vivo fiat_, let it come in their times: so secure,\nso desperate, so immoderate in lust and pleasure, so prone to revenge that,\nas Paterculus said of some caitiffs in his time in Rome, _Quod nequiter\nausi, fortiter executi_: it shall not be so wickedly attempted, but as\ndesperately performed, whatever they take in hand. Were it not for God's\nrestraining grace, fear and shame, temporal punishment, and their own\ninfamy, they would. Lycaon-like exenterate, as so many cannibals eat up, or\nCadmus' soldiers consume one another. These are most impious, and commonly\nprofessed atheists, that never use the name of God but to swear by it; that\nexpress nought else but epicurism in their carriage, or hypocrisy; with\nPentheus they neglect and contemn these rites and religious ceremonies of\nthe gods; they will be gods themselves, or at least _socii deorum. Divisum\nimperium cum Jove Caesar habet._ \"Caesar divides the empire with Jove.\"\nAproyis, an Egyptian tyrant, grew, saith [6629]Herodotus, to that height of\npride, insolency of impiety, to that contempt of Gods and men, that he held\nhis kingdom so sure, _ut a nemine deorum aut hominum sibi eripi posset_,\nneither God nor men could take it from him. [6630]A certain blasphemous\nking of Spain (as [6631]Lansius reports) made an edict, that no subject of\nhis, for ten years' space, should believe in, call on, or worship any god.\nAnd as [6632]Jovius relates of \"Mahomet the Second, that sacked\nConstantinople, he so behaved himself, that he believed neither Christ nor\nMahomet; and thence it came to pass, that he kept his word and promise no\nfarther than for his advantage, neither did he care to commit any offence\nto satisfy his lust.\" I could say the like of many princes, many private\nmen (our stories are full of them) in times past, this present age, that\nlove, fear, obey, and perform all civil duties as they shall find them\nexpedient or behoveful to their own ends. _Securi adversus Deos, securi\nadversus homines, votis non est opus_, which [6633] Tacitus reports of some\nGermans, they need not pray, fear, hope, for they are secure, to their\nthinking, both from Gods and men. Bulco Opiliensis, sometime Duke of\n[6634]Silesia, was such a one to a hair; he lived (saith [6635]Aeneas\nSylvius) at [6636]Vratislavia, \"and was so mad to satisfy his lust, that he\nbelieved neither heaven nor hell, or that the soul was immortal, but\nmarried wives, and turned them up as he thought fit, did murder and\nmischief, and what he list himself.\" This duke hath too many followers in\nour days: say what you can, dehort, exhort, persuade to the contrary, they\nare no more moved,--_quam si dura, silex aut stet Marpesia cautes_, than so\nmany stocks, and stones; tell them of heaven and hell, 'tis to no purpose,\n_laterem lavas_, they answer as Ataliba that Indian prince did friar\nVincent, [6637]\"when he brought him a book, and told him all the mysteries\nof salvation, heaven and hell, were contained in it: he looked upon it, and\nsaid he saw no such matter, asking withal, how he knew it:\" they will but\nscoff at it, or wholly reject it. Petronius in Tacitus, when he was now by\nNero's command bleeding to death, _audiebat amicos nihil referentes de\nimmortalitate animae, aut sapientum placitis, sed levia carmina et faciles\nversus_; instead of good counsel and divine meditations, he made his\nfriends sing him bawdy verses and scurrilous songs. Let them take heaven,\nparadise, and that future happiness that will, _bonum est esse hic_, it is\ngood being here: there is no talking to such, no hope of their conversion,\nthey are in a reprobate sense, mere carnalists, fleshly minded men, which\nhowsoever they may be applauded in this life by some few parasites, and\nheld for worldly wise men. [6638]\"They seem to me\" (saith Melancthon) \"to\nbe as mad as Hercules was when he raved and killed his wife and children.\"\nA milder sort of these atheistical spirits there are that profess religion,\nbut _timide et haesitanter_, tempted thereunto out of that horrible\nconsideration of diversity of religions, which are and have been in the\nworld (which argument Campanella, _Atheismi Triumphati, cap. 9._ both\nurgeth and answers), besides the covetousness, imposture, and knavery of\npriests, _quae faciunt_ (as [6639]Postellus observes) _ut rebus sacris\nminus faciant fidem_; and those religions some of them so fantastical,\nexorbitant, so violently maintained with equal constancy and assurance;\nwhence they infer, that if there be so many religious sects, and denied by\nthe rest, why may they not be all false? or why should this or that be\npreferred before the rest? The sceptics urge this, and amongst others it is\nthe conclusion of Sextus Empericus, _lib. 3. advers. Mathematicos_: after\nmany philosophical arguments and reasons pro and con that there are gods,\nand again that there are no gods, he so concludes, _cum tot inter se\npugnent, &c. Una tantum potest esse vera_, as Tully likewise disputes:\nChristians say, they alone worship the true God, pity all other sects,\nlament their case; and yet those old Greeks and Romans that worshipped the\ndevil, as the Chinese now do, _aut deos topicos_, their own gods; as Julian\nthe apostate, [6640]Cecilius in Minutius, Celsus and Porphyrius the\nphilosopher object: and as Machiavel contends, were much more noble,\ngenerous, victorious, had a more flourishing commonwealth, better cities,\nbetter soldiers, better scholars, better wits. Their gods overcame our\ngods, did as many miracles, &c. Saint Cyril, Arnobius, Minutius, with many\nother ancients of late, Lessius, Morneus, Grotius _de Verit. Relig.\nChristianae_, Savanarola _de Verit. Fidei Christianae_, well defend; but\nZanchius, [6641]Campanella, Marinus Marcennus, Bozius, and Gentillettus\nanswer all these atheistical arguments at large. But this again troubles\nmany as of old, wicked men generally thrive, professed atheists thrive,\n\n[6642] \"Nullos esse Deos, inane coelum,\n        Affirmat Selius: probatque, quod se\n        Factum, dum negat haec, videt beatum.\"\n\n       \"There are no gods, heavens are toys,\n        Selius in public justifies;\n        Because that whilst he thus denies\n        Their deities, he better thrives.\"\n\nThis is a prime argument: and most part your most sincere, upright, honest,\nand [6643]good men are depressed, \"The race is not to the swift, nor the\nbattle to the strong\" (Eccles. ix. 11.), \"nor yet bread to the wise, favour\nnor riches to men of understanding, but time and chance comes to all.\"\nThere was a great plague in Athens (as Thucydides, _lib. 2._ relates), in\nwhich at last every man, with great licentiousness, did what he list, not\ncaring at all for God's or men's laws. \"Neither the fear of God nor laws of\nmen\" (saith he) \"awed any man, because the plague swept all away alike,\ngood and bad; they thence concluded it was alike to worship or not worship\nthe gods, since they perished all alike.\" Some cavil and make doubts of\nscripture itself: it cannot stand with God's mercy, that so many should be\ndamned, so many bad, so few good, such have and hold about religions, all\nstiff on their side, factious alike, thrive alike, and yet bitterly\npersecuting and damning each other; \"It cannot stand with God's goodness,\nprotection, and providence\" (as [6644]Saint Chrysostom in the Dialect of\nsuch discontented persons) \"to see and suffer one man to be lame, another\nmad, a third poor and miserable all the days of his life, a fourth\ngrievously tormented with sickness and aches, to his last hour. Are these\nsigns and works of God's providence, to let one man be deaf, another dumb?\nA poor honest fellow lives in disgrace, woe and want, wretched he is; when\nas a wicked caitiff abounds in superfluity of wealth, keeps whores,\nparasites, and what he will himself:\" _Audis Jupiter haec? Talia multa\nconnectentes, longum reprehensionis sermonem erga Dei providentiam\ncontexunt._ [6645]Thus they mutter and object (see the rest of their\narguments in Marcennus in Genesin, and in Campanella, amply confuted), with\nmany such vain cavils, well known, not worthy the recapitulation or\nanswering: whatsoever they pretend, they are _interim_ of little or no\nreligion.\n\nCousin-germans to these men are many of our great philosophers and deists,\nwho, though they be more temperate in this life, give many good moral\nprecepts, honest, upright, and sober in their conversation, yet in effect\nthey are the same (accounting no man a good scholar that is not an\natheist), _nimis altum sapiunt_, too much learning makes them mad. Whilst\nthey attribute all to natural causes, [6646]contingence of all things, as\nMelancthon calls them, _Pertinax hominum genus_, a peevish generation of\nmen, that misled by philosophy, and the devil's suggestion, their own\ninnate blindness, deny God as much as the rest, hold all religion a\nfiction, opposite to reason and philosophy, though for fear of magistrates,\nsaith [6647]Vaninus, they durst not publicly profess it. Ask one of them of\nwhat religion he is, he scoffingly replies, a philosopher, a Galenist, an\n[6648]Averroist, and with Rabelais a physician, a peripatetic, an epicure.\nIn spiritual things God must demonstrate all to sense, leave a pawn with\nthem, or else seek some other creditor. They will acknowledge Nature and\nFortune, yet not God: though in effect they grant both: for as Scaliger\ndefines, Nature signifies God's ordinary power; or, as Calvin writes,\nNature is God's order, and so things extraordinary may be called unnatural:\nFortune his unrevealed will; and so we call things changeable that are\nbeside reason and expectation. To this purpose [6649]Minutius in _Octavio_,\nand [6650] Seneca well discourseth with them, _lib. 4. de beneficiis, cap.\n5, 6, 7._ \"They do not understand what they say; what is Nature but God?\ncall him what thou wilt, Nature, Jupiter, he hath as many names as offices:\nit comes all to one pass, God is the fountain of all, the first Giver and\nPreserver, from whom all things depend,\" [6651]_a quo, et per quem omnia,\nNam quocunque vides Deus est, quocunque moveris_, \"God is all in all, God\nis everywhere, in every place.\" And yet this Seneca, that could confute and\nblame them, is all out as much to be blamed and confuted himself, as mad\nhimself; for he holds _fatum Stoicum_, that inevitable Necessity in the\nother extreme, as those Chaldean astrologers of old did, against whom the\nprophet Jeremiah so often thunders, and those heathen mathematicians,\nNigidius Figulus, magicians, and Priscilianists, whom St. Austin so eagerly\nconfutes, those Arabian questionaries, Novem Judices, Albumazer, Dorotheus,\n&c., and our countryman [6652]Estuidus, that take upon them to define out\nof those great conjunction of stars, with Ptolomeus, the periods of\nkingdoms, or religions, of all future accidents, wars, plagues, schisms,\nheresies, and what not? all from stars, and such things, saith Maginus,\n_Quae sibi et intelligentiis suis reservavit Deus_, which God hath reserved\nto himself and his angels, they will take upon them to foretell, as if\nstars were immediate, inevitable causes of all future accidents. Caesar\nVaninus, in his book _de admirandis naturae Arcanis, dial. 52. de\noraculis_, is more free, copious, and open, in this explication of this\nastrological tenet of Ptolemy, than any of our modern writers, Cardan\nexcepted, a true disciple of his master Pomponatius; according to the\ndoctrine of Peripatetics, he refers all apparitions, prodigies, miracles,\noracles, accidents, alterations of religions, kingdoms, &c. (for which he\nis soundly lashed by Marinus Mercennus, as well he deserves), to natural\ncauses (for spirits he will not acknowledge), to that light, motion,\ninfluences of heavens and stars, and to the intelligences that move the\norbs. _Intelligentia quae, movet orbem mediante coelo_, &c. Intelligences\ndo all: and after a long discourse of miracles done of old, _si haec\ndaemones possint, cur non et intelligentiae, coelorum motrices_? And as\nthese great conjunctions, aspects of planets, begin or end, vary, are\nvertical and predominant, so have religions, rites, ceremonies, and\nkingdoms their beginning, progress, periods, _in urbibus, regibus,\nreligionibus, ac in particularibus hominibus, haec vera ac manifesta, sunt,\nut Aristoteles innuere videtur, et quotidiana docet experientia, ut\nhistorias perlegens videbit; quid olim in Gentili lege Jove sanctius et\nillustrius? quid nunc vile magis et execrandum? Ita coelestia corpora pro\nmortalium beneficio religiones aedificant, et cum cessat influxus, cessat\nlex_, [6653]&c. And because, according to their tenets, the world is\neternal, intelligences eternal, influences of stars eternal, kingdoms,\nreligions, alterations shall be likewise eternal, and run round after many\nages; _Atque iterum ad Troiam magnus mittetur Achilles; renascentur\nreligiones, et ceremoniae, res humanae in idem recident, nihil nunc quod\nnon olim fuit, et post saeculorum revolutiones alias est, erit,[6654] &c.\nidem specie_, saith Vaninus, _non individuo quod Plato significavit._ These\n(saith mine [6655]author), these are the decrees of Peripatetics, which\nthough I recite, _in obsequium Christianae fidei detestor_, as I am a\nChristian I detest and hate. Thus Peripatetics and astrologians held in\nformer times, and to this effect of old in Rome, saith Dionysius\nHalicarnassus, _lib. 7_, when those meteors and prodigies appeared in the\nair, after the banishment of Coriolanus, [6656] \"Men were diversely\naffected: some said they were God's just judgments for the execution of\nthat good man, some referred all to natural causes, some to stars, some\nthought they came by chance, some by necessity\" decreed _ab initio_, and\ncould not be altered. The two last opinions of necessity and chance were,\nit seems, of greater note than the rest.\n\n[6657] \"Sunt qui in Fortunae jam casibus omnia ponunt,\n        Et mundum credunt nullo rectore moveri,\n        Natura, volvente vices,\" &c.\n\nFor the first of chance, as [6658]Sallust likewise informeth us, those old\nRomans generally received; \"They supposed fortune alone gave kingdoms and\nempires, wealth, honours, offices: and that for two causes; first, because\nevery wicked base unworthy wretch was preferred, rich, potent, &c.;\nsecondly, because of their uncertainty, though never so good, scarce any\none enjoyed them long: but after, they began upon better advice to think\notherwise, that every man made his own fortune.\" The last of Necessity was\nSeneca's tenet, that God was _alligatus causis secundis_, so tied to second\ncauses, to that inexorable Necessity, that he could alter nothing of that\nwhich was once decreed; _sic erat in fatis_, it cannot be altered, _semel\njussit, semper paret Deus, nulla vis rumpit, nullae preces, nec ipsum\nfulmen_, God hath once said it, and it must for ever stand good, no\nprayers, no threats, nor power, nor thunder itself can alter it. Zeno,\nChrysippus, and those other Stoics, as you may read in Tully _2. de\ndivinatione_, Gellius, _lib. 6. cap. 2._ &c., maintained as much. In all\nages, there have been such, that either deny God in all, or in part; some\nderide him, they could have made a better world, and ruled it more orderly\nthemselves, blaspheme him, derogate at their pleasure from him. 'Twas so in\n[6659]Plato's time, \"Some say there be no gods, others that they care not\nfor men, a middle sort grant both.\" _Si non sit Deus, unde mala? si sit\nDeus, unde mala_? So Cotta argues in Tully, why made he not all good, or at\nleast tenders not the welfare of such as are good? As the woman told\nAlexander, if he be not at leisure to hear causes, and redress them, why\ndoth he reign? [6660]Sextus Empericus hath many such arguments. Thus\nperverse men cavil. So it will ever be, some of all sorts, good, bad,\nindifferent, true, false, zealous, ambidexters, neutralists, lukewarm,\nlibertines, atheists, &c. They will see these religious sectaries agree\namongst themselves, be reconciled all, before they will participate with,\nor believe any: they think in the meantime (which [6661]Celsus objects, and\nwhom Origen confutes), \"We Christians adore a person put to [6662]death\nwith no more reason than the barbarous Getes worshipped Zamolxis, the\nCilicians Mopsus, the Thebans Amphiaraus, and the Lebadians Trophonius; one\nreligion is as true as another, new fangled devices, all for human\nrespects;\" great-witted Aristotle's works are as much authentical to them\nas Scriptures, subtle Seneca's Epistles as canonical as St. Paul's,\nPindarus' Odes as good as the Prophet David's Psalms, Epictetus'\nEnchiridion equivalent to wise Solomon's Proverbs. They do openly and\nboldly speak this and more, some of them, in all places and companies.\n[6663]\"Claudius the emperor was angry with Heaven, because it thundered,\nand challenged Jupiter into the field; with what madness! saith Seneca; he\nthought Jupiter could not hurt him, but he could hurt Jupiter.\" Diagoras,\nDemonax, Epicurus, Pliny, Lucian, Lucretius,--_Contemptorque Deum\nMezentius_, \"professed atheists all\" in their times: though not simple\natheists neither, as Cicogna proves, _lib. 1. cap. 1._ they scoffed only at\nthose Pagan gods, their plurality, base and fictitious offices. Gilbertus\nCognatus labours much, and so doth Erasmus, to vindicate Lucian from\nscandal, and there be those that apologise for Epicurus, but all in vain;\nLucian scoffs at all, Epicurus he denies all, and Lucretius his scholar\ndefends him in it:\n\n[6664] \"Humana ante oculua foede cum vita jaceret\n        In terris oppressa gravi cum religione,\n        Quae caput a coeli regionibus ostendebat,\n        Horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans,\" &c.\n\n       \"When human kind was drench'd in superstition,\n        With ghastly looks aloft, which frighted mortal men,\" &c.\n\nHe alone, like another Hercules, did vindicate the world from that monster.\nUncle [6665]Pliny, _lib. 2. cap. 7. nat. hist._ and _lib. 7. cap. 55_, in\nexpress words denies the immortality of the soul. [6666]Seneca doth little\nless, _lib. 7. epist. 55. ad Lucilium, et lib. de consol. ad Martiam_, or\nrather more. Some Greek Commentators would put as much upon Job, that he\nshould deny resurrection, &c., whom Pineda copiously confutes in _cap. 7.\nJob, vers. 9._ Aristotle is hardly censured of some, both divines and\nphilosophers. St. Justin _in Peraenetica ad Gentes_, Greg. Nazianzen. _in\ndisput. adversus Eun._, Theodoret, _lib. 5. de curat. graec. affec._,\nOrigen. _lib. de principiis_. Pomponatius justifies in his Tract (so styled\nat least) _De immortalitate Animae_, Scaliger (who would forswear himself\nat any time, saith Patritius, in defence of his great master Aristotle),\nand Dandinus, _lib. 3. de anima_, acknowledge as much. Averroes oppugns all\nspirits and supreme powers; of late Brunus (_infelix Brunus_, [6667]Kepler\ncalls him), Machiavel, Caesar Vaninus lately burned at Toulouse in France,\nand Pet. Aretine, have publicly maintained such atheistical paradoxes,\n[6668]with that Italian Boccaccio with his fable of three rings, &c., _ex\nquo infert haud posse internosci, quae sit verior religio, Judaica,\nMahometana, an Christiana, quoniam eadem signa_, &c., \"from which he\ninfers, that it cannot be distinguished which is the true religion,\nJudaism, Mahommedanism, or Christianity,\" &c. [6669]Marinus Mercennus\nsuspects Cardan for his subtleties, Campanella, and Charron's Book of\nWisdom, with some other Tracts, to savour of [6670]atheism: but amongst the\nrest that pestilent book _de tribus mundi impostoribus_, _quem sine horrore\n(inquit) non legas, et mundi Cymbalum dialogis quatuor contentum, anno\n1538, auctore Peresio, Parisiis excusum_, [6671]&c. And as there have been\nin all ages such blasphemous spirits, so there have not been wanting their\npatrons, protectors, disciples and adherents. Never so many atheists in\nItaly and Germany, saith [6672]Colerus, as in this age: the like complaint\nMercennus makes in France, 50,000 in that one city of Paris. Frederic the\nEmperor, as [6673]Matthew Paris records _licet non sit recitabile_ (I use\nhis own words) is reported to have said, _Tres praestigiatores, Moses,\nChristus, et Mahomet, uti mundo dominarentur, totum populum sibi\ncontemporaneum se duxisse._ (Henry, the Landgrave of Hesse, heard him speak\nit,) _Si principes imperii institutioni meae adhaererent, ego multo\nmeliorem modum credendi et vivendi ordinarem._\n\nTo these professed atheists, we may well add that impious and carnal crew\nof worldly-minded men, impenitent sinners, that go to hell in a lethargy,\nor in a dream; who though they be professed Christians, yet they will\n_nulla pallescere culpa_, make a conscience of nothing they do, they have\ncauterised consciences, and are indeed in a reprobate sense, \"past all\nfeeling, have given themselves over to wantonness, to work all manner of\nuncleanness even with greediness,\" Ephes. iv. 19. They do know there is a\nGod, a day of judgment to come, and yet for all that, as Hugo saith, _ita\ncomedunt ac dormiunt, ac si diem judicii evasissent; ita ludunt ac rident,\nac si in coelis cum Deo regnarent_: they are as merry for all the sorrow,\nas if they had escaped all dangers, and were in heaven already:\n\n[6674]  ------\"Metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum\n        Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.\"\n\nThose rude idiots and ignorant persons, that neglect and contemn the means\nof their salvation, may march on with these; but above all others, those\nHerodian temporizing statesmen, political Machiavellians and hypocrites,\nthat make a show of religion, but in their hearts laugh at it. _Simulata\nsanctitas duplex iniquitas_; they are in a double fault, \"that fashion\nthemselves to this world,\" which [6675]Paul forbids, and like Mercury, the\nplanet, are good with good, bad with bad. When they are at Rome, they do\nthere as they see done, puritans with puritans, papists with papists;\n_omnium horarum homines_, formalists, ambidexters, lukewarm Laodiceans.\n[6676]All their study is to please, and their god is their commodity, their\nlabour to satisfy their lusts, and their endeavours to their own ends.\nWhatsoever they pretend, or in public seem to do, [6677]\"With the fool in\ntheir hearts, they say there is no God.\" _Heus tu--de Jove quid sentis_?\n\"Hulloa! what is your opinion about a Jupiter?\" Their words are as soft as\noil, but bitterness is in their hearts; like [6678]Alexander VI. so cunning\ndissemblers, that what they think they never speak. Many of them are so\nclose, you can hardly discern it, or take any just exceptions at them; they\nare not factious, oppressors as most are, no bribers, no simoniacal\ncontractors, no such ambitious, lascivious persons as some others are, no\ndrunkards, _sobrii solem vident orientem, sobrii vident occidentem_, they\nrise sober, and go sober to bed, plain dealing, upright, honest men, they\ndo wrong to no man, and are so reputed in the world's esteem at least, very\nzealous in religion, very charitable, meek, humble, peace-makers, keep all\nduties, very devout, honest, well spoken of, beloved of all men: but he\nthat knows better how to judge, he that examines the heart, saith they are\nhypocrites, _Cor dolo plenum; sonant vitium percussa maligne_, they are not\nsound within. As it is with writers [6679]oftentimes, _Plus sanctimoniae,\nin libello, quam libelli auctore_, more holiness is in the book than in the\nauthor of it: so 'tis with them: many come to church with great Bibles,\nwhom Cardan said he could not choose but laugh at, and will now and then\n_dare operam Augustino_, read Austin, frequent sermons, and yet professed\nusurers, mere gripes, _tota vitae ratio epicurea est_; all their life is\nepicurism and atheism, come to church all day, and lie with a courtesan at\nnight. _Qui curios simulant et Bacchanalia vivunt_, they have Esau's hands,\nand Jacob's voice: yea, and many of those holy friars, sanctified men,\nCappam, saith Hierom, _et cilicium induunt, sed intus latronem tegunt._\nThey are wolves in sheep's clothing, _Introrsum turpes, speciosi pelle\ndecora_, \"Fair without, and most foul within.\" [6680]_Latet plerumque sub\ntristi amictu lascivia, et deformis horror vili veste tegitur_; ofttimes\nunder a mourning weed lies lust itself, and horrible vices under a poor\ncoat. But who can examine all those kinds of hypocrites, or dive into their\nhearts? ]f we may guess at the tree by the fruit, never so many as in these\ndays; show me a plain-dealing true honest man: _Et pudor, et probitas, et\ntimor omnis abest._ He that shall but look into their lives, and see such\nenormous vices, men so immoderate in lust, unspeakable in malice, furious\nin their rage, flattering and dissembling (all for their own ends) will\nsurely think they are not truly religious, but of an obdurate heart, most\npart in a reprobate sense, as in this age. But let them carry it as they\nwill for the present, dissemble as they can, a time will come when they\nshall be called to an account, their melancholy is at hand, they pull a\nplague and curse upon their own heads, _thesaurisant iram Dei._ Besides all\nsuch as are _in deos contumeliosi_, blaspheme, contemn, neglect God, or\nscoff at him, as the poets feign of Salmoneus, that would in derision\nimitate Jupiter's thunder, he was precipitated for his pains, Jupiter\n_intonuit contra_, &c. so shall they certainly rue it in the end,\n([6681]_in se spuit, qui in coelum spuit_), their doom's at hand, and hell\nis ready to receive them.\n\nSome are of opinion, that it is in vain to dispute with such atheistical\nspirits in the meantime, 'tis not the best way to reclaim them. Atheism,\nidolatry, heresy, hypocrisy, though they have one common root, that is\nindulgence to corrupt affection, yet their growth is different, they have\ndivers symptoms, occasions, and must have several cures and remedies. 'Tis\ntrue some deny there is any God, some confess, yet believe it not; a third\nsort confess and believe, but will not live after his laws, worship and\nobey him: others allow God and gods subordinate, but not one God, no such\ngeneral God, _non talem deum_, but several topic gods for several places,\nand those not to persecute one another for any difference, as Socinus will,\nbut rather love and cherish.\n\nTo describe them in particular, to produce their arguments and reasons,\nwould require a just volume, I refer them therefore that expect a more\nample satisfaction, to those subtle and elaborate treatises, devout and\nfamous tracts of our learned divines (schoolmen amongst the rest, and\ncasuists) that have abundance of reasons to prove there is a God, the\nimmortality of the soul, &c., out of the strength of wit and philosophy\nbring irrefragable arguments to such as are ingenuous and well disposed; at\nthe least, answer all cavils and objections to confute their folly and\nmadness, and to reduce them, _si fieri posset, ad sanam mentem_, to a\nbetter mind, though to small purpose many times. Amongst others consult\nwith Julius Caesar Lagalla, professor of philosophy in Rome, who hath\nwritten a large volume of late to confute atheists: of the immortality of\nthe soul, Hierom. Montanus _de immortalitate Animae_: Lelius Vincentius of\nthe same subject: Thomas Giaminus, and Franciscus Collius _de Paganorum\nanimabus post mortem_, a famous doctor of the Ambrosian College in Milan.\nBishop Fotherby in his Atheomastix, Doctor Dove, Doctor Jackson, Abernethy,\nCorderoy, have written well of this subject in our mother tongue: in Latin,\nColerus, Zanchius, Palearius, Illyricus, [6682]Philippus, Faber Faventinus,\n&c. But _instar omnium_, the most copious confuter of atheists is Marinus\nMercennus in his Commentaries on Genesis: [6683]with Campanella's Atheismus\nTriumphatus. He sets down at large the causes of this brutish passion,\n(seventeen in number I take it) answers all their arguments and sophisms,\nwhich he reduceth to twenty-six heads, proving withal his own assertion;\n\"There is a God, such a God, the true and sole God,\" by thirty-five\nreasons. His Colophon is how to resist and repress atheism, and to that\npurpose he adds four especial means or ways, which who so will may\nprofitably peruse.\n\n\nSUBSECT. II.--_Despair. Despairs, Equivocations, Definitions, Parties and\nParts affected_.\n\nThere be many kinds of desperation, whereof some be holy, some unholy, as\n[6684]one distinguisheth; that unholy he defines out of Tully to be\n_Aegritudinem animi sine ulla rerum expectatione meliore_, a sickness of\nthe soul without any hope or expectation of amendment; which commonly\nsucceeds fear; for whilst evil is expected, we fear: but when it is\ncertain, we despair. According to Thomas _2. 2ae. distinct. 40. art. 4._ it\nis _Recessus a re desiderata, propter impossibilitatem existimatam_, a\nrestraint from the thing desired, for some impossibility supposed. Because\nthey cannot obtain what they would, they become desperate, and many times\neither yield to the passion by death itself, or else attempt\nimpossibilities, not to be performed by men. In some cases, this desperate\nhumour is not much to be discommended, as in wars it is a cause many times\nof extraordinary valour; as Joseph, _lib. 1. de bello Jud. cap. 14._ L.\nDanaeus _in Aphoris. polit. pag. 226._ and many politicians hold. It makes\nthem improve their worth beyond itself, and of a forlorn impotent company\nbecome conquerors in a moment. _Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem_,\n\"the only hope for the conquered is despair.\" In such courses when they see\nno remedy, but that they must either kill or be killed, they take courage,\nand oftentimes, _praeter spem_, beyond all hope vindicate themselves.\nFifteen thousand Locrenses fought against a hundred thousand Crotonienses,\nand seeing now no way but one, they must all die, [6685]thought they would\nnot depart unrevenged, and thereupon desperately giving an assault,\nconquered their enemies. _Nec alia causa victoriae_, (saith Justin mine\nauthor) _quam quod desperaverant._ William the Conqueror, when he first\nlanded in England, sent back his ships, that his soldiers might have no\nhope of retiring back. [6686]Bodine excuseth his countrymen's overthrow at\nthat famous battle at Agincourt, in Henry the Fifth his time, (_cui\nsimile_, saith Froissard, _tota historia producere non possit_, which no\nhistory can parallel almost, wherein one handful of Englishmen overthrew a\nroyal army of Frenchmen) with this refuge of despair, _pauci desperati_, a\nfew desperate fellows being compassed in by their enemies, past all hope of\nlife, fought like so many devils; and gives a caution, that no soldiers\nhereafter set upon desperate persons, which [6687]after Frontinus and\nVigetius, Guicciardini likewise admonisheth, _Hypomnes. part. 2. pag. 25._\nnot to stop an enemy that is going his way. Many such kinds there are of\ndesperation, when men are past hope of obtaining any suit, or in despair of\nbetter fortune; _Desperatio facit monachum_, as the saying is, and\ndesperation causeth death itself; how many thousands in such distress have\nmade away themselves, and many others? For he that cares not for his own,\nis master of another man's life. A Tuscan soothsayer, as [6688]Paterculus\ntells the story, perceiving himself and Fulvius Flaccus his dear friend,\nnow both carried to prison by Opimius, and in despair of pardon, seeing the\nyoung man weep, _quin tu potius hoc inquit facis_, do as I do; and with\nthat knocked out his brains against the door-cheek, as he was entering into\nprison, _protinusque illiso capite in capite in carceris januam effuso\ncerebro expiravit_, and so desperate died. But these are equivocal,\nimproper. \"When I speak of despair,\" saith [6689]Zanchie, \"I speak not of\nevery kind, but of that alone which concerns God. It is opposite to hope,\nand a most pernicious sin, wherewith the devil seeks to entrap men.\"\nMusculus makes four kinds of desperation, of God, ourselves, our neighbour,\nor anything to be done; but this division of his may be reduced easily to\nthe former: all kinds are opposite to hope, that sweet moderator of\npassions, as Simonides calls it; I do not mean that vain hope which\nfantastical fellows feign to themselves, which according to Aristotle is\n_insomnium vigilantium_, a waking dream; but this divine hope which\nproceeds from confidence, and is an anchor to a floating soul; _spes alit\nagricolas_, even in our temporal affairs, hope revives us, but in spiritual\nit farther animateth; and were it not for hope, \"we of all others were the\nmost miserable,\" as Paul saith, in this life; were it not for hope, the\nheart would break; \"for though they be punished in the sight of men,\"\n(Wisdom iii. 4.) yet is \"their hope full of immortality:\" yet doth it not\nso rear, as despair doth deject; this violent and sour passion of despair,\nis of all perturbations most grievous, as [6690]Patritius holds. Some\ndivide it into final and temporal; [6691]final is incurable, which\nbefalleth reprobates; temporal is a rejection of hope and comfort for a\ntime, which may befall the best of God's children, and it commonly proceeds\n[6692]\"from weakness of faith,\" as in David when he was oppressed he cried\nout, \"O Lord, thou hast forsaken me,\" but this for a time. This ebbs and\nflows with hope and fear; it is a grievous sin howsoever: although some\nkind of despair be not amiss, when, saith Zanchius, we despair of our own\nmeans, and rely wholly upon God: but that species is not here meant. This\npernicious kind of desperation is the subject of our discourse, _homicida\nanimae_, the murderer of the soul, as Austin terms it, a fearful passion,\nwherein the party oppressed thinks he can get no ease but by death, and is\nfully resolved to offer violence unto himself; so sensible of his burthen,\nand impatient of his cross, that he hopes by death alone to be freed of his\ncalamity (though it prove otherwise), and chooseth with Job vi. 8. 9. xvii.\n5. \"Rather to be strangled and die, than to be in his bonds.\" [6693]The\npart affected is the whole soul, and all the faculties of it; there is a\nprivation of joy, hope, trust, confidence, of present and future good, and\nin their place succeed fear, sorrow, &c. as in the symptoms shall be shown.\nThe heart is grieved, the conscience wounded, the mind eclipsed with black\nfumes arising from those perpetual terrors.\n\n\nSUBSECT. III.--_Causes of Despair, the Devil, Melancholy, Meditation,\nDistrust, Weakness of Faith, Rigid Ministers, Misunderstanding Scriptures,\nGuilty Consciences, &c._\n\nThe principal agent and procurer of this mischief is the devil; those whom\nGod forsakes, the devil by his permission lays hold on. Sometimes he\npersecutes them with that worm of conscience, as he did Judas, [6694]Saul,\nand others. The poets call it Nemesis, but it is indeed God's just\njudgment, _sero sed serio_, he strikes home at last, and setteth upon them\n\"as a thief in the night,\" 1 Thes. ii. [6695]This temporary passion made\nDavid cry out, \"Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in\nthine heavy displeasure; for thine arrows have light upon me, &c. there is\nnothing sound in my flesh, because of thine anger.\" Again, I roar for the\nvery grief of my heart: and Psalm xxii. \"My God, my God, why hast thou\nforsaken me, and art so far from my health, and the words of my crying? I\nam like to water poured out, my bones are out of joint, mine heart is like\nwax, that is molten in the midst of my bowels.\" So Psalm lxxxviii. 15 and\n16 vers. and Psalm cii. \"I am in misery at the point of death, from my\nyouth I suffer thy terrors, doubting for my life; thine indignations have\ngone over me, and thy fear hath cut me off.\" Job doth often complain in\nthis kind; and those God doth not assist, the devil is ready to try and\ntorment, \"still seeking whom he may devour.\" If he find them merry, saith\nGregory, \"he tempts them forthwith to some dissolute act; if pensive and\nsad, to a desperate end.\" _Aut suadendo blanditur, aut minando terret_,\nsometimes by fair means, sometimes again by foul, as he perceives men\nseverally inclined. His ordinary engine by which he produceth this effect,\nis the melancholy humour itself, which is _balneum diaboli_, the devil's\nbath; and as in Saul, those evil spirits get in [6696]as it were, and take\npossession of us. Black choler is a shoeing-horn, a bait to allure them,\ninsomuch that many writers make melancholy an ordinary cause, and a symptom\nof despair, for that such men are most apt, by reason of their ill-disposed\ntemper, to distrust, fear, grief, mistake, and amplify whatsoever they\npreposterously conceive, or falsely apprehend. _Conscientia scrupulosa\nnascitur ex vitio naturali, complexione melancholica_ (saith Navarrus _cap.\n27. num. 282. tom. 2. cas. conscien._) The body works upon the mind, by\nobfuscating the spirits and corrupted instruments, which [6697]Perkins\nillustrates by simile of an artificer, that hath a bad tool, his skill is\ngood, ability correspondent, by reason of ill tools his work must needs be\nlame and imperfect. But melancholy and despair, though often, do not always\nconcur; there is much difference: melancholy fears without a cause, this\nupon great occasion; melancholy is caused by fear and grief, but this\ntorment procures them and all extremity of bitterness; much melancholy is\nwithout affliction of conscience, as [6698]Bright and Perkins illustrate by\nfour reasons; and yet melancholy alone may be sometimes a sufficient cause\nof this terror of conscience. [6699]Felix Plater so found it in his\nobservations, _e melancholicis alii damnatos se putant, Deo curae, non\nsunt, nec praedestinati_, &c. \"They think they are not predestinate, God\nhath forsaken them;\" and yet otherwise very zealous and religious; and 'tis\ncommon to be seen, \"melancholy for fear of God's judgment and hell-fire,\ndrives men to desperation; fear and sorrow, if they be immoderate, end\noften with it.\" Intolerable pain and anguish, long sickness, captivity,\nmisery, loss of goods, loss of friends, and those lesser griefs, do\nsometimes effect it, or such dismal accidents. _Si non statim relevantur_,\n[6700]Mercennus, _dubitant an sit Deus_, if they be not eased forthwith,\nthey doubt whether there be any God, they rave, curse, \"and are desperately\nmad because good men are oppressed, wicked men flourish, they have not as\nthey think to their desert,\" and through impatience of calamities are so\nmisaffected. Democritus put out his eyes, _ne malorum civium prosperos\nvideret successus_, because he could not abide to see wicked men prosper,\nand was therefore ready to make away himself, as [6701]Agellius writes of\nhim. Felix Plater hath a memorable example in this kind, of a painter's\nwife in Basil, that was melancholy for her son's death, and for melancholy\nbecame desperate; she thought God would not pardon her sins, [6702]\"and for\nfour months still raved, that she was in hell-fire, already damned.\" When\nthe humour is stirred up, every small object aggravates and incenseth it,\nas the parties are addicted. [6703]The same author hath an example of a\nmerchant man, that for the loss of a little wheat, which he had over long\nkept, was troubled in conscience, for that he had not sold it sooner, or\ngiven it to the poor, yet a good scholar and a great divine; no persuasion\nwould serve to the contrary, but that for this fact he was damned: in other\nmatters Very judicious and discreet. Solitariness, much fasting, divine\nmeditation, and contemplations of God's judgments, most part accompany this\nmelancholy, and are main causes, as [6704]Navarrus holds; to converse with\nsuch kinds of persons so troubled, is sufficient occasion of trouble to\nsome men. _Nonnulli ob longas inedias, studia et meditationes coelestes, de\nrebus sacris et religione semper agitant_, &c. Many, (saith P. Forestus)\nthrough long fasting, serious meditations of heavenly things, fall into\nsuch fits; and as Lemnius adds, _lib. 4. cap. 21_, [6705]\"If they be\nsolitary given, superstitious, precise, or very devout: seldom shall you\nfind a merchant, a soldier, an innkeeper, a bawd, a host, a usurer, so\ntroubled in mind, they have cheverel consciences that will stretch, they\nare seldom moved in this kind or molested: young men and middle age are\nmore wild and less apprehensive; but old folks, most part, such as are\ntimorous and religiously given.\" Pet. Forestus _observat. lib. 10. cap. 12.\nde morbis cerebri_, hath a fearful example of a minister, that through\nprecise fasting in Lent, and overmuch meditation, contracted this mischief,\nand in the end became desperate, thought he saw devils in his chamber, and\nthat he could not be saved; he smelled nothing, as he said, but fire and\nbrimstone, was already in hell, and would ask them, still, if they did not\n[6706]smell as much. I told him he was melancholy, but he laughed me to\nscorn, and replied that he saw devils, talked with them in good earnest,\nWould spit in my face, and ask me if 1 did not smell brimstone, but at last\nhe was by him cured. Such another story I find in Plater _observat. lib.\n1._ A poor fellow had done some foul offence, and for fourteen days would\neat no meat, in the end became desperate, the divines about him could not\nease him, [6707]but so he died. Continual meditation of God's judgments\ntroubles many, _Multi ob timorem futuri judicii_, saith Guatinerius _cap.\n5. tract. 15._ _et suspicionem desperabundi sunt._ David himself complains\nthat God's judgments terrified his soul, Psalm cxix. part. 16. vers. 8. \"My\nflesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.\"\n_Quoties diem illum cogito_ (saith [6708]Hierome) _toto corpore\ncontremisco_, I tremble as often as I think of it. The terrible meditation\nof hell-fire and eternal punishment much torments a sinful silly soul.\nWhat's a thousand years to eternity? _Ubi moeror, ubi fletus, ubi dolor\nsempiternus. Mors sine morte, finis sine fine_; a finger burnt by chance we\nmay not endure, the pain is so grievous, we may not abide an hour, a night\nis intolerable; and what shall this unspeakable fire then be that burns for\never, innumerable infinite millions of years, _in omne aevum in aeternum._\nO eternity!\n\n[6709] \"Aeternitas est illa vox,\n          Vox illa fulminatrix,\n        Tonitruis minacior,\n          Fragoribusque coeli,\n        Aeternitas est illa vox,\n          --meta carens et orta, &c.\n        Tormenta nulla territant,\n          Quae finiuntur annis;\n        Aeternitas, aeternitas\n          Versat coquilque pectus.\n        Auget haec poenas indies,\n          Centuplicatque flammas,\" &c.\n\nThis meditation terrifies these poor distressed souls, especially if their\nbodies be predisposed by melancholy, they religiously given, and have\ntender consciences, every small object affrights them, the very\ninconsiderate reading of Scripture itself, and misinterpretation of some\nplaces of it; as, \"Many are called, few are chosen. Not every one that\nsaith Lord. Fear not little flock. He that stands, let him take heed lest\nhe fall. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, That night two\nshall be in a bed, one received, the other left. Strait is the way that\nleads to heaven, and few there are that enter therein.\" The parable of the\nseed and of the sower, \"some fell on barren ground, some was choked. Whom\nhe hath predestinated he hath chosen. He will have mercy on whom he will\nhave mercy.\" _Non est volentis nec currentis, sed miserentis Dei._ These\nand the like places terrify the souls of many; election, predestination,\nreprobation, preposterously conceived, offend divers, with a deal of\nfoolish presumption, curiosity, needless speculation, contemplation,\nsolicitude, wherein they trouble and puzzle themselves about those\nquestions of grace, free will, perseverance, God's secrets; they will know\nmore than is revealed of God in his word, human capacity, or ignorance can\napprehend, and too importunate inquiry after that which is revealed;\nmysteries, ceremonies, observation of Sabbaths, laws, duties, &c., with\nmany such which the casuists discuss, and schoolmen broach, which divers\nmistake, misconstrue, misapply to themselves, to their own undoing, and so\nfall into this gulf. \"They doubt of their election, how they shall know,\nit, by what signs. And so far forth,\" saith Luther, \"with such nice points,\ntorture and crucify themselves, that they are almost mad, and all they get\nby it is this, they lay open a gap to the devil by desperation to carry\nthem to hell;\" but the greatest harm of all proceeds from those thundering\nministers, a most frequent cause they are of this malady: [6710]\"and do\nmore harm in the church\" (saith Erasmus) \"than they that flatter; great\ndanger on both sides, the one lulls them asleep in carnal security, the\nother drives them to despair.\" Whereas, [6711]St. Bernard well adviseth,\n\"We should not meddle with the one without the other, nor speak of judgment\nwithout mercy; the one alone brings desperation, the other security.\" But\nthese men are wholly for judgment; of a rigid disposition themselves, there\nis no mercy with them, no salvation, no balsam for their diseased souls,\nthey can speak of nothing but reprobation, hell-fire, and damnation; as\nthey did Luke xi. 46. lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, which\nthey themselves touch not with a finger. 'Tis familiar with our papists to\nterrify men's souls with purgatory, tales, visions, apparitions, to daunt\neven the most generous spirits, \"to [6712]require charity,\" as Brentius\nobserves, \"of others, bounty, meekness, love, patience, when they\nthemselves breathe nought but lust, envy, covetousness.\" They teach others\nto fast, give alms, do penance, and crucify their mind with superstitious\nobservations, bread and water, hair clothes, whips, and the like, when they\nthemselves have all the dainties the world can afford, lie on a down-bed\nwith a courtesan in their arms: _Heu quantum patimur pro Christo_, as\n[6713]he said, what a cruel tyranny is this, so to insult over and terrify\nmen's souls! Our indiscreet pastors many of them come not far behind,\nwhilst in their ordinary sermons they speak so much of election,\npredestination, reprobation, _ab aeterno_, subtraction of grace,\npreterition, voluntary permission, &c., by what signs and tokens they shall\ndiscern and try themselves, whether they be God's true children elect, _an\nsint reprobi, praedestinati_, &c., with such scrupulous points, they still\naggravate sin, thunder out God's judgments without respect, intempestively\nrail at and pronounce them damned in all auditories, for giving so much to\nsports and honest recreations, making every small fault and thing\nindifferent an irremissible offence, they so rent, tear and wound men's\nconsciences, that they are almost mad, and at their wits' end.\n\n\"These bitter potions\" (saith [6714]Erasmus) \"are still in their mouths,\nnothing but gall and horror, and a mad noise, they make all their auditors\ndesperate:\" many are wounded by this means, and they commonly that are most\ndevout and precise, have been formerly presumptuous, and certain of their\nsalvation; they that have tender consciences, that follow sermons, frequent\nlectures, that have indeed least cause, they are most apt to mistake, and\nfall into these miseries. I have heard some complain of Parson's\nResolution, and other books of like nature (good otherwise), they are too\ntragical, too much dejecting men, aggravating offences: great care and\nchoice, much discretion is required in this kind.\n\nThe last and greatest cause of this malady, is our own conscience, sense of\nour sins, and God's anger justly deserved, a guilty conscience for some\nfoul offence formerly committed,--[6715]O _miser Oreste, quid morbi te\nperdit_? Or: _Conscientia, Sum enim mihi conscius de malis\nperpetratis_.[6716] \"A good conscience is a continual feast,\" but a galled\nconscience is as great a torment as can possibly happen, a still baking\noven, (so Pierius in his Hieroglyph, compares it) another hell. Our\nconscience, which is a great ledger book, wherein are written all our\noffences, a register to lay them up, (which those [6717]Egyptians in their\nhieroglyphics expressed by a mill, as well for the continuance, as for the\ntorture of it) grinds our souls with the remembrance of some precedent\nsins, makes us reflect upon, accuse and condemn our own selves. [6718]\"Sin\nlies at door,\" &c. I know there be many other causes assigned by Zanchius,\n[6719]Musculus, and the rest; as incredulity, infidelity, presumption,\nignorance, blindness, ingratitude, discontent, those five grand miseries in\nAristotle, ignominy, need, sickness, enmity, death, &c.; but this of\nconscience is the greatest, [6720]_Instar ulceris corpus jugiter\npercellens_: The scrupulous conscience (as [6721]Peter Forestus calls it)\nwhich tortures so many, that either out of a deep apprehension of their\nunworthiness, and consideration of their own dissolute life, \"accuse\nthemselves and aggravate every small offence, when there is no such cause,\nmisdoubting in the meantime God's mercies, they fall into these\ninconveniences.\" The poet calls them [6722]furies dire, but it is the\nconscience alone which is a thousand witnesses to accuse us, [6723] _Nocte\ndieque suum gestant in pectore testem_. A continual tester to give in\nevidence, to empanel a jury to examine us, to cry guilty, a persecutor with\nhue and cry to follow, an apparitor to summon us, a bailiff to carry us, a\nserjeant to arrest, an attorney to plead against us, a gaoler to torment, a\njudge to condemn, still accusing, denouncing, torturing and molesting. And\nas the statue of Juno in that holy city near Euphrates in [6724]Assyria\nwill look still towards you, sit where you will in her temple, she stares\nfull upon you, if you go by, she follows with her eye, in all sites,\nplaces, conventicles, actions, our conscience will be still ready to accuse\nus. After many pleasant days, and fortunate adventures, merry tides, this\nconscience at last doth arrest us. Well he may escape temporal punishment,\n[6725]bribe a corrupt judge, and avoid the censure of law, and flourish for\na time; \"for [6726]who ever saw\" (saith Chrysostom) \"a covetous man\ntroubled in mind when he is telling of his money, an adulterer mourn with\nhis mistress in his arms? we are then drunk with pleasure, and perceive\nnothing:\" yet as the prodigal son had dainty fare, sweet music at first,\nmerry company, jovial entertainment, but a cruel reckoning in the end, as\nbitter as wormwood, a fearful visitation commonly follows. And the devil\nthat then told thee that it was a light sin, or no sin at all, now\naggravates on the other side, and telleth thee, that it is a most\nirremissible offence, as he did by Cain and Judas, to bring them to\ndespair; every small circumstance before neglected and contemned, will now\namplify itself, rise up in judgment, and accuse the dust of their shoes,\ndumb creatures, as to Lucian's tyrant, _lectus et candela_, the bed and\ncandle did bear witness, to torment their souls for their sins past.\nTragical examples in this kind are too familiar and common: Adrian, Galba,\nNero, Otho, Vitellius, Caracalla, were in such horror of conscience for\ntheir offences committed, murders, rapes, extortions, injuries, that they\nwere weary of their lives, and could get nobody to kill them.\n[6727]Kennetus, King of Scotland, when he had murdered his nephew Malcom,\nKing Duffe's son, Prince of Cumberland, and with counterfeit tears and\nprotestations dissembled the matter a long time, [6728]\"at last his\nconscience accused him, his unquiet soul could not rest day or night, he\nwas terrified with fearful dreams, visions, and so miserably tormented all\nhis life.\" It is strange to read what [6729]Cominaeus hath written of Louis\nXI. that French King; of Charles VIII.; of Alphonsus, King of Naples; in\nthe fury of his passion how he came into Sicily, and what pranks he played.\nGuicciardini, a man most unapt to believe lies, relates how that Ferdinand\nhis father's ghost who before had died for grief, came and told him, that\nhe could not resist the French King, he thought every man cried France,\nFrance; the reason of it (saith Cominseus) was because he was a vile\ntyrant, a murderer, an oppressor of his subjects, he bought up all\ncommodities, and sold them at his own price, sold abbeys to Jews and\nFalkoners; both Ferdinand his father, and he himself never made conscience\nof any committed sin; and to conclude, saith he, it was impossible to do\nworse than they did. Why was Pausanias the Spartan tyrant, Nero, Otho,\nGalba, so persecuted with spirits in every house they came, but for their\nmurders which they had committed? [6730]Why doth the devil haunt many men's\nhouses after their deaths, appear to them living, and take possession of\ntheir habitations, as it were, of their palaces, but because of their\nseveral villainies? Why had Richard the Third such fearful dreams, saith\nPolydore, but for his frequent murders? Why was Herod so tortured in his\nmind? because he had made away Mariamne his wife. Why was Theodoric, the\nKing of the Goths, so suspicious, and so affrighted with a fish head alone,\nbut that he had murdered Symmachus, and Boethius his son-in-law, those\nworthy Romans? Caelius, _lib. 27. cap. 22._ See more in Plutarch, in his\ntract _De his qui sero a Numine puniuntur_, and in his book _De\ntranquillitate animi_, &c. Yea, and sometimes GOD himself hath a hand in\nit, to show his power, humiliate, exercise, and to try their faith, (divine\ntemptation, Perkins calls it, _Cas. cons. lib. 1. cap. 8. sect. 1._) to\npunish them for their sins. God the avenger, as [6731]David terms him,\n_ultor a tergo Deus_, his wrath is apprehended of a guilty, soul, as by\nSaul and Judas, which the poets expressed by Adrastia, or Nemesis:\n\n[6732] \"Assequitur Nemesique virum vestigia servat,\n        Ne male quid facias.\"------\n\nAnd she is, as [6733]Ammianus, _lib. 14._ describes her, \"the queen of\ncauses, and moderator of things,\" now she pulls down the proud, now she\nrears and encourageth those that are good; he gives instance in his\nEusebius; Nicephorus, _lib. 10. cap. 35. eccles. hist._ in Maximinus and\nJulian. Fearful examples of God's just judgment, wrath and vengeance, are\nto be found in all histories, of some that have been eaten to death with\nrats and mice, as [6734]Popelius, the second King of Poland, ann. 830, his\nwife and children; the like story is of Hatto, Archbishop of Mentz, ann.\n969, so devoured by these vermin, which howsoever Serrarius the Jesuit\nMogunt. _rerum lib. 4. cap. 5._ impugn by twenty-two arguments, Tritemius,\n[6735]Munster, Magdeburgenses, and many others relate for a truth. Such\nanother example I find in Geraldus Cambrensis _Itin. Cam. lib. 2. cap. 2._\nand where not?\n\nAnd yet for all these terrors of conscience, affrighting punishments which\nare so frequent, or whatsoever else may cause or aggravate this fearful\nmalady in other religions, I see no reason at all why a papist at any time\nshould despair, or be troubled for his sins; for let him be never so\ndissolute a caitiff so notorious a villain, so monstrous a sinner, out of\nthat treasure of indulgences and merits of which the pope is dispensator,\nhe may have free pardon and plenary remission of all his sins. There be so\nmany general pardons for ages to come, forty thousand years to come, so\nmany jubilees, so frequent gaol-deliveries out of purgatory for all souls,\nnow living, or after dissolution of the body, so many particular masses\ndaily said in several churches, so many altars consecrated to this purpose,\nthat if a man have either money or friends, or will take any pains to come\nto such an altar, hear a mass, say so many paternosters, undergo such and\nsuch penance, he cannot do amiss, it is impossible his mind should be\ntroubled, or he have any scruple to molest him. Besides that _Taxa Camerae\nApostolicae_, which was first published to get money in the days of Leo\nDecimus, that sharking pope, and since divulged to the same ends, sets down\nsuch easy rates and dispensations for all offences, for perjury, murder,\nincest, adultery, &c., for so many grosses or dollars (able to invite any\nman to sin, and provoke him to offend, methinks, that otherwise would not)\nsuch comfortable remission, so gentle and parable a pardon, so ready at\nhand, with so small cost and suit obtained, that I cannot see how he that\nhath any friends amongst them (as I say) or money in his purse, or will at\nleast to ease himself, can any way miscarry or be misaffected, how he\nshould be desperate, in danger of damnation, or troubled in mind. Their\nghostly fathers can so readily apply remedies, so cunningly string and\nunstring, wind and unwind their devotions, play upon their consciences with\nplausible speeches and terrible threats, for their best advantage settle\nand remove, erect with such facility and deject, let in and out, that I\ncannot perceive how any man amongst them should much or often labour of\nthis disease, or finally miscarry. The causes above named must more\nfrequently therefore take hold in others.\n\n\nSUBSECT. IV.--_Symptoms of Despair, Fear, Sorrow, Suspicion, Anxiety,\nHorror of Conscience, Fearful Dreams and Visions_.\n\nAs shoemakers do when they bring home shoes, still cry leather is dearer\nand dearer, may I justly say of those melancholy symptoms: these of despair\nare most violent, tragical, and grievous, far beyond the rest, not to be\nexpressed but negatively, as it is privation of all happiness, not to be\nendured; \"for a wounded spirit who can bear it?\" Prov. xviii. 19. What,\ntherefore, [6736]Timanthes did in his picture of Iphigenia, now ready to be\nsacrificed, when he had painted Chalcas mourning, Ulysses sad, but most\nsorrowful Menelaus; and showed all his art in expressing a variety of\naffections, he covered the maid's father Agamemnon's head with a veil, and\nleft it to every spectator to conceive what he would himself; for that true\npassion and sorrow in _summo gradu_, such as his was, could not by any art\nbe deciphered. What he did in his picture, I will do in describing the\nsymptoms of despair; imagine what thou canst, fear, sorrow, furies, grief,\npain, terror, anger, dismal, ghastly, tedious, irksome, &c. it is not\nsufficient, it comes far short, no tongue can tell, no heart conceive it.\n'Tis an epitome of hell, an extract, a quintessence, a compound, a mixture\nof all feral maladies, tyrannical tortures, plagues, and perplexities.\nThere is no sickness almost but physic provideth a remedy for it; to every\nsore chirurgery will provide a slave; friendship helps poverty; hope of\nliberty easeth imprisonment; suit and favour revoke banishment; authority\nand time wear away reproach: but what physic, what chirurgery, what wealth,\nfavour, authority can relieve, bear out, assuage, or expel a troubled\nconscience? A quiet mind cureth all them, but all they cannot comfort a\ndistressed soul: who can put to silence the voice of desperation? All that\nis single in other melancholy, _Horribile, dirum, pestilens, atrox, ferum_,\nconcur in this, it is more than melancholy in the highest degree; a burning\nfever of the soul; so mad, saith [6737]Jacchinus, by this misery; fear,\nsorrow, and despair, he puts for ordinary symptoms of melancholy. They are\nin great pain and horror of mind, distraction of soul, restless, full of\ncontinual fears, cares, torments, anxieties, they can neither eat, drink,\nnor sleep for them, take no rest,\n\n[6738] \"Perpetua impietas, nec mensae tempore cessat,\n        Exagitat vesana quies, somnique furentes.\"\n\n       \"Neither at bed, nor yet at board,\n        Will any rest despair afford.\"\n\nFear takes away their content, and dries the blood, wasteth the marrow,\nalters their countenance, \"even in their greatest delights, singing,\ndancing, dalliance, they are still\" (saith [6739]Lemnius) \"tortured in\ntheir souls.\" It consumes them to nought, \"I am like a pelican in the\nwilderness (saith David of himself, temporally afflicted), an owl, because\nof thine indignation,\" Psalm cii. 8, 10, and Psalm lv. 4. \"My heart\ntrembleth within me, and the terrors of death have come upon me; fear and\ntrembling are come upon me, &c. at death's door,\" Psalm cvii. 18. \"Their\nsoul abhors all manner of meats.\" Their [6740]sleep is (if it be any)\nunquiet, subject to fearful dreams and terrors. Peter in his bonds slept\nsecure, for he knew God protected him; and Tully makes it an argument of\nRoscius Amerinus' innocency, that he killed not his father, because he so\nsecurely slept. Those martyrs in the primitive church were most\n[6741]cheerful and merry in the midst of their persecutions; but it is far\notherwise with these men, tossed in a sea, and that continually without\nrest or intermission, they can think of nought that is pleasant,\n[6742]\"their conscience will not let them be quiet,\" in perpetual fear,\nanxiety, if they be not yet apprehended, they are in doubt still they shall\nbe ready to betray themselves, as Cain did, he thinks every man will kill\nhim; \"and roar for the grief of heart,\" Psalm xxxviii. 8, as David did; as\nJob did, xx. 3, 21, 22, &c., \"Wherefore is light given to him that is in\nmisery, and life to them that have heavy hearts? which long for death, and\nif it come not, search it more than treasures, and rejoice when they can\nfind the grave.\" They are generally weary of their lives, a trembling heart\nthey have, a sorrowful mind, and little or no rest. _Terror ubique tremor,\ntimor undique et undique terror._ \"Fears, terrors, and affrights in all\nplaces, at all times and seasons.\" _Cibum et potum pertinaciter aversantur\nmulti, nodum in scirpo quaeritantes, et culpam imaginantes ubi nulla est_,\nas Wierus writes _de Lamiis lib. 3. c. 7._ \"they refuse many of them meat\nand drink, cannot rest, aggravating still and supposing grievous offences\nwhere there are none.\" God's heavy wrath is kindled in their souls, and\nnotwithstanding their continual prayers and supplications to Christ Jesus,\nthey have no release or ease at all, but a most intolerable torment, and\ninsufferable anguish of conscience, and that makes them, through\nimpatience, to murmur against God many times, to rave, to blaspheme, turn\natheists, and seek to offer violence to themselves. Deut. xxviii. 65, 68.\n\"In the morning they wish for evening, and for morning in the evening, for\nthe sight of their eyes which they see, and fear of hearts.\" [6743]Marinus\nMercennus, in his comment on Genesis, makes mention of a desperate friend\nof his, whom, amongst others, he came to visit, and exhort to patience,\nthat broke out into most blasphemous atheistical speeches, too fearful to\nrelate, when they wished him to trust in God, _Quis est ille Deus (inquit)\nut serviam illi, quid proderit si oraverim; si praesens est, cur non\nsuccurrit? cur non me carcere, inertia, squalore confectum liberat? quid\nego feci? &c. absit a me hujusmodi Deus_. Another of his acquaintance broke\nout into like atheistical blasphemies, upon his wife's death raved, cursed,\nsaid and did he cared not what. And so for the most part it is with them\nall, many of them, in their extremity, think they hear and see visions,\noutcries, confer with devils, that they are tormented, possessed, and in\nhell-fire, already damned, quite forsaken of God, they have no sense or\nfeeling of mercy, or grace, hope of salvation, their sentence of\ncondemnation is already past, and not to be revoked, the devil will\ncertainly have them. Never was any living creature in such torment before,\nin such a miserable estate, in such distress of mind, no hope, no faith,\npast cure, reprobate, continually tempted to make away themselves.\nSomething talks with them, they spit fire and brimstone, they cannot but\nblaspheme, they cannot repent, believe or think a good thought, so far\ncarried; _ut cogantur ad impia cogitandum etiam contra voluntatem_, said\n[6744]Felix Plater, _ad blasphemiam erga deum, ad multa horrenda\nperpetranda, ad manus violentas sibi inferendas_, &c., and in their\ndistracted fits and desperate humours, to offer violence to others, their\nfamiliar and dear friends sometimes, or to mere strangers, upon very small\nor no occasion; for he that cares not for his own, is master of another\nman's life. They think evil against their wills; that which they abhor\nthemselves, they must needs think, do, and speak. He gives instance in a\npatient of his, that when he would pray, had such evil thoughts still\nsuggested to him, and wicked [6745]meditations. Another instance he hath of\na woman that was often tempted to curse God, to blaspheme and kill herself.\nSometimes the devil (as they say) stands without and talks with them,\nsometimes he is within them, as they think, and there speaks and talks as\nto such as are possessed: so Apollodorus, in Plutarch, thought his heart\nspake within him. There is a most memorable example of [6746]Francis Spira,\nan advocate of Padua, Ann. 1545, that being desperate, by no counsel of\nlearned men could be comforted: he felt (as he said) the pains of hell in\nhis soul; in all other things he discoursed aright, but in this most mad.\nFrismelica, Bullovat, and some other excellent physicians, could neither\nmake him eat, drink, or sleep, no persuasion could ease him. Never pleaded\nany man so well for himself, as this man did against himself, and so he\ndesperately died. Springer, a lawyer, hath written his life. Cardinal\nCrescence died so likewise desperate at Verona, still he thought a black\ndog followed him to his death-bed, no man could drive the dog away,\nSleiden. _com. 23. cap. lib. 3._ Whilst I was writing this Treatise, saith\nMontaltus, _cap. 2. de mel._ [6747]\"A nun came to me for help, well for all\nother matters, but troubled in conscience for five years last past; she is\nalmost mad, and not able to resist, thinks she hath offended God, and is\ncertainly damned.\" Felix Plater hath store of instances of such as thought\nthemselves damned, [6748] forsaken of God, &c. One amongst the rest, that\ndurst not go to church, or come near the Rhine, for fear to make away\nhimself, because then he was most especially tempted. These and such like\nsymptoms are intended and remitted, as the malady itself is more or less;\nsome will hear good counsel, some will not; some desire help, some reject\nall, and will not be eased.\n\n\nSUBSECT. V.--_Prognostics of Despair, Atheism, Blasphemy, violent death,\n&c._\n\nMost part these kind of persons make [6749]away themselves, some are mad,\nblaspheme, curse, deny God, but most offer violence to their own persons,\nand sometimes to others. \"A wounded spirit who can bear?\" Prov. xviii. 14.\nAs Cain, Saul, Achitophel, Judas, blasphemed and died. Bede saith, Pilate\ndied desperate eight years after Christ. [6750]Felix Plater hath collected\nmany examples. [6751]A merchant's wife that was long troubled with such\ntemptations, in the night rose from her bed, and out of the window broke\nher neck into the street: another drowned himself desperate as he was in\nthe Rhine: some cut their throats, many hang themselves. But this needs no\nillustration. It is controverted by some, whether a man so offering\nviolence to himself, dying desperate, may be saved, ay or no? If they die\nso obstinately and suddenly, that they cannot so much as wish for mercy,\nthe worst is to be suspected, because they die impenitent. [6752]If their\ndeath had been a little more lingering, wherein they might have some\nleisure in their hearts to cry for mercy, charity may judge the best;\ndivers have been recovered out of the very act of hanging and drowning\nthemselves, and so brought _ad sanam mentem_, they have been very penitent,\nmuch abhorred their former act, confessed that they have repented in an\ninstant, and cried for mercy in their hearts. If a man put desperate hands\nupon himself, by occasion of madness or melancholy, if he have given\ntestimony before of his regeneration, in regard he doth this not so much\nout of his will, as _ex vi morbi_, we must make the best construction of\nit, as [6753]Turks do, that think all fools and madmen go directly to\nheaven.\n\n\nSUBSECT. VI.--_Cure of Despair by Physic, Good Counsel, Comforts, &c._\n\nExperience teacheth us, that though many die obstinate and wilful in this\nmalady, yet multitudes again are able to resist and overcome, seek for help\nand find comfort, are taken _e faucibus Erebi_, from the chops of hell, and\nout of the devil's paws, though they have by [6754]obligation, given\nthemselves to him. Some out of their own strength, and God's assistance,\n\"Though He kill me,\" (saith Job,) \"yet will I trust in Him,\" out of good\ncounsel, advice and physic. [6755]Bellovacus cured a monk by altering his\nhabit, and course of life: Plater many by physic alone. But for the most\npart they must concur; and they take a wrong course that think to overcome\nthis feral passion by sole physic; and they are as much out, that think to\nwork this effect by good service alone, though both be forcible in\nthemselves, yet _vis unita fortior_, \"they must go hand in hand to this\ndisease:\"--_alterius sic altera poscit opem._ For physic the like course is\nto be taken with this as in other melancholy: diet, air, exercise, all\nthose passions and perturbations of the mind, &c. are to be rectified by\nthe same means. They must not be left solitary, or to themselves, never\nidle, never out of company. Counsel, good comfort is to be applied, as they\nshall see the parties inclined, or to the causes, whether it be loss, fear,\nbe grief, discontent, or some such feral accident, a guilty conscience, or\notherwise by frequent meditation, too grievous an apprehension, and\nconsideration of his former life; by hearing, reading of Scriptures, good\ndivines, good advice and conference, applying God's word to their\ndistressed souls, it must be corrected and counterpoised. Many excellent\nexhortations, phraenetical discourses, are extant to this purpose, for such\nas are any way troubled in mind: Perkins, Greenham, Hayward, Bright,\nAbernethy, Bolton, Culmannus, Helmingius, Caelius Secundus, Nicholas\nLaurentius, are copious on this subject: Azorius, Navarrus, Sayrus, &c.,\nand such as have written cases of conscience amongst our pontifical\nwriters. But because these men's works are not to all parties at hand, so\nparable at all times, I will for the benefit and ease of such as are\nafflicted, at the request of some [6756]friends, recollect out of their\nvoluminous treatises, some few such comfortable speeches, exhortations,\narguments, advice, tending to this subject, and out of God's word, knowing,\nas Culmannus saith upon the like occasion, [6757]\"how unavailable and vain\nmen's councils are to comfort an afflicted conscience, except God's word\nconcur and be annexed, from which comes life, ease, repentance,\" &c.\nPresupposing first that which Beza, Greenham, Perkins, Bolton, give in\ncharge, the parties to whom counsel is given be sufficiently prepared,\nhumbled for their sins, fit for comfort, confessed, tried how they are more\nor less afflicted, how they stand affected, or capable of good advice,\nbefore any remedies be applied: to such therefore as are so thoroughly\nsearched and examined, I address this following discourse.\n\nTwo main antidotes, [6758]Hemmingius observes, opposite to despair, good\nhope out of God's word, to be embraced; perverse security and presumption\nfrom the devil's treachery, to be rejected; _Illa solus animae, haec\npestis_; one saves, the other kills, _occidit animam_, saith Austin, and\ndoth as much harm as despair itself, [6759]Navarrus the casuist reckons up\nten special cures out of Anton. _1. part. Tit. 3. cap. 10._ 1. God. 2.\nPhysic. 3. [6760]Avoiding such objects as have caused it. 4. Submission of\nhimself to other men's judgments. 5. Answer of all objections, &c. All\nwhich Cajetan, Gerson, _lib. de vit. spirit._ Sayrus, _lib. 1. cons. cap.\n14._ repeat and approve out of Emanuel Roderiques, _cap. 51 et 52._\nGreenham prescribes six special rules, Culmannus seven. First, to\nacknowledge all help come from God. 2. That the cause of their present\nmisery is sin. 3. To repent and be heartily sorry for their sins. 4. To\npray earnestly to God they may be eased. 5. To expect and implore the\nprayers of the church, and good men's advice. 6. Physic. 7. To commend\nthemselves to God, and rely upon His mercy: others, otherwise, but all to\nthis effect. But forasmuch as most men in this malady are spiritually sick,\nvoid of reason almost, overborne by their miseries, and too deep an\napprehension of their sins, they cannot apply themselves to good counsel,\npray, believe, repent, we must, as much as in us lies, occur and help their\npeculiar infirmities, according to their several causes and symptoms, as we\nshall find them distressed and complain.\n\nThe main matter which terrifies and torments most that are troubled in\nmind, is the enormity of their offences, the intolerable burthen of their\nsins, God's heavy wrath and displeasure so deeply apprehended, that they\naccount themselves reprobates, quite forsaken of God, already damned, past\nall hope of grace, incapable of mercy, _diaboli mancipia_, slaves of sin,\nand their offences so great they cannot be forgiven. But these men must\nknow there is no sin so heinous which is not pardonable in itself, no crime\nso great but by God's mercy it may be forgiven. \"Where sin aboundeth, grace\naboundeth much more,\" Rom. v. 20. And what the Lord said unto Paul in his\nextremity, 2 Cor. xi. 9. \"My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is\nmade perfect through weakness:\" concerns every man in like case. His\npromises are made indefinite to all believers, generally spoken to all\ntouching remission of sins that are truly penitent, grieved for their\noffences, and desire to be reconciled, Matt. ix. 12, 13, \"I came not to\ncall the righteous but sinners to repentance,\" that is, such as are truly\ntouched in conscience for their sins. Again, Matt. xi. 28, \"Come unto me\nall ye that are heavy laden, and I will ease you.\" Ezek. xviii. 27, \"At\nwhat time soever a sinner shall repent him of his sins from the bottom of\nhis heart, I will blot out all his wickedness out of my remembrance saith\nthe Lord.\" Isaiah xliii. 25, \"I, even I, am He that put away thine iniquity\nfor mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.\" \"As a father\" (saith\nDavid Psal. ciii. 13) \"hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord\ncompassion on them that fear him.\" And will receive them again as the\nprodigal son was entertained, Luke xv., if they shall so come with tears in\ntheir eyes, and a penitent heart. _Peccator agnoscat, Deus ignoscit._ \"The\nLord is full of compassion and mercy, slow to anger, of great kindness,\"\nPsal. ciii. 8. \"He will not always chide, neither keep His anger for ever,\"\n9. \"As high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is His mercy towards\nthem that fear Him,\" 11. \"As far as the East is from the West, so far hath\nHe removed our sins from us,\" 12. Though Cain cry out in the anguish of his\nsoul, my punishment is greater than I can bear, 'tis not so; thou liest,\nCain (saith Austin), \"God's mercy is greater than thy sins. His mercy is\nabove all His works,\" Psal. cxlv. 9, able to satisfy for all men's sins,\n_antilutron_, 1 Tim. ii. 6. His mercy is a panacea, a balsam for an\nafflicted soul, a sovereign medicine, an alexipharmacum for all sins, a\ncharm for the devil; his mercy was great to Solomon, to Manasseh, to Peter,\ngreat to all offenders, and whosoever thou art, it may be so to thee. For\nwhy should God bid us pray (as Austin infers) \"Deliver us from all evil,\"\n_nisi ipse misericors perseveraret_, if He did not intend to help us? He\ntherefore that [6761]doubts of the remission of his sins, denies God's\nmercy, and doth Him injury, saith Austin. Yea, but thou repliest, I am a\nnotorious sinner, mine offences are not so great as infinite. Hear\nFulgentius, [6762]\"God's invincible goodness cannot be overcome by sin, His\ninfinite mercy cannot be terminated by any: the multitude of His mercy is\nequivalent to His magnitude.\" Hear [6763]Chrysostom, \"Thy malice may be\nmeasured, but God's mercy cannot be defined; thy malice is circumscribed,\nHis mercies infinite.\" As a drop of water is to the sea, so are thy\nmisdeeds to His mercy: nay, there is no such proportion to be given; for\nthe sea, though great, yet may be measured, but God's mercy cannot be\ncircumscribed. Whatsoever thy sins be then in quantity or quality,\nmultitude or magnitude, fear them not, distrust not. I speak not this,\nsaith [6764]Chrysostom, \"to make thee secure and negligent, but to cheer\nthee up.\" Yea but, thou urgest again, I have little comfort of this which\nis said, it concerns me not: _Inanis poenitentia quam sequens culpa\ncoinquinat_, 'tis to no purpose for me to repent, and to do worse than ever\nI did before, to persevere in sin, and to return to my lusts as a dog to\nhis vomit, or a swine to the mire: [6765]to what end is it to ask\nforgiveness of my sins, and yet daily to sin again and again, to do evil\nout of a habit? I daily and hourly offend in thought, word, and deed, in a\nrelapse by mine own weakness and wilfulness: my _bonus genius_, my good\nprotecting angel is gone, I am fallen from that I was or would be, worse\nand worse, \"my latter end is worse than my beginning:\" _Si quotidiae\npeccas, quotidie_, saith Chrysostom, _poenitentiam age_, if thou daily\noffend, daily repent: [6766]\"if twice, thrice, a hundred, a hundred\nthousand times, twice, thrice, a hundred thousand times repent.\" As they do\nby an old house that is out of repair, still mend some part or other; so do\nby thy soul, still reform some vice, repair it by repentance, call to Him\nfor grace, and thou shalt have it; \"For we are freely justified by His\ngrace,\" Rom. iii. 24. If thine enemy repent, as our Saviour enjoined Peter,\nforgive him seventy-seven times; and why shouldst thou think God will not\nforgive thee? Why should the enormity of thy sins trouble thee? God can do\nit, he will do it. \"My conscience\" (saith [6767]Anselm) \"dictates to me\nthat I deserve damnation, my repentance will not suffice for satisfaction:\nbut thy mercy, O Lord, quite overcometh all my transgressions.\" The gods\nonce (as the poets feign) with a gold chain would pull Jupiter out of\nheaven, but all they together could not stir him, and yet he could draw and\nturn them as he would himself; maugre all the force and fury of these\ninfernal fiends, and crying sins, \"His grace is sufficient.\" Confer the\ndebt and the payment; Christ and Adam; sin, and the cure of it; the disease\nand the medicine; confer the sick man to his physician, and thou shalt soon\nperceive that his power is infinitely beyond it. God is better able, as\n[6768]Bernard informeth us, \"to help, than sin to do us hurt; Christ is\nbetter able to save, than the devil to destroy.\" [6769]If he be a skilful\nPhysician, as Fulgentius adds, \"he can cure all diseases; if merciful, he\nwill.\" _Non est perfecta bonitas a qua non omnis malitia vincitur_, His\ngoodness is not absolute and perfect, if it be not able to overcome all\nmalice. Submit thyself unto Him, as St. Austin adviseth, [6770]\"He knoweth\nbest what he doth; and be not so much pleased when he sustains thee, as\npatient when he corrects thee; he is omnipotent, and can cure all diseases\nwhen he sees his own time.\" He looks down from heaven upon earth, that he\nmay hear the \"mourning of prisoners, and deliver the children of death,\"\nPsal. cii. 19. 20. \"And though our sins be as red as scarlet, He can make\nthem as white as snow,\" Isai. i. 18. Doubt not of this, or ask how it shall\nbe done: He is all-sufficient that promiseth; _qui fecit mundum de\nimmundo_, saith Chrysostom, he that made a fair world of nought, can do\nthis and much more for his part: do thou only believe, trust in him, rely\non him, be penitent and heartily sorry for thy sins. Repentance is a\nsovereign remedy for all sins, a spiritual wing to rear us, a charm for our\nmiseries, a protecting amulet to expel sin's venom, an attractive loadstone\nto draw God's mercy and graces unto us. [6771]_Peccatum vulnus, poenitentia\nmedicinam_: sin made the breach, repentance must help it; howsoever thine\noffence came, by error, sloth, obstinacy, ignorance, _exitur per\npoenitentiam_, this is the sole means to be relieved. [6772]Hence comes our\nhope of safety, by this alone sinners are saved, God is provoked to mercy.\n\"This unlooseth all that is bound, enlighteneth darkness, mends that is\nbroken, puts life to that which was desperately dying:\" makes no respect of\noffences, or of persons. [6773]\"This doth not repel a fornicator, reject a\ndrunkard, resist a proud fellow, turn away an idolater, but entertains all,\ncommunicates itself to all.\" Who persecuted the church more than Paul,\noffended more than Peter? and yet by repentance (saith Curysologus) they\ngot both _Magisterium et ministerium sanctitatis_, the Magistery of\nholiness. The prodigal son went far, but by repentance he came home at\nlast. [6774]\"This alone will turn a wolf into a sheep, make a publican a\npreacher, turn a thorn into an olive, make a debauched fellow religious,\" a\nblasphemer sing halleluja, make Alexander the coppersmith truly devout,\nmake a devil a saint. [6775]\"And him that polluted his mouth with\ncalumnies, lying, swearing, and filthy tunes and tones, to purge his throat\nwith divine Psalms.\" Repentance will effect prodigious cures, make a\nstupend metamorphosis. \"A hawk came into the ark, and went out again a\nhawk; a lion came in, went out a lion; a bear, a bear; a wolf, a wolf; but\nif a hawk came into this sacred temple of repentance, he will go forth a\ndove\" (saith [6776]Chrysostom), \"a wolf go out a sheep, a lion a lamb.\n[6777]This gives sight to the blind, legs to the lame, cures all diseases,\nconfers grace, expels vice, inserts virtue, comforts and fortifies the\nsoul.\" Shall I say, let thy sin be what it will, do but repent, it is\nsufficient. [6778]_Quem poenitet peccasse pene est innocens._ 'Tis true\nindeed and all-sufficient this, they do confess, if they could repent; but\nthey are obdurate, they have cauterised consciences, they are in a\nreprobate sense, they cannot think a good thought, they cannot hope for\ngrace, pray, believe, repent, or be sorry for their sins, they find no\ngrief for sin in themselves, but rather a delight, no groaning of spirit,\nbut are carried headlong to their own destruction, \"heaping wrath to\nthemselves against the day of wrath,\" Rom. ii. 5. 'Tis a grievous case this\nI do yield, and yet not to be despaired; God of his bounty and mercy calls\nall to repentance, Rom. ii. 4, thou mayst be called at length, restored,\ntaken to His grace, as the thief upon the cross, at the last hour, as Mary\nMagdalene and many other sinners have been, that were buried in sin. \"God\"\n(saith [6779]Fulgentius) \"is delighted in the conversion of a sinner, he\nsets no time;\" _prolixitas temporis Deo non praejudicat, aut gravitas\npeccati_, deferring of time or grievousness of sin, do not prejudicate his\ngrace, things past and to come are all one to Him, as present: 'tis never\ntoo late to repent. [6780]\"This heaven of repentance is still open for all\ndistressed souls;\" and howsoever as yet no signs appear, thou mayst repent\nin good time. Hear a comfortable speech of St. Austin, [6781]\"Whatsoever\nthou shall do, how great a sinner soever, thou art yet living; if God would\nnot help thee, he would surely take thee away; but in sparing thy life, he\ngives thee leisure, and invites thee to repentance.\" Howsoever as yet, I\nsay, thou perceivest no fruit, no feeling, findest no likelihood of it in\nthyself, patiently abide the Lord's good leisure, despair not, or think\nthou art a reprobate; He came to call sinners to repentance, Luke v. 32, of\nwhich number thou art one; He came to call thee, and in his time will\nsurely call thee. And although as yet thou hast no inclination to pray, to\nrepent, thy faith be cold and dead, and thou wholly averse from all Divine\nfunctions, yet it may revive, as trees are dead in winter, but flourish in\nthe spring! these virtues may lie hid in thee for the present, yet\nhereafter show themselves, and peradventure already bud, howsoever thou\ndost not perceive. 'Tis Satan's policy to plead against, suppress and\naggravate, to conceal those sparks of faith in thee. Thou dost not believe,\nthou sayest, yet thou wouldst believe if thou couldst, 'tis thy desire to\nbelieve; then pray, [6782]\"Lord help mine unbelief:\" and hereafter thou\nshall certainly believe: [6783]_Dabitur sitienti_, it shall be given to him\nthat thirsteth. Thou canst not yet repent, hereafter thou shall; a black\ncloud of sin as yet obnubilates thy soul, terrifies thy conscience, but\nthis cloud may conceive a rainbow at the last, and be quite dissipated by\nrepentance. Be of good cheer; a child is rational in power, not in act; and\nso art thou penitent in affection, though not yet in action. 'Tis thy\ndesire to please God, to be heartily sorry; comfort thyself, no time is\noverpast, 'tis never too late. A desire to repent is repentance itself,\nthough not in nature, yet in God's acceptance; a willing mind is\nsufficient. \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness,\"\nMatt. v. 6. He that is destitute of God's grace, and wisheth for it, shall\nhave it. \"The Lord\" (saith David, Psal. x. 17) \"will hear the desire of the\npoor,\" that is, such as are in distress of body and mind. 'Tis true thou\ncanst not as yet grieve for thy sin, thou hast no feeling of faith, I\nyield; yet canst thou grieve thou dost not grieve? It troubles thee, I am\nsure, thine heart should be so impenitent and hard, thou wouldst have it\notherwise; 'tis thy desire to grieve, to repent, and to believe. Thou\nlovest God's children and saints in the meantime, hatest them not,\npersecutest them not, but rather wishest thyself a true professor, to be as\nthey are, as thou thyself hast been heretofore; which is an evident token\nthou art in no such desperate case. 'Tis a good sign of thy conversion, thy\nsins are pardonable, thou art, or shalt surely be reconciled. \"The Lord is\nnear them that are of a contrite heart,\" Luke iv. 18. [6784]A true desire\nof mercy in the want of mercy, is mercy itself; a desire of grace in the\nwant of grace, is grace itself; a constant and earnest desire to believe,\nrepent, and to be reconciled to God, if it be in a touched heart, is an\nacceptation of God, a reconciliation, faith and repentance itself. For it\nis not thy faith and repentance, as [6785]Chrysostom truly teacheth, that\nis available, but God's mercy that is annexed to it, He accepts the will\nfor the deed: so that I conclude, to feel in ourselves the want of grace,\nand to be grieved for it, is grace itself. I am troubled with fear my sins\nare not forgiven, Careless objects: but Bradford answers they are; \"For God\nhath given thee a penitent and believing heart, that is, a heart which\ndesireth to repent and believe; for such an one is taken of him (he\naccepting the will for the deed) for a truly penitent and believing heart.\"\n\nAll this is true thou repliest, but yet it concerns not thee, 'tis verified\nin ordinary offenders, in common sins, but thine are of a higher strain,\neven against the Holy Ghost himself, irremissible sins, sins of the first\nmagnitude, written with a pen of iron, engraven with a point of a diamond.\nThou art worse than a pagan, infidel, Jew, or Turk, for thou art an\napostate and more, thou hast voluntarily blasphemed, renounced God and all\nreligion, thou art worse than Judas himself, or they that crucified Christ:\nfor they did offend out of ignorance, but thou hast thought in thine heart\nthere is no God. Thou hast given thy soul to the devil, as witches and\nconjurors do, _explicite_ and _implicite_, by compact, band and obligation\n(a desperate, a fearful case) to satisfy thy lust, or to be revenged of\nthine enemies, thou didst never pray, come to church, hear, read, or do any\ndivine duties with any devotion, but for formality and fashion's sake, with\na kind of reluctance, 'twas troublesome and painful to thee to perform any\nsuch thing, _praeter voluntatem_, against thy will. Thou never mad'st any\nconscience of lying, swearing, bearing false witness, murder, adultery,\nbribery, oppression, theft, drunkenness, idolatry, but hast ever done all\nduties for fear of punishment, as they were most advantageous, and to thine\nown ends, and committed all such notorious sins, with an extraordinary\ndelight, hating that thou shouldst love, and loving that thou shouldst\nhate. Instead of faith, fear and love of God, repentance, &c., blasphemous\nthoughts have been ever harboured in his mind, even against God himself,\nthe blessed Trinity; the [6786]Scripture false, rude, harsh, immethodical:\nheaven, hell, resurrection, mere toys and fables, [6787]incredible,\nimpossible, absurd, vain, ill contrived; religion, policy, and human\ninvention, to keep men in obedience, or for profit, invented by priests and\nlawgivers to that purpose. If there be any such supreme power, he takes no\nnotice of our doings, hears not our prayers, regardeth them not, will not,\ncannot help, or else he is partial, an excepter of persons, author of sin,\na cruel, a destructive God, to create our souls, and destinate them to\neternal damnation, to make us worse than our dogs and horses, why doth he\nnot govern things better, protect good men, root out wicked livers? why do\nthey prosper and flourish? as she raved in the [6788]tragedy--_pellices\ncaelum tenent_, there they shine, _Suasque Perseus aureas stellas habet_,\nwhere is his providence? how appears it?\n\n[6789] \"Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet, at Cato parvo,\n        Pomponius nullo, quis putet esse Deos.\"\n\nWhy doth he suffer Turks to overcome Christians, the enemy to triumph over\nhis church, paganism to domineer in all places as it doth, heresies to\nmultiply, such enormities to be committed, and so many such bloody wars,\nmurders, massacres, plagues, feral diseases! why doth he not make us all\ngood, able, sound? why makes he [6790]venomous creatures, rocks, sands,\ndeserts, this earth itself the muck-hill of the world, a prison, a house of\ncorrection? [6791]_Mentimur regnare Jovem_, &c., with many such horrible\nand execrable conceits, not fit to be uttered; _Terribilia de fide,\nhorribilia de Divinitate._ They cannot some of them but think evil, they\nare compelled _volentes nolentes_, to blaspheme, especially when they come\nto church and pray, read, &c., such foul and prodigious suggestions come\ninto their hearts.\n\nThese are abominable, unspeakable offences, and most opposite to God,\n_tentationes foedae, et impiae_, yet in this case, he or they that shall be\ntempted and so affected, must know, that no man living is free from such\nthoughts in part, or at some times, the most divine spirits have been so\ntempted in some sort, evil custom, omission of holy exercises, ill company,\nidleness, solitariness, melancholy, or depraved nature, and the devil is\nstill ready to corrupt, trouble, and divert our souls, to suggest such\nblasphemous thoughts into our fantasies, ungodly, profane, monstrous and\nwicked conceits: If they come from Satan, they are more speedy, fearful and\nviolent, the parties cannot avoid them: they are more frequent, I say, and\nmonstrous when they come; for the devil he is a spirit, and hath means and\nopportunities to mingle himself with our spirits, and sometimes more slyly,\nsometimes more abruptly and openly, to suggest such devilish thoughts into\nour hearts; he insults and domineers in melancholy distempered fantasies\nand persons especially; melancholy is _balneum, diaboli_, as Serapio holds,\nthe devil's bath, and invites him to come to it. As a sick man frets, raves\nin his fits, speaks and doth he knows not what, the devil violently compels\nsuch crazed souls to think such damned thoughts against their wills, they\ncannot but do it; sometimes more continuate, or by fits, he takes his\nadvantage, as the subject is less able to resist, he aggravates,\nextenuates, affirms, denies, damns, confounds the spirits, troubles heart,\nbrain, humours, organs, senses, and wholly domineers in their imaginations.\nIf they proceed from themselves, such thoughts, they are remiss and\nmoderate, not so violent and monstrous, not so frequent. The devil commonly\nsuggests things opposite to nature, opposite to God and his word, impious,\nabsurd, such as a man would never of himself, or could not conceive, they\nstrike terror and horror into the parties' own hearts. For if he or they be\nasked whether they do approve of such like thoughts or no, they answer (and\ntheir own souls truly dictate as much) they abhor them as much as hell and\nthe devil himself, they would fain think otherwise if they could; he hath\nthought otherwise, and with all his soul desires so to think again; he doth\nresist, and hath some good motions intermixed now and then: so that such\nblasphemous, impious, unclean thoughts, are not his own, but the devil's;\nthey proceed not from him, but from a crazed phantasy, distempered humours,\nblack fumes which offend his brain: [6792]they are thy crosses, the devil's\nsins, and he shall answer for them, he doth enforce thee to do that which\nthou dost abhor, and didst never give consent to: and although he hath\nsometimes so slyly set upon thee, and so far prevailed, as to make thee in\nsome sort to assent to such wicked thoughts, to delight in, yet they have\nnot proceeded from a confirmed will in thee, but are of that nature which\nthou dost afterwards reject and abhor. Therefore be not overmuch troubled\nand dismayed with such kind of suggestions, at least if they please thee\nnot, because they are not thy personal sins, for which thou shalt incur the\nwrath of God, or his displeasure: contemn, neglect them, let them go as\nthey come, strive not too violently, or trouble thyself too much, but as\nour Saviour said to Satan in like case, say thou, avoid Satan, I detest\nthee and them. _Satanae est mala ingerere_ (saith Austin) _nostrum non\nconsentire_: as Satan labours to suggest, so must we strive not to give\nconsent, and it will be sufficient: the more anxious and solicitous thou\nart, the more perplexed, the more thou shalt otherwise be troubled and\nentangled. Besides, they must know this, all so molested and distempered,\nthat although these be most execrable and grievous sins, they are\npardonable yet, through God's mercy and goodness, they may be forgiven, if\nthey be penitent and sorry for them. Paul himself confesseth, Rom. xvii.\n19. \"He did not the good he would do, but the evil which he would not do;\n'tis not I, but sin that dwelleth in me.\" 'Tis not thou, but Satan's\nsuggestions, his craft and subtlety, his malice: comfort thyself then if\nthou be penitent and grieved, or desirous to be so, these heinous sins\nshall not be laid to thy charge; God's mercy is above all sins, which if\nthou do not finally contemn, without doubt thou shalt be saved. [6793]\"No\nman sins against the Holy Ghost, but he that wilfully and finally\nrenounceth Christ, and contemneth him and his word to the last, without\nwhich there is no salvation, from which grievous sin, God of his infinite\nmercy deliver us.\" Take hold of this to be thy comfort, and meditate withal\non God's word, labour to pray, to repent, to be renewed in mind, \"keep\nthine heart with all diligence.\" Prov. iv. 13, resist the devil, and he\nwill fly from thee, pour out thy soul unto the Lord with sorrowful Hannah,\n\"pray continually,\" as Paul enjoins, and as David did, Psalm i. \"meditate\non his law day and night.\"\n\nYea, but this meditation is that mars all, and mistaken makes many men far\nworse, misconceiving all they read or hear, to their own overthrow; the\nmore they search and read Scriptures, or divine treatises, the more they\npuzzle themselves, as a bird in a net, the more they are entangled and\nprecipitated into this preposterous gulf: \"Many are called, but few are\nchosen,\" Matt. xx. 16. and xxii. 14. with such like places of Scripture\nmisinterpreted strike them with horror, they doubt presently whether they\nbe of this number or no: God's eternal decree of predestination, absolute\nreprobation, and such fatal tables, they form to their own ruin, and\nimpinge upon this rock of despair. How shall they be assured of their\nsalvation, by what signs? \"If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall\nthe ungodly and sinners appear?\" 1 Pet. iv. 18. Who knows, saith Solomon,\nwhether he be elect? This grinds their souls, how shall they discern they\nare not reprobates? But I say again, how shall they discern they are? From\nthe devil can be no certainty, for he is a liar from the beginning; if he\nsuggests any such thing, as too frequently he doth, reject him as a\ndeceiver, an enemy of human kind, dispute not with him, give no credit to\nhim, obstinately refuse him, as St. Anthony did in the wilderness, whom the\ndevil set upon in several shapes, or as the collier did, so do thou by him.\nFor when the devil tempted him with the weakness of his faith, and told him\nhe could not be saved, as being ignorant in the principles of religion, and\nurged him moreover to know what he believed, what he thought of such and\nsuch points and mysteries: the collier told him, he believed as the church\ndid; but what (said the devil again) doth the church believe? as I do (said\nthe collier); and what's that thou believest? as the church doth, &c., when\nthe devil could get no other answer, he left him. If Satan summon thee to\nanswer, send him to Christ: he is thy liberty, thy protector against cruel\ndeath, raging sin, that roaring lion, he is thy righteousness, thy Saviour,\nand thy life. Though he say, thou art not of the number of the elect, a\nreprobate, forsaken of God, hold thine own still, _hic murus aheneus esto_,\nlet this be as a bulwark, a brazen wall to defend thee, stay thyself in\nthat certainty of faith; let that be thy comfort, Christ will protect thee,\nvindicate thee, thou art one of his flock, he will triumph over the law,\nvanquish death, overcome the devil, and destroy hell. If he say thou art\nnone of the elect, no believer, reject him, defy him, thou hast thought\notherwise, and mayst so be resolved again; comfort thyself; this persuasion\ncannot come from the devil, and much less can it be grounded from thyself?\nmen are liars, and why shouldst thou distrust? A denying Peter, a\npersecuting Paul, an adulterous cruel David, have been received; an\napostate Solomon may be converted; no sin at all but impenitency, can give\ntestimony of final reprobation. Why shouldst thou then distrust, misdoubt\nthyself, upon what ground, what suspicion? This opinion alone of\nparticularity? Against that, and for the certainty of election and\nsalvation on the other side, see God's good will toward men, hear how\ngenerally his grace is proposed to him, and him, and them, each man in\nparticular, and to all. 1 Tim. ii. 4. \"God will that all men be saved, and\ncome to the knowledge of the truth.\" 'Tis a universal promise, \"God sent\nnot his son into the world to condemn the world, but that through him the\nworld might be saved.\" John iii. 17. \"He that acknowledged himself a man in\nthe world, must likewise acknowledge he is of that number that is to be\nsaved.\" Ezek. xxxiii. 11, \"I will not the death of a sinner, but that he\nrepent and live:\" But thou art a sinner; therefore he will not thy death.\n\"This is the will of him that sent me, that every man that believeth in the\nSon, should have everlasting life.\" John vi. 40. \"He would have no man\nperish, but all come to repentance,\" 2 Pet. iii. 9. Besides, remission of\nsins is to be preached, not to a few, but universally to all men, \"Go\ntherefore and tell all nations, baptising them,\" &c. Matt. xxviii. 19. \"Go\ninto all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature,\" Mark xvi. 15.\nNow there cannot be contradictory wills in God, he will have all saved, and\nnot all, how can this stand together? be secure then, believe, trust in\nhim, hope well and be saved. Yea, that's the main matter, how shall I\nbelieve or discern my security from carnal presumption? my faith is weak\nand faint, I want those signs and fruits of sanctification, [6794]sorrow\nfor sin, thirsting for grace, groanings of the spirit, love of Christians\nas Christians, avoiding occasion of sin, endeavour of new obedience,\ncharity, love of God, perseverance. Though these signs be languishing in\nthee, and not seated in thine heart, thou must not therefore be dejected or\nterrified; the effects of the faith and spirit are not yet so fully felt in\nthee; conclude not therefore thou art a reprobate, or doubt of thine\nelection, because the elect themselves are without them, before their\nconversion. Thou mayst in the Lord's good time be converted; some are\ncalled at the eleventh hour. Use, I say, the means of thy conversion,\nexpect the Lord's leisure, if not yet called, pray thou mayst be, or at\nleast wish and desire thou. mayst be.\n\nNotwithstanding all this which might be said to this effect, to ease their\nafflicted minds, what comfort our best divines can afford in this case,\nZanchius, Beza, &c. This furious curiosity, needless speculation, fruitless\nmeditation about election, reprobation, free will, grace, such places of\nScripture preposterously conceived, torment still, and crucify the souls of\ntoo many, and set all the world together by the ears. To avoid which\ninconveniences, and to settle their distressed minds, to mitigate those\ndivine aphorisms, (though in another extreme some) our late Arminians have\nrevived that plausible doctrine of universal grace, which many fathers, our\nlate Lutheran and modern papists do still maintain, that we have free will\nof ourselves, and that grace is common to all that will believe. Some\nagain, though less orthodoxal, will have a far greater part saved than\nshall be damned, (as [6795]Caelius Secundus stiffly maintains in his book,\n_De amplitudine regni coelestis_, or some impostor under his name)\n_beatorum numerus multo major quam damnatorum._ [6796]He calls that other\ntenet of special [6797]\"election and reprobation, a prejudicate, envious\nand malicious opinion, apt to draw all men to desperation. Many are called,\nfew chosen,\" &c. He opposeth some opposite parts of Scripture to it,\n\"Christ came into the world to save sinners,\" &c. And four especial\narguments he produceth, one from God's power. If more be damned than saved,\nhe erroneously concludes, [6798]the devil hath the greater sovereignty! for\nwhat is power but to protect? and majesty consists in multitude. \"If the\ndevil have the greater part, where is his mercy, where is his power? how is\nhe _Deus Optimus Maximus, misericors_? &c., where is his greatness, where\nhis goodness?\" He proceeds, [6799]\"We account him a murderer that is\naccessory only, or doth not help when he can; which may not be supposed of\nGod without great offence, because he may do what he will, and is otherwise\naccessory, and the author of sin. The nature of good is to be communicated,\nGod is good, and will not then be contracted in his goodness: for how is he\nthe father of mercy and comfort, if his good concern but a few? O envious\nand unthankful men to think otherwise! [6800]Why should we pray to God that\nare Gentiles, and thank him for his mercies and benefits, that hath damned\nus all innocuous for Adam's offence, one man's offence, one small offence,\neating of an apple? why should we acknowledge him for our governor that\nhath wholly neglected the salvation of our souls, contemned us, and sent no\nprophets or instructors to teach us, as he hath done to the Hebrews?\" So\nJulian the apostate objects. Why should these Christians (Caelius urgeth)\nreject us and appropriate God unto themselves, _Deum illum suum unicum_,\n&c. But to return to our forged Caelius. At last he comes to that, he will\nhave those saved that never heard of, or believed in Christ, _ex puris\nnaturalibus_, with the Pelagians, and proves it out of Origen and others.\n\"They\" (saith [6801]Origen) \"that never heard God's word, are to be excused\nfor their ignorance; we may not think God will be so hard, angry, cruel or\nunjust as to condemn any man _indicta causa_.\" They alone (he holds) are in\nthe state of damnation that refuse Christ's mercy and grace, when it is\noffered. Many worthy Greeks and Romans, good moral honest men, that kept\nthe law of nature, did to others as they would be done to themselves, as\ncertainly saved, he concludes, as they were that lived uprightly before the\nlaw of Moses. They were acceptable in. God's sight, as Job was, the Magi,\nthe queen of Sheba, Darius of Persia, Socrates, Aristides, Cato, Curius,\nTully, Seneca, and many other philosophers, upright livers, no matter of\nwhat religion, as Cornelius, out of any nation, so that he live honestly,\ncall on God, trust in him, fear him, he shall be saved. This opinion was\nformerly maintained by the Valentinian and Basiledian heretics, revived of\nlate in [6802]Turkey, of what sect Rustan Bassa was patron, defended by\n[6803]Galeatius [6804]Erasmus, by Zuinglius _in exposit. fidei ad Regem\nGalliae_, whose tenet Bullinger vindicates, and Gualter approves in a just\napology with many arguments. There be many Jesuits that follow these\nCalvinists in this behalf, Franciscus Buchsius Moguntinus, Andradius\nConsil. Trident, many schoolmen that out of the 1 Rom. v. 18. 19. are\nverily persuaded that those good works of the Gentiles did so far please\nGod, that they might _vitam aeternam promereri_, and be saved in the end.\nSesellius, and Benedictus Justinianus in his comment on the first of the\nRomans, Mathias Ditmarsh the politician, with many others, hold a\nmediocrity, they may be _salute non indigni_ but they will not absolutely\ndecree it. Hofmannus, a Lutheran professor of Helmstad, and many of his\nfollowers, with most of our church, and papists, are stiff against it.\nFranciscus Collius hath fully censured all opinions in his Five Books, _de\nPaganorum animabus post mortem_, and amply dilated this question, which\nwhoso will may peruse. But to return to my author, his conclusion is, that\nnot only wicked livers, blasphemers, reprobates, and such as reject God's\ngrace, \"but that the devils themselves shall be saved at last,\" as\n[6805]Origen himself long since delivered in his works, and our late\n[6806]Socinians defend, Ostorodius, _cap. 41. institut._ Smaltius, &c.\nThose terms of all and for ever in Scripture, are not eternal, but only\ndenote a longer time, which by many examples they prove. The world shall\nend like a comedy, and we shall meet at last in heaven, and live in bliss\naltogether, or else in conclusion, _in nihil evanescere._ For how can he be\nmerciful that shall condemn any creature to eternal unspeakable punishment,\nfor one small temporary fault, all posterity, so many myriads for one and\nanother man's offence, _quid meruistis oves_? But these absurd paradoxes\nare exploded by our church, we teach otherwise. That this vocation,\npredestination, election, reprobation, _non ex corrupta massa, praeviso,\nfide_, as our Arminians, or _ex praevisis operibus_, as our papists, _non\nex praeteritione_, but God's absolute decree _ante mundum creatum_, (as\nmany of our church hold) was from the beginning, before the foundation of\nthe world was laid, or _homo conditus_, (or from Adam's fall, as others\nwill, _homo lapsus objectum est reprobationis_) with _perseverantia\nsanctorum_, we must be certain of our salvation, we may fall but not\nfinally, which our Arminians will not admit. According to his immutable,\neternal, just decree and counsel of saving men and angels, God calls all,\nand would have all to be saved according to the efficacy of vocation: all\nare invited, but only the elect apprehended: the rest that are unbelieving,\nimpenitent, whom God in his just judgment leaves to be punished for their\nsins, are in a reprobate sense; yet we must not determine who are such,\ncondemn ourselves or others, because we have a universal invitation; all\nare commanded to believe, and we know not how soon or how late our end may\nbe received. I might have said more of this subject; but forasmuch as it is\na forbidden question, and in the preface or declaration to the articles of\nthe church, printed 1633, to avoid factions and altercations, we that are\nuniversity divines especially, are prohibited \"all curious search, to print\nor preach, or draw the article aside by our own sense and comments upon\npain of ecclesiastical censure.\" I will surcease, and conclude with\n[6807]Erasmus of such controversies: _Pugnet qui volet, ego censeo leges\nmajorum reverenter suscipiendas, et religiose observandas, velut a Deo\nprofectas; nec esse tutum, nec esse pium, de potestate publica sinistram\nconcipere aut serere suspicionem. Et siquid est tyrannidis, quod tamen non\ncogat ad impietatem, satius est ferre, quam seditiose reluctari._\n\nBut to my former task. The last main torture and trouble of a distressed\nmind, is not so much this doubt of election, and that the promises of grace\nare smothered and extinct in them, nay quite blotted out, as they suppose,\nbut withal God's heavy wrath, a most intolerable pain and grief of heart\nseizeth on them: to their thinking they are already damned, they suffer the\npains of hell, and more than possibly can be expressed, they smell\nbrimstone, talk familiarly with devils, hear and see chimeras, prodigious,\nuncouth shapes, bears, owls, antiques, black dogs, fiends, hideous\noutcries, fearful noises, shrieks, lamentable complaints, they are\npossessed, [6808]and through impatience they roar and howl, curse,\nblaspheme, deny God, call his power in question, abjure religion, and are\nstill ready to offer violence unto themselves, by hanging, drowning, &c.\nNever any miserable wretch from the beginning of the world was in such a\nwoeful case. To such persons I oppose God's mercy and his justice; _Judicia\nDei occulta, non injusta_: his secret counsel and just judgment, by which\nhe spares some, and sore afflicts others again in this life; his judgment\nis to be adored, trembled at, not to be searched or inquired after by\nmortal men: he hath reasons reserved to himself, which our frailty cannot\napprehend. He may punish all if he will, and that justly for sin; in that\nhe doth it in some, is to make a way for his mercy that they repent and be\nsaved, to heal them, to try them, exercise their patience, and make them\ncall upon him, to confess their sins and pray unto him, as David did, Psalm\ncxix. 137. \"Righteous art thou, O Lord, and just are thy judgments.\" As the\npoor publican, Luke xviii. 13. \"Lord have mercy upon me a miserable\nsinner.\" To put confidence and have an assured hope in him, as Job had,\nxiii. 15. \"Though he kill me I will trust In him:\" _Ure, seca, occide O\nDomine_, (saith Austin) _modo serves animam_, kill, cut in pieces, burn my\nbody (O Lord) to save my soul. A small sickness; one lash of affliction, a\nlittle misery, many times will more humiliate a man, sooner convert, bring\nhim home to know himself, than all those paraenetical discourses, the whole\ntheory of philosophy, law, physic, and divinity, or a world of instances\nand examples. So that this, which they take to be such an insupportable\nplague, is an evident sign of God's mercy and justice, of His love and\ngoodness: _periissent nisi periissent_, had they not thus been undone, they\nhad finally been undone. Many a carnal man is lulled asleep in perverse\nsecurity, foolish presumption, is stupefied in his sins, and hath no\nfeeling at all of them: \"I have sinned\" (he saith) \"and what evil shall\ncome unto me,\" Eccles. v. 4, and \"Tush, how shall God know it?\" and so in a\nreprobate sense goes down to hell. But here, _Cynthius aurem vellit_, God\npulls them by the ear, by affliction, he will bring them to heaven and\nhappiness; \"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,\"\nMatt. v. 4, a blessed and a happy state, if considered aright, it is, to be\nso troubled. \"It is good for me that I have been afflicted,\" Psal. cxix.\n\"before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Thy word.\"\n\"Tribulation works patience, patience hope,\" Rom. v. 4, and by such like\ncrosses and calamities we are driven from the stake of security. So that\naffliction is a school or academy, wherein the best scholars are prepared\nto the commencements of the Deity. And though it be most troublesome and\ngrievous for the time, yet know this, it comes by God's permission and\nprovidence; He is a spectator of thy groans and tears, still present with\nthee, the very hairs of thy head are numbered, not one of them can fall to\nthe ground without the express will of God: he will not suffer thee to be\ntempted above measure, he corrects us all, [6809]_numero, pondere, et\nmensura_, the Lord will not quench the smoking flax, or break the bruised\nreed, _Tentat_ (saith Austin) _non ut obruat, sed ut coronet_ he suffers\nthee to be tempted for thy good. And as a mother doth handle her child sick\nand weak, not reject it, but with all tenderness observe and keep it, so\ndoth God by us, not forsake us in our miseries, or relinquish us for our\nimperfections, but with all pity and compassion support and receive us;\nwhom he loves, he loves to the end. Rom. viii. \"Whom He hath elected, those\nHe hath called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.\" Think not then thou\nhast lost the Spirit, that thou art forsaken of God, be not overcome with\nheaviness of heart, but as David said, \"I will not fear though I walk in\nthe shadows of death.\" We must all go, _non a deliciis ad delicias_,\n[6810]but from the cross to the crown, by hell to heaven, as the old Romans\nput Virtue's temple in the way to that of Honour; we must endure sorrow and\nmisery in this life. 'Tis no new thing this, God's best servants and\ndearest children have been so visited and tried. Christ in the garden cried\nout, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" His son by nature, as\nthou art by adoption and grace. Job, in his anguish, said, \"The arrows of\nthe Almighty God were in him,\" Job vi. 4. \"His terrors fought against him,\nthe venom drank up his spirit,\" cap. xiii. 26. He saith, \"God was his\nenemy, writ bitter things against him\" (xvi. 9.) \"hated him.\" His heavy\nwrath had so seized on his soul. David complains, \"his eyes were eaten up,\nsunk into his head,\" Ps. vi. 7, \"his moisture became as the drought in\nsummer, his flesh was consumed, his bones vexed:\" yet neither Job nor David\ndid finally despair. Job would not leave his hold, but still trust in Him,\nacknowledging Him to be his good God. \"The Lord gives, the Lord takes,\nblessed be the name of the Lord,\" Job. i. 21. \"Behold I am vile, I abhor\nmyself, repent in dust and ashes,\" Job xxxix. 37. David humbled himself,\nPsal. xxxi. and upon his confession received mercy. Faith, hope,\nrepentance, are the sovereign cures and remedies, the sole comforts in this\ncase; confess, humble thyself, repent, it is sufficient. _Quod purpura non\npotest, saccus potest_, saith Chrysostom; the king of Nineveh's sackcloth\nand ashes \"did that which his purple robes and crown could not effect;\"\n_Quod diadema non potuit, cinis perfecit._ Turn to Him, he will turn to\nthee; the Lord is near those that are of a contrite heart, and will save\nsuch as be afflicted in spirit, Ps. xxxiv. 18. \"He came to the lost sheep\nof Israel,\" Matt. xv. 14. _Si cadentem intuetur, clementiae manum\nprotendit_, He is at all times ready to assist. _Nunquam spernit Deus\nPoenitentiam si sincere et simpliciter offeratur_, He never rejects a\npenitent sinner, though he have come to the full height of iniquity,\nwallowed and delighted in sin; yet if he will forsake his former ways,\n_libenter amplexatur_, He will receive him. _Parcam huic homini_, saith\n[6811]Austin, (_ex persona Dei_) _quia sibi ipsi non pepercit; ignoscam\nquia peccatum agnovit_. I will spare him because he hath not spared\nhimself; I will pardon him because he doth acknowledge his offence: let it\nbe never so enormous a sin, \"His grace is sufficient,\" 2 Cor. xii. 9.\nDespair not then, faint not at all, be not dejected, but rely on God, call\non him an thy trouble, and he will hear thee, he will assist, help, and\ndeliver thee: \"Draw near to Him, he will draw near to thee,\" James iv. 8.\nLazarus was poor and full of boils, and yet still he relied upon God,\nAbraham did hope beyond hope.\n\nThou exceptest, these were chief men, divine spirits, _Deo cari_, beloved\nof God, especially respected; but I am a contemptible and forlorn wretch,\nforsaken of God, and left to the merciless fury of evil spirits. I cannot\nhope, pray, repent, &c. How often shall I say it? thou mayst perform all\nthose duties, Christian offices, and be restored in good time. A sick man\nloseth his appetite, strength and ability, his disease prevaileth so far,\nthat all his faculties are spent, hand and foot perform not their duties,\nhis eyes are dim, hearing dull, tongue distastes things of pleasant relish,\nyet nature lies hid, recovereth again, and expelleth all those feculent\nmatters by vomit, sweat, or some such like evacuations. Thou art\nspiritually sick, thine heart is heavy, thy mind distressed, thou mayst\nhappily recover again, expel those dismal passions of fear and grief; God\ndid not suffer thee to be tempted above measure; whom he loves (I say) he\nloves to the end; hope the best. David in his misery prayed to the Lord,\nremembering how he had formerly dealt with him; and with that meditation of\nGod's mercy confirmed his faith, and pacified his own tumultuous heart in\nhis greatest agony. \"O my soul, why art thou so disquieted within me,\" &c.\nThy soul is eclipsed for a time, I yield, as the sun is shadowed by a\ncloud; no doubt but those gracious beams of God's mercy will shine upon\nthee again, as they have formerly done: those embers of faith, hope and\nrepentance, now buried in ashes, will flame out afresh, and be fully\nrevived. Want of faith, no feeling of grace for the present, are not fit\ndirections; we must live by faith, not by feeling; 'tis the beginning of\ngrace to wish for grace: we must expect and tarry. David, a man after God's\nown heart, was so troubled himself; \"Awake, why sleepest thou? O Lord,\narise, cast me not off; wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest mine\naffliction and oppression? My soul is bowed down to the dust. Arise, redeem\nus,\" &c., Ps. xliv. 22. He prayed long before he was heard, _expectans\nexpectavit_; endured much before he was relieved. Psal. lxix. 3, he\ncomplains, \"I am weary of crying, and my throat is dry, mine eyes fail,\nwhilst I wait on the Lord;\" and yet he perseveres. Be not dismayed, thou\nshalt be respected at last. God often works by contrarieties, he first\nkills and then makes alive, he woundeth first and then healeth, he makes\nman sow in tears that he may reap in joy; 'tis God's method: he that is so\nvisited, must with patience endure and rest satisfied for the present. The\npaschal lamb was eaten with sour herbs; we shall feel no sweetness of His\nblood, till we first feel the smart of our sins. Thy pains are great,\nintolerable for the time; thou art destitute of grace and comfort, stay the\nLord's leisure, he will not (I say) suffer thee to be tempted above that\nthou art able to bear, 1 Cor. x. 13. but will give an issue to temptation.\nHe works all for the best to them that love God, Rom. viii. 28. Doubt not\nof thine election, it is an immutable decree; a mark never to be defaced:\nyou have been otherwise, you may and shall be. And for your present\naffliction, hope the best, it will shortly end. \"He is present with his\nservants in their affliction,\" Ps. xci. 15. \"Great are the troubles of the\nrighteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all,\" Ps. xxxiv. 19. \"Our\nlight affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh in us an eternal\nweight of glory,\" 2. Cor. iv. 18. \"Not answerable to that glory which is to\ncome; though now in heaviness,\" saith 1 Pet. i. 6, \"you shall rejoice.\"\n\nNow last of all to those external impediments, terrible objects, which they\nhear and see many times, devils, bugbears, and mormeluches, noisome smells,\n&c. These may come, as I have formerly declared in my precedent discourse\nof the Symptoms of Melancholy, from inward causes; as a concave glass\nreflects solid bodies, a troubled brain for want of sleep, nutriment, and\nby reason of that agitation of spirits to which Hercules de Saxonia\nattributes all symptoms almost, may reflect and show prodigious shapes, as\nour vain fear and crazed phantasy shall suggest and feign, as many silly\nweak women and children in the dark, sick folks, and frantic for want of\nrepast and sleep, suppose they see that they see not: many times such\nterriculaments may proceed from natural causes, and all other senses may be\ndeluded. Besides, as I have said, this humour is _balneum diaboli_, the\ndevil's bath, by reason of the distemper of humours, and infirm organs in\nus: he may so possess us inwardly to molest us, as he did Saul and others,\nby God's permission: he is prince of the air, and can transform himself\ninto several shapes, delude all our senses for a time, but his power is\ndetermined, he may terrify us, but not hurt; God hath given \"His angels\ncharge over us, He is a wall round about his people,\" Psal. xci. 11, 12.\nThere be those that prescribe physic in such cases, 'tis God's instrument\nand not unfit. The devil works by mediation of humours, and mixed diseases\nmust have mixed remedies. Levinus Lemnius _cap. 57 & 58, exhort. ad vit.\nep. instit._ is very copious on this subject, besides that chief remedy of\nconfidence in God, prayer, hearty repentance, &c., of which for your\ncomfort and instruction, read Lavater _de spectris part. 3. cap. 5. and 6._\nWierus _de praestigiis daemonum lib. 5._ to Philip Melancthon, and others,\nand that Christian armour which Paul prescribes; he sets down certain\namulets, herbs, and precious stones, which have marvellous virtues all,\n_profligandis daemonibus_, to drive away devils and their illusions.\nSapphires, chrysolites, carbuncles, &c. _Quae mira virtute pollent ad\nlemures, stryges, incubos, genios aereos arcendos, si veterum monumentis\nhabenda fides._ Of herbs, he reckons us pennyroyal, rue, mint, angelica,\npeony: Rich. Argentine _de praestigiis daemonum, cap. 20_, adds, hypericon\nor St. John's wort, _perforata herba_, which by a divine virtue drives away\ndevils, and is therefore _fuga daemonum_: all which rightly used by their\nsuffitus, _Daemonum vexationibus obsistunt, afflictas mentes a daemonibus\nrelevant, et venenatis Jiimis_, expel devils themselves, and all devilish\nillusions. Anthony Musa, the Emperor Augustus, his physician, _cap. 6, de\nBetonia_, approves of betony to this purpose; [6812]the ancients used\ntherefore to plant it in churchyards, because it was held to be an holy\nherb and good against fearful visions, did secure such places as it grew\nin, and sanctified those persons that carried it about them. _Idem fere\nMathiolus in dioscoridem._ Others commend accurate music, so Saul was\nhelped by David's harp. Fires to be made in such rooms where spirits haunt,\ngood store of lights to be set up, odours, perfumes, and suffumigations, as\nthe angel taught Tobias, of brimstone and bitumen, thus, myrrh, briony\nroot, with many such simples which Wecker hath collected, _lib. 15, de\nsecretis, cap. 15._ _[Symbol: Jupiter] sulphuris drachmam unam, recoquatur\nin vitis albae, aqua, ut dilutius sit sulphur; detur aegro: nam daemones\nsunt morbi_ (saith Rich. Argentine, _lib. de praestigiis daemonum, cap.\nult._) Vigetus hath a far larger receipt to this purpose, which the said\nWecker cites out of Wierus, _[Symbol: Jupiter] sulphuris, vini, bituminis,\nopoponacis, galbani, castorei_, &c. Why sweet perfumes, fires and so many\nlights should be used in such places, Ernestus Burgravius Lucerna _vitae,\net mortis_, and Fortunius Lycetus assigns this cause, _quod his boni genii\nprovocentur, mali arceaniur_; \"because good spirits are well pleased with,\nbut evil abhor them!\" And therefore those old Gentiles, present Mahometans,\nand Papists have continual lamps burning in their churches all day and all\nnight, lights at funerals and in their graves; _lucernae ardentes ex auro\nliquefacto_ for many ages to endure (saith Lazius), _ne daemones corpus\nlaedant_; lights ever burning as those vestal virgins. Pythonissae\nmaintained heretofore, with many such, of which read Tostatus in _2 Reg.\ncap. 6. quaest. 43_, Thyreus, _cap. 57, 58, 62, &c. de locis infestis_,\nPictorius Isagog. _de daemonibus_, &c., see more in them. Cardan would have\nthe party affected wink altogether in such a case, if he see aught that\noffends him, or cut the air with a sword in such places they walk and\nabide; _gladiis enim et lanceis terrentur_, shoot a pistol at them, for\nbeing aerial bodies (as Caelius Rhodiginus, _lib. 1. cap. 29._ Tertullian,\nOrigen, Psellas, and many hold), if stroken, they feel pain. Papists\ncommonly enjoin and apply crosses, holy water, sanctified beads, amulets,\nmusic, ringing of bells, for to that end are they consecrated, and by them\nbaptised, characters, counterfeit relics, so many masses, peregrinations,\noblations, adjurations, and what not? Alexander Albertinus a, Rocha, Petrus\nThyreus, and Hieronymus Mengus, with many other pontificial writers,\nprescribe and set down several forms of exorcisms, as well to houses\npossessed with devils, as to demoniacal persons; but I am of\n[6813]Lemnius's mind, 'tis but _damnosa adjuratio, aut potius ludificatio_,\na mere mockery, a counterfeit charm, to no purpose, they are fopperies and\nfictions, as that absurd [6814]story is amongst the rest, of a penitent\nwoman seduced by a magician in France, at St. Bawne, exorcised by Domphius,\nMichaelis, and a company of circumventing friars. If any man (saith\nLemnius) will attempt such a thing, without all those juggling\ncircumstances, astrological elections of time, place, prodigious habits,\nfustian, big, sesquipedal words, spells, crosses, characters, which\nexorcists ordinarily use, let him follow the example of Peter and John,\nthat without any ambitious swelling terms, cured a lame man. Acts iii. \"In\nthe name of Christ Jesus rise and walk.\" His name alone is the best and\nonly charm against all such diabolical illusions, so doth Origen advise:\nand so Chrysostom, _Haec erit tibi baculus, haec turris inexpugnabilis,\nhaec armatura. Nos quid ad haec dicemus, plures fortasse expectabunt_,\nsaith St. Austin. Many men will desire my counsel and opinion what is to be\ndone in this behalf; I can say no more, _quam ut vera fide, quae per\ndilectionem operatur, ad Deum unum fugiamus_, let them fly to God alone for\nhelp. Athanasius in his book, _De variis quaest._ prescribes as a present\ncharm against devils, the beginning of the lxvii. Psalm. _Exurgat Deus,\ndissipentur inimici_, &c. But the best remedy is to fly to God, to call on\nhim, hope, pray, trust, rely on him, to commit ourselves wholly to him.\nWhat the practice of the primitive church was in this behalf, _Et quis\ndaemonia ejiciendi modus_, read Wierus at large, _lib. 5. de Cura. Lam.\nmeles. cap. 38. et deinceps._\n\nLast of all: if the party affected shall certainly know this malady to have\nproceeded from too much fasting, meditation, precise life, contemplation of\nGod's judgments (for the devil deceives many by such means), in that other\nextreme he circumvents melancholy itself, reading some books, treatises,\nhearing rigid preachers, &c. If he shall perceive that it hath begun first\nfrom some great loss, grievous accident, disaster, seeing others in like\ncase, or any such terrible object, let him speedily remove the cause, which\nto the cure of this disease Navarras so much commends, [6815]_avertat\ncogitationem a re scrupulosa_, by all opposite means, art, and industry,\nlet him _laxare animum_, by all honest recreations, \"refresh and recreate\nhis distressed soul;\" let him direct his thoughts, by himself and other of\nhis friends. Let him read no more such tracts or subjects, hear no more\nsuch fearful tones, avoid such companies, and by all means open himself,\nsubmit himself to the advice of good physicians and divines, which is\n_contraventio scrupulorum_, as [6816]he calls it, hear them speak to whom\nthe Lord hath given the tongue of the learned, to be able to minister a\nword to him that is weary, [6817]whose words are as flagons of wine. Let\nhim not be obstinate, headstrong, peevish, wilful, self-conceited (as in\nthis malady they are), but give ear to good advice, be ruled and persuaded;\nand no doubt but such good counsel may prove as preposterous to his soul,\nas the angel was to Peter, that opened the iron gates, loosed his bands,\nbrought him out of prison, and delivered him from bodily thraldom; they may\nease his afflicted mind, relieve his wounded soul, and take him out of the\njaws of hell itself. I can say no more, or give better advice to such as\nare any way distressed in this kind, than what I have given and said. Only\ntake this for a corollary and conclusion, as thou tenderest thine own\nwelfare in this, and all other melancholy, thy good health of body and\nmind, observe this short precept, give not way to solitariness and\nidleness. \"Be not solitary, be not idle.\"\n\nSPERATE MISERI--UNHAPPY HOPE.\n\nCAVETE FELICES--HAPPY BE CAUTIOUS.\n\n_Vis a dubio liberari? vis quod incertum est evadere? Age poenitentiam dum\nsanus es; sic agens, dico tibi quod securus es, quod poenitentiam egisti eo\ntempore quo peccare potuisti_. Austin. \"Do you wish to be freed from\ndoubts? do you desire to escape uncertainty?

His elder brother was William Burton, the Leicestershire antiquary, born\n   24th August, 1575, educated at Sutton Coldfield, admitted commoner, or\n   gentleman commoner, of Brazen Nose College, 1591; at the Inner Temple,\n   20th May, 1593; B. A. 22d June, 1594; and afterwards a barrister and\n   reporter in the Court of Common Pleas. \"But his natural genius,\" says\n   Wood, \"leading him to the studies of heraldry, genealogies, and\n   antiquities, he became excellent in those obscure and intricate matters;\n   and look upon him as a gentleman, was accounted, by all that knew him,\n   to be the best of his time for those studies, as may appear by his\n   'Description of Leicestershire.'\" His weak constitution not permitting\n   him to follow business, he retired into the country, and his greatest\n   work, \"The Description of Leicestershire,\" was published in folio, 1623.\n   He died at Falde, after suffering much in the civil war, 6th April,\n   1645, and was buried in the parish church belonging thereto, called\n   Hanbury.\n\n2. This is Wood's account. His will says, Nuneaton; but a passage in this\n   work [see fol. 304,] mentions Sutton Coldfield; probably he may have\n   been at both schools.\n\n3. So in the Register.\n\n4. So in the Register.\n\n5. Originating, perhaps, in a note, p. 448, 6th edit. (p. 455 of the\n   present), in which a book is quoted as having been \"printed at Paris\n   1624, _seven_ years after Burton's first edition.\" As, however, the\n   editions after that of 1621, are regularly marked in succession to the\n   eighth, printed in 1676, there seems very little reason to doubt that,\n   in the note above alluded to, either 1624 has been a misprint for 1628,\n   or _seven_ years for _three_ years.

As for ourselves (for neither are we free from this fault) the same\n      guilt, the same crime, may be objected against us: for it is through\n      our fault, negligence, and avarice, that so many and such shameful\n      corruptions occur in the church (both the temple and the Deity are\n      offered for sale), that such sordidness is introduced, such impiety\n      committed, such wickedness, such a mad gulf of wretchedness and\n      irregularity--these I say arise from all our faults, but more\n      particularly from ours of the University. We are the nursery in which\n      those ills are bred with which the state is afflicted; we voluntarily\n      introduce them, and are deserving of every opprobrium and suffering,\n      since we do not afterwards encounter them according to our strength.\n      For what better can we expect when so many poor, beggarly fellows,\n      men of every order, are readily and without election, admitted to\n      degrees? Who, if they can only commit to memory a few definitions and\n      divisions, and pass the customary period in the study of logics, no\n      matter with what effect, whatever sort they prove to be, idiots,\n      triflers, idlers, gamblers, sots, sensualists,\n\n        ----\"mere ciphers in the book of life\n        Like those who boldly woo'd Ulysses' wife;\n        Born to consume the fruits of earth: in truth,\n        As vain and idle as Pheacia's youth;\"\n\n      only let them have passed the stipulated period in the University,\n      and professed themselves collegians: either for the sake of profit,\n      or through the influence of their friends, they obtain a\n      presentation; nay, sometimes even accompanied by brilliant eulogies\n      upon their morals and acquirements; and when they are about to take\n      leave, they are honoured with the most flattering literary\n      testimonials in their favour, by those who undoubtedly sustain a loss\n      of reputation in granting them. For doctors and professors (as an\n      author says) are anxious about one thing only, viz., that out of\n      their various callings they may promote their own advantage, and\n      convert the public loss into their private gains. For our annual\n      officers wish this only, that those who commence, whether they are\n      taught or untaught is of no moment, shall be sleek, fat, pigeons,\n      worth the plucking. The Philosophastic are admitted to a degree in\n      Arts, because they have no acquaintance with them. And they are\n      desired to be wise men, because they are endowed with no wisdom, and\n      bring no qualification for a degree, except the wish to have it. The\n      Theologastic (only let them pay) thrice learned, are promoted to\n      every academic honour. Hence it is that so many vile buffoons, so\n      many idiots everywhere, placed in the twilight of letters, the mere\n      ghosts of scholars, wanderers in the market place, vagrants, barbels,\n      mushrooms, dolts, asses, a growling herd, with unwashed feet, break\n      into the sacred precincts of theology, bringing nothing along with\n      them but an impudent front, some vulgar trifles and foolish\n      scholastic technicalities, unworthy of respect even at the crossing\n      of the highways. This is the unworthy, vagrant, voluptuous race,\n      fitter for the hog sty (haram) than the altar (aram), that basely\n      prostitute divine literature; these are they who fill the pulpits,\n      creep into the palaces of our nobility after all other prospects of\n      existence fail them, owing to their imbecility of body and mind, and\n      their being incapable of sustaining any other parts in the\n      commonwealth; to this sacred refuge they fly, undertaking the office\n      of the ministry, not from sincerity, but as St. Paul says,\n      huckstering the word of God. Let not any one suppose that it is here\n      intended to detract from those many exemplary men of which the Church\n      of England may boast, learned, eminent, and of spotless fame, for\n      they are more numerous in that than in any other church of Europe:\n      nor from those most learned universities which constantly send forth\n      men endued with every form of virtue. And these seminaries would\n      produce a still greater number of inestimable scholars hereafter if\n      sordidness did not obscure the splendid light, corruption interrupt,\n      and certain truckling harpies and beggars envy them their usefulness.\n      Nor can any one be so blind as not to perceive this--any so stolid as\n      not to understand it--any so perverse as not to acknowledge how\n      sacred Theology has been contaminated by those notorious idiots, and\n      the celestial Muse treated with profanity. Vile and shameless souls\n      (says Luther) for the sake of gain, like flies to a milk-pail, crowd\n      round the tables of the nobility in expectation of a church living,\n      any office, or honour, and flock into any public hall or city ready\n      to accept of any employment that may offer. \"A thing of wood and\n      wires by others played.\" Following the paste as the parrot, they\n      stutter out anything in hopes of reward: obsequious parasites, says\n      Erasmus, teach, say, write, admire, approve, contrary to their\n      conviction, anything you please, not to benefit the people but to\n      improve their own fortunes. They subscribe to any opinions and\n      decisions contrary to the word of God, that they may not offend their\n      patron, but retain the favour of the great, the applause of the\n      multitude, and thereby acquire riches for themselves; for they\n      approach Theology, not that they may perform a sacred duty, but make\n      a fortune: nor to promote the interests of the church, but to pillage\n      it: seeking, as Paul says, not the things which are of Jesus Christ,\n      but what may be their own: not the treasure of their Lord, but the\n      enrichment of themselves and their followers. Nor does this evil\n      belong to those of humbler birth and fortunes only, it possesses the\n      middle and higher ranks, _bishops excepted_. \"O Pontiffs, tell the\n      efficacy of gold in sacred matters!\" Avarice often leads the highest\n      men astray, and men, admirable in all other respects: these find a\n      salvo for simony; and, striking against this rock of corruption, they\n      do not shear but flay the flock; and, wherever they teem, plunder,\n      exhaust, raze, making shipwreck of their reputation, if not of their\n      souls also. Hence it appears that this malady did not flow from the\n      humblest to the highest classes, but _vice versa_, so that the maxim\n      is true although spoken in jest--\"he bought first, therefore has the\n      best right to sell.\" For a Simoniac (that I may use the phraseology\n      of Leo) has not received a favour; since he has not received one he\n      does not possess one; and since he does not possess one he cannot\n      confer one. So far indeed are some of those who are placed at the\n      helm from promoting others, that they completely obstruct them, from\n      a consciousness of the means by which themselves obtained the honour.\n      For he who imagines that they emerged from their obscurity through\n      their learning, is deceived; indeed, whoever supposes promotion to be\n      the reward of genius, erudition, experience, probity, piety, and\n      poetry (which formerly was the case, but nowadays is only promised)\n      is evidently deranged. How or when this malady commenced, I shall not\n      further inquire; but from these beginnings, this accumulation of\n      vices, all her calamities and miseries have been brought upon the\n      Church; hence such frequent acts of simony, complaints, fraud,\n      impostures-- from this one fountain spring all its conspicuous\n      iniquities. I shall not press the question of ambition and courtly\n      flattery, lest they may be chagrined about luxury, base examples of\n      life, which offend the honest, wanton drinking parties, &c. Yet;\n      hence is that academic squalor, the muses now look sad, since every\n      low fellow ignorant of the arts, by those very arts rises, is\n      promoted, and grows rich, distinguished by ambitious titles, and\n      puffed up by his numerous honours; he just shows himself to the\n      vulgar, and by his stately carriage displays a species of majesty, a\n      remarkable solicitude, letting down a flowing beard, decked in a\n      brilliant toga resplendent with purple, and respected also on account\n      of the splendour of his household and number of his servants. There\n      are certain statues placed in sacred edifices that seem to sink under\n      their load, and almost to perspire, when in reality they are void of\n      sensation, and do not contribute to the stony stability, so these men\n      would wish to look like Atlases, when they are no better than statues\n      of stone, insignificant scrubs, funguses, dolts, little different\n      from stone. Meanwhile really learned men, endowed with all that can\n      adorn a holy life, men who have endured the heat of mid-day, by some\n      unjust lot obey these, dizzards, content probably with a miserable\n      salary, known by honest appellations, humble, obscure, although\n      eminently worthy, needy, leading a private life without honour,\n      buried alive in some poor benefice, or incarcerated for ever in their\n      college chambers, lying hid ingloriously. But I am unwilling to stir\n      this sink any longer or any deeper; hence those tears, this\n      melancholy habit of the muses; hence (that I may speak with\n      Secellius) is it that religion is brought into disrepute and\n      contempt, and the priesthood abject; (and since this is so, I must\n      speak out and use a filthy witticism of the filthy) a foetid. crowd,\n      poor, sordid, melancholy, miserable, despicable, contemptible.\n\n2104.

Non est amor desiderium aut appetitus ut ab omnibus hactenus\n      traditim; nam cum potimur amata re, non manet appetitus; est igitur\n      affectus quo cum re amata aut unimur, aut unionem perpetuamus.\n\n4470.

Gratia et pulchritudo ita suaviter animos demulcent, ita vehementer\n      alluciunt, et admirabiliter connectuntur, ut in inum confundant et\n      distingui non possunt et sunt tanquam radii et splendores divini\n      solis in rebus variis vario modo fulgentes.\n\n4477.
