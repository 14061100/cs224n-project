{"summary": "\nThe Odyssey begins ten years after the end of the ten-year Trojan War (the subject of the Iliad), and Odysseus has still not returned home from the war. Odysseus' son Telemachus is about 20 years old and is sharing his absent father's house on the island of Ithaca with his mother Penelope and a crowd of 108 boisterous young men, \"the Suitors\", whose aim is to persuade Penelope to marry one of them, all the while enjoying the hospitality of Odysseus' household and eating up his wealth.\nOdysseus' protectress, the goddess Athena, discusses his fate with Zeus, king of the gods, at a moment when Odysseus' enemy, the god of the sea Poseidon, is absent from Mount Olympus. Then, disguised as a Taphian chieftain named Mentes, she visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father. He offers her hospitality; they observe the suitors dining rowdily while the bard Phemius performs a narrative poem for them. Penelope objects to Phemius' theme, the \"Return from Troy\", because it reminds her of her missing husband, but Telemachus rebuts her objections.\nThat night Athena, disguised as Telemachus, finds a ship and crew for the true Telemachus. The next morning, Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca to discuss what should be done with the suitors. Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as Mentor), he departs for the Greek mainland and the household of Nestor, most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, now at home in Pylos. From there, Telemachus rides overland, accompanied by Nestor's son, Peisistratus, to Sparta, where he finds Menelaus and Helen who are now reconciled. He is told that they returned to Sparta after a long voyage by way of Egypt. There, on the island of Pharos, Menelaus encountered the old sea-god Proteus, who told him that Odysseus was a captive of the nymph Calypso. Incidentally, Telemachus learns the fate of Menelaus' brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and leader of the Greeks at Troy: he was murdered on his return home by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus.\n\nThe second part tells the story of Odysseus. After having spent seven years in captivity on Calypso's island, Ogygia, Calypso falls deeply in love with him but he has consistently spurned her advances. She is persuaded to release him by Odysseus' great-grandfather, the messenger god Hermes, who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea. Odysseus builds a raft and is given clothing, food and drink by Calypso. When Poseidon finds out that Odysseus has escaped, he wrecks the raft but, helped by a veil given by the sea nymph Ino, Odysseus swims ashore on Scherie, the island of the Phaeacians. Naked and exhausted, he hides in a pile of leaves and falls asleep. The next morning, awakened by the laughter of girls, he sees the young Nausicaa, who has gone to the seashore with her maids to wash clothes after Athena told her in a dream to do so. He appeals to her for help. She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents, Arete and Alcinous, or Alkinous. Odysseus is welcomed and is not at first asked for his name. He remains for several days, takes part in a pentathlon, and hears the blind singer Demodocus perform two narrative poems. The first is an otherwise obscure incident of the Trojan War, the \"Quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles\"; the second is the amusing tale of a love affair between two Olympian gods, Ares and Aphrodite. Finally, Odysseus asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the Trojan Horse, a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity. He then begins to tell the story of his return from Troy.\n\nAfter a piratical raid on Ismaros in the land of the Cicones, he and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms. They visited the lethargic Lotus-Eaters who gave two of his men their fruit which caused them to forget their homecoming, and then were captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus, escaping by blinding him with a wooden stake. While they were escaping, however, Odysseus foolishly told Polyphemus his identity, and Polyphemus told his father, Poseidon, that Odysseus had blinded him. Poseidon then curses Odysseus to wander the sea for ten years, during which he would lose all his crew and return home through the aid of others. After their escape, they stayed with Aeolus, the master of the winds and he gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home. However, the greedy sailors naively opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking it contained gold. All of the winds flew out and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come, just as Ithaca came into sight.\nAfter unsuccessfully pleading with Aeolus to help them again, they re-embarked and encountered the cannibalistic Laestrygonians. All of Odysseus's ships except his own entered the harbor of the Laestrygonians' Island and were immediately destroyed. He sailed on and visited the witch-goddess Circe. She turned half of his men into swine after feeding them cheese and wine. Hermes warned Odysseus about Circe and gave Odysseus a drug called moly which gave him resistance to Circe's magic. Circe, surprised by Odysseus' resistance, agreed to change his men back to their human form in exchange for Odysseus' love. They remained with her on the island for one year, while they feasted and drank. Finally, guided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbor at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead. He first encountered the spirit of crewmember Elpenor, who had gotten drunk and fallen from a roof to his death, which had gone unnoticed by others, before Odysseus and the rest of his crew had left Circe. Elpenor's ghost told Odysseus to bury his body, which Odysseus promised to do. Odysseus then summoned the spirit of the old prophet Tiresias for advice on how to appease the gods upon his return home. Next Odysseus met the spirit of his own mother, who had died of grief during his long absence. From her, he got his first news of his own household, threatened by the greed of the Suitors. Finally, he met the spirits of famous men and women. Notably he encountered the spirit of Agamemnon, of whose murder he now learned, and Achilles, who told him about the woes of the land of the dead (for Odysseus' encounter with the dead, see also Nekuia).\n\nReturning to Circe's island, they were advised by her on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirted the land of the Sirens, who sang an enchanting song that normally caused passing sailors to steer toward the rocks, only to hit them and sink. All of the sailors except for Odysseus, who was tied to the mast as he wanted to hear the song, had their ears plugged up with beeswax. They then passed between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, Odysseus losing six men to Scylla, and landed on the island of Thrinacia. Zeus caused a storm which prevented them leaving. While Odysseus was away praying, his men ignored the warnings of Tiresias and Circe and hunted down the sacred cattle of the sun god Helios as their food had run short. The Sun God insisted that Zeus punish the men for this sacrilege. They suffered a shipwreck as they were driven towards Charybdis. All but Odysseus were drowned; he clung to a fig tree above Charybdis. Washed ashore on the island of Ogygia, he was compelled to remain there as Calypso's lover until she was ordered by Zeus, via Hermes, to release Odysseus.\n\nHaving listened with rapt attention to his story, the Phaeacians, who are skilled mariners, agree to help Odysseus get home. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own slaves, the swineherd Eumaeus. Athena disguises Odysseus as a wandering beggar so he can see how things stand in his household. After dinner, he tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself: He was born in Crete, had led a party of Cretans to fight alongside other Greeks in the Trojan War, and had then spent seven years at the court of the king of Egypt; finally he had been shipwrecked in Thesprotia and crossed from there to Ithaca.\nMeanwhile, Telemachus sails home from Sparta, evading an ambush set by the Suitors. He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and makes for Eumaeus's hut. Father and son meet; Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but still not to Eumaeus), and they decide that the Suitors must be killed. Telemachus goes home first. Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his own house, still pretending to be a beggar. When Odysseus's dog (who was a puppy before he left) saw him, he was so excited that he died.He is ridiculed by the Suitors in his own home, especially by one extremely impertinent man named Antinous. Odysseus meets Penelope and tests her intentions by saying he once met Odysseus in Crete. Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus's recent wanderings.\nOdysseus's identity is discovered by the housekeeper, Eurycleia, when she recognizes an old scar as she is washing his feet. Eurycleia tries to tell Penelope about the beggar's true identity, but Athena makes sure that Penelope cannot hear her. Odysseus then swears Eurycleia to secrecy.\n\nThe next day, at Athena's prompting, Penelope maneuvers the Suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus' bow. The man who can string the bow and shoot it through a dozen axe heads would win. Odysseus takes part in the competition himself: he alone is strong enough to string the bow and shoot it through the dozen axe heads, making him the winner. He then turns his arrows on the Suitors and with the help of Athena, Telemachus, Eumaeus and Philoteus the cowherd, he kills all the Suitors. Odysseus and Telemachus hang twelve of their household maids, who had betrayed Penelope or had sex with the Suitors, or both; they mutilate and kill the goatherd Melanthius, who had mocked and abused Odysseus. Now at last, Odysseus identifies himself to Penelope. She is hesitant, but accepts him when he mentions that their bed was made from an olive tree still rooted to the ground. Many modern and ancient scholars take this to be the original ending of the Odyssey, and the rest to be an interpolation.\nThe next day he and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father Laertes, who likewise accepts his identity only when Odysseus correctly describes the orchard that Laertes had previously given him.\nThe citizens of Ithaca have followed Odysseus on the road, planning to avenge the killing of the Suitors, their sons. Their leader points out that Odysseus has now caused the deaths of two generations of the men of Ithaca: his sailors, not one of whom survived; and the Suitors, whom he has now executed. The goddess Athena intervenes and persuades both sides to give up the vendetta, a deus ex machina. After this, Ithaca is at peace once more, concluding the Odyssey.\n\n", "full_text": "THE ODYSSEY\n\n\n  rendered into English\n  prose for the use of\n  those who cannot\n  read the original\n\n\nBy Samuel Butler\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\n\nThis translation is intended to supplement a work entitled \"The\nAuthoress of the Odyssey\", which I published in 1897. I could not give\nthe whole \"Odyssey\" in that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore\nepitomised my translation, which was already completed and which I now\npublish in full.\n\nI shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I\nhave there written. The points in question are:\n\n(1) that the \"Odyssey\" was written entirely at, and drawn entirely\nfrom, the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike\nas regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of\nUlysses, when once he is within easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves\ninto a periplus of the island, practically from Trapani back to Trapani,\nvia the Lipari islands, the Straits of Messina, and the island of\nPantellaria.\n\n(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived\nat the place now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work\nunder the name of Nausicaa.\n\nThe main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English\nand Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the\n\"Athenaeum\" for January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were\nurged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian \"Eagle\" for the Lent and\nOctober terms of the same year. Nothing to which I should reply\nhas reached me from any quarter, and knowing how anxiously I have\nendeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument, I begin\nto feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I should have heard,\nat any rate about some of them, before now. Without, therefore, for\na moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce in my\nconclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself\nto translating the \"Odyssey\" for English readers, with such notes as\nI think will be found useful. Among these I would especially call\nattention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly\nallowed me to make public.\n\nI have repeated several of the illustrations used in \"The Authoress of\nthe Odyssey\", and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court\nof Ulysses' house more vividly before the reader. I should like to\nexplain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is\naccidental, and was not observed by me till I developed the negative. In\nan appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the\nplan of Ulysses' house, together with the plan itself. The reader is\nrecommended to study this plan with some attention.\n\nIn the preface to my translation of the \"Iliad\" I have given my views as\nto the main principles by which a translator should be guided, and need\nnot repeat them here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of\ntranslating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more\nor less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in\npoetry is wrong in prose, and the exigencies of readable prose are the\nfirst things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,\nhowever, may see how far I have departed from strict construe, I will\nprint here Messrs. Butcher and Lang's translation of the sixty lines or\nso of the \"Odyssey.\" Their translation runs:\n\n  Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered\n  far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of\n  Troy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose\n  mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his\n  heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and the\n  return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his\n  company, though he desired it sore. For through the\n  blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who\n  devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from\n  them their day of returning. Of these things, goddess,\n  daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\n  declare thou even unto us.\n\n  Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction,\n  were at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but\n  Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward\n  path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her\n  hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when\n  now the year had come in the courses of the seasons,\n  wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to\n  Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even\n  among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save\n  Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus,\n  till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now\n  departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are\n  sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where\n  Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to\n  receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he made merry\n  sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in\n  the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of\n  men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his\n  heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon,\n  far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among\n  the Immortals:\n\n  'Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of\n  us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves,\n  through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows\n  beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\n  beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife\n  of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,\n  and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had\n  warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\n  slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor\n  woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the\n  hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate\n  and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he\n  prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good\n  will; but now hath he paid one price for all.'\n\n  And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: 'O\n  father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that\n  man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish\n  likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for\n  wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends\n  this long while suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle,\n  where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and\n  therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\n  wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and\n  himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky\n  asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in\n  sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is\n  wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus\n  yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from\n  his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\n  heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not\n  Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free\n  offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore\n  wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?'\n\nThe \"Odyssey\" (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\n\"Iliad\"; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\nmarginal references to the \"Iliad,\" and had marked them to this end in\nmy MS. I found, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly\nscholasticised, and abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on\nthose who have the management of our University presses, that they would\nrender a great service to students if they would publish a Greek text of\nthe \"Odyssey\" with the Iliadic passages printed in a different type, and\nwith marginal references. I have given the British Museum a copy of the\n\"Odyssey\" with the Iliadic passages underlined and referred to in MS.;\nI have also given an \"Iliad\" marked with all the Odyssean passages, and\ntheir references; but copies of both the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" so marked\nought to be within easy reach of all students.\n\nAny one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen\nround the \"Iliad\" since Wolf's time, without keeping it well before\nhis reader's mind that the \"Odyssey\" was demonstrably written from one\nsingle neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to\nthis conclusion) presumably by one person only--that it was written\ncertainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.--that\nthe writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the\n\"Iliad\" as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose\ngenuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to\nbe by Homer--any one who fails to keep these points before his readers,\nis hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who will\nmark his \"Iliad\" and his \"Odyssey\" from the copies in the British Museum\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common\nsense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages in both\npoems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their proper\nvalue to a large number of books here and on the Continent that at\npresent enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps\nis an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many puzzles of\nthe \"Odyssey\" cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they arise from\nover-saturation with the \"Iliad.\"\n\nOther difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the\npoem in the writer's mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some\nlength in pp. 251-261 of \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\". Briefly, the\n\"Odyssey\" consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses,\nwhich alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of the poem.\nThis poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of Ulysses'\nadventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of lines\n1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v., and thence without\nintermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at which point the\noriginal scheme was abandoned.\n\n(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of\nTelemachus' voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly)\nof Book i., is continued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till\nUlysses wakes in the middle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it\ncontinues to the end of Book xxiv.\n\nIn \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\", I wrote:\n\n   the introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix.,\n   535, with the writing a new council of the gods at the\n   beginning of Book v., to take the place of the one that was\n   removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only things that were\n   done to give even a semblance of unity to the old scheme\n   and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse, after\n   being asked to sing of one subject, spend two-thirds of her\n   time in singing a very different one, with a climax for\n   which no-one has asked her. For roughly the Return occupies\n   eight Books, and Penelope and the Suitors sixteen.\n\nI believe this to be substantially correct.\n\nLastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the\nLeipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a\ncomma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the \"Odyssey,\"\nthat there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in so small a\nmatter; still, from a spirit of mere conservatism, I have preferred\nto do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and viii., and\n[Greek], at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial capitals in\nan edition far too careful to admit a supposition of inadvertence, when\n[Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii., and [Greek] at the\nbeginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I cannot determine.\nNo other Books of the \"Odyssey\" have initial capitals except the three\nmentioned unless the first word of the Book is a proper name.\n\nS. BUTLER.\n\nJuly 25, 1900.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\n\nButler's Translation of the \"Odyssey\" appeared originally in 1900, and\nThe Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition\nof \"The Authoress\", which is published simultaneously with this new\nedition of the Translation, I have given some account of the genesis of\nthe two books.\n\nThe size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both\nbooks uniform with Butler's other works; and, fortunately, it has been\npossible, by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into\neach page, so that the references remain good, and, with the exception\nof a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated\nso far as they affect the Translation, the new editions are faithful\nreprints of the original editions, with misprints and obvious errors\ncorrected--no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up\nto date.\n\n(a) The Index has been revised.\n\n(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been necessary\nto shorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been taken of\nvarious corrections of and additions to the headlines and shoulder-notes\nmade by Butler in his own copies of the two books.\n\n(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,\nwhereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the\npage. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.\n\nOn page 153 of \"The Authoress\" Butler says: \"No great poet would compare\nhis hero to a paunch full of blood and fat, cooking before the fire\n(xx, 24-28).\" This passage is not given in the abridged Story of the\n\"Odyssey\" at the beginning of the book, but in the Translation it occurs\nin these words:\n\n\"Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he\ntossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front\nof a hot fire, doing it first on one side then on the other, that he\nmay get it cooked as soon as possible; even so did he turn himself about\nfrom side to side, thinking all the time how, single-handed as he\nwas, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked\nsuitors.\"\n\nIt looks as though in the interval between the publication of \"The\nAuthoress\" (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his\nmind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a\npaunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man who\nturns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one which a\ngreat poet might make.\n\nIn seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable\nassistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,\nCambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,\nCambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the\ncare and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the\nlabour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and references\nto the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" and I believe that it could not have been\nbetter performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and it would have\nbeen a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known that his work was\nbeing shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H. R. Robertson, who\nmore than half a century ago was a fellow-student with him at Cary's\nSchool of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury.\n\nHENRY FESTING JONES.\n\n120 MAIDA VALE, W.9.\n\n4th December, 1921.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ODYSSEY\n\n\nBook I\n\nTHE GODS IN COUNCIL--MINERVA'S VISIT TO ITHACA--THE CHALLENGE FROM\nTELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.\n\nTell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after\nhe had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and\nmany were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and\nbring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his\nmen, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the\ncattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever\nreaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of\nJove, from whatsoever source you may know them.\n\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife\nand country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into\na large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a\ntime when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then,\nhowever, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not\nyet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except\nNeptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him\nget home.\n\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end,\nand lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. {1} He\nhad gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\nhimself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian\nJove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was\nthinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes;\nso he said to the other gods:\n\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\nAgamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\nit would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do\neither of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his\nrevenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him\nthis in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for\neverything in full.\"\n\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but\nAegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart\nbleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,\nfar away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered\nwith forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,\ndaughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean,\nand carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This\ndaughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying\nby every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he\nis tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the\nsmoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when\nUlysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt\nsacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?\"\n\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\nin mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\nblinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\nNeptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore\nthough he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing\nhim from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how\nwe can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are\nall of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"\n\nAnd Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the\ngods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury\nto the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and\nthat he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart\ninto Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans\nin assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who\npersist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also\nconduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about\nthe return of his dear father--for this will make people speak well of\nhim.\"\n\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the\nredoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith\nshe quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she\ndarted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was\nin Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor,\nMentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand.\nThere she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which\nthey had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house.\nMen-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some\nmixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the\ntables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up\ngreat quantities of meat.\n\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send\nthem flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and\nbe honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he\ncaught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed\nthat a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right\nhand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. \"Welcome,\" said he,\n\"to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what\nyou have come for.\"\n\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong\nbearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and\nhe conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a\ncloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,{2} and he set\nanother seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might\nnot be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he\nmight ask her more freely about his father.\n\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she\ndrew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and\noffered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver\nfetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their\nside, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.\n\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.\n{3} Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went\nround with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\nand water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were\nbefore them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted\nmusic and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet,\nso a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce\nto sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing\nTelemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man\nmight hear.\n\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I am\ngoing to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and\nall this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some\nwilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see\nmy father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather\nthan a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has\nfallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is\ncoming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,\nsir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell\nme of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your\ncrew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves\nto be--for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want\nto know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my\nfather's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went\nabout much himself.\"\n\nAnd Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all about\nit. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have\ncome here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue\nbeing bound for Temesa {4} with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back\ncopper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away\nfrom the town, in the harbour Rheithron {5} under the wooded mountain\nNeritum. {6} Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will\ntell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your\nfather was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods\nare still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland.\nIt is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a\nprisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne\nin upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much\nlonger; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in\nchains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell\nme, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow\nfor a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes,\nfor we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower\nof all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us\nseen the other.\"\n\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it\nis a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one\nwho had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there\nis no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my\nfather.\"\n\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,\nwhat is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What\nis it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the\nfamily--for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And\nthe guests--how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over\nthe whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who\ncomes near them.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\nashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of\nmy father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the\nchiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of\nZacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up\nmy house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who\nwill neither point blank say that she will not marry, {7} nor yet bring\nmatters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\nlong will do so also with myself.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses home\nagain. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is\nthe man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making\nmerry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were\nhe to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from\nEphyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of\nMermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any,\nbut my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses\nis the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a\nsorry wedding.\n\n\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you\nto set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice,\ncall the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning--lay your case\nbefore them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take\nthemselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set\non marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her\na husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a\ndaughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take\nthe best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest\nof your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\nyou something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;\nthence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all\nthe Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home,\nyou can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another\ntwelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at\nonce, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow\nto his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all\nthis, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you\nmay kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes'\npraises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You are a\nfine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a\nname in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew,\nwho will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter\nover for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk to me\nin this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell\nme; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little\nlonger till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then\ngive you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give\nyou one of great beauty and value--a keepsake such as only dear friends\ngive to one another.\"\n\nMinerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at\nonce. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till\nI come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very\ngood one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\n\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\nhis father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were\nsitting.\n\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he\ntold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid\nupon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from\nher room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but\nattended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood\nby one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters {8}\nwith a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover,\nbefore her face, and was weeping bitterly.\n\n\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\nsuch as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and\nlet them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it\nbreaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I\nmourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\nmiddle Argos.\" {9}\n\n\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind to;\nbards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes\nthem, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good\npleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of\nthe Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly.\nMake up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who\nnever came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go,\nthen, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is\nman's matter, and mine above all others {10}--for it is I who am master\nhere.\"\n\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in\nher heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she\nmourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.\nBut the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters {11},\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.\n\nThen Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors, let\nus feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a\nrare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in\nthe morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice\nto depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, at\nyour own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging\nupon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full,\nand when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge\nyou.\"\n\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\nyou.\"\n\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of\nfor me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in\nIthaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;\nnevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom\nUlysses has won for me.\"\n\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news\nabout the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He\nseemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone\nin a moment before we could get to know him.\"\n\n\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his\nprophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of\nAnchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's.\" But in\nhis heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\n\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the\nevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to\nbed each in his own abode. {12} Telemachus's room was high up in a tower\n{13} that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding\nand full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops,\nthe son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.\nLaertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he\ngave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her\nin his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take\nher to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. {14} She it was who\nnow lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of\nthe other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a\nbaby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as\nhe took off his shirt {15} he gave it to the good old woman, who folded\nit tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the\nbolt home by means of the strap. {16} But Telemachus as he lay covered\nwith a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended\nvoyage and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.\n\n\nBook II\n\nASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA--SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE\nSUITORS--TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH\nMINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.\n\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\ngirded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an\nimmortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in\nassembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,\nwhen they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in\nhand--not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him\nwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as\nhe went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the\noldest councillors made way for him.\n\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was\nthe first to speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,\nland of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they\nwere all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.\n{17} He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's\nland, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless\ntheir father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still\nweeping for him when he began his speech.\n\n\"Men of Ithaca,\" he said, \"hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us\nthere has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it\nbe, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has\nhe got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or\nwould he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is\nan excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's desire.\"\n\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was\nbursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the assembly\nand the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to\nAegyptius, \"Sir,\" said he, \"it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have\nconvened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind\nof any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any\nmatter of public moment on which I would speak. My grievance is purely\npersonal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my\nhouse. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was\nchief among all you here present, and was like a father to every one\nof you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter\nruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering\nmy mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to\nher father Icarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and\nto provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep\nhanging about my father's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat\ngoats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the\nquantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we\nhave now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold\nmy own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he\nwas, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I\ncannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and\nruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public\nopinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be\ndispleased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the\nbeginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and\nleave me singlehanded {18}--unless it be that my brave father Ulysses\ndid some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by\naiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of\nhouse and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for\nI could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with\nnotices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have\nno remedy.\" {19}\n\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into\ntears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no\none ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke\nthus:\n\n\"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw\nthe blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she\nis a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she\nhad been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and\nsending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then\nthere was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour\nframe in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\nneedlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still\ndo not press me to marry again immediately, wait--for I would not have\nskill in needlework perish unrecorded--till I have completed a pall for\nthe hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall\ntake him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is\nlaid out without a pall.'\n\n\"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the\nstitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years\nand we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now in her\nfourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and\nwe caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\nwhether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer,\nthat both you and the Achaeans may understand-'Send your mother away,\nand bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's choice'; for I\ndo not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with\nthe airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva\nhas taught her, and because she is so clever. We never yet heard of such\na woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women\nof old, but they were nothing to your mother any one of them. It was not\nfair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in\nthe mind with which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on\neating up your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she\ngets all the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.\nUnderstand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here\nnor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some one or\nother of us.\"\n\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me\nfrom my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether\nhe is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the\nlarge sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back\nto him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will also\npunish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on the\nErinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing to\ndo, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take offence\nat this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at\nyour own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you elect to\npersist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon\nwith you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be\nno man to avenge you.\"\n\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they\nflew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly\nflight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they\nwheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring\ndeath into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely and\ntearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the town.\nThe people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what all this\nmight be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best prophet and reader of\nomens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying:\n\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,\nfor I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be\naway much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and\ndestruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live in\nIthaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness\nbefore he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will\nbe better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;\neverything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set\nout for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much\nhardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the\ntwentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is\ncoming true.\"\n\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, \"Go home, old man, and prophesy to\nyour own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens\nmyself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the\nsunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has\ndied in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with\nhim, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of\nTelemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will\ngive you something for your family, but I tell you--and it shall surely\nbe--when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one\nover till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his young friend\nwill only fare so much the worse--he will take nothing by it, for the\nsuitors will prevent this--and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine,\nsir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear\nhardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you\nall to send his mother back to her father, who will find her a husband\nand provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may\nexpect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our suit; for we\nfear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches, nor\nfor any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please,\nbut we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and continue to\neat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till such time as his\nmother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the\ntiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize\nof such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom\nwe should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us.\"\n\nThen Telemachus said, \"Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no\nmore, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca\nnow know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to\ntake me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in\nquest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\nme something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\nheaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on\nhis way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet\nanother twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will\nreturn at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.\"\n\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor {20} who had been a friend of\nUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority\nover the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty\naddressed them thus:\n\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably;\nI hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for\nthere is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as\nthough he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors, for\nif they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts, and\nwager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the high\nhand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at\nthe way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such\nscandalous goings on--which you could do if you chose, for you are many\nand they are few.\"\n\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, \"Mentor, what folly is\nall this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing\nfor one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses\nhimself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do\nhis best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would\nhave small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head\nif he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have\nbeen saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business, and\nlet his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on\nhis journey, if he goes at all--which I do not think he will, for he\nis more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him\nsomething.\"\n\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\nabode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\n\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the\ngrey waves, and prayed to Minerva.\n\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail\nthe seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would\nobey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors,\nare hindering me that I cannot do so.\"\n\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with\nthe voice of Mentor. \"Telemachus,\" said she, \"if you are made of\nthe same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\nhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half\ndone. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\nbut unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins\nI see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as\ntheir fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are\nnot going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely\nwithout some share of your father's wise discernment, I look with hope\nupon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of\nthose foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give\nno thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and\nall of them, so that they shall perish on the same day. As for your\nvoyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such an old friend\nof mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with you myself.\nNow, however, return home, and go about among the suitors; begin getting\nprovisions ready for your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine\nin jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern\nbags, while I go round the town and beat up volunteers at once. There\nare many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them\nfor you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out\nto sea without delay.\"\n\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in\ndoing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the\nsuitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous\ncame up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,\nsaying, \"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither\nin word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The\nAchaeans will find you in everything--a ship and a picked crew to\nboot--so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your\nnoble father.\"\n\n\"Antinous,\" answered Telemachus, \"I cannot eat in peace, nor take\npleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that\nyou should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?\nNow that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and\nwhether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all\nthe harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain--though,\nthanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must\nbe passenger not captain.\"\n\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the\nothers went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, {21} jeering at\nhim tauntingly as they did so.\n\n\"Telemachus,\" said one youngster, \"means to be the death of us; I\nsuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again\nfrom Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as\nwell, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?\"\n\nAnother said, \"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like\nhis father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have\nplenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as\nfor the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have\nthat.\"\n\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and\nspacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay\nheaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were\nkept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil,\nwhile casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to\ndrink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home\nagain after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in the\nmiddle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter of\nOps the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and day.\nTelemachus called her to the store-room and said:\n\n\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\nare keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\njars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn\nleathern bags with barley meal--about twenty measures in all. Get these\nthings put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take\neverything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs\nfor the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear\nanything about the return of my dear father.\"\n\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,\nsaying, \"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into\nyour head? Where in the world do you want to go to--you, who are the\none hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign\ncountry nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these\nwicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and\nwill share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are\namong your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life\nout on the barren ocean.\"\n\n\"Fear not, nurse,\" answered Telemachus, \"my scheme is not without\nheaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this\nto my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she\nhears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil\nher beauty by crying.\"\n\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she\nhad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and\ngetting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the\nsuitors.\n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and\nwent round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the\nship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him\nto let her have a ship--which he was very ready to do. When the sun had\nset and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the\nwater, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and\nstationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up, and\nthe goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.\n\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into\na deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them\ndrop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their\nwine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and\nfull of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and\ncalled Telemachus to come outside.\n\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, \"the men are on board and at their oars, waiting\nfor you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.\"\n\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When\nthey got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and\nTelemachus said, \"Now my men, help me to get the stores on board;\nthey are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know\nanything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When\nthey had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,\nMinerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,\nwhile Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and\ntook their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from\nthe West, {22} that whistled over the deep blue waves {23} whereon\nTelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they\ndid as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\nraised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their\nwhite sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail bellied out\nwith the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam\nhissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they made all fast\nthroughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls to the brim, and made\ndrink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but more\nparticularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\n\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night\nfrom dark till dawn,\n\n\nBook III\n\nTELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.\n\nbut as the sun was rising from the fair sea {24} into the firmament of\nheaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the\ncity of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore\nto offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\nThere were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\nnine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats {25}\nand burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,\nTelemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship\nto anchor, and went ashore.\n\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\n\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken\nthis voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he\ncame by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has\ngot to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies,\nfor he is an excellent person.\"\n\n\"But how, Mentor,\" replied Telemachus, \"dare I go up to Nestor, and\nhow am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long\nconversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who\nis so much older than myself.\"\n\n\"Some things, Telemachus,\" answered Minerva, \"will be suggested to\nyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am\nassured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth\nuntil now.\"\n\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they\nreached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were assembled.\nThere they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round\nhim were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the\nspits {26} while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers\nthey crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their\nplaces. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of\nthem, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the\nsands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them\ntheir portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a\ngolden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same\ntime.\n\n\"Offer a prayer, sir,\" said he, \"to King Neptune, for it is his feast\nthat you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink\noffering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt\nnot that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without\nGod in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\nage with myself, so I will give you the precedence.\"\n\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\nproper of him to have given it to herself first; {27} she accordingly\nbegan praying heartily to Neptune. \"O thou,\" she cried, \"that encirclest\nthe earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon\nthee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and\non his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some\nhandsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly,\ngrant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that\nhas brought us in our ship to Pylos.\"\n\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to\nTelemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were\nroasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his\nportion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"that our guests have done their dinner, it will be best\nto ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and from\nwhat port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas as\nrovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand against\nyou?\"\n\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\nabout his father and get himself a good name.\n\n\"Nestor,\" said he, \"son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask\nwhence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under Neritum,\n{28} and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public\nimport. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have\nsacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what fate\nbefell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards\nUlysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead\nat all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor say\nwhether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the\nwaves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if haply\nyou may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it\nwith your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for he was\na man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for me,\nbut tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father\nUlysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when you\nAchaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my\nfavour and tell me truly all.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" answered Nestor, \"you recall a time of much sorrow to\nmy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while\nprivateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city\nof king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there--Ajax, Achilles,\nPatroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man\nsingularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more\nthan this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\nyou were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I\ncould not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn\nhomeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we try\nevery kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during\nall this time there was no one who could compare with your father in\nsubtlety--if indeed you are his son--I can hardly believe my eyes--and\nyou talk just like him too--no one would say that people of such\ndifferent ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any kind\nof difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but in\nsingleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might be\nordered for the best.\n\n\"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the\nArgives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\ndispleasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\nbetween the two sons of Atreus.\n\n\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for\nit was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained\nwhy they had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was\nfor sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought\nthat we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger\nof Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not\nprevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not\nchange them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the\nAchaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of\ntwo minds as to what they should do.\n\n\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into\nthe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,\nabout half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We--the other\nhalf--embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had\nsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the\ngods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet\nmean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of\nwhich some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under\nUlysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships\nthat were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing.\nThe son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on\nMenelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our\ncourse--for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island\nof Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the\nstormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown\none to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed\nour ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a\nfair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to\nGeraestus, {29} where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for\nhaving helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed and his men\nstationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind\nnever fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me.\n\n\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\nabout the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost\nbut, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that\nhave reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the\nMyrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; so also\ndid the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men\nat sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe\nhome with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you live, you\nwill have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of\nAegisthus--and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what\na good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes\ndid, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You\ntoo, then--for you are a tall smart-looking fellow--show your mettle and\nmake yourself a name in story.\"\n\n\"Nestor son of Neleus,\" answered Telemachus, \"honour to the Achaean\nname, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all\ntime for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant\nme to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who\nare ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such\nhappiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best\nwe may.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember to have\nheard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards\nyou and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,\nor are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows but\nwhat Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full,\neither single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva\nwere to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were\nfighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any\none as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care\nof you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget\ntheir wooing.\"\n\nTelemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far\ntoo much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though the\ngods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.\"\n\nOn this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\nhas a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I\ncould be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home\nquickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the\ntreachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when\na man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond\nthey are of him.\"\n\n\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"do not let us talk about it any more.\nThere is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have long\nsince counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\nabout which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than any\none else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so that it\nis like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell\nme true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaus\ndoing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man than\nhimself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither\namong mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?\"\n\n\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\ndivined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy\nhad found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no\nbarrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have\nbeen thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would\nhave mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we\nwere over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was taking\nhis ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife\nClytemnestra with incessant flattery.\n\n\"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she\nwas of a good natural disposition; {30} moreover there was a bard with\nher, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,\nthat he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled\nher destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and\nleft him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon--after which she\nwent willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many\nburnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries\nand gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\n\n\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms\nwith one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens,\nApollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of\nMenelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in\nrough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand,\nand Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order\nto bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when\nhe too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean\nheads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the\nwaves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of\nthe river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out\ninto the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the\ncoast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind\nblowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small\nheadland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was\ndriven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save\nthemselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and\nseas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among\npeople of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his\nevil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in\nMycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer\nof his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and\nof false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very\nday Menelaus came home, {31} with as much treasure as his ships could\ncarry.\n\n\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\nhave been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\nto go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\ndistant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\nwinds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\ncannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and terrible are the\nseas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your\nown men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a\nchariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he\nwill tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\"\n\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, \"Sir,\nall that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the\nvictims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to\nNeptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed\ntime. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious\nfestival.\"\n\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men\nservants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled\nthe mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims\ninto the fire, and stood up to make their drink offerings. When they\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,\nMinerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but Nestor\ncaught them up at once and stayed them.\n\n\"Heaven and the immortal gods,\" he exclaimed, \"forbid that you should\nleave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and\nshort of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to\nfind comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you\nI have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son of\nmy old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship--not while I\nlive--nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I\nhave done.\"\n\nThen Minerva answered, \"Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much\nbetter that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall\nreturn with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give\norders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older\nperson among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age,\nwho have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the\nship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians\nwhere I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let\none of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your\nbest and fleetest horses.\"\n\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus\nby the hand. \"My friend,\" said he, \"I see that you are going to be a\ngreat hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are\nstill so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell in\nheaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who shewed\nsuch favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy queen,\" he\ncontinued, \"vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good wife,\nand my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed\nheifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the\nyoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to\nhis own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got\nthere and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them\na bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took\nthe lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much\nand made drink offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove.\nThen, when they had made their drink offerings and had drunk each as\nmuch as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own\nabode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the\ngateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left\nhim. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\nqueen his wife by his side.\n\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left\nhis couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble\nthat stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of\ngods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of\nHades; so Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the\npublic weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,\nEchephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son\nwas Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with\nthem. Nestor then addressed them.\n\n\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first\nand foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested\nherself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or\nother of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,\nand come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus' ship,\nand invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel.\nSome one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the\nhorns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the\nmaids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats,\nand logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some\nclear spring water.\"\n\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship; the\ngoldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his\ngold, and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out\nthe gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess\nmight have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought\nher in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that\nhad a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of\nbarley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to\nstrike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with\nwashing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many\na prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer's head upon the\nfire.\n\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal {32}\nThrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke\nthat cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the\ndaughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife\nEurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight.\nThen they lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus\ncut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\nher up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\nround in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top\nof them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over\nthem, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in\ntheir hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward\nmeats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the\nspits and toasted them over the fire.\n\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed\nTelemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she\nbrought him a fair mantle and shirt, {33} and he looked like a god as\nhe came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When\nthe outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to\ndinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink Nestor said, \"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to\nthe chariot that he may start at once.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet\nhorses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision\nof bread, wine, and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then\nTelemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins\nand took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew\nforward nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of\nPylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon\ntheir necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land.\nThen they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles\nentertained them hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\nDawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove out through the\ngateway under the echoing gatehouse. {34} Pisistratus lashed the horses\non and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn\nlands of the open country, and in the course of time completed their\njourney, so well did their steeds take them. {35}\n\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\n\n\nBook IV\n\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY--MEANWHILE THE SUITORS\nIN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\n\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight\nto the abode of Menelaus {36} [and found him in his own house, feasting\nwith his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also of\nhis daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was\nstill at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he\nwas sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons\nover whom Achilles' son was reigning. For his only son he had found a\nbride from Sparta, {37} the daughter of Alector. This son, Megapenthes,\nwas born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven vouchsafed Helen no more\nchildren after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as golden Venus\nherself.\n\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry\nin his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre,\nwhile two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the\nman struck up with his tune.] {38}\n\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\nwhereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\nthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close\nup to him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two\nmen, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their\nhorses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?\"\n\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never\nused to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses\nout, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;\nyou and I have staid often enough at other people's houses before we got\nback here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward.\"\n\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They\ntook their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the\nmangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned\nthe chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into\nthe house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when they saw it,\nfor its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had\nadmired everything to their heart's content, they went into the bath\nroom and washed themselves.\n\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by\nthe side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\nhands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\nthem bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\nhouse, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and\nset cups of gold by their side.\n\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you have\ndone supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as\nyou cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of\nsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you\nare.\"\n\nOn this he handed them {39} a piece of fat roast loin, which had been\nset near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the\ngood things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat\nand drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close\nthat no one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart,\nsee the gleam of bronze and gold--of amber, {40} ivory, and silver.\nEverything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\nJove. I am lost in admiration.\"\n\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \"No one, my sons, can hold his own\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but among\nmortal men--well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I\nhave, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and have\nundergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could\nget home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians;\nI went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to\nLibya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep\nlamb down three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master\nor man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes yield\nall the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered\nthrough the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in\nbeing lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must\nhave told you about all this, and of my heavy loss in the ruin {41} of a\nstately mansion fully and magnificently furnished. Would that I had only\na third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home, and all those\nwere living who perished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I often\ngrieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At times\nI cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is\ncold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may,\nI do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for\nno one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did.\nHe took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he\nhas been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or\ndead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son\nTelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in\ngrief on his account.\"\n\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought\nhim of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus\nmentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands.\nWhen Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time\nfor speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all about.\n\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her\na seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver\nwork-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in\nEgyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave\nMenelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of\ngold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to\nwit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on wheels, with a\ngold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full\nof fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was\nlaid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the\nfootstool, and began to question her husband. {42}\n\n\"Do we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\nhave come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?--but I cannot help\nsaying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like\nsomebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think)\nas this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind\nhim, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on\naccount of my most shameless self.\"\n\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you do.\nHis hands and feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape\nof his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking\nabout Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my account, tears\nfell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\n\nThen Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and\nis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose\nconversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,\nsent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could\ngive him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home\nwhen his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this\nis how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is\nno one among his own people to stand by him.\"\n\n\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\nthe son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake.\nI had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when\nheaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have\nfounded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have\nmade him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and\nshould have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that\nare subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\nand nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an\nintercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good\nfortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\nall.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\nTelemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom\nthe son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\n\n\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me\nyou were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be\npossible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am\ngetting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon\nI care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all\nwe can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and\nwring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he\nwas by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him--his\nname was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that\nhe was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.\"\n\n\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\nIt is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man\nis son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and\noffspring--and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days,\ngiving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are\nboth well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all this\nweeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over our\nhands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the morning.\"\n\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\nand they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\n\nThen Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\nthe wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\nWhoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest\nof the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop down\ndead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes.\nThis drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen\nby Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts\nof herbs, some good to put into the mixing bowl and others poisonous.\nMoreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for\nthey are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this drug in the\nbowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said:\n\n\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,\nand can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I\ntell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the\nexploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,\nand you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself\nwith wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the\nenemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different\nfrom what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise\nhe entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me.\nWhen, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes,\nand after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans\ntill he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me\nall that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got much\ninformation before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the\nTrojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my\nheart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was unhappy about\nthe wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from\nmy country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no\nmeans deficient either in person or understanding.\"\n\nThen Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is\ntrue. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but\nI have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,\nand what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the\nbravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction\nupon the Trojans. {43} At that moment you came up to us; some god\nwho wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place\nand pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked\nall our wives--Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what\na noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds whether to\nspring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but Ulysses\nheld us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Anticlus, who\nwas beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two brawny hands\nover his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that saved us all, for\nhe muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.\"\n\n\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of no avail to save\nhim, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us\nall to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\"\n\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in\nthe gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So\nthe maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which\na man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did\nTelemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son\nof Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.\n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose\nand dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\ngirded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an\nimmortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\n\n\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\nLacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about\nit.\"\n\n\"I have come, sir,\" replied Telemachus, \"to see if you can tell me\nanything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my\nfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep\nkilling great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying\ntheir addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if\nhaply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you saw\nit with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller; for he was\na man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for myself,\nbut tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father\nUlysses ever did you loyal service either by word or deed, when you\nAchaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my\nfavour and tell me truly all.\"\n\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\n\"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay\nher new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the\nforest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair\nwill make short work with the pair of them--and so will Ulysses with\nthese suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still\nthe man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and\nthrew him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him--if he is still\nsuch and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift\nand a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I will not\nprevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\n\n\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for\nmy hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very\nstrict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship\ncan sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an\nisland called Pharos--it has a good harbour from which vessels can\nget out into open sea when they have taken in water--and here the gods\nbecalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help\nme forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men would\nhave starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in\nthe person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for\nshe had taken a great fancy to me.\n\n\"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the\nmen used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the\nhope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.\n'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starving in this\nway--at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day\nafter day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by\ninches.'\n\n\"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\nto be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods\nknow everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in\nthis way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my\nhome.'\n\n\"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. There\nis an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name\nis Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is\nNeptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of\nthe sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you about\nyour voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the\nsea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so will, all\nthat has been going on at your house both good and bad, while you have\nbeen away on your long and dangerous journey.'\n\n\"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a\ngod is not easily caught--not by a mortal man.'\n\n\"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. About the\ntime when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea\ncomes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the\nwater over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to\nsleep in a great sea cave, where the seals--Halosydne's chickens as they\ncall them--come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals\nall round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they bring with\nthem. {44} Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this place and\nwill lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have\nin your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old man will\nplay you.\n\n\"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he\nhas seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep\namong them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is\nasleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for he\nwill do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself into\nevery kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become also\nboth fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him tighter\nand tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was\nwhen you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him\ngo; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you,\nand what you must do to reach your home over the seas.'\n\n\"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\nthe place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was\nclouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper\nready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\n\n\"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the three\nmen on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by\nthe sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched\nme up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just\nskinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then she dug\nfour pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up.\nWhen we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after\nthe other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would\nhave been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most\ndistressing {45}--who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\nhelp it?--but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\nthat gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's\nnostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\n{46}\n\n\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals\ncome up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the old man\nof the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over\nthem and counted them. We were among the first he counted, and he never\nsuspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had\ndone counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on\nwhich he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first\ninto a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon,\na leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water, and then\nagain directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold,\ntill at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said,\n'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with\nyou for snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do you want?'\n\n\"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing\nby trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this\nisland, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing\nall heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail\nthe sea so as to reach my home?'\n\n\"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\nyou must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your\nfriends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven-fed\nstream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that\nreign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your\nvoyage.'\n\n\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and\nterrible voyage to Egypt; {47} nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do all,\nold man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true,\nwhether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set\nsail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came\nto a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the\ndays of his fighting were done.'\n\n\"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know what\nI can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my\nstory. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many\nstill remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans\nperished during their return home. As for what happened on the field of\nbattle--you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,\nalive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove\nhim on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe\nout of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have\nescaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the\ngods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when\nNeptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny\nhands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained\nwhere it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong\ninto the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was\ndrowned.\n\n\"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when\nhe was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught\nby a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his\nwill, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but\nwhere Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as though\nhe was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind into its\nold quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native\nsoil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own country.\n\n\"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and\nto whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking\nout for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the\nslip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by,\nhe went and told Aegisthus, who at once began to lay a plot for him. He\npicked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on\none side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet.\nThen he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to\nthe feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of\nthe doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was\nover as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not one of\nAgamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus', but\nthey were all killed there in the cloisters.'\n\n\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down\nupon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear to live\nnor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of\nweeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, 'Son\nof Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can\ndo no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can,\nfor Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been\nbeforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his\nfuneral.'\n\n\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom\nyou spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is\nhe dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'\n\n\"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\nCalypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for\nhe has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own\nend, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you to\nthe Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There fair-haired\nRhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any where else in\nthe world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but\nOceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea,\nand gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you because you\nhave married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'\n\n\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went\nalong. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put\nour masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took\nour seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I\nagain stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\nhecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\nheaven's anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his\nname might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for\nthe gods sent me a fair wind.\n\n\"And now for yourself--stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I\nwill then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a\nchariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice\nthat so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a\ndrink-offering to the immortal gods.\"\n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" replied Telemachus, \"do not press me to stay longer; I\nshould be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I find\nyour conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at\nhome with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already\nimpatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any present you\nmay be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should be a piece of\nplate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but will leave them\nto adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom\nwhere lotus thrives, as also meadow-sweet and wheat and barley, and oats\nwith their white and spreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither\nopen fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than\nhorses, and I like it the better for that. {48} None of our islands have\nmuch level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.\"\n\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. \"What you\nsay,\" said he, \"shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by Vulcan's\nown hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.\nPhaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit\nwhich I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey. I will\nmake you a present of it.\"\n\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king's house. They\nbrought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them to\ntake with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts].\n{49}\n\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at\na mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who were\ntheir ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were sitting\ntogether when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous,\n\n\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet\nbroken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.\"\n\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\nTelemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was\nonly away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the\nswineherd; so Antinous said, \"When did he go? Tell me truly, and\nwhat young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\nbondsmen--for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him\nhave the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take\nit without your leave?\"\n\n\"I lent it him,\" answered Noemon, \"what else could I do when a man of\nhis position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him? I\ncould not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the\nbest young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain--or some\ngod who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor\nhere myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for\nPylos.\"\n\nNoemon then went back to his father's house, but Antinous and Eurymachus\nwere very angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to come\nand sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous son of\nEupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes\nflashed fire as he said:\n\n\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we\nhad made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has\ngot away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving\nus trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find me\na ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for\nhim in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day\nthat he set out to try and get news of his father.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all of\nthem went inside the buildings.\n\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were\nplotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the\nouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell\nhis mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:\n\"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids\nto leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they\nmay neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\nbut let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my\nson's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children, how\ngood Ulysses had been to them--never doing anything high-handed, nor\nspeaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they\nmay take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did\nan unjust thing by anybody--which shows what bad hearts you have, and\nthat there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.\"\n\nThen Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\nplotting something much more dreadful now--may heaven frustrate their\ndesign. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home\nfrom Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.\"\n\nThen Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.\nAt last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What business had\nhe to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like\nsea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to\nkeep up his name?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Medon, \"whether some god set him on to it, or\nwhether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his\nfather was dead, or alive and on his way home.\"\n\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.\nThere were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for\nsitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of\nher own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old\nand young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a\ntransport of sorrow she exclaimed,\n\n\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and\nlion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose\nname was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son\nis at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word\nabout his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so\nmuch as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you\nvery well knew when he was starting. If I had known he meant taking this\nvoyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent\nupon it, or leave me a corpse behind him--one or other. Now, however,\ngo some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my father on my\nmarriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything\nto Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public\nsympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his\nown race and that of Ulysses.\"\n\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or let\nme live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the\nreal truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in\nthe way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I\nwould not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you\nasked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to\nspoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change\nyour dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Minerva,\ndaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he\nbe in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough\nalready. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son\nof Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him,\nand inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round\nit.\"\n\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the\ntears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and\nwent upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a\nbasket and began praying to Minerva.\n\n\"Hear me,\" she cried, \"Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If\never Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or\nheifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son\nfrom the villainy of the suitors.\"\n\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;\nmeanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,\nand one of them said:\n\n\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. Little\ndoes she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\"\n\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.\nThen Antinous said, \"Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some\nof it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about\nwhich we are all of a mind.\"\n\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the\nsea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and sails\ninside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs\nof leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while\ntheir fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the ship\nfast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and\nwaited till night should fall.\n\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and\nwondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the\nwicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming\nher in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into a\nslumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\nthe likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had\nmarried Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the\nhouse of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into\nher room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door\nto, and hovered over her head saying,\n\n\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you\nto weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet\ncome back to you.\"\n\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\n\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to\nleave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?\nI, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good\nquality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\nmiddle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship--a\nfoolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going\nabout among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than\nabout my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest\nsomething should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has\ngone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against him,\nand are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\n\nThen the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is\none gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by\nhis side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who\nhas sent me to bear you this message.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\ndivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one--is he\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\n\nAnd the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he is\nalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.\"\n\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\ninto thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted,\nso vivid had been her dream.\n\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the\nsea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\nAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and\nthere is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then\nthe Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.\n\n\nBook V\n\nCALYPSO--ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\n\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus--harbinger of light\nalike to mortals and immortals--the gods met in council and with them,\nJove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to\ntell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away\nthere in the house of the nymph Calypso.\n\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"and all you other gods that live in\neverlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope\nthey will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of\nhis subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were\ntheir father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells\nthe nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to\nhis own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him\nover the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder his\nonly son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where\nhe has been to see if he can get news of his father.\"\n\n\"What, my dear, are you talking about?\" replied her father, \"did you not\nsend him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to\nget home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to\nprotect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors\nhave to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you are\nour messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor\nUlysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men,\nbut after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach\nfertile Scheria, {50} the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to\nthe gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves. They\nwill send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him more\nbronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy,\nif he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\nfriends.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as\nhe was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with\nwhich he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand\nwith which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he\npleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped\ndown through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose\nwaves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and\ncorner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He\nflew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\nisland which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on by land\ntill he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\n\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and\none could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal\nwood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden\nshuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there\nwas a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,\nwherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests--owls, hawks, and\nchattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine\nloaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of\nthe cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut\npretty close together, and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate\nthe beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. {51}\nEven a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot,\nso Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it\nsufficiently he went inside the cave.\n\nCalypso knew him at once--for the gods all know each other, no matter\nhow far they live from one another--but Ulysses was not within; he was\non the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears\nin his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso\ngave Mercury a seat and said: \"Why have you come to see me,\nMercury--honoured, and ever welcome--for you do not visit me often? Say\nwhat you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be\ndone at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.\"\n\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed\nhim some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,\nand then said:\n\n\"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I\nhave come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove\nsent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all\nthis way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer\nme sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none\nof us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says that\nyou have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine years\nbefore the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after\nhaving sacked it. On their way home they sinned against Minerva, {52}\nwho raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave\ncompanions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide.\nJove says that you are to let this man go at once, for it is decreed\nthat he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but shall return\nto his house and country and see his friends again.\"\n\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, \"You gods,\" she\nexclaimed, \"ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous\nand hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with\nhim in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion,\nyou precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him\nin Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to\nhim in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so\nvery long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now you are angry\nwith me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting\nall alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning\nand sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him\nand cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that\nhe should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor\nbring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the\nman go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself\nfor I have neither ships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will\nreadily give him such advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to\nbring him safely to his own country.\"\n\n\"Then send him away,\" said Mercury, \"or Jove will be angry with you and\npunish you\".\n\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for\nshe had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beach with\nhis eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for\nhe had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her\nin the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As for\nthe day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore, weeping,\ncrying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea.\nCalypso then went close up to him said:\n\n\"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life\nout any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go,\ncut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper\ndeck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine,\nand water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you\nclothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in\nheaven so will it--for they know more about these things, and can settle\nthem better than I can.\"\n\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. \"Now goddess,\" he answered, \"there is\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home\nwhen you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not\neven a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant\nvoyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft\nunless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.\"\n\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: \"You know a great\ndeal,\" said she, \"but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and\nearth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx--and this\nis the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take--that I mean you\nno sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I should do\nmyself in your place. I am dealing with you quite straightforwardly; my\nheart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry for you.\"\n\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till\nthey came to Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury\nhad just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that\nmortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and\nthey laid their hands on the good things that were before them. When\nthey had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso spoke,\nsaying:\n\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own\nland at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much\nsuffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country,\nyou would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me\nmake you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this wife\nof yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet I\nflatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she\nis, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in\nbeauty with an immortal.\"\n\n\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"do not be angry with me about this. I\nam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.\nNevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some\ngod wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best\nof it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let\nthis go with the rest.\"\n\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into\nthe inner part of the cave and went to bed.\n\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on\nhis shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer\nfabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her\nwaist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how\nshe could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great bronze\naxe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a\nbeautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a\nsharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where the\nlargest trees grew--alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky--very\ndry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water. {53}\nThen, when she had shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went\nhome, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished doing. He cut down\ntwenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by rule in good\nworkmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so\nhe bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts and\nrivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam\nof a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a\ngunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder\nto steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood.\nBy and by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made\nthese too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of\nall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\n\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\nsent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\nclothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger\none of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found\nhim in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for\nhim, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat and\nguided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his\neyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on\nthe Bear--which men also call the wain, and which turns round and round\nwhere it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of\nOceanus--for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven\nand ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,\nrising like a shield on the horizon.\n\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see\nhim sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his\nhead and muttered to himself, saying, \"Good heavens, so the gods have\nbeen changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\nand now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\nthat he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\nhe shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\"\n\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\nit round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till\nearth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of\nthe heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all\nat the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses' heart\nbegan to fail him. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in his dismay, \"what ever\nwill become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should\nhave trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How\nblack is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds\nare raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest\nand thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause\nof the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the\nTrojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured\nmy name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.\"\n\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft\nreeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the\nhelm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast\nhalf way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long\ntime Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the\nsurface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down;\nbut at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine\nthat was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,\nhowever, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could\ntowards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape\ndrowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the\nSouth, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and\nshuttlecock with it at once.\n\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called\nLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been\nsince raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great\ndistress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like\na sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.\n\n\"My poor good man,\" said she, \"why is Neptune so furiously angry with\nyou? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster\nhe will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid\nyou; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the\nPhaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my veil and\nput it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm\nso long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off, throw it\nback as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again.\" With these\nwords she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again\nlike a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\n\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in\nhis dismay, \"this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me\nto ruin by advising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at\npresent, for the land where she said I should be quit of all troubles\nseemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do--I am sure it\nwill be best--no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long\nas her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I will swim\nfor it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.\"\n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that\nseemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,\nwhich then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed\nabout by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon\nit as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso\nhad given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged into the\nsea--meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,\nand wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, \"There now, swim\nup and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people.\nI do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\nlightly.\" On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his\npalace is.\n\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the\nwinds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good\nstiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses\nreached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\n\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with\na heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the\nthird day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much\nas a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly\nahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when\ntheir dear father begins to get better after having for a long time\nborne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods\ndeliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land\nand trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set\nfoot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he began to\nhear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still broke\nagainst them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind,\nbut only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\n\nUlysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\nhimself, \"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I\nhad given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is\nrocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea,\nwith deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for want of\nfoot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash\nme against the rocks as I leave the water--which would give me a\nsorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some\nshelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea again\nsorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the\ndeep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\nNeptune is very angry with me.\"\n\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such\nforce against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to\npieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the\nrock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave\nretired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on again\nand carried him back with it far into the sea--tearing his hands as the\nsuckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and\nthe stones come up along with it--even so did the rocks tear the skin\nfrom his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the\nwater.\n\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He\nswam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against\nthe land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to\nsee if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves\naslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and\nhere he thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it\nafforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he\nprayed inwardly and said:\n\n\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the\nsea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost\nhis way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my\ndistress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your\nriverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your\nsuppliant.\"\n\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\nbefore him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\nat last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\ncompletely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\nnostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\nbreathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\nwhen he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the\nscarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt {54} stream\nof the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that\nbore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the\nrushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.\n\n\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will become of me,\nand how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the\nlong watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and\ndamp may make an end of me--for towards sunrise there will be a keen\nwind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill\nside, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape\nthe cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may take\nadvantage of me and devour me.\"\n\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\nupon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\ntwo shoots of olive that grew from a single stock--the one an ungrafted\nsucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\ncould break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays\npierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\ninto one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\na bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\nabout--enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\nwinter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down\nand heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the\ncountry, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the\nashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did\nUlysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep\nupon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his\nsorrows.\n\n\nBook VI\n\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\n\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off\nto the country and city of the Phaeacians--a people who used to live in\nthe fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes\nwere stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous\nmoved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other\npeople. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,\nand divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to\nthe house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired\nof heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\n\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\nslept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King\nAlcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,\none on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's\ndaughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then,\ncoming up to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over\nher head and said:\n\n\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going\nto be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed\nyourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This is\nthe way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother\nproud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day,\nand start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have\neverything ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men among\nyour own people are courting you, and you are not going to remain a\nmaid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and mules\nready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for\nthe washing-cisterns are some way from the town.\"\n\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say\nis the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and\nneither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine\nand in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are\nillumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess\nwent when she had given instructions to the girl.\n\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about\nher dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her\nfather and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her\nmother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her\nmaids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was\ngoing out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian\naldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\n\n\"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want to\ntake all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the chief\nman here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when\nyou attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at\nhome, two of them married, while the other three are good looking\nbachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to\na dance, and I have been thinking about all this.\"\n\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,\nbut her father knew and said, \"You shall have the mules, my love, and\nwhatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall\nget you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your\nclothes.\"\n\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\ndown from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\nprepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a\ngoat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and her mother\ngave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint\nthemselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on,\nwhereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled\nwithout flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes,\nbut the maids also who were with her.\n\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,\nthrough which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\nquantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules\nand turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the\nwater side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the\nwater, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the\ndirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid\nthem out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of\nshingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with\nolive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and\nwaited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done\ndinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to\nplay at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes\nforth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or\ndeer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their\nsport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a\nfull head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole\nbevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.\n\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how\nUlysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him\nto the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one\nof the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they\nall shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed\nof leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.\n\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself, \"what kind of people have I come amongst?\nAre they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I\nseem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of\nthe nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows of\ngreen grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me try\nif I cannot manage to get a look at them.\"\n\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\ncovered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\nlion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and\ndefying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of\noxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\ninto a well fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep--even such did\nUlysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he\nwas, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed\nwith salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that jutted\nout into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva\nput courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood\nright in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up to\nher, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or\nstay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show him\nthe way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to entreat her from a\ndistance in case the girl should take offence at his coming near enough\nto clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive\nlanguage.\n\n\"O queen,\" he said, \"I implore your aid--but tell me, are you a goddess\nor are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I\ncan only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana, for your face\nand figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal\nand live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother--thrice\nhappy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted\nthey must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to a\ndance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts have\nbeen the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never yet saw any\none so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in admiration as I\nbehold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when\nI was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo--for I was there, too,\nwith much people after me, when I was on that journey which has been the\nsource of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out\nof the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I\nnow admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I\nam in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been\ntossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the\nway from the Ogygian island, {55} and now fate has flung me upon this\ncoast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think that\nI have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has still much\nevil in store for me.\n\n\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I\nhave met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to\nyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to\nwrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's\ndesire--husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\nbetter in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a\nhouse. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends\nglad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\"\n\nTo this Nausicaa answered, \"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what\nhe has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however, that\nyou have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes nor\nfor anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for.\nI will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of our\npeople; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in whom\nthe whole power of the state is vested.\"\n\nThen she called her maids and said, \"Stay where you are, you girls. Can\nyou not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a\nrobber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do\nus Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a\nland's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with\nany other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and\nwe must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress\nare under Jove's protection, and will take what they can get and be\nthankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,\nand wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the\nwind.\"\n\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another\nback. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told\nthem, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the\nlittle golden cruse of oil, and told him to go and wash in the stream.\nBut Ulysses said, \"Young women, please to stand a little on one side\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,\nfor it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I\ncannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to\nstrip {56} before a number of good looking young women.\"\n\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\nwashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and\nfrom his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had\ngot the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put\non the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him look\ntaller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on\nthe top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she\nglorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who has\nstudied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece of\nsilver plate by gilding it--and his work is full of beauty. Then he went\nand sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and\nhandsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to\nher maids:\n\n\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw\nhim I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods\nwho dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such\nanother as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away.\nHowever, give him something to eat and drink.\"\n\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\nfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she\ntook her seat, she called Ulysses:\n\n\"Stranger,\" said she, \"rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you\nthat you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure\nand do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as\nwe are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the\nwaggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently,\nhowever, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall\nrunning all round it, and a good harbour on either side with a narrow\nentrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side,\nfor every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the\nmarket place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved\nwith large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear\nof all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places\nwhere oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers;\nthey know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and\npride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel\nfar over the sea.\n\n\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\nfellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-looking stranger that\nis going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is\ngoing to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken\nfrom some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at\nlast come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to\nlive with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good thing if she\nwould take herself off and find a husband somewhere else, for she will\nnot look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who are in love\nwith her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made\nabout me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be scandalised\nat seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite\nof everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\n\n\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you\nhome, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the\nroad side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all\nround it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about as far\nfrom the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for\na while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father's\nhouse. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into the town\nand ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will have no\ndifficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one\nelse in the whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has.\nWhen you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right\nacross the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her\nsitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a\nfine sight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts\nwith her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of\nmy father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind\nhim, but go up to my mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you\nwould get home quickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see\nyour own country again, no matter how distant it may be.\"\n\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\nThe mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\nShe was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\njudgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of\nMinerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of\nJove.\n\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear\nme now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking me.\nNow, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and\nbe hospitably received by the Phaeacians.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show\nherself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was\nstill furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.\n\n\nBook VII\n\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\n\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\ntown. When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway,\nand her brothers--comely as the gods--gathered round her, took the mules\nout of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she\nwent to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit\nthe fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.\n\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he\nwas just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a\nlittle girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and\nUlysses said:\n\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\ntown and country.\"\n\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\n\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\nthey reached the king's house Minerva said:\n\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter\nof Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his\nill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\n\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\ngreat Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous; {58} Apollo killed the first of them while\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\n\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\ncountry.\"\n\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\nthe hook of the door was of gold.\n\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\n\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\ncourt to the house itself, and the town's people draw water from it.\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\nhouse of king Alcinous.\n\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\n\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may\nheaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them\nby the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for\nI have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\n\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\naddressed them thus:\n\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger should\nbe seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to\nhear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat\non a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and\nwater that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord of thunder,\nwho takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let\nthe housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the\nhouse.\"\n\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one\nof the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\n\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\n\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" {62}\n\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\nthe greatness of my house.\" {63}\n\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\nwas minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\n\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\nin the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the cunning and\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\n\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\nyour shores.\n\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\nwas westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing upon the\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\nyou the whole truth.\"\n\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\"\n\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She did\ntell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,\nfor I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human\nbeing is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how\nmuch you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter,\nand become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and\nan estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your\nown wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the\nmatter of your escort. You can sleep {64} during the whole voyage if you\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own\nhome, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further\noff than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took\nyellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the\nfurthest of any place--and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day\nwithout distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You\nwill thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent\noarsmen my sailors are.\"\n\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant that\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the\nroom that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to\nwear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when\nthey had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, \"Rise, sir\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\" and glad indeed was\nhe to go to his rest.\n\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by\nhis side.\n\n\nBook VIII\n\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS--THE GAMES.\n\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous\nand Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place\nof assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat down\nside by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form\nof one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in order to help\nUlysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said,\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly\nall of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long\nvoyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.\"\n\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was\nstruck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him\nabout the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he\nreally was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a\nvery remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill\nto which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got together,\nAlcinous spoke:\n\n\"Hear me,\" said he, \"aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,\nhas found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or\nWest. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let\nus then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;\nindeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain\nof me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into\nthe sea--one that has never yet made a voyage--and man her with two and\nfifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast\nyour oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to\nprepare a feast. {65} I will find you in everything. I am giving these\ninstructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards\nyou aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining\nour guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have\nDemodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may\nchoose to sing about.\"\n\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\nservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to\nthe sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew\nthe ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due\ncourse, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a\nlittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house\nof King Alcinous. The out houses, {66} yards, and all the precincts were\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and\nAlcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen.\nThese they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\n\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had\ndearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though\nshe had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of\nhis eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it\nup against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his\nhead, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also\nset a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of\nwine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.\n\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\ninspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\na matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on\none another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad\nwhen he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo\nhad foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to\nconsult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will\nof Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\n\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he\nwas weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his\neyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to\nthe gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for\nthey delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his\nhead and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who\nwas sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So\nhe at once said, \"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we\nhave had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is\nits due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports,\nso that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends\nhow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and\nrunners.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\nservant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief\nmen of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several\nthousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent\ncompetitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,\nPrymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus, and\nAmphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus son of\nNaubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking man\namong the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\n\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he\nleft every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple\nof mules can plough in a fallow field. {67} They then turned to the\npainful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man.\nAmphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc\nthere was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son Laodamas\nwas the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all\nbeen diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger whether he excels\nin any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs,\ncalves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all\nold, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea\nfor making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"go up to your guest\nand speak to him about it yourself.\"\n\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\nand said to Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some\none or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them--and\nyou must have gone in for many a one before now. There is nothing that\ndoes any one so much credit all his life long as the showing himself a\nproper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something,\nand banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long\ndelayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is\nfound.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is\nset rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble,\nand am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people\nto further me on my return home.\"\n\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that you\nare unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I\nsuppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships\nas captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward\nfreights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the\nathlete about you.\"\n\n\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\nfellow--so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but\nheaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms\nevery one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with\nhim so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever\nhe goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but his\ngood looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No god\ncould make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool. Your\nill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are quite\nmistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the\nage. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone\nthrough much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary\nsea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts have\nstung me to the quick.\"\n\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves. {68} Then, swinging it back, he\nthrew it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\nhe did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as\nit sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been\nmade yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where\nit had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could easily tell your\nmark by groping for it--it is so far ahead of any other. You may make\nyour mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near to\nsuch a throw as yours.\"\n\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come up to\nthat throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even\nheavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I\nam exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it\nis, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I\nam his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal friend.\nAt least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest\nto challenge his host's family at any game, especially when he is in a\nforeign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if he\ndoes; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to\nhave the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand\nat every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent\narcher. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my\narrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.\nPhiloctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when we\nAchaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one else\nin the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of the\nearth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as\nHercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian--men who could shoot against the gods\nthemselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end,\nfor Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an\narrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of\nthe Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at\nsea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.\"\n\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \"Sir, we have\nhad much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I\nunderstand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been\ndispleased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one\nof our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who\nknows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,\nand will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with\nyourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary\naptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly\nremarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly\nfleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good\ndinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen,\nwarm baths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best\ndancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able\nto tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors,\nrunners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my\nhouse, so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.\"\n\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house,\nand the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was\ntheir business to manage everything connected with the sports, so\nthey made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his\nplace in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town\nbegan to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the\nmerry twinkling of their feet.\n\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how\nthey first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus\nmany presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the sun, who\nsaw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he\nheard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,\ngot his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which\nnone could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in\nthat place. {69} When he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom\nand festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also\nlet many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god\ncould see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread\nthe chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one\nhe was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he\nsaw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\n\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took\nher hand in his own, \"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at\nhome, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is\nbarbarous.\"\n\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too\nlate that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had\nturned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him what\nwas going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule\nmaking a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.\n\n\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods who live for\never, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will\nshow you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am\nlame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas\nI am a cripple--but my parents are to blame for that, not I; they ought\nnever to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together asleep on\nmy bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very fond of one\nanother, but I do not think they will lie there longer than they can\nhelp, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there, however, they\nshall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for his\nbaggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\"\n\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the\ngoddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all\ngood things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with\ninextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,\nwhereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\n\n\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god\nin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\n\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \"Messenger\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\"\n\n\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\nthough there were three times as many chains--and you might look on, all\nof you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.\"\n\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took\nit all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again.\n\"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require, that\nhe shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the\nimmortal gods.\"\n\n\"Do not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me to do this; a bad man's bond is bad\nsecurity; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away\nand leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\n\n\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\nI will pay you myself.\" So Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot and\nmust not refuse you.\"\n\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\nfree they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to\nCyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with\nburnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil\nof ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her\nin raiment of the most enchanting beauty.\n\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were\ncharmed as they heard him.\n\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no\none to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made\nfor them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards\nthe clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it\nwith ease before it came down again. When they had done throwing the\nball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time\nkept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all\nthe young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their\nfeet. Then Ulysses said:\n\n\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the\nworld, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished\nas I saw them.\"\n\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians,\n\"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of\nsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as\nhe may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and\ncounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean\ncloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in\na lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a\nlight heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\npresent too, for he has been rude.\"\n\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\nsent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He\nshall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of\nsilver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which\nit fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\"\n\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, \"Good\nluck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the\nwinds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,\nfor I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone\nthrough much hardship.\"\n\nTo which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck to you too my friend, and may the\ngods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you\nhave given me along with your apology.\"\n\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of\nthe donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his\nsons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then\nAlcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.\n\n\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest we\nhave, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the\nfire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to\nthe careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made\nhim; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that\nwill follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet--which is of\nexquisite workmanship--that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his\nlife whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.\"\n{70}\n\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as\nthey could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear\nfire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot\nas the flame played about the belly of the tripod. {71} Meanwhile Arete\nbrought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she packed\nall the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had\nbrought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous, and\nsaid to Ulysses:\n\n\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for\nfear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your\nship.\" {72}\n\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\nservant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad\nof a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he\nleft the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken\nas good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had\ndone washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak\nand shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting\nover their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts\nsupporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as she saw him\npass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do not forget me when you are safe\nat home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having\nsaved your life.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the\nmighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I bless\nyou as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.\"\n\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the\nfavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near\none of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean\nagainst it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of\nfat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,\n\"Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for\nall the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;\nbards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse\nteaches them their songs and loves them.\"\n\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took\nit and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and\ndrink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, \"Demodocus, there is no one in the\nworld whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the\nMuse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the\nreturn of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you\nwere not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who\nwas. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse\nwhich Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got\nby stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who\nafterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will\ntell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.\"\n\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of\nthe Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden\nwithin the horse, {73} were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place\nof assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their\nfortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and\nwere in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it\nup then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock\non which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while\nyet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\nfor the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city\nwas doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest\nof the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans.\nAnon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and\nsacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they\noverran the city hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went\nraging like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was\nthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's\nhelp he was victorious.\n\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\nherself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She\nscreams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for\nbreath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back\nand shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and\nsorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks--even so piteously did\nUlysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\n\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\nhis song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From\nthe moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our\nguest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently\nin great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we\nare making with so much good will are wholly in his honour, and any\none with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to\ntreat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\n\n\"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your\nfather and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were\nknown among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one,\nneither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for\npeople's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.\nTell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape\ntheir purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have\nno pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations have,\nbut the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking\nabout and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole\nworld, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered\nwith mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or\ncoming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father say that\nNeptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the matter of\ngiving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should wreck a\nship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, {74} and\nbury our city under a high mountain. This is what my father used to say,\nbut whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he\nwill decide for himself.\n\n\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and\nin what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves,\nand of their cities--who were hostile, savage and uncivilised, and who,\non the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made\nso unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from Troy.\nThe gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order\nthat future generations might have something to sing about. Did you\nlose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before Troy? a\nson-in-law or father-in-law--which are the nearest relations a man has\noutside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and kindly-natured\ncomrade--for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?\"\n\n\nBook IX\n\nULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY---THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI,\nAND CYCLOPES.\n\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard\nwith such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or\nmore delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the\nguests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread\nand meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every\nman. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,\nsince you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my\nown sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet\nhow to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been\nlaid heavily upon me.\n\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and\none day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though I\nlive so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned\namong mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to\nheaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called Neritum,\ncovered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands\nvery near to one another--Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of\nZacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea\ntowards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. {75}\nIt is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none\nthat they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her\nin her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean\ngoddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there\nis nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and\nhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far\nfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will\ntell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove's will I met\nwith on my return from Troy.\n\n\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is\nthe city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to\nthe sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided\nequitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I\nthen said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly\nwould not obey me, so they staid there drinking much wine and killing\ngreat numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\ncried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more in\nnumber, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war,\nfor they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion\nserved; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and\nbloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were\nhard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts\naimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. {76} So long as the day\nwaxed and it was still morning, we held our own against them, though\nthey were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the\ntime when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we\nlost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those\nthat were left.\n\n\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we\nhad thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the\nhands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it\nblew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and\nnight sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the\ngale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took\nthem down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land.\nThere we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and\ndistress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again raised\nour masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen\ndirect our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed had not\nthe North wind and the currents been against me as I was doubling Cape\nMalea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.\n\n\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who\nlive on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take\nin fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near\nthe ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to\nsee what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had\na third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the\nLotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,\nwhich was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about\nhome, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to\nthem, but were for staying and munching lotus {77} with the Lotus-eaters\nwithout thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they wept\nbitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under the\nbenches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them\nshould taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home, so they\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.\n\n\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of\nthe lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor\nplough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and\ngrapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes\nyield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no\nlaws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of\nhigh mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no\naccount of their neighbours.\n\n\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite\nclose to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run\nwith wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never\ndisturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen--who as a rule will suffer so\nmuch hardship in forest or among mountain precipices--do not go there,\nnor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness\nuntilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it\nbut only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who\ncould make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,\nor sail over the sea to one another's country as people who have ships\ncan do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island, {78}\nfor it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season.\nThere are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea\nshore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there\nexcellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always\nyield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good\nharbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be\nmoored, but all one has to do is to beach one's vessel and stay there\ntill the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of\nthe harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and\nthere are poplars growing all round it.\n\n\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\nbrought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist\nhung all round our ships; {79} the moon was hidden behind a mass of\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for\nit, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before\nwe found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached\nthe ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach\ntill daybreak.\n\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On\nthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and\ndividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven\nsent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got\nnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to\nthe going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty\nof wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked\nthe city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we were\nfeasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes,\nwhich was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could\nalmost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and\ngoats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down\nupon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\n\n\"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while I go\nwith my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they are\nuncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'\n\n\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so\nthey took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When we\ngot to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near\nthe sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for\na great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with\na high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees\nboth pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then\naway from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with\nother people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature,\nnot like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that\nstands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain.\n\n\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all\nbut the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I also\ntook a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron,\nson of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, and\nlived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking\nthe city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and\nchild; so he made me some presents of great value--seven talents of fine\ngold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended,\nand of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew\nabout it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank\nit he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance\nfrom the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain\nfrom drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet\nfull of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to\ndeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect\nneither right nor law.\n\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside\nand took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded\nwith cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold.\nThey were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then\nthe oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones {80} all\nkept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls,\nand milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they\nsaw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and\nmake off with them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the\nlambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with them. It would have\nbeen indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for\nI wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me\na present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal\nwith.\n\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his\nsheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood\nto light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on\nto the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end\nof the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the\nshe-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and\nhe-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth\nof the cave--so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled waggons\nwould not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway. When\nhe had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due\ncourse, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half\nthe milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he\npoured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got\nthrough with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us,\nwhereon he said:\n\n\"'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do\nyou sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every\nman's hand against you?'\n\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\nform, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,\nbut by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far\nout of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who\nhas won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great\na city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show\nus some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may\nreasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven, for we\nare your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers under his\nprotection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in\ndistress.'\n\n\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you are\na fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed,\nabout fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care\nabout Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger\nthan they. I shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of\nany regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for doing so. And now\ntell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it\nround the point, or is she lying straight off the land?'\n\n\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in that\nway, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship on to\nthe rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven\non to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped\nthe jaws of death.'\n\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down\nupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore\nthem limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion\nin the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving\nanything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven\non seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but\nwhen the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his\nmeal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself\nfull length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at\nfirst inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals,\nbut I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we\nshould never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in\nfront of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till\nmorning came.\n\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit\nhis fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let\neach have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his\nwork, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his\nmorning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone\naway from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back\nagain--as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a\nquiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried\n'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was\nleft to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with\nglory.\n\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for\na staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could\nonly compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and\ntold them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,\nand lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire\nto make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of\nthem should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the\nmonster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom\nI should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch\ncame back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave--this\ntime driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I\nsuppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him\nto do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the\ndoor, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and\nthen let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all\nthis work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off\nthem. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my\nhands:\n\n\"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\nman's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a\ndrink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and\nfurther me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and\nraving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can\nyou expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this\nway?'\n\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of\nthe wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be so kind,' he said,\n'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make\nyou a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this\ncountry, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this\ndrinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.'\n\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and\nthree times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw\nthat the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as\nI could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,\ntherefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what\nmy father and mother and my friends have always called me.'\n\n\"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades before\nNoman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present\nthat I will make him.'\n\n\"As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of\nhuman flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I\nthrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged\nmy men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green\nthough it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing\nwith heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their\nhearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the\nmonster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it\nround and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an\nauger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye,\ntill the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and\nround, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids\nand eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a\nblacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it--for\nit is this that gives strength to the iron--and it makes a great hiss as\nhe does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive\nwood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a\nfright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye,\nand hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did\nso to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him;\nso they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him\ncrying, and asked what was the matter with him.\n\n\"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able\nto sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is\ntrying to kill you either by fraud or by force?'\n\n\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing\nme by fraud; no man is killing me by force.'\n\n\"'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when\nJove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray\nto your father Neptune.'\n\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about\nwith his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then\nhe sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch\nanyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish\nenough to attempt this.\n\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own\nlife and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows\nthat his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the\nend I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were well\ngrown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in\nthrees together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster\nused to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two\non either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each\nman. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I\ncaught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the thick wool under\nhis belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a\nfirm hold on it all the time.\n\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but\nwhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep\nhurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens\nwaiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their\nmaster in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they\nstood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were\nunderneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy\nwith its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid\nhold of it and said:\n\n\"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the\nmob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the\nfirst to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it\nbecause you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because\nthat wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and\nblinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and\ntalk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his\nbrains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus\nhave some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done me.'\n\n\"As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by\nconstantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them\ndown to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who\nhad escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.\nHowever, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to\nhush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once\nand put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote\nthe grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my\nvoice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\n\n\"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your man\nbefore eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your\nvisitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would\nfind you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.'\n\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that\nit was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. {81} The sea\nquaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised\ncarried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore.\nBut I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my\nmen by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they\nlaid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I\nwas for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of\nme to hold my tongue.\n\n\"'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage\ncreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us\nback again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death\nof us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have\npounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged\nrocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'\n\n\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,\n'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\nLaertes, who lives in Ithaca.'\n\n\"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy\nabout me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man\nboth brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an\nexcellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he\ngrew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and said\nI should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all along\nexpecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength, whereas\nhe turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has managed to\nblind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come here, then,\nUlysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality, and urge\nNeptune to help you forward on your journey--for Neptune and I are\nfather and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else\nneither god nor man can do.'\n\n\"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more\nthan Neptune to cure that eye of yours.'\n\n\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,\nsaying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\nget back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship\nand find trouble in his house.'] {82}\n\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up\na rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell\ninto it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way\ntowards the shore of the island.\n\n\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our\nreturn. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the\nsea shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them equitably\namongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram,\nmy companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I\nsacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Jove, who\nis the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how\nhe might destroy both my ships and my comrades.\n\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on\ndark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered\nDawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed\non with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we\nhad lost our comrades.\n\n\nBook X\n\nAEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.\n\n\"Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of\nHippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as\nit were) upon the sea, {83} iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,\nAeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry\nthe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,\nfeasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the\natmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till\nit groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well\nmade bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were\nthe people among whom we had now come.\n\n\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I\ntold him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go,\nand asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty,\nbut set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide\nto hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as\nin a sack--for Jove had made him captain over the winds, and he could\nstir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put\nthe sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread\nthat not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any quarter. The\nWest wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but\nit all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.\n\n\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native\nland showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the\nstubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light\nsleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might\nget home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves,\nand said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus\nhad given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,\n'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or\ncountry he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy,\nwhile we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with hands\nas empty as we set out with--and now Aeolus has given him ever so much\nmore. Quick--let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver\nthere is in the sack he gave him.'\n\n\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us\nweeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew\nnot whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best\nof it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while\nthe men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the\nAeolian island.\n\n\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by\nthe ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men\nand went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting\nwith his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold.\nThey were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses, what brings you\nhere? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further\nyou on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go\nto.'\n\n\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have undone\nme; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this\nmischief, for you can if you will.'\n\n\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\nfather answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you\ncome here as one abhorred of heaven.' And with these words he sent me\nsorrowing from his door.\n\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and\nfruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six\ndays, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the\nrocky stronghold of Lamus--Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,\nwhere the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]\nsalutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers\nthe salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn\ndouble wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,\nfor they work much the same by night as they do by day. {84}\n\n\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,\nwith a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their\nships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was\nnever so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I\nkept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the\npoint; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign\nneither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I\nsent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people\nthe inhabitants were.\n\n\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,\nand who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going\nto the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and\nwhen my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of\nthat country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she\ndirected them to her father's house, but when they got there they found\nhis wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified\nat the sight of her.\n\n\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,\nand forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,\nand began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other\ntwo ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\nraised a hue-and-cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians\nsprang up from every quarter--ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at\nus from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard\nthe horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the\ndeath cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes\nand took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men\nwithin the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and\ntold my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like\nthe rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough\nwhen we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us.\nAs for the others there was not one of them left.\n\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had\nlost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives--a\ngreat and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes--for\nthey are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus.\nWe brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god\nguided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two\nnights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day\ncame I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to\nreconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork,\nor hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I\nespied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of\ntrees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I\nwould not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it\nbest to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some\nof them instead of going myself.\n\n\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean\nthrough him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of\nhim. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid\nit down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a\nfathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of\nthe noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and\nwalked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too\nbig for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with\none hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men\nand spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. 'Look here my friends,'\nsaid I, 'we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and\nat any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat\nand drink on board.' On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea\nshore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then,\nwhen they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed\ntheir hands and began to cook him for dinner.\n\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed\nthere eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it\ncame on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, 'My friends,\nwe are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no\nidea where the sun either sets or rises, {85} so that we do not even\nknow East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try\nand find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as\nI could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the\nhorizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out\nof a thick forest of trees.'\n\n\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had\nbeen treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre\nPolyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to\nbe got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain\nover each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took command of\nthe other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon\nEurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as\nalso did we who were left behind.\n\n\"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on\na site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.\nThere were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it--poor\nbewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\ninto subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great\ntails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.\n{86} As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from\ndinner--for they know he will bring them something--even so did these\nwolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men\nwere terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently\nthey reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they stood there\nthey could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\nas no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and\ntrusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There is some one inside\nworking at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds\nwith it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.'\n\n\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them\nenter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who\nsuspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her\nhouse, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with\ncheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked\npoisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she\nturned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her\npig-styes. They were like pigs--head, hair, and all, and they grunted\njust as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they\nremembered everything.\n\n\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns\nand beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me\nabout the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay\nthat though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes\nfilled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced\nhis story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.\n\n\"'We went,' said he, 'as you told us, through the forest, and in the\nmiddle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place\nthat could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a\ngoddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to\nher and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and\ninvited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed\nher into the house, but I staid where I was, for I thought there might\nbe some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of\nthem ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.'\n\n\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also\ntook my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the\nway. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,\nsaying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for\nI know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return\nalive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with\nthe few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.'\n\n\"'Stay where you are, then,' answered I, 'eating and drinking at the\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.'\n\n\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the\ncharmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe,\nI met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the\nhey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\nface. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'My poor\nunhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and\nwithout knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigstyes, like\nso many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you can\nset them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and will have\nto stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will protect\nyou and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one\nof great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe's house, it\nwill be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.\n\n\"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try\nto practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will\ndrug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm\nyou, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her\nspells from working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes\nyou with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you\nwere going to kill her. She will then be frightened, and will desire you\nto go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for\nyou want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of\nyourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods\nthat she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has\ngot you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.'\n\n\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it\nwas like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the\ngods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do\nwhatever they like.\n\n\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;\nbut I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with\ncare as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called\nthe goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door,\nand asked me to come in; so I followed her--much troubled in my mind.\nShe set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a\nfootstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet\nfor me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she\nhad given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck\nme with her wand. 'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigstye, and\nmake your lair with the rest of them.'\n\n\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke\npiteously, saying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and people\nhave you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?\nNever yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I\ngave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the\nbold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day with\nhis ship while on his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe your\nsword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust\neach other.'\n\n\"And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you\nwhen you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you\nhave got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to\nbed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall\ncertainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take\nyour solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'\n\n\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her\noath then I went to bed with her.\n\n\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their\nwork. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the\nholy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple\ncloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought\ntables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A\nthird mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden\ncups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set it to\nboil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When\nthe water in the cauldron was boiling, {87} she poured cold into it\ntill it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began\nwashing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the\ntire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me\nand anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt\nand led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a\nfootstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a\nbeautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash\nmy hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought\nme bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and\nthen Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what\nwas before me, still moody and suspicious.\n\n\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she\ncame to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you\nwere dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink?\nIs it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have\nalready sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of\neither eating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends\nfree and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must\nfree my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own eyes.'\n\n\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand\nin her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many\nprime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and\nanointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug\nhad given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they\nwere before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once,\nseized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole\nhouse was filled with the sound of their halloa-ballooing, and Circe\nherself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, 'Ulysses,\nnoble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left\nyour ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship's\ngear and property in some cave, and come back here with your men.'\n\n\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at\nthe ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the silly\nblubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and\ngambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked\nafter they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with\ntheir lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back\nto their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred. 'Sir,'\nsaid the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad to see you back as\nthough we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of\nour comrades.'\n\n\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to the\nland, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave; then\ncome with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, where\nyou will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great\nabundance.'\n\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\nto hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will\nbecome of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who\nwill turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to\nkeep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our\ncomrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all through\nhis sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'\n\n\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of\nhis being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\nand said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the\nship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'\n\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that\nI had given him.\n\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen\ncloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at\ndinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face\nand knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole\npalace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble\nson of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you\nhave all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel\nsavages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and\ndrink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you\nleft Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you\nkeep all the time thinking of the hardships you have suffered during\nyour travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you.'\n\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But\nwhen the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had\ncome round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began\nto think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your\nhouse and native country at all.'\n\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to\nthe going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when\nthe sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to\nsleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed\nwith Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what\nI had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keep the promise you made\nme about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so\ndo my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as\never your back is turned.'\n\n\"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there\nis another journey which you have got to take before you can sail\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to\nconsult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason is\nstill unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even\nin death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'\n\n\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would\ngladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And who\nshall guide me upon this voyage--for the house of Hades is a port that\nno ship can reach.'\n\n\"'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise your mast, set your\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will\nreach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall\npoplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your\nship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of\nHades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and\nyou will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into\none another.\n\n\"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench\na cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine,\nand in the third place water--sprinkling white barley meal over the\nwhole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts,\nand promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a\nbarren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with\ngood things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall\nhave a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.\n\n\"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer\nthem a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but\nyourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river.\nOn this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your\nmen to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as a\nburnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine. Then draw your\nsword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from\ncoming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have answered your\nquestions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about\nyour voyage--what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the\nsea so as to reach your home.'\n\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed\nme in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to\neach of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'\nsaid I to them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.'\nAnd on this they did as I bade them.\n\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had\nwith us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or\ncourage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the\nrest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the\nnoise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot\nall about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the\nroof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of Hades.\n\n\"When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think you are\nabout to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of\nthis, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult\nthe ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'\n\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves\non the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard\nby the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,\nfor who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not\nwish to be seen?\n\n\nBook XI\n\nTHE VISIT TO THE DEAD. {88}\n\n\"Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the\nwater and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on\nboard and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe,\nthat great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft\nand staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well filled;\nso we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and let her go as the\nwind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were full as she\nheld her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness\nwas over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river\nOceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce\nneither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but\nthe poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there\nwe beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the\nwaters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.\n\n\"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword\nand dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the\ndead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water,\nand I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to\nthe poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to\nIthaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and\nwould load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised\nthat Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my\nflocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of\nthe two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts\ncame trooping up from Erebus--brides, {89} young bachelors, old men worn\nout with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had\nbeen killed in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they\ncame from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind\nof screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them\ncoming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead\nsheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat\nprayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword\ndrawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood\ntill Teiresias should have answered my questions.\n\n\"The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had\nnot yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and\nunburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to do. I was\nvery sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said I, 'how\ndid you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here\non foot quicker than I have with my ship.'\n\n\"'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own\nunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's house,\nand never thought of coming down again by the great staircase but fell\nright off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to the house\nof Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind\nyou, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought\nyou up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the one hope of\nyour house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave this\nlimbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do not\ngo thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may bring\nheaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have, build\na barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used\nto row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.' And I said, 'My\npoor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.'\n\n\"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one\nside of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost\nof my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the\nghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her\nalive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but\neven so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood till\nI had asked my questions of Teiresias.\n\n\"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre\nin his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why,\npoor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead\nin this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your sword\nthat I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.'\n\n\"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the\nblood he began with his prophecy.\n\n\"'You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven will\nmake this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye\nof Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having\nblinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you\ncan restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the\nThrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging to\nthe sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these flocks\nunharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet after\nmuch hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of\nthe destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though you may\nyourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all your\nmen, [in another man's ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your\nsubstance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to your\nwife.\n\n\"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and\nafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must\ntake a well made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country\nwhere the people have never heard of the sea and do not even mix salt\nwith their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and oars that\nare as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain token which\ncannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and will say it must\nbe a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your shoulder; on this you\nmust fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar\nto Neptune. {90} Then go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in\nheaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come to you\nfrom the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I\nhave said will come true].' {91}\n\n\"'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and\ntell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by us; she\nis sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own\nson she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can\nmake her know me.'\n\n\"'That,' said he, 'I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the\nblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let\nthem have any blood they will go away again.'\n\n\"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my\nmother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke\nfondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down to this abode of\ndarkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the living to\nsee these places, for between us and them there are great and terrible\nwaters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot, but he\nmust have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying to find\nyour way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor\nseen your wife in your own house?'\n\n\"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of\nthe Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean\nland nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one\nlong series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with\nAgamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But\ntell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a long\nillness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity?\nTell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me, is my\nproperty still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who\nthinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again what my wife\nintends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with my son and\nguard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could and\nmarried again?'\n\n\"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is\nin great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night\nand day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and\nTelemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate,\n{92} and how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place\nin the country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable bed\nnor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire\nwith the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm\nweather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your\nnever having come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As\nfor my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and\npainlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as\nthose that generally wear people out and kill them, but my longing to\nknow what you were doing and the force of my affection for you--this it\nwas that was the death of me.' {93}\n\n\"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother's ghost.\nThrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each\ntime she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and\nbeing touched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do you not stay\nstill when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one\nanother we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in\nthe house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of\ngrief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?'\n\n\"'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not\nProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they\nare dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these\nperish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the\nbody, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now, however,\ngo back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all these\nthings that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'\n\n\"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the\nwives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds\nabout the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.\nIn the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that\nhung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at\nonce. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned\nher told me her race and lineage.\n\n\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of\nCretheus the son of Aeolus. {94} She fell in love with the river Enipeus\nwho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover,\nlay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched\nitself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he\nloosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god\nhad accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and\nsaid, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not\nfruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve months.\nTake great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold your\ntongue and do not tell any one.'\n\n\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and\nNeleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was\na great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in\nPylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres,\nand Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\n\n\"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons\nAmphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built\na wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not hold\nThebes till they had walled it.\n\n\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.\n\n\"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it\nwas to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after\nhaving killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the\nworld; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite\nthe gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the mighty\njailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits\nhaunted him as for an outraged mother--to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\n\n\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given\npriceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of\nIasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore\nNestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously\nlovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus\nwould only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from\nthe grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man\nwho would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer, {95} but\nthe will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught\nhim and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had passed and\nthe same season came round again, Iphicles set him at liberty, after\nhe had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then, was the will of\nJove accomplished.\n\n\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,\nCastor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes\nare lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special\ndispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one of them\nevery other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.\n\n\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace\nof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short\nlived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,\nand the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they\nwere nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They\nthreatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount\nOssa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,\nthat they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if\nthey had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,\nbefore they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or chin.\n\n\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but\nhe did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the\nisland of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.\n\n\"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every\nsingle one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is\ntime for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As\nfor my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\"\n\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:--\n\n\"What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good\nlooking, and is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you\nshare in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor\nniggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need, for\nheaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\"\n\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among\nthem, \"My friends,\" said he, \"what our august queen has just said to us\nis both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it;\nbut the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King\nAlcinous.\"\n\n\"The thing shall be done,\" exclaimed Alcinous, \"as surely as I still\nlive and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to\nget home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,\nby which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean\nto give him. As regards his escort it will be a matter for you all, and\nmine above all others as the chief person among you.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here\nfor a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your\nnoble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to\nmy advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and\nshould thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me when I get\nback to Ithaca.\"\n\n\"Ulysses,\" replied Alcinous, \"not one of us who sees you has any idea\nthat you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people\ngoing about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see\nthrough them, but there is a style about your language which assures me\nof your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own\nmisfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced\nbard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty\nheroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished\nthere. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed\ntime--go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here\nlistening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us\nof your adventures.\"\n\n\"Alcinous,\" answered Ulysses, \"there is a time for making speeches, and\na time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not\nrefrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades\nwho did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their\nreturn, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\n\n\"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions,\nthe ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by\nthose who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he\nhad tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his\narms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any\nmore, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you come\nby your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and\nwaves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end\nof you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing,\nor while they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?'\n\n\"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea\nin any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the\nmainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between\nthem. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most\nmiserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all\naround me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding\nbreakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You\nmust have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or\nin single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the\nway in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I\nheard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close\nbeside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and\nraised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away\nfrom me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying,\nfor there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman\nwhen she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own\nhusband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children and my\nservants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and\nall women who shall come after--even on the good ones.'\n\n\"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to\nlast in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us fell\nfor Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief\nagainst you too during your absence.'\n\n\"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendly\neven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the\nrest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope\nis a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a\nyoung bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for Troy. This\nchild no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate, {96} and he and\nhis father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me\nthe happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so.\nFurthermore I say--and lay my saying to your heart--do not tell people\nwhen you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them,\nfor after all this there is no trusting women. But now tell me, and\ntell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes? Is he in\nOrchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus--for I presume\nthat he is still living.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your\nson is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not\nknow.'\n\n\"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost\nof Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was\nthe finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus.\nThe fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying,\n'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake\nnext, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly dead,\nwho are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?'\n\n\"And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the\nAchaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me\nabout my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get\nnear the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been\nin trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so\nfortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all\nus Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you are\na great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to\nheart even if you are dead.'\n\n\"'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather be\na paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of\nkings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the\nwars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if\nyou have heard anything about my father Peleus--does he still rule among\nthe Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and\nPhthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by\nhis side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I\nkilled the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy--could I but be\nas I then was and go even for a short time to my father's house, any one\nwho tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.'\n\n\"'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell you all\nabout your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros\nwith the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always\nfirst to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the\nonly two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the\nplain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but would\ndash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man did\nhe kill in battle--I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew\nwhile fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how\nhe killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the\nCeteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when\nall the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had\nmade, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the\ndoor of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and\nchief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every\nlimb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek;\nhe was all the time urging me to break out from the horse--grasping\nthe handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury\nagainst the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune\nof war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in\nclose combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'\n\n\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a\nmeadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the\nprowess of his son.\n\n\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof--still\nangry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour\nof Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners\nand Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in\nsuch a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all\nthe Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.\n\n\"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not\nforget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that\nhateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to\nlose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much\nas we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid\non anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for it\nwas this that made him counsel your destruction--come hither, therefore,\nbring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell you.'\n\n\"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being\nso angry, or I should have gone on talking to him, {97} only that there\nwere still others among the dead whom I desired to see.\n\n\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his\nsentences upon them.\n\n\"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the\nghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he\nhad a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\n\n\"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some\nnine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging\ntheir beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with\nhis hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's mistress Leto as\nshe was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.\n\n\"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that\nreached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never\nreach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it\ndried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground--parched\nby the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their\nfruit over his head--pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy\nolives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take\nsome, the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.\n\n\"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone\nwith both his hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the\ntop of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to the\nother side, its weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless stone\n{98} would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would\nbegin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and the\nsteam rose after him.\n\n\"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who\nis daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like\nscared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare\nbow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though\never on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous\ngolden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears, wild\nboars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and\ndeath. The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able\nto make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me, and\nspoke piteously, saying, 'My poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are\nyou too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was above\nground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me--a low fellow\nwho set me all manner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the\nhell-hound--for he did not think he could find anything harder for me\nthan this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him, for\nMercury and Minerva helped me.'\n\n\"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed\nwhere I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.\nAnd I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom\nI would fain have seen--Theseus and Pirithous--glorious children of the\ngods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such\nappalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send\nup from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On\nthis I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at\nonce and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,\nwhereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had to\nrow at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\n\n\nBook XII\n\nTHE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.\n\n\"After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open\nsea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn\nand sun-rise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands\nand got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and waited\ntill day should break.\n\n\"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent\nsome men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood\nfrom a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had\nwept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his\nbody and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone\nover it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been\nused to row with.\n\n\"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from\nthe house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could;\nand her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine.\nThen she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You have done a bold thing\nin going down alive to the house of Hades, and you will have died twice,\nto other people's once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the\nday, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow\nmorning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and\nwill explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from\nmisadventure either by land or sea.'\n\n\"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day\nto the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on\ndark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the\nship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from\nthe others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our\nadventures.\n\n\"'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay\nattention to what I am about to tell you--heaven itself, indeed, will\nrecall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who\nenchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close\nand hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never\nwelcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to\ndeath with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead\nmen's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them.\nTherefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that\nnone of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you\nmay get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half\nway up the mast, {99} and they must lash the rope's ends to the mast\nitself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray\nthe men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\n\n\"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\ncoherent directions {100} as to which of two courses you are to take; I\nwill lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for\nyourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against which\nthe deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed\ngods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no,\nnot even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Jove, but the\nsheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has to send\nanother to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these\nrocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel\nthat ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from\nthe house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against these great\nrocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love she bore to\nJason.\n\n\"'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a\ndark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not\neven in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and\ntwenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer\nup, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there\nis a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must\ntake your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the\nstoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and\nyelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but\nin truth she is a dreadful monster and no one--not even a god--could\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet,\nand six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck\nshe has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very\nclose together, so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment,\nand she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and\npeering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or\nany larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which\nAmphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some men,\nfor she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in each\nmouth.\n\n\"'You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together\nthat there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig\ntree in full leaf {101} grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking\nwhirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her\nwaters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not\nthere when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not\nsave you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you\ncan, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'\n\n\"'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'\n\n\"'You dare devil,' replied the goddess, 'you are always wanting to fight\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme,\nrude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance\nwill be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about\nher rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you with\na second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of your\nmen; so drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out lustily to\nCrataiis who is Scylla's dam, bad luck to her; she will then stop her\nfrom making a second raid upon you.'\n\n\"'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see\nmany herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god--seven\nherds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each\nflock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they\nare tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of\nthe sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them and\nhad done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was\na long way off, to live there and look after their father's flocks and\nherds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you\nharm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship\nand of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will\nreturn late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.'\n\n\"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,\nwhereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to\nloose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took\ntheir places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently\nthe great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair wind\nthat blew dead aft, and staid steadily with us, keeping our sails well\nfilled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her\ngo as wind and helmsman headed her.\n\n\"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends, it\nis not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that\nCirce has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether\nwe live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were\nto keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a\nfield of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as no\none else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece half\nway up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I\ncannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the mast itself.\nIf I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.'\n\n\"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we\nreached the island of the two Sirens, {102} for the wind had been very\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a\nbreath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails\nand stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with\nthe foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax\nand cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong\nhands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and\nthe rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all\nmy men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright\non the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got\nwithin earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate, the\nSirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\n\n\"'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name,\nand listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying\nto hear the enchanting sweetness of our song--and he who listens will\ngo on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that\nthe gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you\neverything that is going to happen over the whole world.'\n\n\"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them\nfurther I made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free;\nbut they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me\nwith still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens'\nvoices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound me.\n\n\"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from\nwhich spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were\nso frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea\nresounded with the rushing of the waters, {103} but the ship stayed\nwhere it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore,\nand exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.\n\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been\nin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops\nshut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel\nsaved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now,\ntherefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might\nand main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them,\nfor the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming\nrapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over\nyonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.'\n\n\"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster\nScylla, for I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would\nhuddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's\nstrict instructions--I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears\nI took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I expected\nfirst to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much harm;\nbut I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes with\nlooking the gloomy rock all over and over.\n\n\"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand\nwas Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt\nwater. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it\nis boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of the\nrocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could see the\nwater all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound\nas it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the whirlpool\nall black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits ends for\nfear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting each moment\nto be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and snatched up my\nsix best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a\nmoment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in\nthe air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my\nname in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand,\nupon some jutting rock {104} throws bait into the water to deceive the\npoor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his\nspear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them\none by one--even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her\nrock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\n\n\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible\nCharybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the\ngoodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at\nsea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the\nyards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban\nprophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned\nme to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I\nsaid to the men, 'My men, I know you are hard pressed, but listen while\nI tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean\nCirce warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it\nwas here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\ntherefore, away from the island.'\n\n\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an\ninsolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very strong\nyourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now,\nthough your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not\nlet them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this island, but\nbid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on through the watches\nof the flying night. It is by night that the winds blow hardest and do\nso much damage; how can we escape should one of those sudden squalls\nspring up from South West or West, which so often wreck a vessel when\nour lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey the\nbehests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.'\n\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you are\nmany against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn\noath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep,\nhe will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be\nsatisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'\n\n\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath\nwe made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh\nwater, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about their poor\ncomrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping\nand they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.\n\n\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that\nland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out\nof the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\nwe brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein the\nsea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men together\nin council.\n\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for\nthese cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear\nto everything.' And again they promised that they would obey.\n\n\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was\nno other wind, but only South and East. {105} As long as corn and wine\nheld out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,\nhowever, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced\nto go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking\nwhatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One day,\ntherefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show me some\nmeans of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of all\nmy men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the wind,\nI washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and by\nthey sent me off into a sweet sleep.\n\n\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, 'Listen\nto me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there\nis none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these\ncows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get\nback to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich it\nwith every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our\nship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other gods are of\nthe same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and\nhave done with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert\nisland as this is.'\n\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,\nso fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,\ntherefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them\nsaying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal,\nfor there was no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the\ncows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped\nthem round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on top\nof them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the\nsacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water\nfrom time to time while the inward meats were being grilled; then, when\nthe thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they\ncut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\n\n\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship\nand to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so\nI groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I exclaimed,\n'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me\na cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me; see what fine\nwork these men of mine have been making in my absence.'\n\n\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said\nto the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:\nthey have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I\nloved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If they\ndo not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down to Hades\nand shine there among the dead.'\n\n\"'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the\nfruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a bolt\nof white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'\n\n\"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the\nmouth of Mercury.\n\n\"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each\none of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for the\ncows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs\nand wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and\nthe joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat, whether\ncooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.\n\n\"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon\nthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury\nof the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread\nsail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the island,\nand could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn raised a black\ncloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did not get on\nmuch further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall\nfrom the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell\naft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of the\nvessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship's\nstern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\noverboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him.\n\n\"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and\nround, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck\nit. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water\nround the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently\ndeprived them of all chance of getting home again.\n\n\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which\ndrifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction\nof the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging\nabout it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting\nastride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take me.\n\n\"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into\nthe South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the\nterrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened,\nfor I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached\nthe rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the\nsalt sea water, {106} but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which\nI caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet\nanywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and\nthe boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and\ntoo far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till\nthe pool should discharge my mast and raft again--and a very long while\nit seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to get home to supper, after\nhaving been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to\nsee my raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At\nlast I let go with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea,\nhard by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands.\nAs for Scylla, the father of gods and men would not let her get further\nsight of me--otherwise I should have certainly been lost.] {107}\n\n\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the\ngods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and\npowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need\nsay no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it\nyesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over again.\"\n\n\nBook XIII\n\nULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.\n\nThus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered\ncloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous\nbegan to speak.\n\n\"Ulysses,\" said he, \"now that you have reached my house I doubt not you\nwill get home without further misadventure no matter how much you have\nsuffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night after\nnight to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist\nas follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought gold,\n{108} and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;\nlet us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a large\ntripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general\nrate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of\nsuch a handsome present.\"\n\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his\nown abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they\nhurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alcinous\nwent on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship's\nbenches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they\nwent to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull\nfor them in honour of Jove who is the lord of all. They set the steaks\nto grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard,\nDemodocus, who was a favourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses\nkept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his\nsetting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who has been all\nday ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about\nhis supper and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for\nit is all his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when\nthe sun went down, and he at once said to the Phaeacians, addressing\nhimself more particularly to King Alcinous:\n\n\"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me on\nmy way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving me\nan escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn\nto good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace among\nfriends, {109} and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction\nto your wives and children; {110} may heaven vouchsafe you every good\ngrace, and may no evil thing come among your people.\"\n\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken\nreasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, \"Pontonous, mix\nsome wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to\nfather Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.\"\n\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others\neach from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that\nlive in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands\nof queen Arete.\n\n\"Farewell, queen,\" said he, \"henceforward and for ever, till age and\ndeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take\nmy leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and\nwith king Alcinous.\"\n\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct\nhim to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maidservants\nwith him--one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong\nbox, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water side\nthe crew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and\ndrink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that\nhe might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too went on\nboard and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his place\nand loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound.\nThereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep,\nsweet, and almost deathlike slumber. {111}\n\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over\nthe course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it were\nthe neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in\nher wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest\nof all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her\nway through the water, carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but\nwho was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.\n\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show,\nthe ship drew near to land. {112} Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the\nold merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line\nof the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of\nwind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship may\nlie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is a\nlarge olive tree, and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern\nsacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. {113} There are mixing bowls\nwithin it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,\nthere are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of\nsea purple--very curious to see--and at all times there is water within\nit. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals can go\ndown into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more\nmysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken by\nthe gods.\n\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place.\n{114} She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on\nto the shore; {115} when, however, they had landed, the first thing they\ndid was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship,\nand lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out the\npresents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he\nwas setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all together by\nthe root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by\n{116} might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and then they made\nthe best of their way home again.\n\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already\nthreatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. \"Father Jove,\" said\nhe, \"I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if\nmortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such\nsmall regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he had\nsuffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home at\nall, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and promised\nthat he should do so; but now they have brought him in a ship fast\nasleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more\nmagnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever\nhave brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and\ngot home without misadventure.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking\nabout? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would\nbe monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As\nregards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and\ntreating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal\nwith him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.\"\n\n\"I should have done so at once,\" replied Neptune, \"if I were not anxious\nto avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should\nlike to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort.\nThis will stop them from escorting people in future; and I should also\nlike to bury their city under a huge mountain.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" answered Jove, \"I should recommend you at the very\nmoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,\nto turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This\nwill astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the\nmountain.\"\n\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid\nway, had got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and\ndrove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground.\nAfter this he went away.\n\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn\ntowards his neighbour, saying, \"Bless my heart, who is it that can have\nrooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could\nsee the whole of her only a moment ago.\"\n\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous\nsaid, \"I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that\nNeptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the\nsea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from\nan escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my old\nfather used to say, and now it is all coming true. {117} Now therefore\nlet us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving\npeople escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not\nbury our city under the high mountain.\" When the people heard this they\nwere afraid and got ready the bulls.\n\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune,\nstanding round his altar; and at the same time {118} Ulysses woke up\nonce more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not\nknow it again; moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy\nday, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she\nmight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens\nand friends recognising him {119} until he had taken his revenge upon\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to\nhim--the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the\ngoodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his\nnative land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried\naloud despairingly.\n\n\"Alas,\" he exclaimed, \"among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they\nsavage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put all\nthis treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over there\nwith the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great chief who\nwould have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I do not\nknow where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear\nsomebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and rulers\nof the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have left me\nin the wrong country; they said they would take me back to Ithaca and\nthey have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise\nthem, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong.\nStill, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off\nwith any of them.\"\n\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his\nclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not\nbeing in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of\nthe sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him\ndisguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good\ncloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely\nfeet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he saw her,\nand went straight up to her.\n\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"you are the first person whom I have met with in\nthis country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed\ntowards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your\nknees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell\nme truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I\non an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?\"\n\nMinerva answered, \"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come\nfrom somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is\na very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is\nrugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad\nisland for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also\nwine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also\nand goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places\nwhere the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known\neven as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off from this\nAchaean country.\"\n\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own\ncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and\nmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\n\n\"I heard of Ithaca,\" said he, \"when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and\nnow it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left\nas much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed\nOrsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him\nbecause he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so\nmuch trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of\nthe weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as\nvassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait\nfor him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as\nhe was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark night and\nnobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but\nas soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who\nwere Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis\nwhere the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They\nmeant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed\non till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get inside\nthe harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it\nbadly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very\ntired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship,\nand placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they\nsailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress of mind.\"\n\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.\nThen she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, \"He must be\nindeed a shifty lying fellow,\" said she, \"who could surpass you in all\nmanner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare\ndevil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not\ndrop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are\nin your own country again? We will say no more, however, about this, for\nwe can both of us deceive upon occasion--you are the most accomplished\ncounsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for diplomacy and\nsubtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know Jove's daughter\nMinerva--me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in\nall your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking\nto you? And now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and\nhelp you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to\ntell you about the troubles that await you in your own house; you have\ngot to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you have\ncome home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man's insolence,\nwithout a word.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you\nare so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it\nis a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much,\nhowever, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we\nAchaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we went on\nboard ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed\nus--from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever\nremember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had to\nwander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I\nreached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me\ninto the town. {120} And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell\nme the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in\nsome other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you\nhave been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\ncountry?\"\n\n\"You are always taking something of that sort in your head,\" replied\nMinerva, \"and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you\nare so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning\nfrom so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and\nchildren, but you do not seem to care about asking after them or hearing\nany news about them till you have exploited your wife, who remains at\nhome vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or day for the\ntears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was\nnever uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back safely\nthough you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with\nmy uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.\n{121} I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land, and\nyou will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old merman\nPhorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near\nit is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] {122} here too is the overarching\ncavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the\nnymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.\"\n\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then\nUlysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed\nthe bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs,\nsaying, \"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never\nagain to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving salutations,\nand I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if Jove's redoubtable\ndaughter will grant me life, and bring my son to manhood.\"\n\n\"Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,\" rejoined Minerva,\n\"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where\nthey will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.\"\n\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding\nplaces, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and\ngood clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything\ncarefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.\nThen the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and consulted how\nto compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.\n\n\"Ulysses,\" said Minerva, \"noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay\nhands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your\nhouse these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents\nto her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and\nsending encouraging messages {123} to every one of them, but meaning the\nvery opposite of all she says.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have\ncome to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you\nhad not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best\navenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on\nthe day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow. Help me now as\nyou did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess, will\nbe with me.\"\n\n\"Trust me for that,\" said she, \"I will not lose sight of you when once\nwe set about it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your\nsubstance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains.\nI will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you; I\nwill cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow\nhair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with\nloathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly\nobject in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom\nyou left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge\nof your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you, and is\ndevoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his pigs\nnear the rock that is called Raven {124} by the fountain Arethusa, where\nthey are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner.\nStay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed to\nSparta and see your son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he\nhas gone to try and find out whether you are still alive.\" {125}\n\n\"But why,\" said Ulysses, \"did you not tell him, for you knew all about\nit? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship\nwhile others are eating up his estate?\"\n\nMinerva answered, \"Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be\nwell spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but\nis staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with\nabundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying\nin wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do\nnot much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are\nnow eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.\"\n\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with\nwrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his\nwhole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones;\nshe changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a\ntunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave him an\nundressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff\nand a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over\nhis shoulder.\n\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess\nwent straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.\n\n\nBook XIV\n\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\n\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the\nwooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the\nplace where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was\nthe most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his\nhut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be\nseen from far. He had made them spacious {126} and fair to see, with\na free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his\nmaster's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them\non top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of\noaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had\nbuilt twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were\nfifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the\nboars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors\nkept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he\nhad continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the\nherdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always\nwith them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\nsandals {127} from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out\nherding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to\ntown with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they\nmight sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\n\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at\nhim, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of\nthe stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by\nthem in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,\nrushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off\nby shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, \"Old\nman, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you\nwould have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in\ncontinual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people\nto eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving\nin some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill\nof bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\nmisfortunes.\"\n\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.\nHe strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of\nthis he threw the shaggy chamois skin--a great thick one--on which he\nused to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,\nand said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's\ndesire in return for the kind way in which you have received me.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult him,\nfor all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you\ncan get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young\nlords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has\nhindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and\ngiven me something of my own--a house, a piece of land, a good looking\nwife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked\nhard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine\nin the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would\nhave done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen's\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a\ngood man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of\nnoble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.\"\n\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\nthem; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before\nUlysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over\nwith white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of\nivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\n\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant's pork. The fat pigs\nhave to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but\nthe blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do\nwhat is lawful and right. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on\nother people's land, and Jove gives them their spoil--even they,\nwhen they have filled their ships and got home again live\nconscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god\nseems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear\nor stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not\none victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was\nexceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland\nis as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will\ntell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle upon the main\nland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs,\nwhile his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading\nherds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on\nthe far end of the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goat\nherds. Each one of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock\nevery day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here,\nand I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them.\"\n\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was\nsatisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\nfilled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said\nas he took it in his hands, \"My friend, who was this master of yours\nthat bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell\nme? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he\nwas, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\nknow, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled\nmuch.\"\n\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will\nget Ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in\nwant of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a\nword of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress\nand tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them,\nand asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will\nwhen they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt\nand a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves\nand birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes\nof the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand\nupon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is\nfor all his friends--for me especially; go where I may I shall never\nfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and\nfather where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about\nmy parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own\ncountry; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak\nof him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very\nfond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall\nalways honour his memory.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard of\nbelief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not\nmerely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything\nfor my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and\ncloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take\nanything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,\nwho lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the\nrites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now\ncome, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses\nwill return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who\nare ill treating his wife and son.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink\nyour wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on\nreminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about\nmy honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only\nwish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son\nTelemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was\nrunning up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face\nand figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been\nunsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of\nhis father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in\nIthaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or\nelse to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect\nhim. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want\nto know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town\nand parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to\nIthaca, and from what country they professed to come--for you cannot\nhave come by land.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were meat\nand wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do\nbut to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily\ntalk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of\nthe sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\n\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\n(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among the\nCretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me\non the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When,\nhowever, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his\nestate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich\nfamily, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of\nbattle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see\nwhat the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the\nenemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was\nthe first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was\nI in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home\nlife of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships,\nfighting, javelins, and arrows--things that most men shudder to think\nof; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what\nI was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy,\nnine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I\namassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance,\nand much more was allotted to me later on.\n\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans,\nbut when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to\nTroy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing\nso. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was\nthat Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my\nchildren, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a\ndescent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine\nships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men\nmade feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail\nfrom Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a\nriver. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness\non board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and\nsteersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus;\nthere I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and\nkeep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every\npoint of vantage.\n\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\nchildren captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\nheard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\nfilled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour.\nThen Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the\nenemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many\nof us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove,\nhowever, put it in my mind to do thus--and I wish I had died then and\nthere in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me--I\ntook off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\nI went straight up to the king's chariot, clasped his knees and kissed\nthem, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took\nme weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and\ntried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared\nthe wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do\nevil.\n\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on\nfor eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who\nhad already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over\ninto going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions\nlay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that\ntime when months and days had gone by till the same season had come\nround again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a pretence\nthat I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that\nhe might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I suspected\nhis intention, but went on board with him, for I could not help it.\n\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their\ndestruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could see\nnothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and the\nsea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts and\nthe ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone\nas the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they\nwere carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many\nsea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship's mast\nwithin my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted\nbefore the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness\nof the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast.\nThere Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without\ncharging me anything at all--for his son found me when I was nearly dead\nwith cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his\nfather's house and gave me clothes to wear.\n\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his\nhomeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought\niron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family\nfor ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.\nBut the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove's\nmind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after so long an\nabsence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as\nhe did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,\nthat should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing\nfor the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge\nof her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.\n\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the\nvery extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land\nthey resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt\nand cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old\nclouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached\nthe tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope\nfast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea\nside. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags\nover my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and\nswam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and\nwent searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further\nuse and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily,\nthen took me to a good man's door--for it seems that I am not to die yet\nawhile.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger, I\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that\npart about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe\nit. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way? I know\nall about the return of my master. The gods one and all of them detest\nhim, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with\nfriends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the\nAchaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have\nbeen heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away\nwe know not whither.\n\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the\ntown unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who\ngrieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at it because they\ncan eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have\nnever cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in\nby an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last\nhe reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen\nUlysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had\nbeen damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the following\nsummer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth.\nAnd now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not\nfor any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of\nrespect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying\nyou.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a\nbargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master\ncomes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to\nDulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,\nset your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,\nas a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.\"\n\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, \"both now and\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and\nshowing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest\nif I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will come in\ndirectly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a\ntremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But\nEumaeus called to his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you have,\nthat I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of him\nourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while\nothers reap the fruit of our labour.\"\n\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine\nfat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not\nforget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first thing\nhe did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them into the\nfire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might return\nhome again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had\nkept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it, while the\nothers slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began\nby putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he\nsprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest\nof the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they\nthrew them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most\nequitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven\nportions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the\nnymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men\nman by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin\nas a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope,\nEumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I\nam, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\n\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\nsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,\nput the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion.\nMesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man\non his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence,\nand had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and\ndrink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all went\nto bed after having made a hearty supper.\n\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It\npoured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is\na wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the\nexcellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give\nit him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\" said he,\n\"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you\nsomething. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make\neven a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance\nand say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have\nbegun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as when we\ngot up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders,\nbut I was in command also, for the other two would have it so. When we\nhad come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour\nand lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the\nsnow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated\nthick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept\ncomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had\ncarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too\ncold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the\nnight was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their places, I\nnudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me\nhis ear.\n\n\"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no\ncloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt,\nand I do not know what to do.'\n\n\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\nplan:\n\n\"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'\nThen he raised his head on his elbow.\n\n\"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We\nare a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell\nAgamemnon to send us up more men at once.'\n\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in those\ndays, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out\nof good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now people\nlook down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\n\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have\nnot many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one.\nWhen Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both cloak and\nshirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\"\n\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some\ngoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here\nUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak\nthat he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\n\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\nto go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his\nproperty during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his\nbrawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also\ntook the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of\nattack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the\npigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\nthe North wind.\n\n\nBook XV\n\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON--HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS\nAT PYLOS AND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA--ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF\nEUMAEUS.\n\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses' son\nthat he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping\nin the forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,\nbut Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy\nfather, so Minerva went close up to him and said:\n\n\"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor\nleave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they\nwill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a\nfool's errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to\nfind your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and\nbrothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her\nmore than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding\npresents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in\nspite of you, but you know what women are--they always want to do the\nbest they can for the man who marries them, and never give another\nthought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father\neither when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you\nhave, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let\nme tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The\nchief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait\n{128} between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you\ncan reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely\nthat some of those who are now eating up your property will find a grave\nthemselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from the\nislands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send you a\nfair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the\ntown, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the\nnight, and then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back\nsafe from Pylos.\"\n\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with\nhis heel to rouse him, and said, \"Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the\nhorses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\" {129}\n\nBut Pisistratus said, \"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\nin the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his\npresents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to\nus in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a\nhost who has shown him kindness.\"\n\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\nleaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\nput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\nshoulders, and went out to meet him. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"let me go\nback now to my own country, for I want to get home.\"\n\nAnd Menelaus answered, \"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not\ndetain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or\ntoo rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a\nman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would\nlike to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the\nhouse and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I\ncan get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have\nyourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner\nfor you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once more\nproper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on\nsuch a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour\nin Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct\nyou myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away\nempty handed; every one will give us something--a bronze tripod, a\ncouple of mules, or a gold cup.\"\n\n\"Menelaus,\" replied Telemachus, \"I want to go home at once, for when\nI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that\nwhile looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that\nsomething valuable has been stolen during my absence.\"\n\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to\nprepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At\nthis moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got\nup; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he\nat once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room, {130}\nnot alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the\nplace where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double\ncup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing bowl.\nMeanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses\nwhich she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was largest\nand most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star,\nand lay at the very bottom of the chest. {131} Then they all came back\nthrough the house again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said,\n\"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home\naccording to your desire. I will now present you with the finest and\nmost precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl of\npure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the\nwork of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a present of it\nin the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home.\nI should like to give it to you.\"\n\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\nwhile Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before\nhim. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\n\n\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\nthe hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.\nTill then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back\nrejoicing to your own country and to your home.\"\n\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as\nhe did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the\nhouse, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought\nthem water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin\nfor them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them;\nan upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of\nwhat there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave them each\ntheir portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid\ntheir hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as\nthey had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked\nthe horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove out through\nthe inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court,\nand Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood\nin front of the horses and pledged them, saying, \"Farewell to both of\nyou; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as\nkind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\nTroy.\"\n\n\"We will be sure, sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"to tell him everything as\nsoon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned\nwhen I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great\nkindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I am\ntaking with me.\"\n\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand--an eagle with a\ngreat white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm\nyard--and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It\ncame quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front\nof the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took\ncomfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \"Tell me, Menelaus, has\nheaven sent this omen for us or for you?\"\n\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to\nmake, but Helen was too quick for him and said, \"I will read this matter\nas heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come\nto pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has\nits nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled far and\nsuffered much, will return to take his revenge--if indeed he is not back\nalready and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"\n\n\"May Jove so grant it,\" replied Telemachus, \"if it should prove to be\nso, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at\nhome.\"\n\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed\nthrough the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon\ntheir necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and\ndarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles\nlived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed\nthe night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed\nhis horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\n\n\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you.\nYou know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both\nof an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;\ndo not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go\nto your father's house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his good\nwill towards me, and I must go home at once.\"\n\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he\ndeemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's\nbeautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then\nhe said, \"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before\nI can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am\nsure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he\nwill not go back without you. But he will be very angry.\"\n\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and\nsoon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave\nhis orders. \"Now, my men,\" said he, \"get everything in order on board\nthe ship, and let us set out home.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\nin the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,\na seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was\ndescended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;\nhe was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the\ngreat and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held them\nfor a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house\nof king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of the\ndaughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow that\ndread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his\nlife, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that had\nbeen done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he\nleft the country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should\nreign over much people. There he married, established himself, and had\ntwo famous sons Antiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of\nOicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove\nand by Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he was killed\nin Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon\nand Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was father to\nPolypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\nfor his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but\nApollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that\nAmphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to live in\nHyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men.\n\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was\nmaking drink-offerings and praying in his ship. \"Friend,\" said he,\n\"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your\nsacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you\nalso by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth\nand nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your\ntown and parents.\"\n\nTelemachus said, \"I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and\nmy father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come\nto some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew\ntogether to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a\nlong time.\"\n\n\"I too,\" answered Theoclymenus, \"am an exile, for I have killed a man\nof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they\nhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at their\nhands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I\nam your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that they may\nnot kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.\"\n\n\"I will not refuse you,\" replied Telemachus, \"if you wish to join us.\nCome, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according to\nwhat we have.\"\n\nOn this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deck of\nthe ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus\nsit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them to\ncatch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the\nmast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast with\nthe forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted\nox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and strong to\ntake the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed\nby Crouni and Chalcis.\n\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel\nmade a quick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans\nrule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, {132} wondering\nwithin himself whether he should escape death or should be taken\nprisoner.\n\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut,\nand the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and drink,\nUlysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would\ncontinue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or\npack him off to the city; so he said:\n\n\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging\nabout the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give\nme your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me\nand show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs\nmust, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I\nshould like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her\nhusband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and\nsee if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should\nsoon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and\nbelieve when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace\nand good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would\nmake a more handy servant than I should--to put fresh wood on the fire,\nchop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that\npoor men have to do for their betters.\"\n\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \"Heaven help\nme,\" he exclaimed, \"what ever can have put such a notion as that into\nyour head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty,\nfor their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They would never\nthink of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants are all\nyoung men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well\nlooking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept quite\nclean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are,\nthen; you are not in anybody's way; I do not mind your being here, no\nmore do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home he will give\nyou a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to\nme, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there\nis nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men have\nonce got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on\nbehalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to stay\nhere and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses' mother,\nand his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set\nout for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the\nhouse of Hades?\"\n\n\"I will tell you all about them,\" replied Eumaeus, \"Laertes is still\nliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house,\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him more\nthan anything else did. She came to an unhappy end {133} through sorrow\nfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come\nto such an end as she did. As long as she was still living, though she\nwas always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her how she\ndid, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene, the youngest\nof her children; we were boy and girl together, and she made little\ndifference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they sent Ctimene\nto Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my mistress\ngave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet, and\nsent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever.\nThis is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in\nthe situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can\nfind something for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there\nis no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house has\nfallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see\ntheir mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have something\nto eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with them\ninto the country. This is what will keep servants in a good humour.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Then you must have been a very little fellow,\nEumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.\nTell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother\nlived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you\nwere alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\nwhatever your master gave them?\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" replied Eumaeus, \"as regards your question: sit still, make\nyourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights\nare now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and\nsitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time,\ntoo much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes\nto go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master's\npigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We too will sit here\neating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories about\nour misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted\nabout in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows\nthat have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as\nfollows:\n\n\"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\nOrtygia, {134} where the land begins to turn round and look in another\ndirection. {135} It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,\nwith much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine\nand wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any\nsickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole\ncountry is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,\na man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.\n\n\"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for\nthe Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted\nwith gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in\nmy father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these\nscoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship,\nseduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter\nhow good she may be by nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who\nshe was and where she came from, and on this she told him her father's\nname. 'I come from Sidon,' said she, 'and am daughter to Arybas, a\nman rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the town from the\ncountry, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea,\nwhere they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them\ntheir price for me.'\n\n\"The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to come along\nwith us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?\nThey are both alive and are said to be well off.'\n\n\"'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear me a\nsolemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'\n\n\"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath\nthe woman said, 'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or\nat the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and\ntell my master, in which case he would suspect something. He would put\nme in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel\ntherefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word\nwhen you have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my\nhands on, and there is something else also that I can do towards paying\nmy fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny\nlittle fellow just able to run about. I will carry him off in your ship,\nand you will get a great deal of money for him if you take him and sell\nhim in foreign parts.'\n\n\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\nyear till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\nand then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\nwoman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's house\nbringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and\nwhile my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and\nbargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went\nback to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the\nhouse. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in\nattendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public\nassembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the\nbosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun\nwas now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as\nfast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship\nwas lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the\nsea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did\nwe sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the\nwoman and she fell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she were\na sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the\nseals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the\nwinds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of\nhis chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon\nthis country.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\nwith the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as\nwell as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who\nsees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good\nlife, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for\nsleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his\ncrew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast,\nand rowed the ship into the harbour. {136} They cast out their mooring\nstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,\nmixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough\nto eat and drink Telemachus said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms.\nIn the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the\ncity, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you\nall a good dinner with meat and wine.\" {137}\n\nThen Theoclymenus said, \"And what, my dear young friend, is to become of\nme? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I\ngo straight to your own house and to your mother?\"\n\n\"At any other time,\" replied Telemachus, \"I should have bidden you go to\nmy own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present\nmoment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be\naway, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show herself\neven to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber,\nout of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go\nto--I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held in the highest\nestimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most\npersistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\ntrying to take Ulysses' place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows\nwhether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes\nplace.\"\n\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand--a hawk, Apollo's\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore\nthem off, {138} fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the\nship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.\n\"Telemachus,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without\nhaving been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an\nomen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no\nhouse in Ithaca more royal than your own.\"\n\n\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemachus. \"If it does, I will show\nyou so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet\nyou will congratulate you.\"\n\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, \"Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have\nthroughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who\nhave accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to\nyour own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.\"\n\nAnd Piraeus answered, \"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you\nplease, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of\nhospitality.\"\n\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose\nthe hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus\nbound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head\nof sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\nhawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city\nas they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he\ncould, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of\nswine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so\ndevoted a servant to his master.\n\n\nBook XVI\n\nULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.\n\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were\nwere getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out\nwith the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but fawned\nupon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the\ndogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:\n\n\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of\nyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and\nnot barking.\"\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door.\nEumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing wine\nfell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head\nand both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be\nmore delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old age,\nafter ten years' absence in a foreign country and after having gone\nthrough much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though he\nhad come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\n\n\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I\nheard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you any\nmore. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look\nat you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\nthe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the\nsuitors are doing.\"\n\n\"So be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\nI want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her\nold home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of\nUlysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\n\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking her\nheart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\n\nAs he spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone\nthreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place\nas he entered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger,\" said\nhe, \"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\nit for me.\"\n\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\nto sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the\nremains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread\nbaskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of\nivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they laid their hands\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus, \"Old friend, where\ndoes this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and\nwho were they?--for assuredly he did not come here by land.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\nand has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands.\nDo whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\n\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\nand am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother\ncannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the\nhouse out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her husband,\nor whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those\nwho are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most advantageous\noffer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I will find him\na cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send\nhim wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep him here at the\nstation, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden\non you and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors,\nfor they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat him in a way that\nwould greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do\nnothing against numbers, for they will be too strong for him.\"\n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in\nwhich the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell\nme, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your\npeople against you? May you not complain of your brothers--for it is to\nthese that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be?\nI wish I were as young as you are and in my present mind; if I were son\nto Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came\nand cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of\nevery one of these men. {139} If they were too many for me--I being\nsingle-handed--I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such\ndisgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine\ndrawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that\nshall never be accomplished.\"\n\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There is no\nenmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom\na man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has\nmade us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and\nUlysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses who\nleft me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any\nuse to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless\nmarauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands, Dulichium,\nSame, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are\neating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother, who\nwill neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring\nmatters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\nlong will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue, however,\nrests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell\nPenelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself\nalone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for\nthere are many who are plotting mischief against me.\"\n\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me no\nfurther, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let\npoor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work\non his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would\neat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that\nfrom the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor\ndrunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits\nweeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\n\n\"More's the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we must\nleave him to himself just now. If people could have everything their own\nway, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my father;\nbut go, and give your message; then make haste back again, and do not\nturn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send one of her\nwomen secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from her.\"\n\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\nbound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\nhim well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\nwoman--fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,\nand revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and\nknew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen\nby everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not\nbark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards.\nShe nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon\nhe left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards.\nThen she said to him:\n\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the\ndestruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be\nlong in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\n\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\na fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\nwhen he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\nupon a god.\n\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you were\na moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not\nthe same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If\nso, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings\nof wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands\nof lawless men.\"\n\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the\nground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could\nnot yet believe that it was his father, and said:\n\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\nat a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from\nheaven.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much\nhardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you\nwonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who does with\nme whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she\nmakes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes\non my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make\nany man look either rich or poor.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\nand wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles\nor vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half\nfledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun\nwould have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not suddenly\nsaid, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca?\nOf what nation did they declare themselves to be--for you cannot have\ncome by land?\"\n\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the\nhabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took\nme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after\ngiving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by\nheaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on\nthe suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our enemies.\nFirst, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that\nI may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter\nover in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole body of them\nourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.\"\n\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your renown\nboth in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very\ngreat one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand\nagainst many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice\nten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once.\nThere are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six\nservants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from\nZacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They\nhave with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at\ntable. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue\nyour coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one\nwho would be willing to come and help us.\"\n\n\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\none else as well.\"\n\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of good\nallies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power\nover both gods and men.\"\n\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as\nbefore. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a\nmiserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart\nagainst my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of\nthe house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently\ntrying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to\nyou, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\nlay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\nwill nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all\nthe armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say\nthat you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it\nis no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled\nand begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are\nafraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they\nmay do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing,\nfor the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave\na sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of oxhide\nshields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva\nwill then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you\nare indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that\nUlysses is within the house--neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor\nany of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit\nthe women alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men\nservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.\"\n\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by, and\nwhen you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,\nhowever, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us. Think\nit over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms and\nexploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your\nestate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all\nmeans, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in favour\nof going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if\nyou really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought\nTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When\nthey had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;\ntheir servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all\nthe presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\nship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the\nservant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting\nwomen, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but Eumaeus went\nclose up to Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden\nhim tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its\noutbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\n\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\na council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the\nfirst to speak.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\nlet us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after\nthe others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\n\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\nsaw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and\nputting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, \"We need\nnot send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told\nthem, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.\"\n\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they went\nup in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any one\nold or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke\nfirst.\n\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day\nlong, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but\nwaited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and\nkilling him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let\nus consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our\naffair is never likely to come off while he is alive, for he is very\nshrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make\nhaste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time\nin doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the world\nhow we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not\nlike this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no\nhurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try and\nlay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the road\nhither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his\nmother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not\nplease you, and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father's\nproperty, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way,\nbut must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she\ncan marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to\nwin her.\"\n\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son\nof Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the\nsuitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his\nconversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any\nof the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural disposition. \"My\nfriends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, \"I am\nnot in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to kill one\nwho is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the\noracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will\nurge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would have you\nhold your hands.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose\nforthwith and went to the house of Ulysses, where they took their\naccustomed seats.\n\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She\nknew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard\ntheir counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court\nattended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by\none of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a\nveil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\n\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are\nnothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death\nof Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove\nhimself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another.\nDo you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the\npeople, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian\npirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They\nwanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife\nand trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others\nalso.\"\n\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\nearth. I say--and it shall surely be--that my spear shall be reddened\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him\nfrom the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her, but in\nreality he was plotting against Telemachus.\n\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\nshed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\nand his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were\nhelping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to\nUlysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and\nclad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might\nrecognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\n\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\" said\nhe. \"What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are\nthey still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\n\n\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was in\nthe town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I\ncould. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he\nwas the first to tell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw\nwith my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury\nabove the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of\nmen in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the\nsuitors, but I cannot be sure.\"\n\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\ncould not see him.\n\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate\nit, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and\nenjoyed the boon of sleep.\n\n\nBook XVII\n\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET--ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE\nTOWN, AND ULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS--HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE\nDOG ARGOS--HE IS INSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A\nSTOOL--PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.\n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\nbound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for\nhe wanted to go into the city. \"Old friend,\" said he to the swineherd,\n\"I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will\nnever leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate\nstranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will\ngive him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own,\nand cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry so\nmuch the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\"\n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always\ndo better in town than country, for any one who likes can give him\nsomething. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and\ncall of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told him,\nand take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and\nthe day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and\nthis frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city\nis some way off.\"\n\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge\nupon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a\nbearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister\nitself, and went inside.\n\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him;\nall the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with\ntheir kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus,\nand wept as she flung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead\nand both his beautiful eyes, \"Light of my eyes,\" she cried as she spoke\nfondly to him, \"so you are come home again; I made sure I was never\ngoing to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to Pylos\nwithout saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come, tell\nme what you saw.\"\n\n\"Do not scold me, mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"nor vex me, seeing what\na narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress, go\nupstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to\nall the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I\nmust now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come\nback with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told Piraeus to\ntake him home and look after him till I could come for him myself.\"\n\nShe heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and\nvowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only\nvouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.\n\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand--not\nalone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a\npresence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went\nby, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths\nand malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with\nMentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father's house,\nand they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus\ncame up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town to the\nplace of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was\nfirst to speak: \"Telemachus,\" said he, \"I wish you would send some of\nyour women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.\"\n\n\"We do not know, Piraeus,\" answered Telemachus, \"what may happen. If\nthe suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,\nI would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should\nget hold of them. If on the other hand I managed to kill them, I shall\nbe much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.\"\n\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got\nthere they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the\nbaths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed\nthem, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at\ntable. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden\newer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;\nand she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the\nhouse. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the\nbearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink Penelope said:\n\n\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I\nhave not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out for\nTroy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to\nme before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had been\nable to hear anything about the return of your father.\"\n\n\"I will tell you then truth,\" replied her son. \"We went to Pylos and saw\nNestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though\nI were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so\nalso did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any\nhuman being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent me,\ntherefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for\nwhose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven's wisdom\ndoomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that had brought me to\nLacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon he said, 'So, then,\nthese cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay\nher new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the\nforest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair,\nwill make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with\nthese suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still\nthe man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and\nthrew him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him--if he is still\nsuch, and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short\nshrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your question, however, I will\nnot prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told\nme, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on\nan island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was\nkeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea.' This was what Menelaus told\nme, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a\nfair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\"\n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said\nto her:\n\n\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\nlisten therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\nnothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\nrites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\nthat Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the\ncountry or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds\nand preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I\nwas on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.\"\n\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true, you\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you\nshall congratulate you.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or\naiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the\nhouse, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now\ntime for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town\nfrom all the country round, {140} with their shepherds as usual, then\nMedon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon them at\ntable, said, \"Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, so\ncome inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at\ndinner time.\"\n\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the\nhouse, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then\nsacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and\nwell grown. {141} Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime\nUlysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the\nswineherd said, \"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town\nto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have\nliked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master\ntells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one's master\nis a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it\nwill be night again directly and then you will find it colder.\" {142}\n\n\"I know, and understand you,\" replied Ulysses; \"you need say no more.\nLet us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to\nwalk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\"\n\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,\nby the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his\nliking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs\nand herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his\nmaster followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp as he\nleaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had\ngot over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached\nthe fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had\nbeen made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of\nwater-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear\ncold water came down to it from a rock high up, {143} while above the\nfountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used\nto sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was\ndriving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors' dinner,\nand there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and Ulysses\nhe reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made\nUlysses very angry.\n\n\"There you go,\" cried he, \"and a precious pair you are. See how heaven\nbrings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master\nswineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any\none sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won a\nprize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders\nagainst every man's door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons\n{144} like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for. If\nyou would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean\nout the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could\nfatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad\nways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but\nbeg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable belly. I say,\ntherefore--and it shall surely be--if he goes near Ulysses' house he\nwill get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him, till they\nturn him out.\"\n\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path. For\na moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him\nwith his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out;\nhe resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the\nswineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his\nhands and praying to heaven as he did so.\n\n\"Fountain nymphs,\" he cried, \"children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned\nyou thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my\nprayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to\nthe swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting\npeople--gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin\nthrough bad shepherding.\"\n\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, \"You ill conditioned cur, what\nare you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\nand take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the\nmoney you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike\nTelemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I\nam that Ulysses will never come home again.\"\n\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\nquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\ngot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\nEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants\nbrought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread\nbefore him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came\nup to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was\njust beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the\nswineherd's hand, and said:\n\n\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far\nyou go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on after\nanother. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it; the\ndoors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard\nmatter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there are many\npeople banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and\nI hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with\nfeasting.\"\n\nThen Eumaeus said, \"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\ndo; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\nfirst and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait\nhere and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may see\nyou loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this\nmatter I pray you.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\nme here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\nthrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that\nI am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot\nhide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives\nmuch trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out\nto sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\"\n\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his\nhead and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred\nbefore setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him.\nIn the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went\nhunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone\nhe was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in\nfront of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away\nto manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw\nUlysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he\ncould not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the\nother side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus\nseeing it, and said:\n\n\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his\nbuild is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one\nof those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for\nshow?\"\n\n\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a far\ncountry. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would\nsoon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest\nthat could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he\nhas fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women\ntake no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master's\nhand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness out of a\nman when he makes a slave of him.\"\n\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\n\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him\nto come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying\nnear where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he\npicked it up, brought it to Telemachus's table, and sat down opposite\nhim. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from\nthe bread-basket.\n\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor\nmiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in\nrags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors\nleading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of\ncypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made to\njoin truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the\nbread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and\nsaid to Eumaeus, \"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go\nthe round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\nshamefaced.\"\n\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\nthis, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and\nfulfil the desire of his heart.\"\n\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it\non the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the\nbard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off.\nThe suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and\nprompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that\nhe might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the\nbad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of them.\nUlysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right, and\nstretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of\nthem pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another who\nhe was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\n\"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I\nhave seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing\nabout the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\n\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\" he\ncried, \"what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps\nand beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think\nit a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master's\nproperty--and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\n\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil.\nIt was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a\nstranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do\npublic service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who\ncan charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the world over,\nbut no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are\nalways harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors\nare, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and\nPenelope are alive and here.\"\n\nBut Telemachus said, \"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the\nbitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\n\nThen turning to Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care of\nmy interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this\nstranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give\nit him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my\nmother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you will\nnot do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than\nof giving them to other people.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\ntalk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would\nnot come here again for another three months.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\nunder the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but\nthe other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with\nbread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and\neat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous and\nsaid:\n\n\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you\nseem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the\nbetter giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a\nrich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to\nmany a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he\nwanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove\nto take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving robbers to\nEgypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my ships\nin the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard\nover them, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of\nvantage.\n\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\nchildren captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\nheard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\nfilled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then\nJove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy,\nfor they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us,\nand took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for myself,\nthey gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by\nname, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus. Thence I am come\nhither in a state of great misery.\"\n\nThen Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\nus during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, {145}\nor I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you\nlavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free\nwith other people's property when there is plenty of it.\"\n\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine sir,\nare better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would\nnot spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in\nanother man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you\nto give him even a piece of bread.\"\n\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You shall\npay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these words he\nthrew a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near\nthe top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not\neven stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his\nrevenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying\nhis well filled wallet at his feet.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets\nhit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and\neven so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,\nwhich is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have\ngods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to\na bad end before his marriage.\"\n\n\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off\nelsewhere,\" shouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged\nhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you\nalive.\"\n\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men\nsaid, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it\nwill be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god--and we know\nthe gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign\ncountries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss and who\nrighteously.\" {146}\n\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile\nTelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his father,\nand though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and\nbrooded on his revenge.\n\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the\nbanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo would\nso strike you, Antinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \"If\nour prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see\nthe sun rise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse, {147} I hate every single one\nof them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like\nthe darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging\nabout the house for sheer want. Every one else has given him\nsomething to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right\nshoulder-blade with a footstool.\"\n\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in\nthe meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\nswineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I\nwant to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips\nall hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I\nsat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither and\nthither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard\nof Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and\nthat he is bringing great wealth home with him.\"\n\n\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I too may hear his story.\nAs for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they\nwill, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain\nunwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while\nthey keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,\nsheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as\na thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such\nrecklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to\ncome again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.\"\n\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded\nwith it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus, \"Go\nand call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I\nwas speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be\nkilled, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and\nlay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is\nspeaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\"\n\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \"Father\nstranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;\nshe is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her\nabout her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the\ntruth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things\nthat you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that\nto fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give\nthat will.\"\n\n\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\ntrue. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him\nin affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel\nsuitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,\nas I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me\na blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one else\ndefended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till\nsundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are\nworn very thin--you know they are, for you have seen them ever since I\nfirst asked you to help me--she can then ask me about the return of her\nhusband.\"\n\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw\nhim cross the threshold, \"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus? Is he\nafraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside\nthe house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one\nelse would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much\nbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can\nhear him and talk to him as you will.\"\n\n\"The man is no fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be as\nhe says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as\nthese men are.\"\n\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had\nexplained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear\nso that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now go back to the\npigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look to\nwhat is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger,\nfor there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad\nend before they do us a mischief.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Telemachus, \"go home when you have had your dinner,\nand in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice for\nthe day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\"\n\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his dinner\nhe left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and went\nback to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse\nthemselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on towards\nevening.\n\n\nBook XVIII\n\nTHE FIGHT WITH IRUS--ULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS--PENELOPE GETS PRESENTS\nFROM THE SUITORS--THE BRAZIERS--ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.\n\nNow there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over\nthe city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and\ndrunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great\nhulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,\nwas Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus, {148}\nbecause he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon\nas he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and drive him out of\nhis own house.\n\n\"Be off, old man,\" he cried, \"from the doorway, or you shall be dragged\nout neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink,\nand wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?\nGet up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\"\n\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I do you no manner of harm;\npeople give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room enough\nin this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things\nthat are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as\nmyself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by. Do not,\nhowever, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old\nthough I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I shall\nhave more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of\nUlysses any more.\"\n\nIrus was very angry and answered, \"You filthy glutton, you run on\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\nlook on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger than\nyourself.\"\n\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front\nof the doorway, {149} and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed\nheartily and said to the others, \"This is the finest sport that you\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The\nstranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them\non to do so at once.\"\n\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged\ntramps. \"Listen to me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats' paunches\ndown at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside\nfor supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the better\nman shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we\nwill not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\n\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,\n\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his\nown against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though\nI know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however\nthat none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and secure him\nthe victory.\"\n\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\nTelemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\nstrikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\nchiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding, are\nof the same mind as I am.\"\n\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his\nmighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger\nstill. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn\ntowards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought such a thigh out\nof his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Irus.\"\n\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\nhim by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such\na fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and\nsaid, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all if\nyou are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.\nI say, therefore--and it shall surely be--if he beats you and proves\nhimself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the\nmainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes\nnear him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails\nfor the dogs to eat.\"\n\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle\nof the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses\nconsidered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end\nof him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow that\nshould only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give the\nlighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was.\nThen they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right shoulder;\nbut Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the\nbones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell\ngroaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground, but\nthe suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses\ncaught hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as\nfar as the gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put\nhis staff in his hands. \"Sit here,\" said he, \"and keep the dogs and pigs\noff; you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of\nthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse.\"\n\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his\nshoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down upon\nthe threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and\nsaluting him, \"May Jove, and all the other gods,\" said they, \"grant\nyou whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this\ninsatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to\nking Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.\"\n\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's\npaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves\nout of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he\ndid so in a golden goblet of wine. \"Good luck to you,\" he said, \"father\nstranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have\nbetter times by and by.\"\n\nTo this Ulysses answered, \"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I\nhave heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man\nboth brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to\nbe a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am\nsaying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon\nearth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks\nthat he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods\nbring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best\nof it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know\nall about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the\nstubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my\nbrothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things\nalways, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without\nvain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how\nthey are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one who\nis certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he\nwill be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that you may\nnot meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here the\nsuitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\"\n\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put\nthe gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away serious\nand bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not\nescape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him to fall by the hand of\nTelemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had\ncome.\n\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\nsuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win\nstill further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking\nlaugh and said, \"Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to\nshow myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also to\ngive my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with\nthem. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Eurynome, \"all that you have said is true,\ngo and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your\nface. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not\nright that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom you\nalways prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is already grown\nup.\"\n\n\"I know, Eurynome,\" replied Penelope, \"that you mean well, but do not\ntry and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed\nme of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell\nAutonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I\nam in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be\nproper for me to do so.\"\n\nOn this the old woman {150} went out of the room to bid the maids go to\ntheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter,\nand sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch\nand her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and\nbeauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed\nher face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she goes\ndancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more commanding\nfigure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn ivory. When\nMinerva had done all this she went away, whereon the maids came in from\nthe women's room and woke Penelope with the sound of their talking.\n\n\"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\" said she, as\nshe passed her hands over her face, \"in spite of all my misery. I wish\nDiana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I\nmight no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who\npossessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man\namong the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\nattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\nholding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either\nside of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and\nbecame so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might\nwin her for his own bed fellow.\n\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, addressing her son, \"I fear you are no longer so\ndiscreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger you\nhad a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown up,\nthough a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well to\ndo father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by no means\nwhat it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been going on,\nand how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated?\nWhat would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a\nsuppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable\nto you.\"\n\n\"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\" replied\nTelemachus, \"I understand all about it and know when things are not\nas they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\nhowever, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then\nanother of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,\nand I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between\nIrus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it to do,\nfor the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove, Minerva, and\nApollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some\ninside the house and some out; and I wish they might all be as limp as\nIrus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he nods\nhis head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing that he cannot\nstand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever that may be, for he\nhas no strength left in him.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could\nsee you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\nby tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\nworld both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\"\n\nTo this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my beauty\nwhether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and my dear\nhusband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I\nshould both be more respected and show a better presence to the world.\nAs it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which\nheaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when\nhe was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand--'Wife,' he said,\n'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the Trojans fight\nwell both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from\nchariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this. I\nknow not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether\nI may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after\nthings here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even\nmore so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard,\nthen marry whom you will, and leave this your present home.' This is\nwhat he said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I\nshall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has\ntaken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover, cuts\nme to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the custom of\nmy country. When men are courting a woman who they think will be a good\nwife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are each trying\nto win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the\nfriends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents, instead of\neating up other people's property without paying for it.\"\n\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\nto get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words\nwhich he knew she did not mean.\n\nThen Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many\npresents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not\nwell to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir\nfrom where we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever\nhe may be.\"\n\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\nservant to bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large and\nlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that\ngleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's two men returned with some\nearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most\nbeautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace\nof the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\npresent of some kind.\n\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought the\npresents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing,\nand stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark;\nthey then brought in three braziers {151} to give light, and piled them\nup with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit torches from\nthem, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses said:\n\n\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen\ninside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool.\nI will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning,\nbut shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\n\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho began\nto gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but had been\nbrought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and\nlooked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she\nshowed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and used to\nmisconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.\n\n\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? Go and\nsleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\nhere. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters--so\nmany of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you\nalways babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you\nbeat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come\nand cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will go and tell\nTelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb\nfrom limb.\"\n\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body\nof the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would do as he\nsaid. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding up\ntorches and looking at the people--brooding the while on things that\nshould surely come to pass.\n\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against\nthem; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,\nwhich made the others laugh. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"you suitors of\nQueen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for\nnothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the\nlight has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head--for\nhis hair is all gone, every bit of it.\"\n\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\nif I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you build\na stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round,\nand will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for\nyou have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had rather fill\nyour belly by going round the country begging.\"\n\n\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were to work one against\nthe other in early summer when the days are at their longest--give me a\ngood scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last\nthe longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing\ngrass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a\nyoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance:\nturn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the\nstraighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me\na shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my\ntemples--you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your\ngibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself\na great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If\nUlysses comes to his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you\nwill find them narrow when you try to fly through them.\"\n\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\nwretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and\nin public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always\nbabble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the\ntramp Irus.\" With this he caught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought\nprotection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid.\nThe stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the\nman fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to\nthe ground. The suitors in the covered cloister were now in an uproar,\nand one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, \"I wish the stranger\nhad gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble he gives\nus. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.\"\n\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \"Sirs, are you mad? Can you\nnot carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has\npossessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had\nyour suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\"\n\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\nbut Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, \"Do not\nlet us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither\nlet us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses' servants. Let\nthe cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we may make them\nand go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to\ndeal with him, for it is to his house that he has come.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of\nDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water\nand handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their\ndrink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their\ndrink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took their\nseveral ways each of them to his own abode.\n\n\nBook XIX\n\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR--ULYSSES INTERVIEWS\nPENELOPE--EURYCLEA WASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS\nLEG--PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.\n\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with\nMinerva's help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said\nto Telemachus, \"Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take\nit down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have\nremoved it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the\nsmoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went\naway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over\ntheir wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\nto use them.\"\n\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take\nthe armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No\none looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched\nwith soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke\ncannot reach it.\"\n\n\"I wish, child,\" answered Euryclea, \"that you would take the management\nof the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the\nproperty yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the\nstore-room? The maids would have done so, but you would not let them.\"\n\n\"The stranger,\" said Telemachus, \"shall show me a light; when people eat\nmy bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.\"\n\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.\nThen Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\nand spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her\nhand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,\n\"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,\ncrossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with\na flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from\nheaven.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask no questions, for\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here\nto talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will\nask me all sorts of questions.\"\n\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner\ncourt, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed\ntill morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the\nmeans whereby with Minerva's help he might be able to kill the suitors.\n\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and\nthey set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the\nfire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a\nfootstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with\na thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the women's\nroom to join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked\nsuitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was left, with\nthe cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the\nbraziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat;\nbut Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said, \"Stranger,\ndo you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying\nupon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.\"\n\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \"My good woman, why should you be\nso angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all\nin rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner\nof tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a\nfine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now\nam, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of\nservants, and all the other things which people have who live well and\nare accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me;\ntherefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place\nin which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get\nout of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for\nthere is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead\nas you think he is, yet by Apollo's will he has left a son behind him,\nTelemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house,\nfor he is now no longer in his boyhood.\"\n\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \"Impudent\nbaggage,\" said she, \"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that\nI was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose\nsake I am in such continual sorrow.\"\n\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \"Bring a seat with a\nfleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,\nand listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\"\n\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon\nas Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, \"Stranger, I shall\nfirst ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"who on the face of the whole earth can dare\nto chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you\nare like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch\nover a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley,\nthe trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea\nabounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds\nunder him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other\nquestion and do not seek to know my race and family, or you will recall\nmemories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness,\nbut I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person's house,\nnor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the\nservants or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes\nswim with tears because I am heavy with wine.\"\n\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\ndear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\nislands--Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say\nthat they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent\nstratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it in\nmy mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin\nworking upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them,\n'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\nagain immediately; wait--for I would not have my skill in needlework\nperish unrecorded--till I have finished making a pall for the hero\nLaertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He\nis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\nwithout a pall.' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I\nused to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would\nunpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was\nnow in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been\naccomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the\nsuitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with\nme, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now\nI do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this\nmarriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son\nchafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is\nnow old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look\nafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent\ndisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and\nwhere you come from--for you must have had father and mother of some\nsort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\"\n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in\nasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:\npeople must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as\nI have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as\nregards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and\nfruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and\nthere are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great\ntown there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a\nconference with Jove himself. {152} Minos was father to Deucalion, whose\nson I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\nsailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my\nbrother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two;\nhence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out\nof his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of\nIlithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly\nfind shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got\nthere he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his\nold and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some\nten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him\nevery kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover,\nI fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store,\nand got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their\nheart's content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one's feet\non land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on\nthe thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.\"\n\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the\nmountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed upon\nit and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did\nher cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time\nsitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he\nkept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much\nas quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had\nrelieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: \"Now,\nstranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really\ndid entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,\nhow he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also\nwith his companions.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can hardly\nsay. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went\nelsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses\nwore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a\ngold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was\na device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws,\nand watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled\nat the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog\nlooking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling\nconvulsively to escape. {153} As for the shirt that he wore next his\nskin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld\nit. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not\nknow whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether\none of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage;\nor possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present\nof them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the\nAchaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple\nmantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I\nsent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant\nwith him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\nlike; his shoulders were hunched, {154} he was dark, and he had thick\ncurly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater\nfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded\nwith himself.\"\n\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief\nin tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you,\nbut henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It\nwas I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them out of\nthe store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold\nbrooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home\nagain. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city\nwhose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\"\n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god.\nStill, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has\nbegged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew\nwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and\nthe sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\nsun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses\nstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to\nescort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering\nwealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no\none can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\nthis, and he swore to me--making drink-offerings in his house as he did\nso--that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would\ntake Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing\nisland of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got\ntogether, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to\nDodona that he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know\nwhether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in\nsecret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close\nat hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and\nmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to\nwhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass.\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon\nand the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\n\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you\nshall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in\nthe house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them\non their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make\nhim a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and\nquiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,\nthat he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to\nhim; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how,\nsir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of\nmy sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in\nmy cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if\nthey are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are\nalive, and speak contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that\nis righteous and deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among\nall lands, and many shall call him blessed.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the\nday that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will\nlie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night\nhave I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor,\nagain, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young\nhussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and\nrespectable woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will\nallow her to wash them.\"\n\nTo this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet\ncame to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such\nadmirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most\nrespectable old woman--the same who received my poor dear husband in\nher arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is\nvery feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said she,\n\"Euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Ulysses' hands and\nfeet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us\ndreadfully fast.\"\n\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began\nto weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot think\nwhatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your\nson grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone\nfrom ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in\nsome foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all\nthese sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your\nnot choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have\ninsulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope\nhas said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope's\nsake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of\ncompassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend\nto; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now,\nbut I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Ulysses\nin figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\n\n\"Those who have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said we\nwere wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\"\n\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his\nfeet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath\nwas warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away\nfrom the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold\nof his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon the\nwhole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her\nmaster, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by\na wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent\ngrandfather Autolycus--who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer\nin the whole world--and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had\nendowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats\nand kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened\nonce that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his\ndaughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the\ninfant upon his knees and said, \"Autolycus, you must find a name for\nyour grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\"\n\n\"Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus: I\nam highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and\nanother, both men and women; so name the child 'Ulysses,' or the child\nof anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family on Mt.\nParnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and will\nsend him on his way rejoicing.\"\n\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from\nAutolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.\nHis grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head,\nand both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get\ndinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year\nold bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these\nthey then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they\nroasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set\nand it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of\nAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.\nThey climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy\nupland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,\nfresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a\nmountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the\nbeast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,\namong whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long\nspear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick\nbrushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor\ncould the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick\nwith fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's feet, and the\nhounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he rushed\nfrom his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with\nfire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his spear\nand try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him,\nand charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that\ntore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit\nhim on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through\nhim, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of\nhim. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the\nboar, and bound Ulysses' wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the\nbleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and\nhis sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid\npresents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When\nhe got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked\nhim all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he\ntold them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with\nAutolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.\n\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well\nhold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell\ninto the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the water\nwas spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her joy and her grief\nfilled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Ulysses\nby the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses\nhimself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled\nyou.\"\n\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her\nthat her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to\nlook in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had\ndiverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with\nhis right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\n\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own\nbreast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to\nmy own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to\nrecognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any\none else in the house, for if you do I tell you--and it shall surely\nbe--that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other\nwomen.\"\n\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay\nmy saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your\nhand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have been\nill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am\nwell able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your\ntongue and leave everything to heaven.\"\n\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, for\nthe first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed\nhim with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself,\nand hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and\nsaid:\n\n\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\nIt is indeed nearly bed time--for those, at least, who can sleep in\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and\nlooking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the\nwhole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie\nawake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and\ncruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in\nthe early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many\na plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in\nits uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard\nmy substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard\nto public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is\nnot now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing\nme and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still\nyoung, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my\nhusband's house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to\ndo so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his\nproperty. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for\nme if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out\nof a trough, {155} and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a\ngreat eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak\ninto the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently\nhe soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he\ncame back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with\nhuman voice, and told me to leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he\nsaid, 'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen\nthat shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\nlonger an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who\nwill bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and when\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\n\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one\ninterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be\nfulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one\nof them will escape.\"\n\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and\nunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come true.\nThere are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed;\nthe one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through\nthe gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean\nsomething to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own\ndream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say--and lay my\nsaying to your heart--the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day\nthat is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a\ntournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court,\none in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built;\nhe would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole\ntwelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and whichever\nof them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all\nthe twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful\nhusband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not\nthat I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your\ntournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,\nhandle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\"\n\nTo this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth\na time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon\nthat couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day\nUlysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\n\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her\nmaidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva shed\nsweet sleep over her eyelids.\n\n\nBook XX\n\nULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP--PENELOPE'S PRAYER TO DIANA--THE TWO SIGNS FROM\nHEAVEN--EUMAEUS AND PHILOETIUS ARRIVE--THE SUITORS DINE--CTESIPPUS\nTHROWS AN OX'S FOOT AT ULYSSES--THEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS DISASTER AND\nLEAVES THE HOUSE.\n\nUlysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the\ntop of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,\nand Eurynome {156} threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself\ndown. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which\nhe should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the\nhabit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling and\nlaughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he doubted\nwhether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there, or\nto let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart\ngrowled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her\nteeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at\nthe evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said,\n\"Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day when the\nterrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence\ntill your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of\nbeing killed.\"\n\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he\ntossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front\nof a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he\nmay get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself about\nfrom side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he was,\nhe should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors.\nBut by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman,\nand hovered over his head saying, \"My poor unhappy man, why do you lie\nawake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and\nso is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud\nof.\"\n\n\"Goddess,\" answered Ulysses, \"all that you have said is true, but I am\nin some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors\nsingle handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there\nis this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing\nthat with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must\nask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it\nis all over.\"\n\n\"For shame,\" replied Minerva, \"why, any one else would trust a worse\nally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise\nthan I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout\nin all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were\nfifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should take\nall their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But go to\nsleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be\nout of your troubles before long.\"\n\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to\nOlympus.\n\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that\neased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting\nup in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she\nprayed to Diana saying, \"Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an\narrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and\nbear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths\nof over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The\ndaughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed\nthem, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed\nthem on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to excel all\nwomen in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an imposing\npresence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting\nthem married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what\nnot happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to\nbecome handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who\nlive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might\nstrike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might\ndo so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield\nmyself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how much people\nmay grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at\nnight, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and\nill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as\nhe was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed\nthat it was no dream, but the very truth itself.\"\n\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and\nit puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by\nhis side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had\nlain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock's\nhide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed,\nsaying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and\nsea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give\nme a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now\nwaking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from\noutside.\"\n\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\nup among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad\nwhen he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from\nhard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign.\nThere were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and\nbarley which are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and\nhad gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished, for\nshe was not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she\nstopped grinding and gave the sign to her master. \"Father Jove,\" said\nshe, \"you, who rule over heaven and earth, you have thundered from a\nclear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this means something for\nsomebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant who calls\nupon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in the\nhouse of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.\"\n\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's\nspeech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge\nhimself on the suitors.\n\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about\nhis shoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a\ndoughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the\nthreshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, \"Nurse, did you make the\nstranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him\nshift for himself?--for my mother, good woman though she is, has a\nway of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting\nothers who are in reality much better men.\"\n\n\"Do not find fault child,\" said Euryclea, \"when there is no one to find\nfault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:\nyour mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he\nwould not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one\nfor him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would not\nsleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed\nbullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the cloister and I\nthrew a cloak over him myself.\" {157}\n\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans\nwere meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not\nalone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and\nsaid, \"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling\nthem with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down\nthe tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs\nand the cups, and go for water from the fountain at once; the suitors\nwill be here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast day.\"\n\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them\nwent to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to\nwork about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also\ncame up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned from\nthe fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs\nhe could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and then he\nsaid good-humouredly to Ulysses, \"Stranger, are the suitors treating you\nany better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\"\n\n\"May heaven,\" answered Ulysses, \"requite to them the wickedness with\nwhich they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense\nof shame.\"\n\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for\nhe too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; and he\nhad two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,\nand then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \"Are you still here,\nstranger,\" said he, \"to pester people by begging about the house? Why\ncan you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding\nbefore we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without\nany sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\nas well as here?\"\n\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\nman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and\nsome goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take\npeople over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer\nand his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the\nswineherd. \"Who, Swineherd,\" said he, \"is this stranger that is lately\ncome here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does he come\nfrom? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man, but the\ngods give sorrow to whom they will--even to kings if it so pleases\nthem.\"\n\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;\n\"Good day to you, father stranger,\" said he, \"you seem to be very poorly\noff now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove,\nof all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children, yet\nyou show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat came\nover me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he\nreminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as\nthis man's are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is already\ndead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master, who made\nme his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and now\nhis cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though\nhe is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already\neager to divide Ulysses' property among them because he has been away so\nlong. I have often thought--only it would not be right while his son\nis living--of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad as\nthis would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated about\nother people's herds. My position is intolerable, and I should long\nsince have run away and put myself under the protection of some other\nchief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send all\nthese suitors flying out of the house.\"\n\n\"Stockman,\" answered Ulysses, \"you seem to be a very well-disposed\nperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell\nyou, and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all\ngods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses\nshall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you\nshall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\"\n\n\"If Jove were to bring this to pass,\" replied the stockman, \"you should\nsee how I would do my very utmost to help him.\"\n\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to\nmurder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand--an\neagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \"My friends,\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to\ndinner instead.\"\n\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the\nbenches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the\nheifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round.\nThey mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every\nman his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread\nbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid their\nhands upon the good things that were before them.\n\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that\nwas paved with stone; {158} he gave him a shabby looking seat at a\nlittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. \"Sit there,\" said he, \"and drink\nyour wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and\nblows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to\nUlysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your\nhands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\"\n\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\nthen Antinous said, \"We do not like such language but we will put up\nwith it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had\nlet us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\"\n\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\nheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\nAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.\n\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man\nhis portion, and feasted to their heart's content; those who waited\nat table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for\nTelemachus had told them to do so.\n\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against\nthem. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name\nwas Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his\ngreat wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the\nsuitors, \"Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as\nlarge a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor\nreasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have\nsomething to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses'\nservants.\"\n\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which\nit lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little\naside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion {159} as he did\nso, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to\nCtesippus, \"It is a good thing for you,\" said he, \"that the stranger\nturned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should have\nrun you through with my spear, and your father would have had to see\nabout getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let me\nhave no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up\nnow to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen\nyou killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put\nup with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further\nviolence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die\nthan see such disgraceful scenes day after day--guests insulted, and men\ndragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way.\"\n\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, \"No\none should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for\nit is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger,\nor any one else of the servants who are about the house; I would say,\nhowever, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which I trust may\ncommend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say, 'as you had ground for\nhoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could complain of\nyour waiting and suffering {160} the suitors to be in your house. It\nwould have been better that he should have returned, but it is now\nsufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man,\nand the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will\nyourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink\nin peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not\nyours.'\"\n\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering\nin some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's\nmarriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and\nI will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist\npoint blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes.\nHeaven forbid that I should do this.\"\n\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set\ntheir wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.\nTheir meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,\nand their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this\nand said, \"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud\nof darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with\ntears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams\ndrip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full\nof ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out\nof heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus\nthen said, \"This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.\nServants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark\nhere.\"\n\nBut Theoclymenus said, \"Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me.\nI have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an\nunderstanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for\nI see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are\ninsulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be\nable to escape.\"\n\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him\nwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking\nTelemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to\nhim, \"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this\nimportunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill\nfor work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is\nanother fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me persuade\nyou, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and send them\noff to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\"\n\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sate silently watching his father,\nexpecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\n\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat\nplaced for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear\nwhat every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much\nmerriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed\nmany victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be\nconceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man\nwere soon to lay before them--for they had brought their doom upon\nthemselves.\n\n\nBook XXI\n\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS\nAND PHILOETIUS\n\nMinerva now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their\nskill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,\nas a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and\ngot the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of\nivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of\nthe house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought\niron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of\ndeadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in\nLacedaemon--Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another\nin Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had\nsailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these\nUlysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and\nthe other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had\ngone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,\nand the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the\ndeath of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove's son,\nmighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his\nshame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's\nvengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before\nIphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave\nhim the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on\nhis death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return\na sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,\nalthough they never visited at one another's houses, for Jove's son\nHercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him\nby Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for\nTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it\nbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\n\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get\nit quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the\ndoors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key,\nand drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;\n{161} these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow,\nand Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in\nwhich the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs:\nreaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg\non which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as\nshe took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her,\nshe went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and\nthe quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along\nwith her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron\nand bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the\nsuitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of\nthe cloister, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either\nside of her. Then she said:\n\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\npretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that\nyou are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and\nwhomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through\neach one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my\nlawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I\ndoubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had\nbidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's\nbow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\nsimpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying\nin this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband;\nsit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if\nyou want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to\ncontend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter\nto string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I\nwas then only a child.\"\n\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to\nstring the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to\nbe the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,\nwhom he was dishonouring in his own house--egging the others on to do so\nalso.\n\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\nrobbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she\nwill quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\nmyself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose\npeer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca\nnor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to\nspeak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay,\nbut let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make\ntrial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall\nnot suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can\nwin the prizes which my father won before me.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,\nand took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in\na long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.\n{162} Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was\nsurprised when they saw him set them up so orderly, though he had never\nseen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\nto make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\nmight to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had\nhoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for\nthe fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to\ncheck him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\n\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too\nyoung, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\nto hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led\ninto the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then\nhe sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\n\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place\nat which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.\"\n\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He\nwas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the\nmixing-bowl. {163} He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and\narrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not\nstring the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they\ntherefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, \"My friends, I\ncannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life and\nsoul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and\nwhich has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping\nand praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow\nand tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman,\nand let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it\nis to win her.\"\n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, {164}\nwith the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his\nseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\nsaying:\n\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow\ntake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend\nit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are\nothers who will soon string it.\"\n\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire in\nthe court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also\na large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the\nbow and grease it--we will then make trial of it again, and bring the\ncontest to an end.\"\n\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\nit. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\nhouse, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but\nthey were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\nthere still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\namong the suitors and much the foremost among them all.\n\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer\nyard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\n\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in\ndoubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of\nmen would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back\nhere all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do--to side with the\nsuitors, or with Ulysses?\"\n\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might so\nordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see\nwith what might and main I would fight for him.\"\n\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\nwhen, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\nsaid, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last,\nin the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you\ntwo alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I\nhave not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,\ntherefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall\ndeliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,\nwill give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give\nyou convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is\nthe scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on\nMt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\nhad examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw\ntheir arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses\nkissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down\nupon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:\n\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and\ntell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both\ntogether; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this\nmoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to\nprevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore,\nEumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and\ntell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any\ngroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not\ncome out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.\nAnd I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court,\nand to bind them securely at once.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\n\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\nit by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\ngrieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and for us\nall; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care\nnearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca\nand elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to\nUlysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us\nin the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\n\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\nyourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can\nstring a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side--as for the axes\nthey can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house\nand take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we\nmay make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will\ntell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow--the best he has; we\ncan then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make\ntrial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.\"\n\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over\nthe hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\nand water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering.\nThen, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as\nhe desired, Ulysses craftily said:--\n\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am\nminded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who\nhas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and\nleave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory\nto whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may\nprove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have\nas much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have\nmade an end of it.\"\n\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature, you\nhave not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar\nor stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the\nwine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who\ndrink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when\nhe was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had\ngot into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of\nPeirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they\nrushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him\nthrough the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore\nthe burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore,\nthere was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon\nhimself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that\nit will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy\nfrom any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,\nwho kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive,\nso drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger\nthan yourself.\"\n\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right that\nyou should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.\nIf the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of\nUlysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me\nhis wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:\nnone of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all\nreason.\"\n\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this man\nwill take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest\nsome of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go\ngossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are\npaying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was\nable to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it\nat once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what will be said,\nand it will be a scandal against us.\"\n\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up the\nestate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect\nothers to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as\nyou think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says\nmoreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see\nwhether he can string it or no. I say--and it shall surely be--that if\nApollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak\nand shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers,\nand a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\nsafely wherever he wants to go.\"\n\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in\nthe islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any\none have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the\nother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the\nbow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the\nhouse and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff,\nand the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter, and mine\nabove all others, for it is I who am master here.\"\n\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her\nheart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned\nher dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\n\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but\nthe suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of\nthem said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of\nyour wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own\nboarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to\ndeath.\"\n\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow\ndown then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other\nside of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus,\nbring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with\nstones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I wish\nI was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am\nthan you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they\nmean mischief.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them\nin a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and\nplaced it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called\nEuryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to\nclose the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or\nuproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but\nare to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.\"\n\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's\napartments.\n\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of\nthe outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the\ngatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,\nresuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who\nhad now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,\nand proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into\nits two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his\nneighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has\ngot one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.\"\n\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things than\nhe is likely to be in stringing this bow.\"\n\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it\nas easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\nthe twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\nto prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\ntwittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a\nsign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the\nson of scheming Saturn had sent him.\n\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table {165}--for those\nwhich the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the\nquiver--he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of\nthe arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When\nhe had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the\nhandle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right\nthrough them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\n\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I\naimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and\nnot as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for\nthe Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and\nthen otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the\ncrowning ornaments of a banquet.\"\n\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on\nhis sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's seat.\n\n\nBook XXII\n\nTHE KILLING OF THE SUITORS--THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES\nARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.\n\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement\nwith his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the\nground at his feet and said, \"The mighty contest is at an end. I will\nnow see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which\nno man has yet hit.\"\n\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a\ntwo-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands.\nHe had no thought of death--who amongst all the revellers would think\nthat one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill\nhim? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean\nthrough his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his\nhand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked\nthe table from him and upset the things on it, so that the bread and\nroasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground. {166}\nThe suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit;\nthey sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked\neverywhere towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear,\nand they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. \"Stranger,\" said they, \"you shall\npay for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other contest;\nyou are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost youth in\nIthaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having killed him.\"\n\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by\nmistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of\nevery one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:\n\n\"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have\nwasted my substance, {167} have forced my women servants to lie with\nyou, and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared\nneither God nor man, and now you shall die.\"\n\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about\nto see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\n\n\"If you are Ulysses,\" said he, \"then what you have said is just. We have\ndone much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was\nthe head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all his\ndoing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much\ncare about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and Jove\nhas not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be chief\nman in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which was his\ndue, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything good among\nourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk.\nEach one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep\non giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have\ndone this no one can complain of your being enraged against us.\"\n\nUlysses again glared at him and said, \"Though you should give me all\nthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have,\nI will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must\nfight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.\"\n\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\n\n\"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he\nis and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then\nshow fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you\nfrom his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the\npavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise\nsuch an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,\nand with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot\nan arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself\nin his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.\nThe cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the\nearth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool\nwith his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.\n\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and\nget him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and\nstruck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and\nwent right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and\nstruck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from\nhim, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he\nstayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack\nat him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and\nimmediately was at his father's side. Then he said:\n\n\"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for\nyour temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour for\nthe swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.\"\n\n\"Run and fetch them,\" answered Ulysses, \"while my arrows hold out, or\nwhen I am alone they may get me away from the door.\"\n\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where\nthe armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass\nhelmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his\nfather, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd\nalso put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile\nUlysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one\nby one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he\nset the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post,\nand hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely\nhead he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that\nnodded menacingly above it, {168} and he grasped two redoubtable\nbronze-shod spears.\n\nNow there was a trap door {169} on the wall, while at one end of the\npavement {170} there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this\nexit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by\nthis door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time.\nBut Agelaus shouted out, \"Cannot some one go up to the trap door and\ntell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should\nsoon make an end of this man and his shooting.\"\n\n\"This may not be, Agelaus,\" answered Melanthius, \"the mouth of the\nnarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One\nbrave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I\nwill do, I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is\nthere that Ulysses and his son have put them.\"\n\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room\nof Ulysses' house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets\nand spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to\nthe suitors. Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors\n{171} putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw the\ngreatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, \"Some one of the women\ninside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be Melanthius.\"\n\nTelemachus answered, \"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left\nthe store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than\nI have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the\nwomen who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the\nson of Dolius.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the\nstore room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to\nUlysses who was beside him, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that\nscoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the store\nroom. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall\nI bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many\nwrongs that he has done in your house?\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no\nmatter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands and\nfeet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast\nbehind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him close up\nto the rafters from a high bearing-post, {172} that he may linger on in\nan agony.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the\nstore room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was\nbusy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the\ntwo took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by\nMelanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted\nshield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,\nbut which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become\nunsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and\nthrew him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had\ntold them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up\nfrom a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did\nyou then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus saying, \"Melanthius, you will pass\nthe night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when\nmorning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be\ndriving in your goats for the suitors to feast on.\"\n\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\ntheir armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the\ncloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the\nbody of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's daughter\nMinerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor.\nUlysses was glad when he saw her and said, \"Mentor, lend me your help,\nand forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done\nyou. Besides, you are my age-mate.\"\n\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the\nother side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to\nreproach her. \"Mentor,\" he cried, \"do not let Ulysses beguile you into\nsiding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when\nwe have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You\nshall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will\ntake all you have, in doors or out, and bring it into hotch-pot with\nUlysses' property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor\nyour daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of\nIthaca.\"\n\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\nangrily. {173} \"Ulysses,\" said she, \"your strength and prowess are no\nlonger what they were when you fought for nine long years among the\nTrojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days,\nand it was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes\nit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own\nground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come on, my\ngood fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcimus shall\nfight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.\"\n\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\nfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew\nup to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in\nthe form of a swallow.\n\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon\nthe suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives\nthey were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen\nunder the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, \"My\nfriends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after\nhaving done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors\nunsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your\nspears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by\nkilling him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the others.\"\n\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of\nno effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the\npointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had\navoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, \"My\nfriends, I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of\nthem, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us\noutright.\"\n\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.\nUlysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while\nthe stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others\ndrew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained\ntheir spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.\n\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\nweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\nthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of\nanother struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the\ntop skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze\nEumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell\nto the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of\nsuitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\nPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\ntaunted him saying, \"Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so\nfoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your\nspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present of\nthis advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he was\nbegging about in his own house.\"\n\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a\nspear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in\nthe belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward\nfull on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the\nrafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed.\nThey fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened\nby the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest. As\neagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on\nthe smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill\nthem, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the\nsport--even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite\nthem on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were\nbeing battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.\n\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, \"Ulysses I beseech\nyou have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in\nyour house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I\nsaw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their\nfolly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks\nfor all the good that I did.\"\n\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, \"If you were their\nsacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be\nlong before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have\nchildren by her. Therefore you shall die.\"\n\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\nhe was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck\nLeiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the\ndust while he was yet speaking.\n\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes--he who had been forced by the\nsuitors to sing to them--now tried to save his life. He was standing\nnear towards the trap door, {174} and held his lyre in his hand. He did\nnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar of\nJove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Ulysses\nhad offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight\nup to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best\nto embrace Ulysses' knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground between the\nmixing bowl {175} and the silver-studded seat; then going up to Ulysses\nhe caught hold of his knees and said, \"Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy\non me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you kill a\nbard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays\nmyself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would\nsing to you as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a\nhurry to cut my head off. Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I\ndid not want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their\nmeals, but they were too many and too strong for me, so they made me.\"\n\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. \"Hold!\" he\ncried, \"the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon\ntoo, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or\nEumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you\nwere raging about the court.\"\n\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a\nseat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\nflayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\nand laid hold of his knees.\n\n\"Here I am, my dear sir,\" said he, \"stay your hand therefore, and tell\nyour father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for\nhaving wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to\nyourself.\"\n\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"Fear not; Telemachus has saved your\nlife, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly\nbetter good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside\nthe cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the\nslaughter--you and the bard--while I finish my work here inside.\"\n\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down\nby Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that\nthey would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully\nover, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,\nbut he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.\nThey were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and\nthrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun\nmakes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one\nagainst the other.\n\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, \"Call nurse Euryclea; I have something\nto say to her.\"\n\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. \"Make\nhaste,\" said he, \"you old woman who have been set over all the other\nwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.\"\n\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room\nand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the\ncorpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been\ndevouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so\nthat he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head\nto foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of\nblood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great\ndeed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \"Old woman,\" said he,\n\"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about\nit; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and\ntheir own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they\nrespected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came\nnear them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their\nwickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the\nhouse have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.\" {176}\n\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" answered Euryclea. \"There are fifty\nwomen in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool,\nand all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all {177} have\nmisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to\nPenelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only\nlately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the\nfemale servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has\nhappened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.\"\n\n\"Do not wake her yet,\" answered Ulysses, \"but tell the women who have\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.\"\n\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to\nUlysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the\nswineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"to remove the dead, and make the women\nhelp you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and\nseats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the\nwomen into the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer\ncourt, and run them through with your swords till they are quite dead,\nand have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used to lie\nin secret with the suitors.\"\n\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\nFirst they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one\nanother in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do\ntheir work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had\ndone this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water,\nwhile Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from\nthe ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors.\nThen when they had made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they\ntook the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall\nof the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not get away:\nand Telemachus said to the other two, \"I shall not let these women die\na clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to\nsleep with the suitors.\"\n\nSo saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the\nbuilding, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch\nthe ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been\nset for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a\nterrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads\nin nooses one after the other and die most miserably. {178} Their feet\nmoved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\n\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\ncourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\nvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut\noff his hands and his feet.\n\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back\ninto the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old\nnurse Euryclea, \"Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and\nfetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go,\nmoreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also\nall the maidservants that are in the house.\"\n\n\"All that you have said is true,\" answered Euryclea, \"but let me bring\nyou some clean clothes--a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on\nyour back any longer. It is not right.\"\n\n\"First light me a fire,\" replied Ulysses.\n\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses\nthoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.\nThen she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;\nwhereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands, and\npressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and\ntaking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep,\nfor he remembered every one of them. {179}\n\n\nBook XXIII\n\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND--EARLY IN THE MORNING\nULYSSES, TELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\n\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear\nhusband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet\nwere nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her\nhead to speak to her. \"Wake up Penelope, my dear child,\" she exclaimed,\n\"and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this\nlong time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has\nkilled the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating\nup his estate and ill treating his son.\"\n\n\"My good nurse,\" answered Penelope, \"you must be mad. The gods sometimes\nsend some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish\npeople become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you;\nfor you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock\nme when I have trouble enough already--talking such nonsense, and waking\nme up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and\nclosed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband\nwent to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back again into the\nwomen's room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to bring me\nsuch absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding. As\nit is your age shall protect you.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Euryclea, \"I am not mocking you. It is quite\ntrue as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger\nwhom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew\nall the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret that he\nmight have his revenge on all these wicked people.\"\n\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,\nand wept for joy. \"But my dear nurse,\" said she, \"explain this to me;\nif he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the\nwicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always\nwere?\"\n\n\"I was not there,\" answered Euryclea, \"and do not know; I only heard\nthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled\nup in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till your\nson came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses\nstanding over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him,\none on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have\nseen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth, and\nlooking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the\ngatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a great fire\nto purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so come\nwith me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last\nthe desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home\nto find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his\nown house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.\"\n\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"do not exult too confidently over all\nthis. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come\nhome--more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both\nof us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is\nangry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end\nof them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor\npoor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence\nof their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land; he\nwill never return home again.\"\n\nThen nurse Euryclea said, \"My child, what are you talking about? but you\nwere all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is\nnever coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side\nat this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was\nwashing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I\nwanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and\nclapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will make this\nbargain with you--if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the\nmost cruel death you can think of.\"\n\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"however wise you may be you can hardly\nfathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of\nmy son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has\nkilled them.\"\n\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she\nconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and\nquestion him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace\nhim. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister, she\nsat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right angles\n{180} [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near one of\nthe bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his\nbrave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time she sat\nsilent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked him full\nin the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\nclothes and failed to recognise him, {181} till Telemachus began to\nreproach her and said:\n\n\"Mother--but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name--why\ndo you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his\nside and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman\ncould bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her\nafter twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much;\nbut your heart always was as hard as a stone.\"\n\nPenelope answered, \"My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find\nno words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot\neven look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses\ncome back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one another\nbetter by and by, for there are tokens with which we two are alone\nacquainted, and which are hidden from all others.\"\n\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, \"Let your mother put me\nto any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.\nShe rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,\nbecause I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,\nhowever, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed\nanother--even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take\nup his quarrel--the man who has killed him must still say good bye to\nhis friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay\nof a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\nconsider this matter.\"\n\n\"Look to it yourself, father,\" answered Telemachus, \"for they say you\nare the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other\nmortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good\nwill, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds\nout.\"\n\n\"I will say what I think will be best,\" answered Ulysses. \"First wash\nand put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and\ndress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if\npeople outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going along\nthe street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in\nthe house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about\nin the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land. Once\nthere, we will settle which of the courses heaven vouchsafes us shall\nseem wisest.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed\nand put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\nhis lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The\nhouse re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people\noutside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married at last.\nShe ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her\nhusband's property until he comes home.\" {182}\n\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been\nhappening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses in his\nown house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him look\ntaller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick on\nthe top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she\nglorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful workman who\nhas studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva--and his work is\nfull of beauty--enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it. He came\nfrom the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite\nhis wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\" said he, \"heaven has\nendowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had. No\nother woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come\nback to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through\nso much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone,\nfor this woman has a heart as hard as iron.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" answered Penelope, \"I have no wish to set myself up, nor to\ndepreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well\nremember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he\nhimself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it\nwith fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\"\n\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \"Wife,\nI am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been\ntaking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it a\nhard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came\nand helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however strong and\nin his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous\ncuriosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a young olive\ngrowing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as\nthick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls\nof stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and\nwell-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left\nthe stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and\nthen worked with carpenter's tools well and skilfully, straightening\nmy work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop.\nI then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the centre-post of my\nbed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and\nsilver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side\nof it to the other. So you see I know all about it, and I desire to\nlearn whether it is still there, or whether any one has been removing it\nby cutting down the olive tree at its roots.\"\n\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\ndown. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and\nkissed him. \"Do not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you, who are\nthe wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied\nus the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together; do\nnot then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus\nas soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through fear\nthat someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story; for\nthere are many very wicked people going about. Jove's daughter Helen\nwould never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country, if she\nhad known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her\nback. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought\nto that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however,\nthat you have convinced me by showing that you know all about our\nbed (which no human being has ever seen but you and I and a single\nmaidservant, the daughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my\nmarriage, and who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I\nhave been I can mistrust no longer.\"\n\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\nfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who\nare swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship with\nthe fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and these,\ncovered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm\nground and out of danger--even so was her husband welcome to her as she\nlooked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about\nhis neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till\nrosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise, and\nheld night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to\nleave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear\nher onward to break the day upon mankind.\n\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, \"Wife, we have not yet reached the end\nof our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. It\nis long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade\nof Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into\nHades to ask about my return and that of my companions. But now let us\ngo to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\"\n\n\"You shall go to bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now that\nthe gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your country.\nBut as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the\ntask that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it later, so it is\nbetter that I should be told at once.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me to tell you?\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I do\nnot like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying\nan oar, till I came to a country where the people have never heard of\nthe sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know nothing\nabout ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this\ncertain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a wayfarer\nshould meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had\non my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice\na ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after which I was to go home and\noffer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for\nmyself, he said that death should come to me from the sea, and that my\nlife should ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of\nmind, and my people should bless me. All this, he said, should surely\ncome to pass.\"\n\nAnd Penelope said, \"If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\ntime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from\nmisfortune.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches\nand made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid\nthem, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the\nbed chamber woman Eurynome {183} to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by\ntorch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\nback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and made\nthe women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\ncloisters.\n\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\nwith one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing\nthe house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many\nsheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine.\nUlysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble\nhe had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she\nwas so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had\nended his whole story.\n\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\nand how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave\ncomrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and\nfurthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for to\nhis great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he went on\nto the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his\nships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only. Then he told\nof cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of\nHades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he\nsaw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who bore him and brought\nhim up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous singing of\nthe Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis\nand to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the\nship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together,\nhimself alone being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian\nisland and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed\nhim, and wanted him to marry her, in which case she intended making him\nimmortal so that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade\nhim to let her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way\nto the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and\nsent him back in a ship to his own country after having given him gold,\nbronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased\nthe burden of his sorrows.\n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned\nDawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On\nthis, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,\n\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in\nlamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though\nI was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last\ncome together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for\nthe sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take\nmany myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now\ngoing to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has\nso long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these\ninstructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will\nat once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs,\ntherefore, {184} and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no\nquestions.\" {185}\n\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also.\nThis they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they\nopened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now\ndaylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led\nthem quickly out of the town.\n\n\nBook XXIV\n\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES--ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE\nOF LAERTES--THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA\nCONCLUDES A PEACE.\n\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his\nhand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in\nsleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts\nand led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As\nbats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them\nhas fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts\nwhine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down into the\ndark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of Oceanus and the\nrock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and the land of dreams,\nwhereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and\nshadows of them that can labour no more.\n\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man\nof all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.\n\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of\nAgamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also\nthe ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus;\nand the ghost of Achilles spoke first.\n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used to say that Jove had loved you better\nfrom first to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many\nand brave men, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the\nhand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too\nearly. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your\nrenown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes, and\nyour son would have been heir to your good name, whereas it has now been\nyour lot to come to a most miserable end.\"\n\n\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\ndied at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the\nAchaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the\nwhirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your\nchivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever\nhave left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then, when we\nhad borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed and\ncleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The Danaans\ntore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she\nheard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound\nof a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans\nquaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had\nnot wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying,\n'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming\nfrom the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.'\n\n\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the\nold man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you\nin immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet\nvoices in lament--calling and answering one another; there was not an\nArgive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights\nseven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the\neighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many\nan ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of\nthe gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot,\nclashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp\nas of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done\ntheir work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in\nointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold\nthem--gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled\nyour bleached bones with those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and\nseparate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, who had been closer to\nyou than any other of your comrades now that Patroclus was no more.\n\n\"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\nto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\nbeen present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\nthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death\nyour fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore\namong all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my\nfighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the\nhands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the\nghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of\nAgamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up\nto them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of\nMelaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to talk\nto him.\n\n\"Amphimedon,\" it said, \"what has happened to all you fine young men--all\nof an age too--that you are come down here under the ground? One could\npick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and\nwaves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end\nof you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing,\nor while fighting in defence of their wives and city? Answer my\nquestion, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how I came to\nyour house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships\nagainst Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for\nwe had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.\"\n\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of\nmen, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully\nand accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses\nhad been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point\nblank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she\nmeant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick she played\nus. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an\nenormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,' said she, 'Ulysses\nis indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately;\nwait--for I would not have my skill in needlework perish\nunrecorded--till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, against\nthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This is what she\nsaid, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great\nweb all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again\nby torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without our\nfinding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year,\nin the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one of her\nmaids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act\nof undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no;\nand when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it\nwashed, {186} its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.\n\n\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from\na voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched\ntheir plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after\nhim, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and\nleaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came\nso unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among\nus, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being\nstruck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but\nwhen the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus\ntook the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind\nthem. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity\nof iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the\nbeginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow--nor nearly\ndo so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us\nshouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might\nsay, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his\nhands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then\nhe stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the\nground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and then,\naiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was\nhelping them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the\ncloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains\nwere being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This,\nAgamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still\nuncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not\nyet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash\nthe black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\noffices due to the departed.\"\n\n\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\nare indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\nexcellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as\nPenelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be\nwelcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far\notherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed her\nlawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought\ndisgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\n\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels\nof the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town\nand soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he\nhad reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a lean-to\nrunning all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat\nand ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked\nafter him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there, he said to\nhis son and to the other two:\n\n\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\nMeanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\nrecognise me after so long an absence.\"\n\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who\nwent straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to\nmake trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did\nnot see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they\nwere all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place\nwhere the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone,\nhoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby;\nhis legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the\nbrambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on\nhis head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn,\nso old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and\nbegan to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him\nall about his having come home, or whether he should first question him\nand see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty\nwith him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down\nand digging about a plant.\n\n\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener--what\npains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a\nfig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your\nattention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I say\nthat you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are old,\nunsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that\nyour master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure\nhave nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth.\nI should have said that you were one of those who should wash well, eat\nwell, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but tell me,\nand tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have\ncome to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a\ndull fellow, and had not the patience to hear my story out when I was\nasking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was still living, or\nwas already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you\nthat this man came to my house once when I was in my own country and\nnever yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that\nhis family came from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of\nArceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the\nabundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid\nsilver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks,\nand as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single\nfold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts.\nTo all this I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts,\nand I let him take his choice.\"\n\nHis father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come to the\ncountry that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked\npeople. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If\nyou could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have\nentertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply\nwhen you left him--as would have been only right considering what you\nhad already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is\nit since you entertained this guest--my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!\nHe has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have\neaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents,\ncould throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could\nhis excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was\nnatural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices\ndue to the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who\nand whence are you--tell me of your town and parents? Where is the\nship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a\npassenger on some other man's ship, and those who brought you here have\ngone on their way and left you?\"\n\n\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who\nis the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my\ncourse as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against\nmy will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open country\noutside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left my\ncountry. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left me.\nThe birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to\nsee them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have another\nfriendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\n\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both\nhands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey\nhead, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,\nand his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang\ntowards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, \"I am he,\nfather, about whom you are asking--I have returned after having been\naway for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation--we have\nno time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the\nsuitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\n\n\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come back\nagain, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall\nconvince me.\"\n\n\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar's\ntusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me\nto Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive the presents which when he\nwas over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out\nto you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all\nabout them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,\nand you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me thirteen\npear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also said you\nwould give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted between each\nrow, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has\nbeen laid heavy upon them.\"\n\nLaertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\nhis son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to\nsupport him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he\ncame to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \"O father\nJove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have\nreally been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I\nam much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here\ndirectly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the\ncities of the Cephallenians.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,\nbut let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready\nas soon as possible.\"\n\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got\nthere they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting\nup meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took\nLaertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on\na good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing\npresence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back\nhis son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said\nto him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much\ntaller and better-looking.\"\n\nLaertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that\nI were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\nNericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I\nthen was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I should\nhave been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors. I\nshould have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to\nsee it.\"\n\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper\nplace on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old\nDolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother, the\nSicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old, had\nbeen to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain it was he,\nthey stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded them good\nnaturedly and said, \"Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind\nabout your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some time and\nhave been waiting for you.\"\n\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \"Sir,\" said\nhe, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we have long\nbeen wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we\nhad given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.\n{187} But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall\nwe send some one to tell her?\"\n\n\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, so you need not trouble\nabout that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered\nround Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;\nthen they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\n\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round\nthe town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the\nsuitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\nfrom every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\nThey took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\nof those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the\nfishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily\nin the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes\nrose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son\nAntinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\nweeping bitterly, \"My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great\nwrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he\nhas lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been\nkilling all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and\ndoing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule,\nor we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an\neverlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons\nand brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life,\nbut had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before\nthey can cross over to the main land.\"\n\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\nPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of\nthe assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not\ndo these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god\ntake the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in\nfront of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court\nand attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one another.\"\n\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor,\nrose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and\nfuture; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\n\n\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as\nthey have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we\nbade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the\nwantonness of their hearts--wasting the substance and dishonouring the\nwife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however, let\nit be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses, or\nyou may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.\"\n\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at\nonce left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the\nspeech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\nthey therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\nthemselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led\nthem on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder\nof his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to\nperish in his attempt.\n\nThen Minerva said to Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer\nme this question--What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting\nstill further, or will you make peace between them?\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your\nown arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the\nsuitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will\nbe most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them\nswear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to\nrule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of\ntheir sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore,\nand let peace and plenty reign.\"\n\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she\ndarted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.\n\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\nsaying, \"Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up\nto us.\" So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on the\nthreshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, \"Here\nthey are, let us put on our armour at once.\"\n\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could--that is to say Ulysses,\nhis three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did\nthe same--warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they\nhad all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,\nUlysses leading the way.\n\nThen Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form\nand voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to\nhis son Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an\nengagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace\nyour ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the\nworld over.\"\n\n\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\nsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.\"\n\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens,\" he exclaimed,\n\"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and\ngrandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.\"\n\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, \"Son of Arceisius---best\nfriend I have in the world--pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove\nher father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\"\n\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed\nto her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet, and\nthe spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nMeantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and\nsmote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\nevery one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\nonly Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men of\nIthaca,\" she cried, \"cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at\nonce without further bloodshed.\"\n\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their\narms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of\nthe goddess' voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But\nUlysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down\nlike a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire\nthat fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, \"Ulysses,\nnoble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry\nwith you.\"\n\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\nthe form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace\nbetween the two contending parties.\n\n\n\n                        FOOTNOTES\n\n{1} Black races are evidently known to the writer as stretching all\nacross Africa, one half looking West on to the Atlantic, and the other\nEast on to the Indian Ocean.\n\n{2} The original use of the footstool was probably less to rest the feet\nthan to keep them (especially when bare) from a floor which was often\nwet and dirty.\n\n{3} The [Greek] or seat, is occasionally called \"high,\" as being higher\nthan the [Greek] or low footstool. It was probably no higher than an\nordinary chair is now, and seems to have had no back.\n\n{4} Temesa was on the West Coast of the toe of Italy, in what is now the\ngulf of Sta Eufemia. It was famous in remote times for its copper mines,\nwhich, however, were worked out when Strabo wrote.\n\n{5} i.e. \"with a current in it\"--see illustrations and map near the end\nof bks. v. and vi. respectively.\n\n{6} Reading [Greek] for [Greek], cf. \"Od.\" iii. 81 where the same\nmistake is made, and xiii. 351 where the mountain is called Neritum, the\nsame place being intended both here and in book xiii.\n\n{7} It is never plausibly explained why Penelope cannot do this, and\nfrom bk. ii. it is clear that she kept on deliberately encouraging the\nsuitors, though we are asked to believe that she was only fooling them.\n\n{8} See note on \"Od.\" i. 365.\n\n{9} Middle Argos means the Peleponnese which, however, is never so\ncalled in the \"Iliad\". I presume \"middle\" means \"middle between the two\nGreek-speaking countries of Asia Minor and Sicily, with South Italy\";\nfor that parts of Sicily and also large parts, though not the whole of\nSouth Italy, were inhabited by Greek-speaking races centuries before the\nDorian colonisations can hardly be doubted. The Sicians, and also the\nSicels, both of them probably spoke Greek.\n\n{10} cf. \"Il.\" vi. 490-495. In the \"Iliad\" it is \"war,\" not \"speech,\"\nthat is a man's matter. It argues a certain hardness, or at any rate\ndislike of the \"Iliad\" on the part of the writer of the \"Odyssey,\"\nthat she should have adopted Hector's farewell to Andromache here, as\nelsewhere in the poem, for a scene of such inferior pathos.\n\n{11} [Greek] The whole open court with the covered cloister running\nround it was called [Greek], or [Greek], but the covered part was\ndistinguished by being called \"shady\" or \"shadow-giving\". It was in this\npart that the tables for the suitors were laid. The Fountain Court at\nHampton Court may serve as an illustration (save as regards the use of\narches instead of wooden supports and rafters) and the arrangement\nis still common in Sicily. The usual translation \"shadowy\" or \"dusky\"\nhalls, gives a false idea of the scene.\n\n{12} The reader will note the extreme care which the writer takes to\nmake it clear that none of the suitors were allowed to sleep in Ulysses'\nhouse.\n\n{13} See Appendix; g, in plan of Ulysses' house.\n\n{14} I imagine this passage to be a rejoinder to \"Il.\" xxiii. 702-705 in\nwhich a tripod is valued at twelve oxen, and a good useful maid of\nall work at only four. The scrupulous regard of Laertes for his wife's\nfeelings is of a piece with the extreme jealousy for the honour of\nwoman, which is manifest throughout the \"Odyssey\".\n\n{15} [Greek] \"The [Greek], or tunica, was a shirt or shift, and served\nas the chief under garment of the Greeks and Romans, whether men\nor women.\" Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, under\n\"Tunica\".\n\n{16} Doors fastened to all intents and purposes as here described may be\nseen in the older houses at Trapani. There is a slot on the outer side\nof the door by means of which a person who has left the room can shoot\nthe bolt. My bedroom at the Albergo Centrale was fastened in this way.\n\n{17} [Greek] So we vulgarly say \"had cooked his goose,\" or \"had settled\nhis hash.\" Aegyptus cannot of course know of the fate Antiphus had met\nwith, for there had as yet been no news of or from Ulysses.\n\n{18} \"Il.\" xxii. 416. [Greek] The authoress has bungled by borrowing\nthese words verbatim from the \"Iliad\", without prefixing the necessary\n\"do not,\" which I have supplied.\n\n{19} i.e. you have money, and could pay when I got judgment, whereas the\nsuitors are men of straw.\n\n{20} cf. \"Il.\" ii. 76. [Greek]. The Odyssean passage runs [Greek]. Is\nit possible not to suspect that the name Mentor was coined upon that of\nNestor?\n\n{21} i.e. in the outer court, and in the uncovered part of the inner\nhouse.\n\n{22} This would be fair from Sicily, which was doing duty for Ithaca in\nthe mind of the writer, but a North wind would have been preferable for\na voyage from the real Ithaca to Pylos.\n\n{23} [Greek] The wind does not whistle over waves. It only whistles\nthrough rigging or some other obstacle that cuts it.\n\n{24} cf. \"Il.\" v.20. [Greek] The Odyssean line is [Greek]. There can\nbe no doubt that the Odyssean line was suggested by the Iliadic, but\nnothing can explain why Idaeus jumping from his chariot should suggest\nto the writer of the \"Odyssey\" the sun jumping from the sea. The\nprobability is that she never gave the matter a thought, but took the\nline in question as an effect of saturation with the \"Iliad,\" and of\nunconscious cerebration. The \"Odyssey\" contains many such examples.\n\n{25} The heart, liver, lights, kidneys, etc. were taken out from the\ninside and eaten first as being more readily cooked; the [Greek], or\nbone meat, was cooking while the [Greek] or inward parts were being\neaten. I imagine that the thigh bones made a kind of gridiron, while at\nthe same time the marrow inside them got cooked.\n\n{26} i.e. skewers, either single, double, or even five pronged. The meat\nwould be pierced with the skewer, and laid over the ashes to grill--the\ntwo ends of the skewer being supported in whatever way convenient. Meat\nso cooking may be seen in any eating house in Smyrna, or any Eastern\ntown. When I rode across the Troad from the Dardanelles to Hissarlik and\nMount Ida, I noticed that my dragoman and his men did all our outdoor\ncooking exactly in the Odyssean and Iliadic fashion.\n\n{27} cf. \"Il.\" xvii. 567. [Greek] The Odyssean lines are--[Greek]\n\n{28} Reading [Greek] for [Greek], cf. \"Od.\" i.186.\n\n{29} The geography of the Aegean as above described is correct, but is\nprobably taken from the lost poem, the Nosti, the existence of which is\nreferred to \"Od.\" i.326,327 and 350, etc. A glance at the map will show\nthat heaven advised its supplicants quite correctly.\n\n{30} The writer--ever jealous for the honour of women--extenuates\nClytemnestra's guilt as far as possible, and explains it as due to her\nhaving been left unprotected, and fallen into the hands of a wicked man.\n\n{31} The Greek is [Greek] cf. \"Iliad\" ii. 408 [Greek] Surely the [Greek]\nof the Odyssean passage was due to the [Greek] of the \"Iliad.\" No other\nreason suggests itself for the making Menelaus return on the very day of\nthe feast given by Orestes. The fact that in the \"Iliad\" Menelaus came\nto a banquet without waiting for an invitation, determines the writer\nof the \"Odyssey\" to make him come to a banquet, also uninvited, but\nas circumstances did not permit of his having been invited, his coming\nuninvited is shown to have been due to chance. I do not think the\nauthoress thought all this out, but attribute the strangeness of the\ncoincidence to unconscious cerebration and saturation.\n\n{32} cf. \"Il.\" i.458, ii. 421. The writer here interrupts an Iliadic\npassage (to which she returns immediately) for the double purpose of\ndwelling upon the slaughter of the heifer, and of letting Nestor's wife\nand daughter enjoy it also. A male writer, if he was borrowing from the\n\"Iliad,\" would have stuck to his borrowing.\n\n{33} cf. \"Il.\" xxiv. 587,588 where the lines refer to the washing the\ndead body of Hector.\n\n{34} See illustration on opposite page. The yard is typical of many that\nmay be seen in Sicily. The existing ground-plan is probably unmodified\nfrom Odyssean, and indeed long pre-Odyssean times, but the earlier\nbuildings would have no arches, and would, one would suppose, be mainly\ntimber. The Odyssean [Greek] were the sheds that ran round the yard\nas the arches do now. The [Greek] was the one through which the main\nentrance passed, and which was hence \"noisy,\" or reverberating. It had\nan upper story in which visitors were often lodged.\n\n{35} This journey is an impossible one. Telemachus and Pisistratus would\nhave been obliged to drive over the Taygetus range, over which there has\nnever yet been a road for wheeled vehicles. It is plain therefore that\nthe audience for whom the \"Odyssey\" was written was one that would be\nunlikely to know anything about the topography of the Peloponnese, so\nthat the writer might take what liberties she chose.\n\n{36} The lines which I have enclosed in brackets are evidently an\nafterthought--added probably by the writer herself--for they evince\nthe same instinctively greater interest in anything that may concern a\nwoman, which is so noticeable throughout the poem. There is no further\nsign of any special festivities nor of any other guests than Telemachus\nand Pisistratus, until lines 621-624 (ordinarily enclosed in brackets)\nare abruptly introduced, probably with a view of trying to carry off the\nintroduction of the lines now in question.\n\nThe addition was, I imagine, suggested by a desire to excuse and explain\nthe non-appearance of Hermione in bk. xv., as also of both Hermione and\nMegapenthes in the rest of bk. iv. Megapenthes in bk. xv. seems to be\nstill a bachelor: the presumption therefore is that bk. xv. was written\nbefore the story of his marriage here given. I take it he is only\nmarried here because his sister is being married. She having been\nproperly attended to, Megapenthes might as well be married at the same\ntime. Hermione could not now be less than thirty.\n\nI have dealt with this passage somewhat more fully in my \"Authoress of\nthe Odyssey\", p.136-138. See also p. 256 of the same book.\n\n{37} Sparta and Lacedaemon are here treated as two different places,\nthough in other parts of the poem it is clear that the writer\nunderstands them as one. The catalogue in the \"Iliad,\" which the writer\nis here presumably following, makes the same mistake (\"Il.\" ii. 581,582)\n\n{38} These last three lines are identical with \"Il.\" vxiii. 604-606.\n\n{39} From the Greek [Greek] it is plain that Menelaus took up the piece\nof meat with his fingers.\n\n{40} Amber is never mentioned in the \"Iliad.\" Sicily, where I suppose\nthe \"Odyssey\" to have been written, has always been, and still is, one\nof the principal amber producing countries. It was probably the only one\nknown in the Odyssean age. See \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\", p260.\n\n{41} This no doubt refers to the story told in the last poem of the\nCypria about Paris and Helen robbing Menelaus of the greater part of his\ntreasures, when they sailed together for Troy.\n\n{42} It is inconceivable that Helen should enter thus, in the middle of\nsupper, intending to work with her distaff, if great festivities were\ngoing on. Telemachus and Pisistratus are evidently dining en famille.\n\n{43} In the Italian insurrection of 1848, eight young men who were being\nhotly pursued by the Austrian police hid themselves inside Donatello's\ncolossal wooden horse in the Salone at Padua, and remained there for\na week being fed by their confederates. In 1898 the last survivor was\ncarried round Padua in triumph.\n\n{44} The Greek is [Greek]. Is it unfair to argue that the writer is a\nperson of somewhat delicate sensibility, to whom a strong smell of fish\nis distasteful?\n\n{45} The Greek is [Greek]. I believe this to be a hit at the writer's\nown countrymen who were of Phocaean descent, and the next following line\nto be a rejoinder to complaints made against her in bk. vi. 273-288, to\nthe effect that she gave herself airs and would marry none of her own\npeople. For that the writer of the \"Odyssey\" was the person who has\nbeen introduced into the poem under the name of Nausicaa, I cannot bring\nmyself to question. I may remind English readers that [Greek] (i.e.\nphoca) means \"seal.\" Seals almost always appear on Phocaean coins.\n\n{46} Surely here again we are in the hands of a writer of delicate\nsensibility. It is not as though the seals were stale; they had only\njust been killed. The writer, however is obviously laughing at her own\ncountrymen, and insulting them as openly as she dares.\n\n{47} We were told above (lines 357,357) that it was only one day's sail.\n\n{48} I give the usual translation, but I do not believe the Greek will\nwarrant it. The Greek reads [Greek].\n\nThis is usually held to mean that Ithaca is an island fit for breeding\ngoats, and on that account more delectable to the speaker than it would\nhave been if it were fit for breeding horses. I find little authority\nfor such a translation; the most equitable translation of the text as it\nstands is, \"Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and delectable\nrather than fit for breeding horses; for not one of the islands is good\ndriving ground, nor well meadowed.\" Surely the writer does not mean that\na pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?\nThe most equitable translation, therefore, of the present text being\nthus halt and impotent, we may suspect corruption, and I hazard the\nfollowing emendation, though I have not adopted it in my translation, as\nfearing that it would be deemed too fanciful. I would read:--[Greek].\n\nAs far as scanning goes the [Greek] is not necessary; [Greek] iv. 72,\n[Greek] iv. 233, to go no further afield than earlier lines of the same\nbook, give sufficient authority for [Greek], but the [Greek] would not\nbe redundant; it would emphasise the surprise of the contrast, and I\nshould prefer to have it, though it is not very important either way.\nThis reading of course should be translated \"Ithaca is an island fit for\nbreeding goats, and (by your leave) itself a horseman rather than\nfit for breeding horses--for not one of the islands is good and well\nmeadowed ground.\"\n\nThis would be sure to baffle the Alexandrian editors. \"How,\" they would\nask themselves, \"could an island be a horseman?\" and they would cast\nabout for an emendation. A visit to the top of Mt. Eryx might perhaps\nmake the meaning intelligible, and suggest my proposed restoration of\nthe text to the reader as readily as it did to myself.\n\nI have elsewhere stated my conviction that the writer of the \"Odyssey\"\nwas familiar with the old Sican city at the top of Mt. Eryx, and that\nthe Aegadean islands which are so striking when seen thence did duty\nwith her for the Ionian islands--Marettimo, the highest and most\nwesterly of the group, standing for Ithaca. When seen from the top of\nMt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do according to \"Od.\" ix. 25,26,\n\"on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the West,\" while\nthe other islands lie \"some way off it to the East.\" As we descend\nto Trapani, Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of\nLevanzo, behind which it disappears. My friend, the late Signor E.\nBiaggini, pointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of\nLevanzo, and said to me \"Come cavalca bene\" (\"How well it rides\"), and\nthis immediately suggested my emendation to me. Later on I found in\nthe hymn to the Pythian Apollo (which abounds with tags taken from the\n\"Odyssey\") a line ending [Greek] which strengthened my suspicion that\nthis was the original ending of the second of the two lines above under\nconsideration.\n\n{49} See note on line 3 of this book. The reader will observe that\nthe writer has been unable to keep the women out of an interpolation\nconsisting only of four lines.\n\n{50} Scheria means a piece of land jutting out into the sea. In my\n\"Authoress of the Odyssey\" I thought \"Jutland\" would be a suitable\ntranslation, but it has been pointed out to me that \"Jutland\" only means\nthe land of the Jutes.\n\n{51} Irrigation as here described is common in gardens near Trapani. The\nwater that supplies the ducts is drawn from wells by a mule who turns a\nwheel with buckets on it.\n\n{52} There is not a word here about the cattle of the sun-god.\n\n{53} The writer evidently thought that green, growing wood might also be\nwell seasoned.\n\n{54} The reader will note that the river was flowing with salt water\ni.e. that it was tidal.\n\n{55} Then the Ogygian island was not so far off, but that Nausicaa might\nbe assumed to know where it was.\n\n{56} Greek [Greek]\n\n{57} I suspect a family joke, or sly allusion to some thing of which\nwe know nothing, in this story of Eurymedusa's having been brought from\nApeira. The Greek word \"apeiros\" means \"inexperienced,\" \"ignorant.\" Is\nit possible that Eurymedusa was notoriously incompetent?\n\n{58} Polyphemus was also son to Neptune, see \"Od.\" ix. 412,529. he was\ntherefore half brother to Nausithous, half uncle to King Alcinous, and\nhalf great uncle to Nausicaa.\n\n{59} It would seem as though the writer thought that Marathon was close\nto Athens.\n\n{60} Here the writer, knowing that she is drawing (with embellishments)\nfrom things actually existing, becomes impatient of past tenses and\nslides into the present.\n\n{61} This is hidden malice, implying that the Phaeacian magnates were\nno better than they should be. The final drink-offering should have been\nmade to Jove or Neptune, not to the god of thievishness and rascality\nof all kinds. In line 164 we do indeed find Echeneus proposing that\na drink-offering should be made to Jove, but Mercury is evidently,\naccording to our authoress, the god who was most likely to be of use to\nthem.\n\n{62} The fact of Alcinous knowing anything about the Cyclopes suggests\nthat in the writer's mind Scheria and the country of the Cyclopes were\nnot very far from one another. I take the Cyclopes and the giants to be\none and the same people.\n\n{63} \"My property, etc.\" The authoress is here adopting an Iliadic line\n(xix. 333), and this must account for the absence of all reference\nto Penelope. If she had happened to remember \"Il.\" v.213, she would\ndoubtless have appropriated it by preference, for that line reads \"my\ncountry, my wife, and all the greatness of my house.\"\n\n{64} The at first inexplicable sleep of Ulysses (bk. xiii. 79, etc.)\nis here, as also in viii. 445, being obviously prepared. The writer\nevidently attached the utmost importance to it. Those who know that the\nharbour which did duty with the writer of the \"Odyssey\" for the one in\nwhich Ulysses landed in Ithaca, was only about 2 miles from the place\nin which Ulysses is now talking with Alcinous, will understand why the\nsleep was so necessary.\n\n{65} There were two classes--the lower who were found in provisions\nwhich they had to cook for themselves in the yards and outer precincts,\nwhere they would also eat--and the upper who would eat in the cloisters\nof the inner court, and have their cooking done for them.\n\n{66} Translation very dubious. I suppose the [Greek] here to be the\ncovered sheds that ran round the outer courtyard. See illustrations at\nthe end of bk. iii.\n\n{67} The writer apparently deems that the words \"as compared with what\noxen can plough in the same time\" go without saying. Not so the writer\nof the \"Iliad\" from which the Odyssean passage is probably taken. He\nexplains that mules can plough quicker than oxen (\"Il.\" x.351-353)\n\n{68} It was very fortunate that such a disc happened to be there, seeing\nthat none like it were in common use.\n\n{69} \"Il.\" xiii. 37. Here, as so often elsewhere in the \"Odyssey,\" the\nappropriation of an Iliadic line which is not quite appropriate puzzles\nthe reader. The \"they\" is not the chains, nor yet Mars and Venus. It is\nan overflow from the Iliadic passage in which Neptune hobbles his horses\nin bonds \"which none could either unloose or break so that they might\nstay there in that place.\" If the line would have scanned without the\naddition of the words \"so that they might stay there in that place,\"\nthey would have been omitted in the \"Odyssey.\"\n\n{70} The reader will note that Alcinous never goes beyond saying that\nhe is going to give the goblet; he never gives it. Elsewhere in both\n\"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" the offer of a present is immediately followed by\nthe statement that it was given and received gladly--Alcinous actually\ndoes give a chest and a cloak and shirt--probably also some of the corn\nand wine for the long two-mile voyage was provided by him--but it is\nquite plain that he gave no talent and no cup.\n\n{71} \"Il.\" xviii, 344-349. These lines in the \"Iliad\" tell of the\npreparation for washing the body of Patroclus, and I am not pleased that\nthe writer of the \"Odyssey\" should have adopted them here.\n\n{72} see note {64}\n\n{73} see note {43}\n\n{74} The reader will find this threat fulfilled in bk. xiii\n\n{75} If the other islands lay some distance away from Ithaca (which\nthe word [Greek] suggests), what becomes of the [Greek] or gut between\nIthaca and Samos which we hear of in Bks. iv. and xv.? I suspect that\nthe authoress in her mind makes Telemachus come back from Pylos to the\nLilybaean promontory and thence to Trapani through the strait between\nthe Isola Grande and the mainland--the island of Asteria being the one\non which Motya afterwards stood.\n\n{76} \"Il.\" xviii. 533-534. The sudden lapse into the third person here\nfor a couple of lines is due to the fact that the two Iliadic lines\ntaken are in the third person.\n\n{77} cf. \"Il.\" ii. 776. The words in both \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" are\n[Greek]. In the \"Iliad\" they are used of the horses of Achilles'\nfollowers as they stood idle, \"champing lotus.\"\n\n{78} I take all this passage about the Cyclopes having no ships to\nbe sarcastic--meaning, \"You people of Drepanum have no excuse for not\ncolonising the island of Favognana, which you could easily do, for you\nhave plenty of ships, and the island is a very good one.\" For that\nthe island so fully described here is the Aegadean or \"goat\" island of\nFavognana, and that the Cyclopes are the old Sican inhabitants of Mt.\nEryx should not be doubted.\n\n{79} For the reasons why it was necessary that the night should be so\nexceptionally dark see \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\" pp. 188-189.\n\n{80} None but such lambs as would suck if they were with their mothers\nwould be left in the yard. The older lambs should have been out feeding.\nThe authoress has got it all wrong, but it does not matter. See \"The\nAuthoress of the Odyssey\" p.148.\n\n{81} This line is enclosed in brackets in the received text, and is\nomitted (with note) by Messrs. Butcher & Lang. But lines enclosed in\nbrackets are almost always genuine; all that brackets mean is that the\nbracketed passage puzzled some early editor, who nevertheless found\nit too well established in the text to venture on omitting it. In the\npresent case the line bracketed is the very last which a full-grown male\neditor would be likely to interpolate. It is safer to infer that the\nwriter, a young woman, not knowing or caring at which end of the ship\nthe rudder should be, determined to make sure by placing it at both\nends, which we shall find she presently does by repeating it (line 340)\nat the stern of the ship. As for the two rocks thrown, the first I take\nto be the Asinelli, see map facing p.80. The second I see as the two\ncontiguous islands of the Formiche, which are treated as one, see map\nfacing p.108. The Asinelli is an island shaped like a boat, and pointing\nto the island of Favognana. I think the authoress's compatriots, who\nprobably did not like her much better that she did them, jeered at the\nabsurdity of Ulysses' conduct, and saw the Asinelli or \"donkeys,\" not as\nthe rock thrown by Polyphemus, but as the boat itself containing Ulysses\nand his men.\n\n{82} This line exists in the text here but not in the corresponding\npassage xii. 141. I am inclined to think it is interpolated (probably\nby the poetess herself) from the first of lines xi. 115-137, which I can\nhardly doubt were added by the writer when the scheme of the work was\nenlarged and altered. See \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\" pp. 254-255.\n\n{83} \"Floating\" ([Greek]) is not to be taken literally. The island\nitself, as apart from its inhabitants, was quite normal. There is no\nindication of its moving during the month that Ulysses stayed with\nAeolus, and on his return from his unfortunate voyage, he seems to\nhave found it in the same place. The [Greek] in fact should no more be\npressed than [Greek] as applied to islands, \"Odyssey\" xv. 299--where\nthey are called \"flying\" because the ship would fly past them. So also\nthe \"Wanderers,\" as explained by Buttmann; see note on \"Odyssey\" xii.\n57.\n\n{84} Literally \"for the ways of the night and of the day are near.\" I\nhave seen what Mr. Andrew Lang says (\"Homer and the Epic,\" p.236, and\n\"Longman's Magazine\" for January, 1898, p.277) about the \"amber route\"\nand the \"Sacred Way\" in this connection; but until he gives his grounds\nfor holding that the Mediterranean peoples in the Odyssean age used to\ngo far North for their amber instead of getting it in Sicily, where it\nis still found in considerable quantities, I do not know what weight I\nought to attach to his opinion. I have been unable to find grounds\nfor asserting that B.C. 1000 there was any commerce between the\nMediterranean and the \"Far North,\" but I shall be very ready to learn\nif Mr. Lang will enlighten me. See \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\" pp.\n185-186.\n\n{85} One would have thought that when the sun was driving the stag down\nto the water, Ulysses might have observed its whereabouts.\n\n{86} See Hobbes of Malmesbury's translation.\n\n{87} \"Il.\" vxiii. 349. Again the writer draws from the washing the body\nof Patroclus--which offends.\n\n{88} This visit is wholly without topographical significance.\n\n{89} Brides presented themselves instinctively to the imagination of the\nwriter, as the phase of humanity which she found most interesting.\n\n{90} Ulysses was, in fact, to become a missionary and preach Neptune to\npeople who knew not his name. I was fortunate enough to meet in Sicily\na woman carrying one of these winnowing shovels; it was not much shorter\nthan an oar, and I was able at once to see what the writer of the\n\"Odyssey\" intended.\n\n{91} I suppose the lines I have enclosed in brackets to have been added\nby the author when she enlarged her original scheme by the addition of\nbooks i.-iv. and xiii. (from line 187)-xxiv. The reader will observe\nthat in the corresponding passage (xii. 137-141) the prophecy ends with\n\"after losing all your comrades,\" and that there is no allusion to the\nsuitors. For fuller explanation see \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\" pp.\n254-255.\n\n{92} The reader will remember that we are in the first year of Ulysses'\nwanderings, Telemachus therefore was only eleven years old. The same\nanachronism is made later on in this book. See \"The Authoress of the\nOdyssey\" pp. 132-133.\n\n{93} Tradition says that she had hanged herself. Cf. \"Odyssey\" xv. 355,\netc.\n\n{94} Not to be confounded with Aeolus king of the winds.\n\n{95} Melampus, vide book xv. 223, etc.\n\n{96} I have already said in a note on bk. xi. 186 that at this point of\nUlysses' voyage Telemachus could only be between eleven and twelve years\nold.\n\n{97} Is the writer a man or a woman?\n\n{98} Cf. \"Il.\" iv. 521, [Greek]. The Odyssean line reads, [Greek]. The\nfamous dactylism, therefore, of the Odyssean line was probably suggested\nby that of the Ileadic rather than by a desire to accommodate sound to\nsense. At any rate the double coincidence of a dactylic line, and an\nending [Greek], seems conclusive as to the familiarity of the writer of\nthe \"Odyssey\" with the Iliadic line.\n\n{99} Off the coast of Sicily and South Italy, in the month of May, I\nhave seen men fastened half way up a boat's mast with their feet resting\non a crosspiece, just large enough to support them. From this point\nof vantage they spear sword-fish. When I saw men thus employed I could\nhardly doubt that the writer of the \"Odyssey\" had seen others like them,\nand had them in her mind when describing the binding of Ulysses. I have\ntherefore with some diffidence ventured to depart from the received\ntranslation of [Greek] (cf. Alcaeus frag. 18, where, however, it is\nvery hard to say what [Greek] means). In Sophocles' Lexicon I find a\nreference to Chrysostom (l, 242, A. Ed. Benedictine Paris 1834-1839)\nfor the word [Greek], which is probably the same as [Greek], but I have\nlooked for the passage in vain.\n\n{100} The writer is at fault here and tries to put it off on Circe. When\nUlysses comes to take the route prescribed by Circe, he ought to pass\neither the Wanderers or some other difficulty of which we are not told,\nbut he does not do so. The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and\nCharybdis, and the alternative between them and something untold\nmerges into the alternative whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or\nCharybdis. Yet from line 260, it seems we are to consider the Wanderers\nas having been passed by Ulysses; this appears even more plainly from\nxxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions the Wandering rocks as\nhaving been between the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis. The writer,\nhowever, is evidently unaware that she does not quite understand her own\nstory; her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that though Trapanese\nsailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other localities\nreally were, no one in those days more than in our own could localise\nthe Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann has argued, were derived not\nfrom any particular spot, but from sailors' tales about the difficulties\nof navigating the group of the Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on\n\"Od.\" x. 3). Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she\nwould not forgo them. The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on\nScylla suggests allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is\non the Italian side, and therefore may be said to look West. It is about\n8 miles thence to the Sicilian coast, so Ulysses may be perfectly well\ntold that after passing Scylla he will come to the Thrinacian island or\nSicily. Charybdis is transposed to a site some few miles to the north of\nits actual position.\n\n{101} I suppose this line to have been intercalated by the author when\nlines 426-446 were added.\n\n{102} For the reasons which enable us to identify the island of the two\nSirens with the Lipari island now Salinas--the ancient Didyme, or \"twin\"\nisland--see The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 195, 196. The two\nSirens doubtless were, as their name suggests, the whistling gusts, or\navalanches of air that at times descend without a moment's warning from\nthe two lofty mountains of Salinas--as also from all high points in the\nneighbourhood.\n\n{103} See Admiral Smyth on the currents in the Straits of Messina,\nquoted in \"The Authoress of the Odyssey,\" p. 197.\n\n{104} In the islands of Favognana and Marettimo off Trapani I have seen\nmen fish exactly as here described. They chew bread into a paste and\nthrow it into the sea to attract the fish, which they then spear. No\nline is used.\n\n{105} The writer evidently regards Ulysses as on a coast that looked\nEast at no great distance south of the Straits of Messina somewhere,\nsay, near Tauromenium, now Taormina.\n\n{106} Surely there must be a line missing here to tell us that the keel\nand mast were carried down into Charybdis. Besides, the aorist [Greek]\nin its present surrounding is perplexing. I have translated it as though\nit were an imperfect; I see Messrs. Butcher and Lang translate it as\na pluperfect, but surely Charybdis was in the act of sucking down the\nwater when Ulysses arrived.\n\n{107} I suppose the passage within brackets to have been an afterthought\nbut to have been written by the same hand as the rest of the poem. I\nsuppose xii. 103 to have been also added by the writer when she decided\non sending Ulysses back to Charybdis. The simile suggests the hand of\nthe wife or daughter of a magistrate who had often seen her father come\nin cross and tired.\n\n{108} Gr. [Greek]. This puts coined money out of the question, but\nnevertheless implies that the gold had been worked into ornaments of\nsome kind.\n\n{109} I suppose Teiresias' prophecy of bk. xi. 114-120 had made no\nimpression on Ulysses. More probably the prophecy was an afterthought,\nintercalated, as I have already said, by the authoress when she changed\nher scheme.\n\n{110} A male writer would have made Ulysses say, not \"may you give\nsatisfaction to your wives,\" but \"may your wives give satisfaction to\nyou.\"\n\n{111} See note {64}.\n\n{112} The land was in reality the shallow inlet, now the salt works of\nS. Cusumano--the neighbourhood of Trapani and Mt. Eryx being made to do\ndouble duty, both as Scheria and Ithaca. Hence the necessity for making\nUlysses set out after dark, fall instantly into a profound sleep, and\nwake up on a morning so foggy that he could not see anything till the\ninterviews between Neptune and Jove and between Ulysses and Minerva\nshould have given the audience time to accept the situation. See\nillustrations and map near the end of bks. v. and vi. respectively.\n\n{113} This cave, which is identifiable with singular completeness, is\nnow called the \"grotta del toro,\" probably a corruption of \"tesoro,\" for\nit is held to contain a treasure. See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp.\n167-170.\n\n{114} Probably they would.\n\n{115} Then it had a shallow shelving bottom.\n\n{116} Doubtless the road would pass the harbour in Odyssean times as it\npasses the salt works now; indeed, if there is to be a road at all there\nis no other level ground which it could take. See map above referred to.\n\n{117} The rock at the end of the Northern harbour of Trapani, to which\nI suppose the writer of the \"Odyssey\" to be here referring, still bears\nthe name Malconsiglio--\"the rock of evil counsel.\" There is a legend\nthat it was a ship of Turkish pirates who were intending to attack\nTrapani, but the \"Madonna di Trapani\" crushed them under this rock just\nas they were coming into port. My friend Cavaliere Giannitrapani of\nTrapani told me that his father used to tell him when he was a boy that\nif he would drop exactly three drops of oil on to the water near the\nrock, he would see the ship still at the bottom. The legend is evidently\na Christianised version of the Odyssean story, while the name supplies\nthe additional detail that the disaster happened in consequence of an\nevil counsel.\n\n{118} It would seem then that the ship had got all the way back from\nIthaca in about a quarter of an hour.\n\n{119} And may we not add \"and also to prevent his recognising that he\nwas only in the place where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier.\"\n\n{120} All this is to excuse the entire absence of Minerva from books\nix.-xii., which I suppose had been written already, before the authoress\nhad determined on making Minerva so prominent a character.\n\n{121} We have met with this somewhat lame attempt to cover the writer's\nchange of scheme at the end of bk. vi.\n\n{122} I take the following from The Authoress of the Odyssey, p. 167.\n\"It is clear from the text that there were two [caves] not one, but some\none has enclosed in brackets the two lines in which the second cave is\nmentioned, I presume because he found himself puzzled by having a second\ncave sprung upon him when up to this point he had only been told of one.\n\n\"I venture to think that if he had known the ground he would not have\nbeen puzzled, for there are two caves, distant about 80 or 100 yards\nfrom one another.\" The cave in which Ulysses hid his treasure is, as I\nhave already said, identifiable with singular completeness. The other\ncave presents no special features, neither in the poem nor in nature.\n\n{123} There is no attempt to disguise the fact that Penelope had long\ngiven encouragement to the suitors. The only defence set up is that she\ndid not really mean to encourage them. Would it not have been wiser to\nhave tried a little discouragement?\n\n{124} See map near the end of bk. vi. Ruccazzu dei corvi of course means\n\"the rock of the ravens.\" Both name and ravens still exist.\n\n{125} See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 140, 141. The real reason\nfor sending Telemachus to Pylos and Lacedaemon was that the authoress\nmight get Helen of Troy into her poem. He was sent at the only point in\nthe story at which he could be sent, so he must have gone then or not at\nall.\n\n{126} The site I assign to Eumaeus's hut, close to the Ruccazzu dei\nCorvi, is about 2,000 feet above the sea, and commands an extensive\nview.\n\n{127} Sandals such as Eumaeus was making are still worn in the Abruzzi\nand elsewhere. An oblong piece of leather forms the sole: holes are cut\nat the four corners, and through these holes leathern straps are passed,\nwhich are bound round the foot and cross-gartered up the calf.\n\n{128} See note {75}\n\n{129} Telemachus like many another good young man seems to expect every\none to fetch and carry for him.\n\n{130} \"Il.\" vi. 288. The store room was fragrant because it was made of\ncedar wood. See \"Il.\" xxiv. 192.\n\n{131} cf. \"Il.\" vi. 289 and 293-296. The dress was kept at the bottom\nof the chest as one that would only be wanted on the greatest occasions;\nbut surely the marriage of Hermione and of Megapenthes (bk, iv. ad\ninit.) might have induced Helen to wear it on the preceding evening,\nin which case it could hardly have got back. We find no hint here of\nMegapenthes' recent marriage.\n\n{132} See note {83}.\n\n{133} cf. \"Od.\" xi. 196, etc.\n\n{134} The names Syra and Ortygia, on which island a great part of the\nDoric Syracuse was originally built, suggest that even in Odyssean times\nthere was a prehistoric Syracuse, the existence of which was known to\nthe writer of the poem.\n\n{135} Literally \"where are the turnings of the sun.\" Assuming, as we may\nsafely do, that the Syra and Ortygia of the \"Odyssey\" refer to Syracuse,\nit is the fact that not far to the South of these places the land turns\nsharply round, so that mariners following the coast would find the\nsun upon the other side of their ship to that on which they'd had it\nhitherto.\n\nMr. A. S. Griffith has kindly called my attention to Herod iv. 42,\nwhere, speaking of the circumnavigation of Africa by Phoenician mariners\nunder Necos, he writes:\n\n\"On their return they declared--I for my part do not believe them, but\nperhaps others may--that in sailing round Libya [i.e. Africa] they had\nthe sun upon their right hand. In this way was the extent of Libya first\ndiscovered.\n\n\"I take it that Eumaeus was made to have come from Syracuse because\nthe writer thought she rather ought to have made something happen at\nSyracuse during her account of the voyages of Ulysses. She could\nnot, however, break his long drift from Charybdis to the island of\nPantellaria; she therefore resolved to make it up to Syracuse in another\nway.\"\n\n{135} Modern excavations establish the existence of two and only two\npre-Dorian communities at Syracuse; they were, so Dr. Orsi informed me,\nat Plemmirio and Cozzo Pantano. See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp.\n211-213.\n\n{136} This harbour is again evidently the harbour in which Ulysses had\nlanded, i.e. the harbour that is now the salt works of S. Cusumano.\n\n{137} This never can have been anything but very niggardly pay for some\neight or nine days' service. I suppose the crew were to consider the\npleasure of having had a trip to Pylos as a set off. There is no trace\nof the dinner as having been actually given, either on the following or\nany other morning.\n\n{138} No hawk can tear its prey while it is on the wing.\n\n{139} The text is here apparently corrupt, and will not make sense as it\nstands. I follow Messrs. Butcher and Lang in omitting line 101.\n\n{140} i.e. to be milked, as in South Italian and Sicilian towns at the\npresent day.\n\n{141} The butchering and making ready the carcases took place partly in\nthe outer yard and partly in the open part of the inner court.\n\n{142} These words cannot mean that it would be afternoon soon after they\nwere spoken. Ulysses and Eumaeus reached the town which was \"some way\noff\" (xvii. 25) in time for the suitor's early meal (xvii. 170 and 176)\nsay at ten or eleven o' clock. The context of the rest of the book shows\nthis. Eumaeus and Ulysses, therefore, cannot have started later than\neight or nine, and Eumaeus's words must be taken as an exaggeration for\nthe purpose of making Ulysses bestir himself.\n\n{143} I imagine the fountain to have been somewhere about where the\nchurch of the Madonna di Trapani now stands, and to have been fed with\nwater from what is now called the Fontana Diffali on Mt. Eryx.\n\n{144} From this and other passages in the \"Odyssey\" it appears that\nwe are in an age anterior to the use of coined money--an age when\ncauldrons, tripods, swords, cattle, chattels of all kinds, measures\nof corn, wine, or oil, etc. etc., not to say pieces of gold, silver,\nbronze, or even iron, wrought more or less, but unstamped, were the\nnearest approach to a currency that had as yet been reached.\n\n{145} Gr. is [Greek]\n\n{146} I correct these proofs abroad and am not within reach of Hesiod,\nbut surely this passage suggests acquaintance with the Works and Ways,\nthough it by no means compels it.\n\n{147} It would seem as though Eurynome and Euryclea were the same\nperson. See note {156}\n\n{148} It is plain, therefore, that Iris was commonly accepted as the\nmessenger of the gods, though our authoress will never permit her to\nfetch or carry for any one.\n\n{149} i.e. the doorway leading from the inner to the outer court.\n\n{150} Surely in this scene, again, Eurynome is in reality Euryclea. See\nnote {156}\n\n{151} These, I imagine, must have been in the open part of the inner\ncourtyard, where the maids also stood, and threw the light of their\ntorches into the covered cloister that ran all round it. The smoke would\notherwise have been intolerable.\n\n{152} Translation very uncertain; vide Liddell and Scott, under [Greek]\n\n{153} See photo on opposite page.\n\n{154} cf. \"Il.\" ii. 184, and 217, 218. An additional and well-marked\nfeature being wanted to convince Penelope, the writer has taken the\nhunched shoulders of Thersites (who is mentioned immediately after\nEurybates in the \"Iliad\") and put them on to Eurybates' back.\n\n{155} This is how geese are now fed in Sicily, at any rate in summer,\nwhen the grass is all burnt up. I have never seen them grazing.\n\n{156} Lower down (line 143) Euryclea says it was herself that had thrown\nthe cloak over Ulysses--for the plural should not be taken as implying\nmore than one person. The writer is evidently still fluctuating between\nEuryclea and Eurynome as the name for the old nurse. She probably\noriginally meant to call her Euryclea, but finding it not immediately\neasy to make Euryclea scan in xvii. 495, she hastily called her\nEurynome, intending either to alter this name later or to change the\nearlier Euryclea's into Eurynome. She then drifted in to Eurynome\nas convenience further directed, still nevertheless hankering after\nEuryclea, till at last she found that the path of least resistance\nwould lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Euryclea two persons.\nTherefore in xxiii. 289-292 both Eurynome and \"the nurse\" (who can be\nnone other than Euryclea) come on together. I do not say that this is\nfeminine, but it is not unfeminine.\n\n{157} See note {156}\n\n{158} This, I take it, was immediately in front of the main entrance of\nthe inner courtyard into the body of the house.\n\n{159} This is the only allusion to Sardinia in either \"Iliad\" or\n\"Odyssey.\"\n\n{160} The normal translation of the Greek word would be \"holding back,\"\n\"curbing,\" \"restraining,\" but I cannot think that the writer meant\nthis--she must have been using the word in its other sense of \"having,\"\n\"holding,\" \"keeping,\" \"maintaining.\"\n\n{161} I have vainly tried to realise the construction of the fastening\nhere described.\n\n{162} See plan of Ulysses' house in the appendix. It is evident that the\nopen part of the court had no flooring but the natural soil.\n\n{163} See plan of Ulysses' house, and note {175}.\n\n{164} i.e. the door that led into the body of the house.\n\n{165} This was, no doubt, the little table that was set for Ulysses,\n\"Od.\" xx. 259.\n\nSurely the difficulty of this passage has been overrated. I suppose\nthe iron part of the axe to have been wedged into the handle, or bound\nsecurely to it--the handle being half buried in the ground. The axe\nwould be placed edgeways towards the archer, and he would have to shoot\nhis arrow through the hole into which the handle was fitted when the axe\nwas in use. Twelve axes were placed in a row all at the same height,\nall exactly in front of one another, all edgeways to Ulysses whose arrow\npassed through all the holes from the first onward. I cannot see how the\nGreek can bear any other interpretation, the words being, [Greek]\n\n\"He did not miss a single hole from the first onwards.\" [Greek]\naccording to Liddell and Scott being \"the hole for the handle of an\naxe, etc.,\" while [Greek] (\"Od.\" v. 236) is, according to the same\nauthorities, the handle itself. The feat is absurdly impossible, but our\nauthoress sometimes has a soul above impossibilities.\n\n{166} The reader will note how the spoiling of good food distresses the\nwriter even in such a supreme moment as this.\n\n{167} Here we have it again. Waste of substance comes first.\n\n{168} cf. \"Il.\" iii. 337 and three other places. It is strange that\nthe author of the \"Iliad\" should find a little horse-hair so alarming.\nPossibly enough she was merely borrowing a common form line from some\nearlier poet--or poetess--for this is a woman's line rather than a\nman's.\n\n{169} Or perhaps simply \"window.\" See plan in the appendix.\n\n{170} i.e. the pavement on which Ulysses was standing.\n\n{171} The interpretation of lines 126-143 is most dubious, and at best\nwe are in a region of melodrama: cf., however, i.425, etc. from which it\nappears that there was a tower in the outer court, and that Telemachus\nused to sleep in it. The [Greek] I take to be a door, or trap door,\nleading on to the roof above Telemachus's bed room, which we are told\nwas in a place that could be seen from all round--or it might be simply\na window in Telemachus's room looking out into the street. From the\ntop of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going on, but\npeople could not get in by the [Greek]: they would have to come in by\nthe main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth of the narrow\npassage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends) commanded\nthe only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be\nnothing gained by raising an alarm. As for the [Greek] of line 143,\nno commentator ancient or modern has been able to say what was\nintended--but whatever they were, Melanthius could never carry twelve\nshields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears. Moreover, where he could\ngo the others could go also. If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius\ninto the house they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear, in which\ncase, unless Minerva had intervened promptly, the \"Odyssey\" would have\nhad a different ending. But throughout the scene we are in a region of\nextravagance rather than of true fiction--it cannot be taken seriously\nby any but the very serious, until we come to the episode of Phemius and\nMedon, where the writer begins to be at home again.\n\n{172} I presume it was intended that there should be a hook driven into\nthe bearing-post.\n\n{173} What for?\n\n{174} Gr: [Greek]. This is not [Greek].\n\n{175} From lines 333 and 341 of this book, and lines 145 and 146 of bk.\nxxi we can locate the approach to the [Greek] with some certainty.\n\n{176} But in xix. 500-502 Ulysses scolded Euryclea for offering\ninformation on this very point, and declared himself quite able to\nsettle it for himself.\n\n{177} There were a hundred and eight Suitors.\n\n{178} Lord Grimthorpe, whose understanding does not lend itself to easy\nimposition, has been good enough to write to me about my conviction that\nthe \"Odyssey\" was written by a woman, and to send me remarks upon the\ngross absurdity of the incident here recorded. It is plain that all\nthe authoress cared about was that the women should be hanged: as for\nattempting to realise, or to make her readers realise, how the hanging\nwas done, this was of no consequence. The reader must take her word for\nit and ask no questions. Lord Grimthorpe wrote:\n\n\"I had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa's hanging of the\nmaids (not 'maidens,' of whom Froude wrote so well in his 'Science of\nHistory') before I forget it all. Luckily for me Liddell & Scott have\nspecially translated most of the doubtful words, referring to this very\nplace.\n\n\"A ship's cable. I don't know how big a ship she meant, but it must have\nbeen a very small one indeed if its 'cable' could be used to tie tightly\nround a woman's neck, and still more round a dozen of them 'in a row,'\nbesides being strong enough to hold them and pull them all up.\n\n\"A dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than\na dozen strong heavy men even over the best pulley hung to the roof\nover them; and the idea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round a\npillar [Greek] is absurdly impossible; and how a dozen of them could be\nhung dangling round one post is a problem which a senior wrangler would\nbe puzzled to answer... She had better have let Telemachus use his sword\nas he had intended till she changed his mind for him.\"\n\n{179} Then they had all been in Ulysses' service over twenty years;\nperhaps the twelve guilty ones had been engaged more recently.\n\n{180} Translation very doubtful--cf. \"It.\" xxiv. 598.\n\n{181} But why could she not at once ask to see the scar, of which\nEuryclea had told her, or why could not Ulysses have shown it to her?\n\n{182} The people of Ithaca seem to have been as fond of carping as the\nPhaeacians were in vi. 273, etc.\n\n{183} See note {156}. Ulysses's bed room does not appear to have been\nupstairs, nor yet quite within the house. Is it possible that it was\n\"the domed room\" round the outside of which the erring maids were, for\naught we have heard to the contrary, still hanging?\n\n{184} Ulysses bedroom in the mind of the writer is here too apparently\ndown stairs.\n\n{185} Penelope having been now sufficiently whitewashed, disappears from\nthe poem.\n\n{186} So practised a washerwoman as our authoress doubtless knew that by\nthis time the web must have become such a wreck that it would have gone\nto pieces in the wash.\n\nA lady points out to me, just as these sheets are leaving my hands, that\nno really good needlewoman--no one, indeed, whose work or character was\nworth consideration--could have endured, no matter for what reason, the\nunpicking of her day's work, day after day for between three and four\nyears.\n\n{187} We must suppose Dolius not yet to know that his son Melanthius\nhad been tortured, mutilated, and left to die by Ulysses' orders on the\npreceding day, and that his daughter Melantho had been hanged. Dolius\nwas probably exceptionally simple-minded, and his name was ironical.\nSo on Mt. Eryx I was shown a man who was always called Sonza Malizia or\n\"Guileless\"--he being held exceptionally cunning.", "title": "The Odyssey"}
